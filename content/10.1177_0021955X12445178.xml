<abstract>
<p>Polyols were synthesized from castor oil with diethanolamine and triethanolamine at the molar ratios from 1:1 M to 1:3 M with the total hydroxyl value and amino value in the range from 291 to 512 mg KOH/g. Bio-based rigid polyurethane foams with good mechanical properties, a high closed-cell content and the renewable content in the range from 25.0 to 35.6 wt% were obtained. Polyurethane coatings’ tensile strength and modulus of elasticity are higher for the samples obtained from castor oil/diethanolamine polyols, but the highest elongation at break is for the polyurethane from castor oil/triethanolamine polyols. In the temperature range from 150°C to 350°C, the polyurethanes from castor oil/triethanolamine have lower weight losses than the polyurethane from castor oil/diethanolamine polyols. The presence of polyethylene glycol enhances the degradability of the bio-based polyurethane foams in the presence of fungi.</p>

<p>Since the 1950s, oleochemistry has grown to a major research and technology area in several institutions and industries. A large variety of products based on fats and oils have been developed since then for different uses, such as specialities for polymer applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445178">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12445178">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many investigations are devoted to the synthesis of polyols from different vegetable oils such as soybean oil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12445178">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12445178">6</xref></sup> rapeseed oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12445178">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445178">8</xref></sup> and palm oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12445178">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12445178">10</xref></sup> For obtaining polyurethane (PU), vegetable oils have to be functionalized, which is done through double bond reactions such as epoxidation, hydroformylation and methathesis, or through ester bond reactions (transesterification, transamidation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445178">1</xref></sup> The use of vegetable oil polyols in PU foam compositions makes it possible to improve the properties of some prepared foams, especially their hydrophobicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445178">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445178">8</xref></sup> PUs from vegetable oil polyols have been found to be characterized by higher thermal stability than those prepared from propylene oxide polyols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12445178">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Castor oil (CO) is a low cost renewable raw material and is attracting research effort because of its use in coatings, elastomers, sealants, and PU foams. The oil is obtained from extracting or expressing the seed of a plant which has the botanical name <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> of the family Eurphorbiacae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X12445178">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12445178">16</xref></sup> Leitheiser and Ehrich have reported that CO can be used to replace the petroleum-based polyol to make PU foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12445178">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12445178">18</xref></sup> Baser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12445178">19</xref></sup> have reported the obtaining of rigid PU foams from a mixture of CO and glycerol and found that glycerol cross-linking gives the foam sufficient rigidity and reduces shrinking.</p>
<p>CO is already used as a raw material for obtaining PU materials conforming to the green chemistry requirements. BASF manufactures the Lupranol Balance polyol from CO, which is used for flexible foam production. Lupranol Balance contains up to 24 wt% of CO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12445178">20</xref></sup> CO polyols are used for producing volatile organic compounds free PU coatings, which are characterized by good mechanical properties and are very hydrophobic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X12445178">21</xref></sup> CO based spray foam insulation with a high content of renewable raw materials is developed. It is an environmentally preferable product and is 100% water blown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X12445178">22</xref></sup> To ensure wider possibilities of obtaining PU materials from renewable raw material resources, studies on the synthesis of new CO polyols as well as the properties of the PU foams and coatings obtained from these polyols are necessary.</p>
<p>In the present study, results on the synthesis of polyols by way of the amidization of CO with DEA, and transesterification with TEA were generalized. Studies on the mechanical and thermal properties, and biodegradation of the obtained bio-based PU coatings and PU foams were carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021955X12445178"><title>Experimental</title>
<sec id="sec3-0021955X12445178" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Castor oil, lactic acid 85%, ε-caprolactone, glycerol, PEG 300 and tin octoate (catalyst) were supplied from Aldrich. DEA were obtained from Huntsman, TEA was supplied by BASF. Voratec SD 100 (a polymeric MDI with 2.7 NCO functionality and 31.2 wt% of NCO) were obtained from Dow Chemical and Lupranol 3422 (polyether polyol; <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic> = 5, OHV = 490 mg KOH/g) from Elastogran. Silicone surfactant L 6912, used as a surfactant, pentamethyldiethylenetriamine and bis(2-dimethlaminoethyl)ether, used as a catalyst, were from Niax. Cyclopentane, used as a blowing agent, was from Solway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021955X12445178"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Polyols of CO were prepared by amidization with DEA or transesterification with TEA; catalyst zinc acetate (0.15 wt%) was added with stirring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445178">8</xref></sup> The CO amidization reaction was carried out at 120–140°C, and transesterification at 140–170°C. Polycaprolactone (PCL) triols were synthesized by adding ε-caprolactone to glycerol at 120°C for 20 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12445178">23</xref></sup> Lactide triol was synthesized by esterifying lactic acid in the presence of DEA at 130°C. Synthesis time was 30 h.</p>
<p>The PU films from CO polyols were synthesized in a 50% anhydrous toluene solution at a temperature of 20–25°C. The functional group ratio NCO:OH was 1.1. As the conversion of NCO groups reached 60–70%, the solution was poured on a fluoroplastic support and left at a temperature of 70°C for 2 h for conditioning. The obtained films had a thickness of 150–250 µm.</p>
<p>Rigid PU foams were prepared applying a hand mixing method. The polyol, catalyst package, surfactant and blowing agent were added by weighing into a 500-mL plastic cup and mixed at 2880 rpm for 10–15 s. Then polymeric MDI was added, and stirring was continued for 10–15 s. For measuring foaming reactivity, PU foam core density, and physical and mechanical properties, samples were foamed into an open box mold with sizes of 200 × 250 mm<sup>2</sup>, height 80 mm.</p>
<p>Biodegradable rigid PU foams were prepared from CO/DEA polyol, PCL triol, lactidtriol and PEG 300, and additives; polymeric MDI was also added. The procedure for producing biodegradable rigid PU foams was the same as described for rigid PU foams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021955X12445178"><title>Measurements</title>
<p>Calorimetric measurements were made on a differential scanning calorimeter Mettler Toledo 823<sup>e</sup> at the heating rate 10°C/min. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with the help of the Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851<sup>e</sup> in an inert atmosphere, at the heating rate 10°C/min in the temperature range 20–1000°C. The weight of the sample was in range from 8 to 10 mg. Fourier transform infrared with attenuated reflectance (FTIR-ATR) of PU films was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer ‘Spectrum One FTIR Spectrometer’, resolution 4 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The polyol viscosity measurements were made at 25°C with a Falling Ball Viscometer KF 100 (Rheo Tec Messtechnik GmbH).</p>
<p>The stress–strain characteristics of PU films were determined by tensile testing 5 to 7 specimens on a Zwick/Roell testing device at the deformation rate 50 mm/min. Density of the foams and closed-cell content were measured according to the standards: DIN 53420 and ISO 4590, respectively. Mechanical testing of PU foams was performed on a testing machine Zwick/Roell 500 N. As a rule, 6 samples on each experimental point were tested. In the majority of cases, the coefficient of variation of foams’ characteristics was within 6–15%.</p>
<p>The biodegradability of PU foams was tested by two methods: biodegradation after exposure to fungi on an agar plate according to a modification of ISO 846,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X12445178">24</xref></sup> and capability to serve as a sole carbon source for several fungi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12445178">25</xref></sup> In both tests, the following fungi were used: <italic>Coniophora puteana</italic> CECT 20145, <italic>Gloeophyllum trabeum</italic> CECT 20146, <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> CECT 2700, <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> CECT 2949, <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> CECT 2779, <italic>Phanerochaete flavido-alba</italic> FPL 106507 and <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> CECT 2414. The fungi used in the studies of biodegradation were those indicated in the international standard ISO 846 and other selected because of their biodegradative capabilities. The main goal was to determine whether the fungi that can be found in most environments are able to degrade the materials either by altering their properties or by using them as a sole carbon source.</p>
<p>Each sample was soaked in a suspension of a fungus and placed into Petri-dishes containing malt extract agar (2% malt extract, 2% dextrose, 2% agar). Colonization and weight loss (%) for three replicates of the samples exposed to each fungus during 8 weeks at 30°C were tested.</p>
<p>The analysis of PU foams as a sole carbon source for fungal growth was performed by using agar plate media composed of a mineral salt solution, with 0.5% (w/v) of powdered PU foams added. PU foams powder (particle size &lt;1 mm) was obtained by using a MF 10 basic grinder (IKA Werke). One plug (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) of a 7-day-old culture of each fungus on potato dextrose agar was inoculated on plates. Cultures were incubated for 3 weeks at 30°C and fungal growth was evaluated.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0021955X12445178"><title>Castor oil polyol synthesis and properties</title>
<p>Castor oil is triacylglycerol, in which approximately 90% of fatty acid chains are ricinoleic acid. CO has the following structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12445178">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0021955X12445178" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Idealized structure of castor oil.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12445178-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid, is unusual in that it has a hydroxyl functional group on the 12th carbon. Idealized CO average <italic>M<sub>n</sub></italic> is 930 g/mol and OHV is 165 mg KOH/g.</p>
<p>In comparison with other vegetable oils, CO has a higher solubility parameter (<italic>δ</italic>). Thus, soybean oil <italic>δ</italic>, which is determined by the inverse gas chromatography method, is 8.37 cal<sup>1/2</sup>/cm<sup>3/2</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X12445178">26</xref></sup> but CO <italic>δ</italic> = 9.00 cal<sup>1/2</sup>/cm<sup>3/2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X12445178">27</xref></sup> Hence, CO, in comparison with other vegetable oils, has a higher <italic>δ</italic>, and this facilitates its transesterification with glycerol or TEA, or also the amidization with DEA, because the synthesis process proceeds in a homogeneous state already from the outset.</p>
<p>Because CO has low OHV, and its structure has low-activity secondary OH-groups, it is not especially suitable for obtaining rigid PU foams. One of the solutions how to expand the applicability of CO for obtaining rigid PU foams is to chemically introduce primary hydroxyl groups onto CO triacylglycerols. That can be done by amidization of CO with DEA, or also by the transesterification of CO with TEA. The results of the systematic studies on the obtaining and properties of PU coatings or PU foams from such polyols are not described.</p>
<p>CO polyols with DEA and TEA were synthesized with increasing molar ratio from 1 : 1 M to 1 : 3 M.</p>
<p>The CO amidization kinetics studies have shown that, in parallel to amidization, also the transesterification process occurs.</p>
<p>CO amidization at the initial stage of the reaction occurs much slower than in the presence of a catalyst – zinc acetate, although the rates of the amidization process at the final stage of the reaction are of equal value in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12445178">Figure 2</xref>). At the end of the CO amidization reaction, the NH groups’ conversion degree in the cases of both catalytic and non-catalytic reactions reaches 86 wt%, while 14 wt% of the product consists of fatty acid amino esters. These results indicate that, in the synthesized CO polyol, there are both ricinoleic acid diethanolamides and ricinoleic acid amino esters. According to Kroll et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021955X12445178">28</xref></sup> fatty acid diethanolamides and amino esters are in equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12445178">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>The data summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12445178">Table 1</xref> show that, with increasing molar ratio CO/DEA and CO/TEA, the OHV + NHV of the synthesized polyols increase. The synthesized polyols have relatively low viscosity, although it is the highest for CO DEA polyols. With increasing molar excess of DEA over CO from 1 to 3, the content of ricinoleic acid diethanolamide and glycerol grows in the obtained polyol. Similarly, polyol structure changes occur also when transesterifying CO with TEA. CO/TEA esters are catalytically active polyols. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12445178">Table 1</xref>, the synthesized polyols have high content of renewable raw materials.</p>
<p>The course of the vegetable oil amidization and transesterification processes can be judged also from calorimetric measurements. DSC experiments were carried out with CO and DEA, as well as CO and TEA blends at their molar ratio 1:3 M at 140°C. It is calculated from DSC curves that the process of CO amidization with DEA at 140°C occurs with the enthalpy 29.74 cal/g, but the CO transesterification with TEA occurs at the enthalpy 28.60 cal/g. These DSC data indirectly indicate that not only the amidization process, but also the transesterification one can occur as CO reacts with DEA.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0021955X12445178"><title>Polyurethane coatings</title>
<p>In contrast to CO, the synthesized castor oil polyols have higher OHV and high content of primary OH groups (50–66% from total OH group content), and this circumstance makes them an attractive raw material for obtaining both rigid PU foams and PU coats. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12445178">Table 2</xref> summarizes the data on the mechanical properties of the PU, obtained from the synthesized CO polyols.

<p>This is explained by the fact that the PUs from the CO/DEA polyols in the main chain’s structure has tertamide groups, which are characterized by high cohesion energy. In turn, the PUs from CO/TEA esters have higher elongation at break (<italic>ε</italic>). The mechanical properties and glass transition temperature of the PU obtained from CO and polymeric MDI are close to those reported by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445178">1</xref></sup> The obtained results make it possible to purposefully form formulations from CO/DEA and CO/TEA type polyols for obtaining rigid PU foams or coats.</p>
<p>The structure of the PU obtained from CO/DEA 1 : 3 M has mainly ricinoleic acid diethanolamide groups. In turn, the structure of the PU from CO/TEA 1 : 3 M has mainly ricinoleic acid amino ester groups.</p>
<p>The structure of the obtained PUs is determined from FTIR-ATR spectroscopy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X12445178">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>The PU synthesized from CO polyols can be characterized as polymers with a cross-linking structure, which contains the short side chains –(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.

<p>Decomposition of PU films obtained from different CO polyols with polymeric MDI was tested. Thermal stability, as measured by TGA in nitrogen, was the highest in the PU from CO/TEA polyols and lowest in that from CO/DEA polyols, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12445178">Figure 6</xref>.

<p>The thermal stability of PU at the initial stage of decomposition was estimated using a temperature at which polymers lose 5 wt%. The results as follows: PU from CO/DEA 1:1 – 226°C, CO/DEA 1:2 −196°C, CO/DEA 1:3 −184°C, CO/TEA 1:1 −280°C, CO/TEA 1:2 −264°C, CO/TEA1:3 – 233°C. With increasing molar excess of DEA or TEA over CO from 1 to 3 M, the thermal stability of the PU obtained from CO/DEA and CO/TEA polyols decreases in temperature range 150–350°C. Rapid decomposition of PU takes place till temperature reaches 500°C, at this temperature weight residue is 10 to 27 wt%.</p>

<p>To assess the possibilities of obtaining biodegradable PU foams, PU foam formulations were formed, which incorporated a CO/DEA polyol, biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) triols, lactide triol and PEG 300. For producing PU foams, cyclopentane and water were used. The composition of these formulations is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021955X12445178">Table 5</xref>.</p>
<p>The polymeric matrix of the obtained PU foams is characterized by the molecular weight per branching unit (<italic>M<sub>c</sub></italic>), and the bio-content and biodegradable unit content. PU foams’ core density was in a range of 30–39 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, but the closed-cell content was from 75% to 90%.</p>
<p>The weight loss of the PU foams after exposure to seven selected fungi is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X12445178">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0021955X12445178" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Weight loss (%) for tested PU foams after 8 weeks of exposure to <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> (Af), <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (An), <italic>Coniophora puteana</italic> (Cp), <italic>Gloeophyllum trabeum</italic> (Gt), <italic>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</italic> (Pch), <italic>Phanerochaete flavido-alba</italic> (Pfa) and <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> (Tr). PU: polyurethane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12445178-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The composition of the PU foams had a dramatic effect on the in vitro biodegradation rate. The material prepared with the highest CO content without PEG 300 (BIO-15) exhibited low (e.g.&lt;2%) degradation by all tested fungi. However, in comparison, the material prepared with a high CO content (80%), but with PEG 300 (BIO-11) added, showed enhanced biodegradation levels.</p>
<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12445178">Figure 6</xref>, the materials showing the highest biodegradation rates were BIO-8 and BIO-13, both containing similar amounts of CO and polymeric MDI but lower ones than the other material tested. Increased amounts of CO are known to decrease biodegradability because of the hydrophobic nature of the long aliphatic hydrocarbon chains of the fatty acid part of CO.</p>
<p>The colonization rating scheme is based on the visual assessment by ISO 846: (0) non-apparent growth even under the microscope (the material is not a nutritive medium for the microorganism); (1) invisible growth or hardly visible to the naked eye but clearly visible under the microscope (the material contains nutritive substances); (2) slight growth covering less than 25% of the surface (the material is not resistant to fungal attack); (3) growth covering more than 25% of the specimen surface (the material is not resistant to fungal attack).</p>
<p>The materials BIO-8, BIO-11 and BIO-13 were more easily colonized by nearly all fungi than BIO-15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021955X12445178">Table 6</xref>).

<p>The growth of fungi on media with PU foams as the sole source of carbon was performed to determine whether the polymers were completely solubilized by extracellular fungal enzymes. This is usually tested by measuring the radius of a clear halo surrounding the microorganism colony.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12445178">25</xref></sup> This was not possible for the materials tested because they form aggregates in the agar medium rather than turbid agar.</p>
<p>Hence, we only tested the presence or absence of the growth of microorganisms on the mentioned media because it indicates whether the microorganism may use the material as a nutritive source and, consequently, could biodegrade it at high rates. <italic>A. niger</italic> was the only microorganism able to grow from all materials tested. <italic>P. flavido-alba</italic> grew in BIO-8, BIO-11 and BIO-13, but not in BIO-15. None of the other fungi tested were able to use the materials as the sole carbon source. Consequently, the reported microorganisms may serve to test the biodegradability of this type of materials under harsh conditions or to develop a suitable process for the controlled biodegradation process after disposal.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021955X12445178" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Water and cyclopentane blown bio-based rigid PU foams obtained from CO diethanolamide and CO triethanolamine polyols have good compressive and tensile strength properties. PU foams from CO triethanolamine polyols show higher elongation at break than PU obtained from CO diethanolamide polyols. PU foams have high closed-cell content, and the renewable content in the range from 25.0 to 35.6 wt%.</p>
<p>The bio-based PU coatings from CO triethanolamine polyols have higher elongation at break but lower tensile strength and modulus of elasticity than PU coatings from CO diethanolamide polyols. With increasing molar ratio CO/DEA and CO/TEA from 1 to 3, the thermal stability of the PUs obtained from these polyols decreases in the temperature range from 150°C to 350°C. The PUs from CO triethanolamine polyols have lower weight losses than the PUs from CO diethanolamide polyols. PUs from CO diethanolamide polyols have higher glass transition temperature than PUs from CO triethanolamine polyols.</p>
<p>Biodegradation of CO-based PU foams by fungi shows that the degradation of the polymer is different depending mainly on the CO and PEG 300 content. The presence of PEG 300 enhances the degradability of the PU foams in the presence of fungi, while the increased CO content decreases biodegradability. The fungi <italic>A. niger</italic> and <italic>P. flavido-alba</italic> are able to use these materials as the sole carbon source.</p>
