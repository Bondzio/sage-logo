<p>In the United States and abroad, the nonprofit/nongovernmental sector is large and economically important, but at an organizational level, individual nonprofits often struggle to survive. In an effort to build social capital as well as economic viability, nonprofits have routinely sought partnerships with similar organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911423641">Foster &amp; Meinhard, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318911423641">Takahashi and Smutny (2002)</xref> posit that interorganizational collaborations (IOCs) increase cost-effectiveness, enhance the capacity of partnering agencies, and increase the comprehensive nature of services for nonprofits. By definition, IOCs represent the mutual partnering of organizations in more or less formal coalitions or short-term partnerships around specific events or goals or for the purpose of sharing information and networking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318911423641">Wood &amp; Gray, 1991</xref>). In practical terms, IOCs involve partnerships of pairs, small groups of organizations, or large multiorganizational alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318911423641">Keyton, Ford, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911423641">Stohl &amp; Walker, 2002</xref>). IOCs are seen as key subset of interorganizational relationships (IORs) and a major growth area across all organizational sectors.</p>
<p>The growth of interorganizational relationships across all sectors since the 1970s is substantial. A report published in the <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> estimates that IORs increase 25% a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423641">Hughes &amp; Weiss, 2007</xref>). The growth of IORs puts organizations (and especially nonprofit organizations) in a position where they need to partner in order to keep a competitive advantage in the environment. The nonprofit sector has not been immune to this growth and push for IORs. Indeed, the prevalence of nonprofit IOCs is higher than other sectors due to current funding structures of individual nonprofit agencies. Funders have recognized the complexity of issues and over the past decade have encouraged partnerships to better attend to all the nuances of larger societal problems, putting pressure on nonprofits to collaborate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318911423641">Wuichet, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the push toward developing IOCs, IORs can be difficult to manage and have failure rates that have grown from roughly 50% in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423641">Borker, de Man, &amp; Weeda, 2004</xref>) to almost 70% by 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423641">Borker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423641">Hughes &amp; Weiss, 2007</xref>). From academic and practitioner standpoints, while IOCs have largely been considered positive organizational events, these statistics belie some inherent problems present with interorganizational partnering.</p>
<p>Consequently, funder mandates to collaborate have caused autonomy issues with individual nonprofits. Nonprofits have been called to become more market focused in the pursuit of mission goals, yet in this pursuit, some nonprofits have lost individual agency in becoming a part of larger IOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318911423641">Wuichet, 2000</xref>). IOCs are largely decision-making bodies composed of individuals who are representing self-interests or <italic>boundary spanners</italic> representing the interests of certain groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423641">Huxham, 1996</xref>). Boundary spanners are defined as the individuals who enact extensive communication through their individual ties to external organizational members and serve as exchange agents between the organization and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911423641">Wilensky, 1967</xref>). The communicative interactions of these boundary spanners create and shape the collaborative form. Within IOCs, members not only share information and work toward collective goals but also wrangle with issues of control, representation, and membership. Boundary spanners not only represent different nonprofits work toward the collective good of the larger issue but also argue over how decisions are made in the IOC and how representation in the decision-making process should occur. Boundary spanners for different nonprofits must discuss and determine what it means to member with IOCs and the potential loss of organizational autonomy that comes with membership. Researchers have called these individual interactions between IOC members the “black box” of collaborating because little is known about how members communicate with each other to constitute IOC and achieve the larger societal goals of the collaborative while still maintaining an individual organizational identity on an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318911423641">Wood &amp; Gray, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911423641">Williams (2002)</xref> exemplifies this argument with the following observation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It seems that the prevailing [research] discourse at both the theoretical and empirical level is quite often confined to a narrow discussion of the effectiveness and sustainability of new inter-organizational structures and mechanisms . . . This fixation at the organizational and inter-organizational domain levels understates and neglects the pivotal contributions of individual actors in the collaborative process. (p. 106)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ongoing push for collaboration as a main source of funding in the nonprofit sector highlights the importance of the nonprofit boundary spanner. In understanding the role between communication and nonprofit organizing, conceptualizing the individual-level communication of this macro-organizational relationship becomes a fruitful branch of research for problematizing the “third space.”</p>
<p>The individual boundary spanner in IOCs serves as the representative of many constituencies. The individual may represent him- or herself, a specific group, a home organization, and/or another IOC. Boundary spanners play representative roles and perform the communicative functions in IOC meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423641">Heath &amp; Frey, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911423641">Wilensky (1967)</xref> defined boundary spanners as the contact people who mitigate the tension between the demand of flexibility from the environment and the need for stability within the organization. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911423641">Aldrich and Herker (1977)</xref> suggested that boundary spanners are the coping mechanism for the organization as it tries to achieve compromise between organizational policies and environmental constraints. Yet beyond the designation as the representative for a constituency, boundary spanners may represent themselves and other interests. Within IOCs, some boundary spanners may even shroud their organizational affiliation for personal benefits or beliefs.</p>
<p>Boundary spanners cope with many internal and external tensions in IOCs. Internally, IOC members must address the political and power inequities that exist between collaboration members. Not all nonprofit members bring equal resources to the table, thus making the differences among boundary spanners more pronounced when evaluating contributions toward outcomes. This makes the relationship building and identity management between IOC boundary spanners crucial. Externally, ongoing tensions between boundary spanners’ participation in an IOC and their responsibilities to their constituent organization or group make identity management difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911423641">Jones &amp; Bodtker, 1998</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423641">Heath and Frey (2004)</xref> highlight, “Dialectical tensions manifest themselves, for instance, in differences between organizational goals and collaboration processes . . . Individuals have to balance their organization’s motivation for participating with the larger goals of the collaboration group” (p. 203).</p>
<p>Boundary spanning in IOCs challenges the collaborative assumption embedded in definitions of boundary spanning. IOC members may be representing themselves and their own interests at one point and the interests of their organization at another. A member may use his or her relationship with a certain group to become a boundary spanner but, once a member of the IOC, does not function as a liaison between the two organizations. Some boundary spanners may be self-appointed or there may be more than one boundary spanner from a certain group, thus overrepresenting one particular constituency in meetings. As Hardy and associates argue,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Individual identities are created as people talk particularistically about an individual, constituting her or his reputation. Thus, one acquires an identity through inclusion, by being “on” the collaboration team; for being “a member” of the management committee, for being “important,” perhaps by sending out the memos, for deciding where the meetings are held. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911423641">Hardy, Lawrence, &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>, p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To this end, boundary spanners’ memberships and collaborative interactions should no longer be conceptualized as a unidimensional construct between the boundary spanner and the IOC but rather research must take into account the complex and numerous affiliations and consequent identities a person must manage in order to participate in the IOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911423641">Stohl &amp; Walker, 2002</xref>). The construction and maintenance of boundary spanners’ identities is inherently rooted in communicative interactions.</p>
<p>The examination of boundary spanner and the creation of identities within the collaboration is one key direction for understanding how the IOC reaches its outcomes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911423641">Lewis (2006)</xref> states about collaborative research, overall, there are already several lines of investigation that examine the construction of self and other within collaborative communication. In addition, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318911423641">Scott (2007)</xref> emphasizes, “Issues of identity and identification are fundamentally communicative . . . Through communication with others we express our belongingness (or lack thereof) to various collectives, and assess the reputation and image of those collectives, that various identities are made known to us” (p. 124).</p>
<p>Within IOC research, there are several studies that have highlighted the identity issues of collaborative members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911423641">Harter (2004)</xref> identified several key tensions boundary spanners encounter in the push–pull between different organizational memberships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318911423641">Lawrence, Phillips, and Hardy’s (1999)</xref> examination of IOC members emphasized the difficulty in negotiating their role in the collaboration. The authors found that even though a person may successfully negotiate an identity, that identity may not be salient to others in the IOC. In two different investigations of identity, Hardy and colleagues posit that effective collaboration emerges out of the discursive resources that create a collective identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911423641">Hardy, Lawrence, &amp; Grant, 2005</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423641">Bartel (2001)</xref> examined the organizational identification of boundary spanners and its effects on social comparison during community outreach.</p>
<p>These investigations into boundary spanners and identity leave many avenues to be explored. First, there is an assumption the boundary spanner will act ethically when interacting outside of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911423641">Williams, 2002</xref>). Most of the literature still creates a positive valence around the boundary spanner, and less is known about the “dark side” of boundary spanning where spanners do not work toward building trust and respect but rather function as a covert operative sent into a group to achieve personal or organizational gain. Second, the investigation of boundary spanner communication gives further insight into the structures (such as governance, decision making, and membership) that create and maintain these collaborative entities. Third, IOC membership is rarely formalized to the extent that individual representation is scrutinized. There may be numerous boundary spanners from one organization represented at an IOC. Some boundary spanners may be formally designated by the organization to represent the group, whereas others may be informally boundary spanning and representing themselves, minority groups, or differing perspectives from the group. This vacillation of identity and switching between representative organizations creates messy and entangled interaction within the IOC where representation and salient identity may not coincide.</p>
<p>In sum, recent investigations into identity research have emerged and established the importance of investigations into boundary spanner identity management in IOCs. The exploration of boundary spanner identity shifts the focus of organizational identity from a self-in-isolation to a self-in-relation perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423641">Bartel, 2001</xref>). As previously stated, exploring how identity issues affect communication in collaborative interactions is important to our understanding of how boundary spanners create structures used to operate in an IOC. With the ongoing push for nonprofits to collaborate, understanding the role of the boundary spanner becomes an integral part of our larger conceptualization of this “third space.” The changing nature of nonprofit organizing and the reliance on IOCs as a potential source of funding challenges our notion of organizing and organizational autonomy. The individual representatives of the nonprofit organization at IOCs now carry institutional and individual significance that communication is well suited to explore. The negotiation of boundary spanner identity (and the consequent nonprofit identity) within this collective, collaborative organizational space is primarily communicative and an important branch of research in the nonprofit sector.</p>
