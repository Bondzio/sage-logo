<p>What happens if you get what you want? What happens if public policy is successful? This book examines many of the answers to the question posed in the title. It provides a full, scholarly, creative, interdisciplinary, and thoughtful analysis. Dozens of contributors address the surprisingly vast issues that would result from reducing or stopping Americans from smoking. There are chapters on smoking trends—with statistical models based on modest success and on great success at smoking reduction. Then, more chapters examine the economic implications for tobacco farmers, cigarette manufacturers and their workers, tobacco-dependent communities, and even tobacco retailers. Three chapters examine the impacts of “Clean Indoor Air Regulations,” tobacco industry philanthropy, and state and local taxes.</p>
<p>We learn, for example, that as the cigarette manufacturing industry became far more mechanized in the last decades, the number of workers employed in the industry dropped dramatically. Thus, although there would be inevitable job losses with smoking reduction, the number of workers would be far fewer than previously estimated, even if the smoking rates had not declined in the past 40 years. From 1950 to 2005, we have seen a reduction from 640 billion cigarettes each year to 400 billion (p. 55). Somewhat similarly, with the decline of tobacco support funding (via the Master Settlement Agreement with states attorneys general in 1998), more tobacco than ever is coming from overseas. Again, the labor and economic impact on the United States would be moderate compared to earlier years.</p>
<p>We also learn of the dire cries of the hospitality industry about the economic losses if cigarettes were not as welcomed everywhere as they were previously. These negative predictions about economic losses did not materialize; and the statistical models indicate additional reductions in smoking will not have the catastrophic effects promised by current warnings. If people do not spend money on cigarettes they tend to buy food, liquor, clothes, and other items. They still go to hotels and to restaurants. We learn that taxes from cigarette sales are just a small part of local and state tax revenues. Perhaps more important, the reduction in healthcare costs borne by states, and the increase in taxable earnings as people stay longer in the workforce is a significant offset to the losses in local taxes. That is just the first part of the book.</p>
<p>The second part focuses on the health and longevity aspects of tobacco reduction or cessation. The book examines tobacco’s impact on mortality and longevity patterns, on health and healthcare expenditures, and on Social Security. There are still about 46 million smokers in the United States, and on average, smoking takes about ten years of each of their lives away. Those years, of course, do not just disappear; the smokers have “premature deaths” from lung cancer (about 40 percent), from other cancers (about 8 percent), and from cardiovascular disease (about 30 percent). There are other horrors from COPD, pneumonia, fetal death, reduced fertility, and preterm births. Smokers also have more hip fractures, poorer surgical outcomes, and miss more days of work than comparable non-smokers (p. 254). Smoking is directly related to premature deaths, and reduction in premature deaths is directly related to the success of smoking reduction programs. There are hundreds of charts, tables and graphs to illustrate these relationships.</p>
<p>One of the key chapters is on the effects of smoking reduction on the Social Security trust fund. We all know the argument: if people live longer they cost the Social Security trust fund more money. Therefore more people smoking would generate a net gain for the trust fund. As foreshadowed in the earlier discussion of state tax revenues, however, the picture is more complex. Non-smoking workers’ healthcare costs are far lower than smokers, and they stay in the labor force longer and earn more (taxable) income than smokers. Also, they do not leave as many young dependents to be supported by the trust fund. In sum, the authors calculate that the net increase in outlays if smoking reduction is successful will be only 1.58 percent (p. 307).</p>
<p>The third section explores the legal and ethical issues of this topic. These include enhancing compliance with tobacco control policies, stigma, smuggling, and the oft-ignored question of smoking and inequality (the poor, minorities, and the mentally ill smoke more than others). Some of the insights are obvious but nevertheless appreciated. If low-tax states increase their cigarette taxes, interstate smuggling will decrease. If tax stamp methodologies and record keeping are improved, then evasion and other forms of smuggling will be attenuated. Especially welcome are the analyses of smoking on stigma, mental illness, the addicted, and social class. These needed to be nuanced and sensitive, and they are. All of the authors of these chapters are social scientists, physicians, social workers, epidemiologists, and public health experts. The three editors are all social scientists.</p>
<p>A final chapter pulls all of this information together in an excellent summary and discussion. Even the obligatory section on limitations is illuminating, for example, how much of the impact on secondhand smoke they included, and why.</p>
<p>When first scanning the chapter titles, I feared this book would tell me more than I wanted to know about the effects of smoking reduction efforts. But after reading it, and especially after considering the powerful forces selling the hundreds of billions of cigarettes each year, I deeply appreciate this work. It is exactly what is needed to provide the arguments and the evidence to counter those who benefit from tobacco production and sales. The tobacco industry is still stunningly powerful, rich, and influential. It controls congressmen, senators, and state legislators. As I write this today, California announced that the tobacco industry won the campaign to stop Proposition 29 that would have added a dollar-a-pack tax for cancer research. The tobacco industry spent the vast portion of the $47M in advertising to defeat the effort. While this is a book of scholarship and research, many of the issues addressed here were at play in the California battle. The book is the armamentarium for those who want to improve public health via reasoned argument and comprehensive data. If science and evidence still counts for anything in policy debate, this is the needed guide.</p>
