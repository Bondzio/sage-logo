<p>The authors offer a comprehensive and current examination of the concept of human error. The basic premise is that attempts to identify, search for, and eliminate sources of human error have diminishing returns and that more effort should be placed on minimizing the effects of errors. However, this premise must be qualified. Traditional approaches for designing safe systems will have positive effects, but achieving ultrasafe systems (e.g., the National Airspace System) requires resiliency.</p>
<p>The book traces the history of how one conceptualizes human error, beginning with linear latent models, through complex systems, to resilience engineering. Fundamentally, resilient systems are those in which individual workers, teams, and organizations are empowered to recognize, anticipate, and adapt to emerging threats to safety. Next, the authors discuss organizational and individual cognitive challenges that impact the performance of operators working at the “sharp” end. Attention then turns to issues concerning the design of technology and how workers adapt to “clumsy” technology.</p>
<p>Woods et al. conclude by arguing that the study of error reduces to an exercise in social and psychological causal attribution and that safety is improved by pursuing a deeper understanding of why complex systems fail. Examples from medicine, aviation, and the U.S. space shuttle disasters illustrate the shortcomings of traditional approaches for analyzing human error.</p>
<p>The authors raise numerous issues concerning organizational influences on operator performance that affect safety, but these issues are not addressed by theory or principles from industrial/organizational psychology or managerial science. The shortcomings of traditional approaches for identifying and eliminating human error supported by case study examples are compelling. However, specific details for ameliorating error (or “failures”) within resilient systems are mostly limited to a set of guidelines in the final chapter.</p>
<p>The book aims at a broad audience, including human factors/ergonomics professionals, system designers, and engineers, but it would also be of interest to managers in organizations that produce or purchase technical products and services and who are concerned with improving safety. It is written for advanced readers, including practitioners, researchers, and graduate students. Although the book emphasizes systems analysis and design, the content is pitched at the conceptual level and does not require formal training in those areas to appreciate the message.</p>
