<sec id="section1-0018720811426140">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Recurrence-based measures of communication determinism and pattern information are described and validated using previously collected team interaction data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720811426140">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Team coordination dynamics has revealed that “mixing” team membership can lead to flexible interaction processes, but keeping a team “intact” can lead to rigid interaction processes. We hypothesized that communication of intact teams would have greater determinism and higher pattern information compared to that of mixed teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720811426140">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Determinism and pattern information were measured from three-person Uninhabited Air Vehicle team communication sequences over a series of 40-minute missions. Because team members communicated using push-to-talk buttons, communication sequences were automatically generated during each mission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018720811426140">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The Composition × Mission determinism effect was significant. Intact teams’ determinism increased over missions, whereas mixed teams’ determinism did not change. Intact teams had significantly higher maximum pattern information than mixed teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018720811426140">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Results from these new communication analysis methods converge with content-based methods and support our hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018720811426140">
<title>Application:</title>
<p>Because they are not content based, and because they are automatic and fast, these new methods may be amenable to real-time communication pattern analysis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Whether they are aware of it, people produce interaction patterns when they communicate to perform a team task (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811426140">Bowers, Jentsch, Salas, &amp; Braun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811426140">Fischer, McDonnell, &amp; Orasanu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811426140">Kanki, Lozito, &amp; Foushee, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811426140">Miller, Scheinkestel, &amp; Joseph, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811426140">Pincus, Fox, Perez, Turner, &amp; McGeehan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811426140">Sexton &amp; Helmreich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720811426140">Xiao, Seagull, Mackenzie, Klein, &amp; Ziegert, 2008</xref>). If interaction patterns develop as people continue working together as a team (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811426140">Achille, Schultz, &amp; Schmidt-Nielson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720811426140">Gorman, Foltz, Kiekel, Martin, &amp; Cooke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811426140">Katz, 1982</xref>), then changes in team membership may be reflected in changes in the quantity and informational content of those patterns. Because team interaction patterns recur in time, often in discontinuous bursts and lulls of interactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720811426140">Huberman &amp; Glance, 1998</xref>), nonlinear dynamics may provide appropriate tools for quantifying pattern changes. With this in mind, we describe the measurement of communication determinism drawn from recurrence analysis for nonlinear time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811426140">Webber &amp; Zbilut, 1994</xref>) and a measure of communication pattern information drawn from information theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720811426140">Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949</xref>).</p>
<p>To demonstrate these measures, we analyze communication data from an experiment in which members of three-person teams either changed or stayed the same following a retention interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811426140">Gorman &amp; Cooke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811426140">Gorman et al., 2006</xref>). Predictions based on prior results from that experiment, which used continuously scaled, content-coded measures of team coordination dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811426140">Gorman, Amazeen, &amp; Cooke, 2010</xref>), are made to evaluate the concurrent validity of the new measures. Furthermore, we propose that the discrete recurrence methods described later are amenable to the analysis of discrete team interaction sequences, whose data may be collected and analyzed in real time.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018720811426140">
<title>Discrete Recurrence Measure of Communication Determinism</title>
<p>We measure communication determinism by applying recurrence analysis to discrete team interaction sequences, although it is typically applied to nonlinear time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811426140">Marwan, Romano, Thiel, &amp; Kurths, 2007</xref>). Whereas a time series consists of observations sampled at a regular time interval from a process continuous in both amplitude (variability) and time; by contrast, a discrete sequence is continuous in neither variability nor time. By <italic>discrete</italic> we mean (team interaction) states sampled from a nominal set of mutually exclusive codes (e.g., which team member is speaking), and by <italic>sequence</italic> we mean the codes are ordered in time, but the exact onset or duration times of the individual codes are not used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811426140">Quera, 2008</xref>). (Later, we describe the analysis of a pattern, by which we mean a short array of ordered codes that may or may not be representative of an overall interaction sequence.) Whether a time series or discrete sequence is analyzed, the basis for recurrence analysis is a <italic>recurrence plot</italic> (RP). We start, then, by outlining the general concept of determinism in recurrence plots for time series, leading up to our calculations using discrete team interaction sequences.</p>
<sec id="section9-0018720811426140">
<title>RPs for time series</title>
<p>For a time series <italic>x</italic> of length <italic>N</italic>, an RP is an <italic>N</italic> × <italic>N</italic> (symmetric) matrix where, if the value of <italic>x</italic>(j) is sufficiently close (within a threshold) to the value of <italic>x</italic>(i), then a dot is plotted at <italic>x</italic>(i,j) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811426140">Eckmann, Oliffson Kamp-horst, &amp; Ruelle, 1987</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811426140">Figure 1</xref>). The RP of a time series <italic>x</italic>, therefore, represents all pair-wise combinations i,j that are sufficiently close, over all time scales, using a dot. Note that the minor diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811426140">Figure 1</xref> (from the bottom-left corner to the upper-right corner) is completely filled in because it is the one-to-one plot of the series against itself, at i = j. Because the plot is symmetrical, we analyze only the upper triangle. As we move toward the upper-left corner, away from the minor diagonal, the dots represent time-shifted points of recurrence in the time series. Recurrent points forming unbroken diagonals in the upper triangle are time-shifted, recurrent patterns of the time series.</p>

The minor diagonal of the recurrence plot is the reconstructed series plotted against itself (at i = j); moving up from the minor diagonal, dots corresponding to recurrent points are plotted at each <italic>x</italic>(i,j) where <italic>x</italic>(j) is within a “Threshold” of <italic>x</italic>(i). Diagonals of recurrent points correspond to time-shifted recurrent patterns.

<p>Recurrence analysis proceeds by quantifying recurrent patterns of the plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811426140">Webber &amp; Zbilut, 1994</xref>). Determinism (DET), one of the quantifications extracted from the plot, is the percentage of points forming diagonals to all recurrent points in the upper triangle:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>This measure ranges from zero to 100%, such that a time series that never repeats has determinism zero and a time series that perfectly repeats has determinism 100. For example, the underlying time series for the RP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811426140">Figure 1</xref>, which was generated using a deterministic mathematical equation, has DET = 97.78. For noisy, real-world complex systems, however, we expect DET to lie between deterministic and random extremes.</p>
<p>RPs and their quantifications have been applied to human interaction data that are continuous in both amplitude and time (e.g., child-caregiver interactions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811426140">Dale &amp; Spivey, 2006</xref>; coupling between speaker-listener eye movements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811426140">Richardson &amp; Dale, 2005</xref>; coordination of postural sway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811426140">Shockley, Santana, &amp; Fowler, 2003</xref>). Those studies describe aspects of RPs, including phase-space reconstruction and threshold selection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811426140">Figure 1</xref>), which are beyond the scope of the methods presented here. Because we are analyzing discrete team interaction sequences, research on recurrence analysis for ordinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811426140">Bandt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811426140">Quera, 2008</xref>) and nominal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811426140">Dale, Warlaumont, &amp; Richardson, in press</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811426140">Pincus et al., 2008</xref>) data series provides the groundwork for the discrete recurrence approach presented here.</p>

<sec id="section10-0018720811426140">
<title>Discrete RPs</title>
<p>Consider three discrete states corresponding to three team members, each of whom is uniquely identified by a mutually exclusive number code (i.e., 1, 2, or 3), when they speak. (Later, we carry out these analyses on three-person teams; here, we demonstrate the approach with simulations using three discrete codes.) There is no metric of time, just a series of discrete speaker states represented by a sequence of codes. For a discrete sequence <italic>x</italic> of length <italic>N</italic>, the <italic>N</italic> × <italic>N</italic> recurrence matrix is formed by plotting a dot when the discrete code at <italic>x</italic>(j) exactly matches the discrete code at <italic>x</italic>(i). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref> presents RPs for three simulations over discrete sequences, each of length <italic>N</italic> = 50 codes. DET is computed for each sequence over recurrent points and their diagonals, as in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0018720811426140">Equation 1</xref>, from the upper triangle of each RP.</p>

</fig>
<p>The left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref> corresponds to a completely deterministic case. The same pattern of three codes (1-2-3) always repeats, such that <italic>x</italic>[i] = <italic>x</italic>[i + 3], resulting in a homogeneous RP with DET = 100. The same result would have been obtained, however, if the sequence had been generated by a different pattern of codes (e.g., 3-2-1 [period-3]; 2-1-1-3 [period-4]; 1-2-2-3-1 [period-5]; etc.) so long as the pattern always repeats. This type of interaction sequence, and its RP, would be ideal for a rigidly structured team task, in which variations from a fixed interaction procedure (a repeating pattern) may be harmful.</p>
<p>The middle column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref>, conversely, corresponds to the completely random case. Compared to the deterministic case, the RP is relatively irregular, with DET = 50. Note that DET ≠ 0 because with only three codes there are bound to be chance-level pattern repetitions; that is, with only three codes, the chance of randomly drawing a repeating pattern is high. The results of a simulation study, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811426140">Table 1</xref>, illustrate that the expected values of DET for a random discrete sequence decay as the number of codes increases beyond three but, for three codes, DET is slightly greater than 55% even as sequence length increases. Unless the task environment were entirely unpredictable, it is hard to imagine a team task in which the random case would be ideal.</p>
<p>The sequence in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720811426140">Figure 1</xref> is a pattern that repeats, but not in exactly the same way. Namely, all three codes <italic>must</italic> be represented during each three-code cycle (e.g., <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0018720811426140">

</inline-formula>), but the order of codes varies probabilistically—in this case, <italic>randomly</italic>— from cycle to cycle. This type of sequence is not ideal; it is an abstraction. It represents small, adaptive adjustments (within each three-code cycle) in an otherwise deterministically structured team interaction process.</p>
<p>Like adaptive processes studied in other domains (e.g., dynamics of cognitive processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811426140">Van Orden, Holden, &amp; Turvey, 2003</xref>; human heart rate dynamics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720811426140">Goldberger et al., 2002</xref>), such sequences are neither random nor deterministic; to remain flexible, they are somewhere in between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811426140">Van Orden, Kloos, &amp; Wallot, 2009</xref>). To remain flexible and adaptive, we argue, teams must maintain a balance between overly structured and completely random interaction patterns (viz. DET = 60; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Pattern Information</title>
<p>In information-theoretic terms, the informational content of a sequence of communication codes can be measured by the number of decisions (usually in bits) required to represent the sequence (i.e., the sequence’s uncertainty; its “entropy”), but it does not tell us, in a literal sense, the <italic>meaning</italic> of the sequence. In this light, the information-theoretic content of a communication pattern (extracted from a longer sequence of codes) quantifies the average amount; our uncertainty about the overall sequence is reduced given our knowledge of the pattern. In other words, how much do observed patterns tell us about the overall sequence? Communication pattern information is quantified as the <italic>mutual information</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811426140">Cover &amp; Thomas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811426140">Gallager, 1968</xref>) of a short pattern of codes relative to an overall sequence of codes:</p>

<p>Theoretically, if a sequence consisted of only those codes in the pattern, and the pattern probability is identical to the probability of those codes occurring independently in the sequence, then pattern information with respect to the overall sequence will be zero (i.e., log[1] = 0). Therefore, a pattern that occurs randomly has pattern information equal to zero. If pattern probability is less than the probability of the codes occurring independently, then pattern information will be negative (i.e., if 0 &lt; y = <italic>p</italic>[pattern] / Π <italic>p</italic>[code] &lt; 1, then log[y] &lt; 0). This so-called <italic>negative mutual information</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811426140">Gallager, 1968</xref>) entails that the pattern occurs below random (chance) levels, such that the pattern may provide misleading information concerning the overall sequence (the logic underlying negative pattern information is detailed in the appendix). Alternatively, higher, positive information values indicate that when the codes do occur, they tend to occur together as a pattern, providing positive mutual information concerning the process that generated the overall interaction sequence.</p>
<p>Sample communication patterns and their information values, with respect to <italic>N</italic> = 1,024 samples of the simulated sequences introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref>, are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref>. Here, we demonstrate the pattern information calculations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref> for the pattern 1-2-3 relative to the overall deterministic sequence: The pattern frequency is 341 because 1-2-3 repeats 341 times in the <italic>N</italic> = 1,024 deterministic sequence. The possibility of occurrence of the 1-2-3 pattern within the overall sequence is given by <italic>N – L</italic> + 1 = 1,024 – 3 + 1 = 1,022, such that <italic>p</italic>(pattern) = 341 / 1,022 = .33 (i.e., if you randomly draw a contiguous, three-code pattern from the deterministic sequence, then you stand a 33% chance of observing the 1-2-3 pattern; the calculation of the possibility of pattern occurrence is detailed in the appendix). <italic>p</italic>(pattern) is then divided by the product of the simple probabilities of the codes in the pattern (i.e., [.33][.33][.33]), yielding Pattern Information = .33 × log(.33/.33<sup>3</sup>) = .73. Although the counting of the pattern and code frequencies for the Random and Deterministic + Random cases requires more effort, their calculations are carried out in the same manner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>For illustrative purposes, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref> shows the results for variations of the same pattern (i.e., 1-2-3 and 3-1-2 are the same pattern shifted by one code), its mirror image (3-2-1), and a slightly lengthened version of the 1-2-3 pattern (1-2-3-1). Pattern length does not matter for the deterministic sequence. As long as the codes are properly ordered, nothing more can be learned by lengthening the pattern. Hence, 1-2-3, and its extension 1-2-3-1, are maximum information patterns for the deterministic sequence. Alternatively, if the pattern does not match the deterministic sequence (e.g., 3-2-1 never occurs in the sequence), then pattern information = −∞, indicating that the pattern is misleading with respect to the overall sequence with absolute certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811426140">Gallager, 1968</xref>). We expect that, like a deterministic sequence, high maximum information patterns are associated with rigidly structured team interaction processes.</p>
<p>Pattern length also does not matter for the random sequence, nor does the order of codes in the pattern. In the random case, any randomly generated pattern should be just as informative with respect to the overall sequence as any well thought out, a priori specified pattern; namely, pattern information ≈ 0. The difficulty with the random case for real team interaction is that there would be no pattern (except the overall sequence itself) that would be informative of how team members interact. Under those circumstances, pattern information would be useless. Again, however, it is hard to imagine a team task in which interaction processes are well suited by the random case.</p>
<p>Recall from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720811426140">Figure 2</xref> that we made the Deterministic + Random sequence by randomly ordering the set of codes (1, 2, or 3) for each repetition of a three-code cycle. Because they represent 3 of the possible 27 three-code combinations, the first three patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref> are somewhat representative of the procedure by which the interaction sequence was produced. Accordingly, each of those patterns results in roughly equivalent, nonzero information concerning the overall process. Unlike the deterministic case, there is not a maximum information pattern; information is distributed over variants of the three-code pattern. Adding a fourth code (in the last pattern in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref>), however, violates the deterministic rule of random pattern formation that patterns form three codes at a time, such that pattern information ≈ 0. The Deterministic + Random sequence has flexibility to change patterns, but only within deterministic constraints. We expect that teams that remain flexible and adaptive within the constraints of the task will distribute mutual information across interaction patterns, rather than exhibit high maximum pattern information.</p>
<p>In the process of evaluating the informational content of the patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">Table 2</xref>, we defined the patterns a priori, top-down, based on our knowledge of the overall sequences. Using that approach, we scanned sequences for known patterns to investigate their utility for explaining the process that generated the overall sequence. Another possibility would be to explore a sequence, bottom-up, for maximum information patterns. Following that approach, in the analyses described later we measure the informational content of recurrent patterns, extracted from discrete RPs, to analyze teams’ maximum pattern information.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The DET and Pattern Information measures are applied to communication data collected in the context of a three-person Uninhabited Air Vehicle Synthetic Task Environment (UAV-STE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811426140">Cooke &amp; Shope, 2005</xref>) for teams. The communication data come from an experiment in which team membership either changed or stayed the same following a retention interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811426140">Gorman, Amazeen, &amp; Cooke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811426140">Gorman &amp; Cooke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811426140">Gorman et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously reported on team effectiveness (performance) data from that experiment, showing that “mixed” teams, whose members changed partway through the experiment, suffered a brief performance decrement following the change in membership. However, mixed teams quickly recovered to perform as well as teams that remained intact, and they had significantly higher team process ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811426140">Gorman &amp; Cooke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811426140">Gorman et al., 2006</xref>). The reason for that difference was revealed in intact versus mixed team coordination dynamics: Intact teams exhibited rigid coordination dynamics, whereas mixed teams exhibited more flexible coordination dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811426140">Gorman, Amazeen, et al., 2010</xref>). Mixed team coordination dynamics were also more stable, which was correlated with adapting to unpredictable changes in the task environment. Due to their increased flexibility, mixed teams were more stable with respect to the unpredictable dynamics of the task environment.</p>
<p>Unlike those prior results, we want to demonstrate that the discrete recurrence approach presents valid measures for differentiating nonlinear dynamics using relatively simple (automatically generated) interaction sequences. Based on those prior results, however, we predicted that because intact teams had more rigid coordination dynamics, their interaction sequences would be more rigidly patterned, manifesting in relatively high determinism and maximum pattern information. On the other hand, because their coordination dynamics were more flexible, we predicted that mixed team interaction sequences would manifest in lower determinism and, relative to their overall interaction process, lower maximum pattern information.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section14-0018720811426140">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Forty-five three-person teams (135 total participants) participated across two experimental sessions, separated by a retention interval. Participants’ age ranged from 18 to 58 (<italic>M</italic> = 26), and 96 were male. Participants did not know each other prior to the experiment. In the current study, we analyze communication data from the 39 teams who participated during the second session of the experiment. Participants were paid $70 during the second session with a $100 bonus for each member of the highest performing team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720811426140">
<title>Procedure, Experimental Design, and Apparatus</title>
<p>The communication data came from a three-person UAV-STE in which teams perform a series of 40-min missions (separated by 5-min breaks) during which they fly the UAV over ground targets to take reconnaissance photographs (11–12 targets per mission). The team members—pilot, photographer, and navigator—monitor role-specific workstations and coordinate control of the UAV over headsets using push-to-talk (PTT) buttons that may be directed to either or both of the other team members. The necessary and sufficient interactions to successfully photograph a target include the following: (1) the navigator provides target information to the photographer; (2) the pilot and photographer negotiate a final airspeed and altitude for that target; and (3) the photographer provides feedback on the status of the photograph. At any given time, however, teams are following this procedure for multiple targets. The result is multiple, nested communication “threads,” corresponding to different targets, operating simultaneously on different time scales.</p>
<p>During the first session of the experiment, teams acquired task proficiency over five missions. Teams returned for the second session after a short (3–5 weeks) or long (10–13 weeks) retention interval. Teams returned for the second session with their same members (intact) or with different members (mixed); however, individuals maintained their same role on the team. Each team completed three missions during the second session (the postretention missions analyzed later).</p>
<p>During each mission, the PTT system recorded who was talking, when, and for how long, such that the PTT system automatically codes for discrete (turn-taking) interaction sequences. PTT recordings were missing for 2 of the 39 Session 2 teams; therefore, their sequences were excluded from the statistical analyses (i.e., 37 teams × 3 postretention missions = 111 interaction sequences). The lengths of the interaction sequences for each experimental condition are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720811426140">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Surrogate Analysis</title>
<p>Surrogate analysis is a resampling method that tests the null hypothesis that the observed dynamics are due to the temporal (sequential) distribution of the data, rather than their marginal distribution properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811426140">Theiler, Eubank, Longtin, Galdrikian, &amp; Farmer, 1992</xref>). We conducted a surrogate analysis to ensure DET and, therefore, pattern analysis results were not artifacts of sequences consisting of only three codes or occurred randomly. Surrogate sequences were generated by randomly shuffling each observed postretention sequence such that the codes were randomly sequenced, but the observed and surrogate sequences retained the same marginal properties (i.e., the multinomial probability of codes is preserved after shuffling). DET values of surrogate sequences (<italic>M</italic> = 57.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.60) and observed sequences (<italic>M</italic> = 60.59, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.43) were compared using a sign test (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811426140">Van Orden et al., 2003</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have presented methods that are simple applications of recurrence analysis and information theory that differentiate teams based on discrete interaction sequences. As we expected, the rigidity of intact teams was reflected in greater communication determinism and higher maximum information patterns relative to mixed teams.</p>
<p>We previously reported that intact teams initially outperform mixed teams, but that effect lasts only one UAV mission (i.e., the first post-retention mission; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811426140">Gorman &amp; Cooke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811426140">Gorman et al., 2006</xref>). Mixed teams, however, exhibit higher team process ratings and more flexible coordination dynamics, which were correlated with adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811426140">Gorman, Amazeen, et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, mixed teams end up performing as well as intact teams, but they become more adaptive. In this report, new results indicate that those experimental effects may be further qualified by level of communication determinism and pattern information: As indexed by determinism, mixed team interaction is less rigid than intact team interaction, and, as indexed by maximum pattern information, single patterns do not explain as much of their interaction process. It has long been argued that, for teams and groups, familiarity can breed habituation of interaction patterns and rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811426140">Gersick &amp; Hackman, 1990</xref>; e.g., groupthink; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811426140">Janis, 1972</xref>). Our current results provide further support for that account and provide evidence for the validity of the discrete recurrence measures.</p>
<p>Whereas intact teams regained preretention levels of communication determinism, mixed teams did not. Relative to preretention levels of maximum pattern information, intact teams ultimately exhibited higher maximum pattern information; however, mixed teams were always at or below preretention levels. By these measures, it appears that mixing teams changes something fundamental in the learning and development of team interaction processes.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that the developmental transition toward deterministic, high maximum information patterns for intact teams did not ultimately produce ideal deterministic results (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811426140">Tables 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811426140">2</xref>). Although intact team interactions were significantly more deterministic than were mixed team interactions, both intact and mixed teams’ results were closer to a deterministic + random process than purely deterministic or random (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811426140">Table 1</xref>). Does this begin to suggest something about the fundamental nature of team interaction in dynamic environments?</p>
<p>If team interaction is not deterministically structured (as it might be if teams rigidly follow an a priori script) and it is not random, then what is the nature of “in-between” forms of interaction—exemplified by the abstract deterministic + random process—such that teams may differentially acquire flexible yet stable interaction processes? We think the key lies in the dynamic interchange between team interaction and the task environment. That is to say that team members are compelled to adjust their interaction patterns (flexibility) in relation to changes in the task environment, such that the team maintains a stable trajectory toward meeting its goals. We have also found that changes in interaction constraints, which specify the nature of the team task, that perturb the stability of a team trajectory provide flexibility training for adaptive teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720811426140">Gorman, Cooke, et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, “local” interaction flexibility and “global” task stability may be reciprocally related. We believe discrete recurrence methods present not only methods for quantifying the effect of training and experimental interventions on flexibility of team interaction processes but also the dynamics that contribute to that process.</p>
<p>The methods we have presented allow us to characterize interaction flexibility in terms of communication determinism and pattern information using relatively simple, discrete interaction sequences. In the next section, we consider the implications of this for automated data analysis, including real-time interaction analysis.</p>
<sec id="section24-0018720811426140">
<title>Implications for Automated Data Analysis</title>
<p>The past research that led to our predictions in the current study used communication and video content to code (“log”) specific types of interactions to examine the dynamic flexibility and stability of team coordination. Content coding can be highly resource intensive and (most often) requires human expertise (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811426140">Emmert &amp; Barker, 1989</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720811426140">Foltz &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). By contrast, the discrete recurrence methods illustrated here may be automatically applied to automatically generated team interaction data. Although discrete sequential methods are not intended to capture deep-level interaction content, they may be useful for capturing some of the same aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of team interaction. In this light, automated data analysis using discrete recurrence methods could be used like a filter to localize interesting data in need of more resource-intensive methods for deep-level content analysis (i.e., the “wedding cake” strategy for team communication analysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811426140">Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because they could be automated, discrete recurrence methods also have potential for real-time communication analysis. Although we analyzed our interaction data post hoc, those data were generated in real time. Therefore, discrete recurrence algorithms may be applied to team interaction sequences <italic>as they are collected</italic>. In the current study we used a PTT system to generate interaction data in real time. However, real-time interaction data can be generated by applying a low-pass filter to sound pressure level (SPL) at team-member microphones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811426140">Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2010</xref>). When SPL exceeds team members’ thresholds, data about who is talking, when, and for how long can be automatically generated for real-time discrete recurrence analysis.</p>

<sec id="section25-0018720811426140">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Several limitations warrant mentioning. First, we examined communication determinism and pattern information in a structured team task, but not a rigidly structured team task. For example, the UAV team members were not required to acknowledge the receipt of a piece of information. A more highly structured task, however, may introduce concurrent requirements for highly structured interaction. In that case, we would expect higher levels of communication determinism and pattern information, indicating that the team is interacting in a manner consistent with the requirements of the task. Second, we were concerned with interaction code sequences but not exact onset/offset (duration time) of codes. Therefore, our analyses are more similar to the analysis of event-coded data than time-coded data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811426140">Bakeman &amp; Gottman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811426140">Quera (2008)</xref>, however, provided pattern analysis strategies for code sequences when code durations are used. Third, we looked only at mean results, not specific patterns. In future applications, these methods may be used to differentiate teams based on specific patterns or to identify patterns for detailed content analysis. Finally, a coding scheme need not correspond to speaker identity. So long as codes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, any team interaction coding scheme may be used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811426140">Bakeman &amp; Gottman, 1997</xref>, for an overview of coding schemes).</p>
<p>Several future directions also deserve mentioning. In our experiment, we manipulated team composition using just two levels of team membership—intact versus mixed—to examine the effect on team interaction processes. A difficulty with assessing interaction patterns in real teams, however, is that one or more key players may come and go at any time. Under those conditions, change in team membership is a variable that may take on many more values than the two levels in our experiment. In terms of nonlinear dynamics of team interaction, scaling of a (more) continuous team membership variable may result in discontinuous changes in the quality of interaction patterns. The challenge for the future, then, is to use discrete recurrence methods to detect qualitative changes (“phase transitions”) in the quantity and informational content of communication patterns with continuously scaled changes in team membership.</p>
<p>Although we applied recurrence analysis to univariate discrete interaction sequences, recurrence analysis can be applied to bivariate nonlinear time series using Cross Recurrence Plots (CRPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811426140">Marwan &amp; Kurths, 2002</xref>). CRPs allow two dynamical systems to be compared to examine synchronization of states across systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811426140">Shockley, Butwill, Zbilut, &amp; Webber, 2002</xref>). A natural extension of the present research, then, is to examine discrete CRPs for synchronization between team interaction sequences. Using that approach, either two teams’ sequences could be plotted against each other or one team’s sequence could be plotted against an ideal referent.</p>

<title>Negative Pattern Information</title>
<p>For team communication, imagine a three-person (Persons 1, 2, and 3) task in which it makes no sense for Person 3 to follow Person 1 (i.e., the transition 1–3 is against the rules). Although the unitary events “1” and “3” may occur frequently in an observed sequence, we would expect any pattern containing the transition 1–3 to occur so rarely that its probability would be less than we would expect to occur randomly by chance. In fact, we might expect that any pattern containing the transition 1–3 should result in negative pattern information, because it is unlikely that any such pattern reflects the process that generated the overall sequence.</p>

<title>Possibility of Pattern Occurrence Calculation</title>
<p>The calculation of the denominator in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0018720811426140">Equation 3</xref> can be understood as follows: Consider a short sequence <italic>x</italic> of length <italic>N</italic> = 6 and a pattern of length <italic>L</italic> = 3. That pattern could occur at each of the following positions of <italic>x</italic>: [1,2,3]; [2,3,4]; [3,4,5]; and [4,5,6]. Hence, there would be a maximum of <italic>N – L</italic> + 1 = 6 – 3 + 1 = 4 locations where the pattern could occur within the sequence <italic>x</italic>. Note that if <italic>N</italic> = <italic>L</italic>, and if each code in the pattern matches the sequence, then <italic>p</italic>(pattern) must equal one; however, if the pattern does not occur in the sequence, then <italic>p</italic>(pattern) must equal zero.</p>
