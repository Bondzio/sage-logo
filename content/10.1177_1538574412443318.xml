<abstract>
<p>Selected near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) parameters were assessed in healthy untrained participants and in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) trained patients to evaluate their usefulness in rehabilitative outcome. Forty-five PAD and 15 healthy participants were studied at entry and at 34 ± 2 weeks. Healthy participants performed their usual activities. Patients with PAD performed 2 home-based programs: structured at prescribed pace (S-pre, n = 31) and unstructured at free pace (U-free, n = 14). We measured ankle–brachial index (ABI), NIRS calf oxygen consumption at rest, NIRS dynamic muscle perfusion during an incremental test, and walking capacity. In all patients with PAD the NIRS parameters significantly increased approaching the stable values of untrained healthy participants. Among PAD, only S-pre group showed significant improvements in hemodynamic, functional, and NIRS parameters with selective adaptations in the worse legs. The assessment of NIRS parameters, that were found stable without training in healthy and modified in PAD only following structured training, might outline the local exercise-induced adaptations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Exercise training is an effective treatment for claudication,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443318">1</xref>
</sup> and walking sessions performed at a moderate level of pain are recommended for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).<sup>

</sup> Exercise training is responsible for changes in muscle structure and function in normal participants and in patients with PAD,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443318">3</xref>
</sup> and the capacity to recognize the quality and quantity of training may allow the design of an optimal training strategy. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is able to noninvasively and objectively assess muscle blood flow and oxygenation levels under static and dynamic conditions.<sup>

<p>To evaluate the suitability of NIRS to noninvasively study local hemodynamics, we reevaluated a validated method to determine muscle oxygen consumption,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412443318">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443318">15</xref>
</sup> and we proposed a dynamic parameter to quantify the degree of muscle oxygenation in a predetermined range of walking speeds in patients with PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>
</sup> To verify the clinical usefulness of these parameters obtained by the NIRS technique, this study aims (a) to determine the reference values for NIRS parameters in patients with PAD and healthy participants and evaluate their stability in the presence or absence of training, (b) to evaluate changes in the NIRS parameters in patients with PAD following 2 different exercise programs, and (c) to evaluate possible selective changes in the NIRS parameters in the worst leg of patients performing the more effective program.</p>

<title>Study Populations</title>
<sec id="section4-1538574412443318">
<title>Patients with PAD</title>
<p>A total of 55 (42 M, age 71.1 ± 6.3 years) patients with PAD at Fontaine stage 2 with stable claudication were sequentially recruited. The patients had been previously evaluated in the Vascular Surgery Department by means of clinical and duplex scanning examinations and/or other diagnostic imaging techniques. Patients were given the option to be included in 2 different home-based exercise programs: (1) a structured program based on exercise prescribed at the hospital and carried out at home or (2) a traditional, unstructured program performed at free pace up to pain tolerance (for details see description of rehabilitation program, below). Exclusion criteria were contraindication/limitations for exercise (eg, unstable angina, recent surgery or myocardial infarction, cardiac disease with a ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%), limitations of oxygen transport and extraction (severe anemia and myopathy), limitations of penetration of light (lower limb lymphedema and/or adipose tissue thickness at the calf &gt;20 mm), severe walking disability (reported claudication distance &lt;50 m) affecting the capacity to reach the predetermined speed during the treadmill test, previous participation in rehabilitation programs, significant modifications of clinical conditions and/or pharmacological therapy during the study period, and failure to comply with at least 50% of the prescribed exercise sessions</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574412443318">
<title>Healthy participants</title>
<p>Fifteen healthy volunteers (7 M, age 38.3 ± 15.3 years) were also randomly recruited. Volunteers underwent a clinical examination and were excluded if affected by any chronic or current pathological condition or if assuming any medication.</p>
<p>Patients with PAD and healthy participants were adequately informed about the study protocol and gave their written informed consent to participate. The protocol used in the study was approved by the local ethical committee.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574412443318">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>Outcome measures were evaluated in all study participants at baseline and after 34 ± 2 weeks by the same operators.</p>
<sec id="section7-1538574412443318">
<title>Hemodynamic evaluation</title>
<p>Ankle–brachial index (ABI) was measured according to standard methods<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443318">2</xref>
</sup> using a Doppler ultrasound device (Stereodop 448.S, Ultrasomed, Milan, Italy), with a 9.3-MHz probe and a standard blood pressure cuff. Legs were considered affected by PAD at ABI values ≤0.9.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443318">2</xref>
</sup> For each patient, their legs were classified as either the better or worse limb according to the ABI value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538574412443318">
<title>Near-infrared spectroscopy measurements</title>
<p>Static and dynamic measurements were obtained with a continuous wave system (Oxymon MK III, Artinis Medical System, The Netherlands) consisting of 2 channels (2 equal-pulsed light sources, 2 avalanche photodiode detectors, and ambient light protection) using intensity-modulated light at a frequency of 1 MHz and laser diodes at 3 wavelengths (905, 850, and 770 nm) corresponding to high absorption of oxyhemoglobin (O<sub>2</sub>Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) with an autosensor operating at 110 to 240 V (approximately 40 W). The light of the laser diodes, which is conducted from the instrument through biological tissue and back through optical glass fibers 3 m long, can be partially absorbed or scattered by the tissues and partially recollected by the detector, thus providing information about O<sub>2</sub>Hb and HHb concentrations as determined by spectral analysis. Additional parameters calculated were the total hemoglobin (tHb) obtained by the sum of O<sub>2</sub>Hb and HHb and the difference between O<sub>2</sub>Hb and HHb. The NIRS sensors were placed and secured with tape along the medial surface of the calf at the level of the largest circumference. The distance between sensor and malleolus medialis was measured and recorded for each patient to obtain a correct positioning at the follow-up evaluation.</p>
<p>The distance between the 2 optical sensors was maintained at 4 cm to allow a maximum penetration depth of the light of approximately 20 mm. Resting muscle oxygen consumption (rmVO<sub>2</sub>) was determined by venous occlusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412443318">14</xref>
</sup> As previously described,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443318">15</xref>
</sup> with the patient resting in a supine position, a blood pressure cuff (length = 79 cm, height = 21 cm) was placed around the thigh and connected to a compressor with a manometer. The cuff was inflated to a pressure of 60 mm Hg within 4 seconds and maintained at a constant level for 30 seconds, after which the pneumatic cuff was quickly released. The absolute value of rmVO<sub>2</sub> was calculated by analyzing the rate of increase in HHb concentration once the venous outflow had been blocked by compression.</p>
<p>A dynamic measurement was performed to determine the rate of muscle deoxygenation in a predetermined speed range during an incremental treadmill test using NIRS sensors placed at the calf.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>

</sup> based on the level walking began at a speed of 1.5 km/h, progressively increasing by 0.1 km/h every 10 m. The speed at the onset of claudication symptoms (pain threshold speed) was recorded. The test was interrupted when the patient was unable to continue for any reason (eg, pain, fatigue, dyspnea, or achievement of the maximal theoretical heart rate [HR]). The patient’s HR was recorded at rest in a standing position and at the end of each step of the test using a HR monitor (Polar Electro, Finland). The difference between the HR recorded at 1.7 and at 3.0 km/h was calculated to determine the patient’s HR response (HRR) in that range. Semiquantitative data obtained by the NIRS instrument during the incremental test within the range 1.7 to 3.0 km/h were analyzed using the software provided by the manufacturer (Oxysoft 47). As previously described,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>
</sup> data were transferred into an electronic spreadsheet and analyzed using statistical software after normalization to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and quantify the individual degrees of variation for HbO<sub>2</sub> (O<sub>2</sub>Hb<sub>AUC</sub>) and tHb (tHb<sub>AUC</sub>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1538574412443318">
<title>Functional evaluation</title>
<p>The distance at the onset of claudication pain (initial claudication distance [ICD]) and at the maximal tolerable pain (absolute claudication distance [ACD]) were assessed by a constant load treadmill test (3 km/h of speed at a slope of 10%), which was performed 20 minutes after the previous incremental test.</p>

</sup> was proposed. Two daily (6 days/week) interval walking sessions of 10 minutes each were prescribed at a speed 20% to 30% lower than the pain threshold speed previously determined. The speed, converted into cadence, was maintained at home using a digital metronome. After the baseline testing session, the program was tailored for the next month and then updated during additional 3 checkups at the hospital according to modification of pain threshold speed, with the walking cadence, length of each bout of exercise, and rest periods being modified. Training was preferably performed indoors, walking on a floor at home (eg, in a corridor or heated garage) to avoid weather limitations. Patients were provided with a diary in which to report the daily exercise carried out and any associated symptoms. Patient adherence to the program was evaluated by examining the diary, which was collected at each subsequent visit. The rehabilitation team was available to the patients via telephone contact throughout the study period.</p>

<p>Patients were asked to walk 20 to 30 min/d at least 6 d/week at their own pace up to a moderate level of pain, to stop for as long as needed and to begin again when possible. Periodic checkups were also organized including incremental treadmill testing as in the S-pre group to maintain similar skills to the treadmill group and motivation for the training sessions.</p>

<p>In both PAD subgroups, a high level of compliance was observed. No minor or major adverse events occurred during the execution of exercise. No major modifications of medical therapies were implemented. The S-pre group patients who completed the study followed the prescribed program, walking at home at average speeds of 63 to 88 ± 7 steps/min. The U-free group patients reported their daily exercise performance (6 d/week) at self-selected speeds, with average daily exercise duration of 25 min. At the end of the study, the S-pre group showed increased rmVO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>Hb<sub>AUC</sub> with a concomitant decrease in HRR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1538574412443318">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412443318">Figure 2</xref>). A significant increase in their ABI values, particularly in the worse leg, was also observed. The described variations were associated with an increase in all functional parameters. In the U-free group, the NIRS and functional parameters were unmodified.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, the NIRS technique was used for the first time to noninvasively detect peripheral metabolic adaptations associated with variations in performance following exercise training in patients with claudication. The values of the selected NIRS parameters under study differed between the healthy participants and patients with PAD, were stable in healthy participants without training, and tended to normalize after exercise training in the patients with PAD. The NIRS parameters were also differently modified in the patients with PAD after exercise sessions of different intensity and structure, with individually varying changes in the worst leg of the patients performing the same structured prescribed exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise training significantly improves walking ability in patients with PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443318">1</xref>
</sup> Muscle changes have been observed in patients with PAD following exercise sessions, for example with improvement in the low oxidative capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443318">3</xref>
</sup> Favorable aerobic adaptations should be complemented with concomitant vascular changes (capillarization, collateral development) that improve O<sub>2</sub> transportation and that transfer in hypoxic areas. However, blood flow improvements are not correlated with exercise-induced improvements in function and symptoms,<sup>

</sup> and hemodynamic changes are poorly reported in patients with PAD following rehabilitative training,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443318">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443318">3</xref>
</sup> despite the potential benefits of exercise on the vessels.<sup>

</sup> We therefore tested the NIRS technique, which is able to noninvasively assess muscle blood flow and oxygenation level and selected static and dynamic parameters<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443318">15</xref>
</sup> to understand whether hemodynamic adaptations following exercise training in PAD were detectable.</p>
<p>Our results from 2 different populations, healthy and PAD participants, confirm the reliability of those NIRS parameters in detecting different hemodynamic conditions and changes. In addition to the confirmed differences in the dynamic metabolic patterns in the muscles between the healthy and PAD patients detected by NIRS at baseline,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>
</sup> we observed changes in perfusion only in the patients with PAD who became physically active, with values approaching those found in healthy persons. The NIRS parameters also changed differently in the 2 subgroups of patients with PAD exposed to different training stimuli. Significant improvements in dynamic muscle perfusion were observed in the subgroup performing a structured training at a prescribed intensity. This group exhibited better walking performance, together with a greater capacity to extract oxygen in the calf and improvements in the ABI and O<sub>2</sub>Hb<sub>AUC</sub>, especially in the worse limb. We observed that free-pace exercise at maximal walking distance in the presence of pain resulted in small functional improvements and poor hemodynamic changes, limited to the better limb, which normally is less limiting to the walking performance. A flat unstructured program, as well as a free training pace similar to usual daily walking performed under hypoxic conditions, may not provide an additional training stimulus for the worse limb, in contrast to a structured program based on selected intensity aiming to expose the muscles of the more ischemic leg to a submaximal intensity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574412443318">22</xref>
</sup> associated with the local relative accumulation of lactic acid. To achieve the optimal aerobic adaptations in PAD, we previously proposed a similar training program<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443318">18</xref>
</sup> based on a slow but increasing walking speed, short interval sessions with a progressive increase in the work/rest ratio followed by functional improvements, accompanied in some cases by an increased ABI value.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443318">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412443318">19</xref>
</sup> As an additional observation in this study, we also found that individually varied responses followed the same personalized structured training, and the NIRS actually allowed us to discriminate these selective adaptations. In a retrospective evaluation of the changes that occurred in the patients in the S-pre group, we examined the more ischemic leg, both because that leg represents a potential performance-limiting factor owing to its early deoxygenation while walking and because the training speed that was used in the program was calibrated based on working capacity. On the basis of an arbitrary cutoff value of a 10% increase in the ABI compared with the baseline, the subgroup with a positive hemodynamic response (ABI+) showed a noticeable increase in the mean ABI value (+26%) associated with an increased O<sub>2</sub>Hb in the calf muscle during dynamic evaluation, confirming increased peripheral oxygen availability. Improved performance was also observed related to the functional parameters at the onset of symptoms. Subgroup ABI−, which did not present relevant hemodynamic changes, failed to show improved dynamic perfusion. However, we observed a compensatory increase in rmVO<sub>2</sub> (165%) in the calf associated with greater extractive muscle capacity compared with the ABI+ legs, with improvement in the functional parameters in the presence of symptoms. The 2 NIRS parameters considered here may therefore reflect different hemodynamic adaptations. The static parameter, rmVO<sub>2</sub>, representing muscle capacity to rapidly extract oxygen, may “quantify” local muscle capillarization. The values for this parameter were significantly higher in patients with severe PAD than in low-moderate PAD or healthy participants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443318">15</xref>
</sup> The NIRS dynamic parameter, detecting muscle perfusion, can represent oxygen availability. In this study, an improved degree of oxygenation may support an increase in oxygen availability due to arterial dilation or neovascularization, occurring only in a subgroup of patients training at a specific intensity. The study also confirmed the plasticity of the oxygen transportation–utilization system in the presence of conditions that stimulate an adaptive response, such as exercise training. A drop in HRR was observed only in the group showing improved muscle extraction or perfusion. Thus, the increased peripheral oxygen availability appears to reduce the compensatory early increase in HR observed in these patients at a low walking speed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412443318">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This study has limitations derived from the application of the NIRS technique (limited area of analysis of a single muscle, variability of probe positioning, and skinfold thickness), as we have discussed previously<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443318">15</xref>
</sup> and attempted to reduce when possible. We analyzed only a localized region of a particular muscle, the gastrocnemius, located below most of the arterial lesions and involved in walking, but oxygen saturation may vary within and between specific muscles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412443318">7</xref>
</sup> The investigators involved were not blinded to the groups under study, although the assessment of NIRS parameters is not operator dependent. Other shortcomings are that patients were not randomized and were allowed to choose their treatment; moreover, the small sample size was reduced by dropouts. A possible limitation is that a PAD-inactive control group was not included. However, we preferred a relatively young population free from disease and therapy to obtain reference values for the NIRS parameters and to evaluate their stability in the absence of exercise training, considering that PAD does not guarantee a stable hemodynamic condition and a constant muscle metabolic efficiency for the continuous hypoxic stimulus during daily walking.</p>
<p>Selected NIRS parameters showed different peripheral hemodynamic responses, measuring untrained participants and patients with PAD following different training programs. Significant functional improvements were observed in the groups of patients showing hemodynamic changes supported by the NIRS parameters, with some individually varying adaptations observed in patients performing the same effective training. The modifications detected through NIRS measurements, when combined with noninvasive parameters including the ABI and HRR, may explain how adaptations affect training outcomes and may therefore be useful to evaluate rehabilitation programs in patients with PAD.</p>
