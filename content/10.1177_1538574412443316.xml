<p>Objective: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access. Methods: Totally 59 patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates. Results: Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short Form 36, and EuroQol scores (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], <italic>P</italic> &gt; .05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], <italic>P</italic> = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 [3.8%], <italic>P</italic> = .623), respectively. Conclusions: The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Small saphenous varicosities have traditionally been treated by open saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) ligation with or without small saphenous vein (SSV) stripping. Numerous factors deter surgeons from undertaking this procedure, such as unpredictable and variable anatomy of the SPJ, difficult dissection, proximity to major neurovascular structures, lack of consensus on SSV stripping, and the high rates of complications and recurrence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443316">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443316">2</xref>
</sup> Minimally invasive endovenous interventions circumvent the need for popliteal dissection and/or SSV stripping with their associated morbidity. While these benefits seem alluring, reluctance by some practitioners to use endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in SSV management seems to stem from the possibility of thermal nerve injury, particularly to the sural nerve, given its proximity to the SSV.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443316">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412443316">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the risks and benefits of EVLA in the context of site of SSV access and to report on the technical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574412443316" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a prospective observational study of 59 consecutive patients who underwent EVLA for symptomatic unilateral SPJ incompetence with SSV reflux, as determined by duplex ultrasonography (DUS). Incompetence was defined as reflux greater than 1 second on spectral Doppler trace. Patients with recurrent varicose veins (VVs), associated great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence or deep venous incompetence were excluded from the study. Site of endovenous access was recorded as either above mid-calf (AMC) or below mid-calf (BMC).</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574412443316">
<title>The EVLA Technique</title>
<p>All procedures were performed under tumescent local anesthesia in a dedicated outpatient clean procedure room. Incompetent SSV and perforators were marked preoperatively using a portable duplex ultrasound machine (Micromaxx, Sonosite, Hitchin, UK) and any clinically obvious surface varicosities marked with the patient standing, to facilitate stab avulsions. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cannulation was performed with the patient in the prone, reverse Trendelenburg position. The exact site of axial vein cannulation was guided by an adequate sized (≥3 mm) distal vein segment in which venous reflux was demonstrated. A 5Fr catheter was introduced into the vein using the Seldinger technique; the patient was then placed in the Trendelenburg position and perivenous tumescent local anesthetic (20 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:200 000 adrenaline and 20 mL of 0.5% levobupivicaine in 1 L of 0.9% saline) infiltrated along the axial vein and tributaries. A bare-tipped 600 nm laser fiber was then introduced via the catheter and its tip accurately positioned at the SPJ under ultrasound guidance. Laser energy was delivered using an 810 nm diode laser generator (Diomed/Angiodynamics, Cambridge, UK) at 14 W power with a continuous pullback rate of 2 mm/s. Perforator ligation and ambulatory phlebectomies were performed concomitantly as a single procedure. An elasticated adhesive bandage (Panelast, Lohmann &amp; Rauscher International GmbH &amp; Co KG) was then applied to the leg, which was replaced with a class II (30-40 mm Hg) knee-length graduated support stocking after 1 week, to be worn during the day for an additional 5 weeks. All patients were asked to walk immediately postprocedure and to return to normal activities as soon as they felt comfortable. They were dispensed paracetamol and regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the absence of contraindication or intolerance. Written aftercare and emergency contact details were provided to all patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574412443316">
<title>Data Collection and Follow-Up</title>
<p>Pretreatment data collection included clinical severity of the VVs as categorized by the Clinical Etiological Anatomic Pathophysiological stages and the venous clinical severity scores (VCSS). Duplex ultrasonography findings, procedure duration, complications, and length of SSV ablated were recorded prospectively. Postoperative pain scores (10 cm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] on days 1, 3, and 7) and additional analgesic requirement were recorded by the patient in a pain diary, as were the number of days to return to work and normal activity. Generic QoL was measured using the Short Form 36 (SF-36; Medical Outcomes Trust, Waltham, Massachusetts) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) instruments, The SF-36 utilizes 36 items to derive 8 domains, each scored from 0 (<italic>worst possible</italic>) to 100 (<italic>best possible</italic>). The EQ-5D utilizes responses to 5 domain questions that are transformed using a time trade-off tariff to a global index scored on a scale of −0.513 (<italic>worst score</italic>) to 1 (<italic>best score</italic>). Both instruments have been validated and utilized as a measure of effectiveness in VV treatment.<sup>

<p>Patients were followed up at the vascular laboratory at 1, 6, 12, and 52 weeks. Each visit consisted of clinical examination followed by DUS examination and collection of QoL questionnaires completed by the patients. Clinical recurrence was predefined as presence of clinically obvious VVs at least 3 mm in diameter, which were not present at 1 or 6 weeks postprocedure but became apparent during subsequent follow-ups. The need for secondary procedures was assessed at 6 to 12 weeks and if patients remained symptomatic with residual/recurrent varicosities or developed symptomatic incompetent perforators affecting QoL, treatment options were discussed and offered subsequently.</p>

<title>Complications and Recurrence</title>
<p>Minor complications recorded in the AMC and BMC groups included phlebitis in 2 (6%) and 1 (3.8%) limbs (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05); and paresthesia in the sural nerve distribution in 2 (6%) and 5 (19%) limbs at 3 months (<italic>P </italic>= .223), persisting up to a year in 1 (3%) and 3 (11.5%) limbs (<italic>P</italic> = .311), respectively. There was a single case of skin tract pigmentation (3.8%) along the treated SSV segment in the BMC group (<italic>P</italic> = .440).</p>
<p>Clinical recurrence was recorded in 3 (9%) and 1 (3.8%) limbs (<italic>P</italic> = .623), in the AMC and BMC groups, respectively. Duplex demonstrated patterns of recurrence in these 4 limbs were incompetent mid-thigh perforator feeding superficial tributaries; concurrent calf perforator and anterolateral thigh branch incompetence; giacomini vein incompetence causing recanalization in the entire length of treated SSV at 3 months, in the AMC group and incompetent calf perforators in the single limb from the BMC group. Open perforator ligation was carried out as a secondary procedure in the same limb. The rest were asymptomatic and declined secondary interventions. One limb from the AMC group underwent ambulatory phlebectomies for residual symptomatic varicosities under local anesthesia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study with its 2 groups differentiated by the level of access AMC and BMC did not show a significant difference in the paresthetic complications between the groups. This finding is contrary to the results from a recent randomized-controlled trial performed by Doganci et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443316">15</xref>
</sup> who found a significant increase in sensory paresthesia associated with endovenous access established distally at the ankle. The investigators attributed such increase in paresthesia to the level of puncture site, having refrained from concomitant phlebectomies in all their patients. The nonsignificant trend shown toward increased complications with distal access site in our study could be attributed to a small sample size (type 2 error); the SSV access in the BMC group was however restricted between mid and lower calf, never requiring cannulation at the ankle, which may have been the elementary reason for increased rate of paresthetic complications in Doganci’s study.</p>
<p>The relative increase in the sensory complications in the BMC group may have however been a direct consequence of increased LED delivery of more than 100 J/cm in 4 of 5 limbs in the same group and 1 of the 2 limbs in the AMC group. Logistic regression analysis to quantify such an association again failed to reach significance, possibly due to the small numbers that received LED over 100 J/cm in this observational study. Temperatures within the vein have been reported to reach between 700°C and 1300°C with EVLA,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412443316">16</xref>
</sup> and although the tumescence “heat sink” significantly lessens the heat transfer to paravenous structures, even temperatures of 45°C may cause irreversible nerve injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443316">3</xref>
</sup> In the case of SSV treatment, the fascial sheath envelope around the vein makes creation of a perivenous tumescence “halo” relatively easy, and with ample volumes of tumescence should in turn adequately separate the paravenous structures along its entire length.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412443316">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443316">17</xref>
</sup> Thus, the senior author of the study recommends meticulous tumescence administration as well as lower laser energy delivery at 60 to 80 J/cm for SSV treatment, based on the best evidence from our own practice to reduce the incidence of postprocedural paresthetic and phlebitic complications, without decreasing treatment efficacy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443316">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443316">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One of the limitations in the design of this observational study is that concomitant phlebectomies which were performed as standard adjuvant treatment in both groups did not assist in determining the contribution of such stab avulsions to potentially cause nerve injuries. The paresthetic complication in the AMC group was low and comparable to other studies reporting on EVLA (810 nm) of SSV alone without adjuvant procedures,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443316">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443316">18</xref>
</sup> thereby suggestive of weak correlation between occurrence of nerve injuries with phlebectomies. However, such speculation could have been validated by comparison with a control group undergoing EVLA alone without adjuvant phlebectomy procedures. Concomitant phlebectomies, however did significantly reduce the number of secondary procedures required for residual varicosities post-SSV EVLA<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412443316">17</xref>
</sup> (1.6% in the current study) as compared to the rates reported in similar studies (between 18% and 100%),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443316">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412443316">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412443316">18</xref>
</sup> offering EVLA without concomitant treatment of tributary varicosities, which is likely to have significant impact on the indirect costs of the treatment and on patient’s expectations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412443316">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical recurrence rates were low in both groups in the current study; with the majority of recurrence (3 of 4 limbs) occurring due to new reflux in the extra-axial locations, unrelated to the length of the SSV ablated. A single case of clinical recurrence due to SSV recanalization (overall 1.6%) at 3 months in the AMC group resulted due to reflux from a previously competent giacomini vein into SSV (treated with 104 J/cm LED; preoperative proximal vein diameter of 5.8 mm). As such we would class this as an anatomical cause for treatment failure rather than a technical failure due to the magnitude of energy delivered or saphenous vein size; both of which have been implicated with increased occurrence of recanalization at LED delivery less than 60 J/cm and in SSVs over 9.0 mm in size.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Irrespective of the site of access, EVLA of SSV with concomitant phlebectomies of the incompetent tributaries appears to be a safe and effective treatment option, improving clinical severity and QoL outcomes in the short term. Low recurrence and complication rates are also promising as compared to the results reported with conventional surgery. With its increasing applications, reports such as ours are required for “procedure refinement” of the EVLA technique. Further randomized trials are also required to compare relative efficacy and complications of such minimally invasive endovenous ablative techniques (thermal and chemical) with surgery in the management of small saphenous varicosities.</p>
