               <italic>Family Law</italic> 42, November 2012, pp 1388–392</p>
            <p>The ‘Government Response to the Family Justice Review: A System with Children and Families at its Heart’ was presented to Parliament in February 2012. One of the recommendations in this document was for the removal of the requirement for an adoption panel to be responsible for considering the suitability of the child for adoption. In response, in September 2012, there were changes made to the function of adoption panels. The purpose of this article is to describe these changes in detail. The author starts by describing the position of adoption panels prior to September 2012 before explaining the various changes. It describes the role of the agency decision-maker, who plays a demanding and significant part of the new process, and the types of cases which are now prohibited from being referred to the adoption panel. Such panels will continue to fulfil a significant role, including considering whether to recommend the approval of prospective adopters, as well as recommending a match.</p>

            <p>
               <italic>Ethics and Social Welfare</italic> 6(4), December 2012, pp 333–350</p>
            <p>The research literature has previously described the ethical issues associated with international adoption from the viewpoint of adoptive parents, birth parents and the adopted child, and for both sending and receiving countries. The aim of this article is to explore how political variants of care ethics, combined with a narrative approach to practice, can be used as a conceptual framework for ethically informed practice with families formed via international adoption. The article begins with an overview of ethical dilemmas and issues of social justice in international adoption. It then describes the evolving narrative of international adoption and the ways in which its changing social construction raises new questions regarding the nature of ethically informed practice in this area of work. The remainder of the article explores how care ethics support an approach to practice that highlights the unique narratives of international adoptees and their adoptive parents as they make the transition to new family attachments and structures. This approach focuses on understanding the needs and experiences of families from their own points of view and within the social, economic, cultural and political contexts in which they have lived, linking a relationship-based, narrative approach to practice to important assumptions in many models of care ethics.</p>

            <p>Depending on the perspective of the teller, international adoption can be a story of politics, power and exploitation or a story about altruism, hope and family. Contemporary discourses surrounding adoption have a normative tone and thus have a significant influence on adoptive parents, structuring their actions and opening the door for scrutiny of individual adopters’ motives and ethics. This article is written by an internationally adoptive mother who is also a sociologist. It uses an auto-ethnographic approach to reflect on her experience of international adoption and use it as a vantage point from which to consider alternative perspectives on the ethical debates in the adoption literature. It demonstrates that much of this literature compels a particular point of view that does not mesh well with the daily experience of being an adoptive parent. The hope is that the insights gained from this experience can inform adoption practices and the development of more nuanced, less polarised perspectives on the ethics of international adoption. It is also hoped that they will inspire new avenues of research that explore the ways in which adoptive parents navigate their socio-political contexts in ways that are ethically sensitive and workable for them.</p>

            <p>‘Intercountry adoption and the Hague Convention: Article 22 and limitations upon safeguarding’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Child and Family Law Quarterly</italic> 24(4) 2012, pp 389–409</p>
            <p>Intercountry adoption is regulated under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993 for contracting states. This article emphasises the primary safeguarding aim of the Convention, and argues that this is compromised by powers of delegation implicit in the terms of the Convention and that the text of Article 22 is inconsistent with the Convention's stated safeguarding aims. The article looks at the prevalence of intercountry adoption and the need for and development of international regulation. It discusses the subsidiarity principle and states' responsibilities towards children and families, the Hague Convention and the delegation of powers, delegation and declarations under Article 22, and Article 22 and its place in the Hague Convention. Noting that the provisions of the Convention mean that individuals operating on a ‘for profit’ basis can be involved in intercountry adoption, the author concludes that the limitations of the Hague Convention must be recognised, and that contracting states should adopt a more ethical approach to it.</p>

            <p>‘Substance use among current and former foster youth: a systematic review’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Children and Youth Services Review</italic> 34(12), December 2012, pp 2337–344</p>
            <p>Substance use tends to escalate across adolescence, peaking in young adulthood. Many experiences that disproportionately affect youth placed in the foster care system (such as trauma and maltreatment, mental illness, and exposure to parental alcohol and drug use) are known to increase the likelihood of future substance use. The aim of this review was to summarise the published literature on alcohol and drug outcomes for current and former foster youth. Prevalence of use and diagnoses are presented separately, as well as a review of risk and protective factors. The findings show that the use of alcohol and marijuana appears to be similar among foster and non-foster youth. However, the use of hard drugs seems higher among foster youth than the general population. The findings also show that the prevalence of substance use disorders is markedly higher among youth in care, with more individuals reporting problems with drugs other than alcohol. Similar patterns are seen among individuals who have left foster care. Both lifetime and past year alcohol and substance use disorders are pronounced in this group. The limitations of the current research and suggestions for improvement in the measurement of these outcome variables are discussed.</p>

            <p>‘Congruence and incongruence in the perception of ‘family’ among foster parents, birth parents and their adolescent (foster) children’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Child &amp; Family Social Work</italic> 17(4), November 2012, pp 427–437</p>
            <p>Over recent decades, listening to children's voices and viewing children as competent actors have gathered momentum in research as well as in practice. Acknowledging children's perspectives requires sensitive listeners who are willing, deliberately and as realistically as possible, to reconstruct children's ways of seeing. In our study, based in Norway, we investigated the views of 22 adolescents in long-term foster care and 15 of their birth parents and 21 of their foster parents. Using Q methodology, we explored congruence and incongruence in the perception of ‘family’ among foster parents, birth parents and their adolescent (foster) children. We found three family perspectives among the adolescents. Within two of these, there seem to be more congruent understandings of the children's perspectives among the parent groups. We discuss some main implications in light of these findings. In Norway, as in many other countries, the policy of child welfare is that children first and foremost should grow up with their birth family. When out-of-home placements are necessary, a basic principle is that children should remain in contact with their birth family.</p>

            <p>‘Factors associated with foster parents' perceptions of agency effectiveness in preparing them for their role’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Journal of Public Child Welfare</italic> 6(5), November/December 2012, pp 678–695</p>
            <p>In the USA, family foster homes are a critical resource for children involved in the child welfare system, but high dropout rates among foster parents and a shortage of foster homes are a concern for most child welfare agencies. Drawing on survey data from foster parents in a mid-Atlantic state, this study examined child welfare agency initiatives that were associated with foster parents' perception of the effectiveness of the agency in preparing them for their role. The article describes the study methodology and presents the results, covering characteristics of and differences between exited foster parents and continuing foster parents, relationship between parents' characteristics and perception of effectiveness, and effectiveness of the agency in preparing continuing and exited foster parents for their role. The findings suggested that training was consistently the most significant factor contributing to perceptions of the effectiveness of agencies in preparing foster parents for their role, that receiving quality training was associated with foster parent retention, and that various forms of support also demonstrated significant effects. The authors discuss the findings and make recommendations for practice.</p>

            <p>
               <italic>Children and Youth Services Review</italic> 34(12), December 2012, pp 2416–2422</p>
            <p>Studies have linked early childhood neglect to the development of physical aggression. This article describes an evaluation of the effectiveness of a child-focused adaptation of the Incredible Years Child Training programme to reduce physical aggression in children in out-of-home care. The intervention was implemented at six volunteering community sites which provide out-of-home care to maltreated children in New York City. The participants were 94 children aged five to eight years with substantiated child neglect. Forty-nine children were randomly assigned to the Child Training and 45 to the Usual Care group. Ratings by foster parents and teachers of child self-control and physical aggression were gathered at baseline, post intervention, and at three-month follow-up. The findings showed that, contrary to expectations, children in the Child Training group did not experience better outcomes than those in the Usual Care group. Foster parent reports indicated that physical aggression decreased over time for both groups. Teacher ratings remained unchanged for both groups. Intervention gains in good self-control were found to be greater for boys than girls. The lessons to be learned from this negative trial are discussed, including the need to attend to gender, expand child training programmes and study site characteristics.</p>

            <p>‘Effects of a school readiness intervention for children in foster care on oppositional and aggressive behaviors in kindergarten’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Children and Youth Services Review</italic> 34(12), December 2012, pp 2361–2366</p>
            <p>Children in foster care are at particularly high risk for difficulties in school. These include not only academic failure but also oppositional and externalising behaviours. The Kids in Transition to School (KITS) Programme is a short-term intervention designed to improve school readiness by increasing literacy, social, and self-regulation skills in children before kindergarten entry. The aim of this study was to examine the longer-term effects of the KITS Programme on classroom oppositional and aggressive behaviours at the end of the kindergarten year. A total of 102 children were randomly assigned to the KITS intervention and 90 were randomly assigned to the foster care services as usual comparison group. At the end of the kindergarten year, teachers were asked to report on the children's oppositional and aggressive behaviours in the classroom. The findings showed that children who had received the intervention had significantly lower levels of oppositional and aggressive behaviours. These findings suggest that an intervention designed to increase school readiness in children in foster care can have positive effects on kindergarten classroom behaviour.</p>

            <p>‘Care as regulated and care in the obdurate world of intimate relations: foster care divided?’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Ethics and Social Welfare</italic> 5(2), June 2011, pp 196–209</p>
            <p>This article first explores the current situation of care as a formal paradigm of a highly regulatory approach to being looked after in a foster care setting. It then considers care and its expression within the interdependencies and everyday moral ‘workings out’ between people in caring relationships. The authors suggests that these relationships are informed partly by exterior regulation, but also emerge predominantly from care as a social process and daily human activity in which the self exists through and with others. Using data from a study of 10 foster families supported by local authorities or independent agencies in Wales, the article also explores the meaning of care in what is often a nebulous mix of paid and unpaid fostering. The moral fabric of the foster family is discussed in regard to three areas of everyday domestic life that are often taken for granted and rarely researched: the symbolism of food; issues of the body; and aspects of touch. The authors conclude with a brief recap of foster care as a relational, constitutive and contextual discipline as opposed to care as professional and regulatory.</p>

            <p>‘Attachment theory and change processes in foster care’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Children and Youth Services Review</italic> 34(11), November 2012, pp 2208–2219</p>
            <p>The aim of this study was to explore attachment theory as a foundation for contemporary foster care practice and policy. It focused on how caregiving contexts and the nature of their change selects certain characteristics and behaviours as relevant in explaining a child's risk of placement change in, or exit from, foster care. Data on a population of 3448 foster children in a major urban area in Ontario over a 21-year period were used to test arguments that children's strategies for dealing with change can be both resistant and adaptive, and that self-perpetuating patterns of attachment can contribute to increasing rates of change in children's lives. Results strongly support attachment theory as a transactional theory of change. Placement change not only influences the hazard of exit in the manner predicted but also engenders a ‘liability of change’, with early change influencing the likelihood of future change independent of contextual and child characteristics. From the perspective of this inquiry, future research that omits information on the history and timing of significant changes in children's lives will be limited in its capacity to explain their current circumstances.</p>

            <p>‘Children in care: a long-term follow-up of criminality and mortality’</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Children and Youth Services Review</italic> 34(9), September 2012, pp 1947–1955</p>
            <p>It is often suggested that most children in care end up in prison later in life, but a 25-year follow-up study questions this claim. While it is true that in the UK 30% of males and 40% of females entering prison custody have been in care, it is also the case that only a small proportion of all care leavers end up in prison. This seeming paradox arises because each year in England, about 25,000 children leave care, and around 2000 young people enter prison custody. Thus, there is a system flow whereby a large number of leavers feeds into a much smaller service that accepts its failures: so although a sizeable proportion of entrants to the latter have been in care, the reverse is not true: only a small proportion of care leavers end up in prison.</p>
            <p>The follow-up study of 450 children admitted to care in 1980 shows that while 52% of boys and 14% of girls were convicted of an offence over the subsequent 25 years, only 20% of the males and nought % of the females could be defined as criminally recidivist in terms of the frequency and gravity of their crimes. The conviction rate for children who were in care because of offending and difficult behaviour was much higher (67% for boys and 13% for girls) than for children who were admitted due to abuse and neglect (10% and 11% respectively) or following family breakdown (24% and 7% respectively). These results mirror Department for Education (DfE) statistics for England that show that only one per cent of care leavers go direct to prison and that only three per cent of 16-year-olds in care at any one time are in prison three years later. Pejorative statements about the criminality of children in care exaggerate the risks of offending posed by care leavers. Thus, they are detrimental to young people, especially young women, who will have been affected by earlier social and psychological disadvantages and who struggle with employment, accommodation and social relationships as they move to independence. These adaptations seem especially hard for young men and may possibly explain the higher than expected mortality rate revealed by the study.</p>
