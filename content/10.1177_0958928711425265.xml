<abstract>
<p>The increasing number of recipients of disability and long-term sickness benefits has resulted in the introduction of specific employability programmes in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. In the UK Pathways to Work involved enabling and support measures for benefit recipients with long-term health conditions. In Denmark ‘flex-jobs’ are an integral occupational health intervention for both employed and unemployed people with reduced working capacity. Through a comparative analysis primarily based on stakeholder interviews in both countries, this paper argues that the concept of an inclusive labour market strategy is crucial to assisting these groups into work, underpinned by governance and a politics of representation. In Denmark both the role of the social partners and subsidized employment are significant. In the UK governance has been constrained and insufficient attention has been paid to income security. Comparing these two models highlights policy learning for the UK from the successes of and challenges to the Danish model.</p>

<title>Activation and the ‘inclusive’ labour market</title>
<p>In the comparative research on active labour market policies (ALMPs) and ‘workfare’ regimes there is a debate emerging regarding the role of enabling and inclusive labour market policy, emphasizing the importance of support services and universal benefits in assisting people into work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425265">Dingeldey, 2007</xref>). Dingeldey suggests that universal welfare states (such as Denmark) invest in vocational training and provide complex and extended services to all citizens, whereas liberal welfare states (such as the UK) focus on job search and the provision of financial incentives such as ‘in-work benefits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928711425265">2007</xref>: 827). Dingeldey argues that within each welfare regime there are two strategies that are not mutually exclusive: one relates to workfare and the deployment of stricter conditions on access to benefits. The second is the ‘enabling’ strategies and services that facilitate labour market participation in an inclusive way. These include training programmes and job placement, childcare, welfare rights and other social and health services linked to activation programmes. ALMPs, or ‘activation’, have transformed the function of social security as compensation to making benefit receipt conditional on demonstration of active job search and willingness to improve employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928711425265">Daguerre with Etherington, 2009</xref>) or face loss of benefit. These include ‘workfarist’ or ‘work first’ initiatives where the emphasis is on paid work rather than on training or on developing people’s skills.</p>
<p>We intend in this paper to contribute to the debate concerning an ‘inclusive labour market’ through a comparative study of activation programmes for people on disability and long-term sickness benefits in the UK and Denmark. The number of people claiming such benefits has risen considerably across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and employment rates for those with a disability average just over half of those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928711425265">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2009</xref>: 11, 13). In the UK about 7 percent of the working-age population is in receipt of disability benefits and in Denmark this is just under 8 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0958928711425265">Whitehead et al., 2009</xref>: 8). In response, in recent years OECD countries have integrated employability programmes for disabled people into their ALMPs. The selection of the UK and Denmark as comparators for this study rests in part in the growing similarities in the policy discourses around activation. Since 2001 Denmark’s Liberal–Conservative coalition government has pursued an increasingly work first strategy, tightening benefit conditionality, including for people with long-term health conditions and disabilities. The Danish Government has increasingly developed a work first approach to activation, including a more intensive work-focused counselling regime under ‘More in Work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928711425265">Danish Government, 2002</xref>) and the introduction of ‘Ability to Work’ assessments. At the same time, in contrast to the UK, it has retained key elements of its welfare state, including comprehensive social benefits which are seen as crucial in retaining one of the lowest child poverty rates in the European Union (EU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928711425265">Bradshaw, 2006</xref>), maintaining substantial investments in its active labour market programmes and a key role for the social partners in employment policy. Both the EU and the OECD have promoted policy learning from Denmark in the area of activation.</p>
<p>In the UK following the previous New Labour government’s welfare reforms, the current Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government is also considerably tightening the rules around eligibility to disability and long-term sickness benefits, and through its unified ‘Work Programme’ introduced in 2011 has outsourced the majority of the activation programmes to the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The shift towards a more intense workfare approach is reflected by the decision to abolish the City Strategy – the devolved governance and partnerships structures established by Labour to coordinate ALMPs for people on disability and long-term sickness benefits. These have been replaced by employer-led Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and there is a question as to how far these will play a key role in developing ALMPs within local labour markets. At the same time local social and welfare services as well as neighbourhood renewal funding are facing major cuts that are likely to have an adverse impact on programmes that support the employability of disadvantaged groups.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<p>The principal research questions we wish to address are:</p>
<list id="list1-0958928711425265" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How far does the generalized shift towards stricter workfare regimes in the UK and Denmark restrict the space for an inclusive labour market for people on disability and long-term sickness benefits?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In what ways do modes of governance and interest representation influence and shape labour market inclusion and exclusion for people on disability and long-term sickness benefits?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does examination of the Danish case provide policy learning for Britain?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This paper is based upon and supplements previous research by the authors funded by the British Academy and the Economic and Social Research Council. To address the research aims, objectives and questions the methodology involved two main elements.</p>
<p>First, we undertook a scoping exercise, consisting of a desk-based review of relevant literature and other documentary sources, including access to descriptive statistics obtained through the UK Department of Work and Pensions and the Danish National Statistics Office.</p>
<p>The second stage involved selection of two case study Jobcentres in the UK and two in Denmark. Face-to-face, semi-structured in-depth elite interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of identified ‘stakeholders’ in the delivery of ALMPs including frontline social workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928711425265">1</xref></sup> and Jobcentre employment counsellors, as well as trade unions, academic researchers and government officials. For the UK case study, document analysis was undertaken, along with semi-structured face-to-face interviews with policy actors at national and local levels of Jobcentre Plus, health authority employees involved with disability employment programmes, representatives from the Trades Union Congress (TUC), NGO welfare rights advisers and a mental health campaigning organization. In this phase of the research the focus of the interviews was to obtain the perspectives and views of stakeholders about the effectiveness of various programme interventions. Furthermore, their purpose was to specifically explore the role of governance arrangements, including the horizontal and vertical relationships between labour market actors. The interview data was manually coded and analysed according to the thematic framework set out below.</p>

<title>Structure of paper</title>
<p>The next section outlines a comparative analytical framework for comparing and contrasting the policies and programmes, followed by an analysis of the findings of our research. The paper concludes by assessing the lessons that can be drawn from the findings. We argue that the concept of an inclusive labour market strategy is crucial to our understanding of ‘what works’ in assisting disadvantaged groups into the labour market and this is underpinned by aspects of governance and a politics of representation.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0958928711425265">
<title>Conceptual and theoretical framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425265">Esping-Andersen (1990)</xref> defined a regime as a set of institutional arrangements that guide social policy and expenditure allocations, highlighting key functions of welfare in relation to the labour market, pensions, sickness and unemployment benefits, and labour market policies. Welfare states can be ‘clustered’ in relation to both coverage (degree of intervention) and nature of policy mixes such as social rights and degree of distribution. Within this typology Denmark is characterized as social democratic with respect to comprehensive levels of coverage in terms of welfare and social services expenditure. The UK is characterized as a liberal or residual regime with less emphasis on redistribution, social benefits subject to means testing and a greater role for the market in the provision of services.</p>
<p>A limitation of regime theory is that it makes assumptions about the territorial dimensions of state intervention. In this respect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop’s (2002)</xref> work provides useful insights on a number of accounts: first, a perspective on the wider political economy of globalization, the dominant discourse and strategy of neo-liberalism and the accompanying re-orientation from welfare to workfare; second, changes in welfare regimes involve a shift from a Keynesian Welfare State (KWS) to a Schumpeterian Workfare State (SWS) as a way of resolving the crisis of Keynesianism and the post-war settlement on redistribution. The SWS promotes structural and economic competitiveness through supply-side policies. It is workfarist in that it subordinates social policy to labour market flexibility and its political economic logic is to incorporate labour into an increasingly commodified labour market. Third, the ‘destatization’ of a series of former state domains and their transfer to civil society organizations redefines the state–civil society relationship ‘through the formation of governance-beyond-the-state’, involving two key aspects of restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928711425265">Swyngedouw, 2005</xref>: 1998). The first is the externalization process comprising privatization, contracting-out and deregulation – increasing numbers of ‘actors’ and public private partnerships become involved with policy delivery (for example the creation of network governance in various policy fields).</p>
<p>The second aspect is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop (2002)</xref> terms ‘rescaling’: the national scale is no longer the sole power container and governance and policy formation is shifted upwards, outwards and downwards. The devolution to localities is important because welfare to work policies are designed in closer proximity to their sites of implementation, taking account of local labour market conditions and inherited institutional and governance structures and relations. Such scalar shifts often involve a reordering of relations between different levels and responsibilities for socio-economic governance, but in some contexts this can increase the centralization and control functions of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This process of state restructuring redefines the state–civil society relationship – services are delivered and targeted to specific population groups and ‘activation measures can be understood as opening up more of the person to governmental power, requiring them to collaborate in the development of new subjective orientations to the worlds of work and welfare’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928711425265">Newman, 2007</xref>: 366). The streamlining of the delivery of welfare to work through ‘one-stop shops’ (Jobcentres) – seen in both Denmark and the UK – is a way of efficiently categorizing and designing systems in order to adapt unemployed people to a changing labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425265">Caswell et al., 2010</xref>). This categorization embodies moral and ideological messages in terms of ‘rights’, ‘responsibilities’ and benefit ‘dependency’ and more recently in relation to a ‘culture of worklessness’ (in the UK). In this respect ‘technologies of power’ have been deployed with respect to conditionality of access to benefits, combined with the system of processing welfare claimants into the labour market.</p>
<p>Drawing on these perspectives we outline and explore four key elements of an inclusive labour market policy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928711425265">Andersen and Etherington, 2005</xref>). These are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928711425265">Table 1</xref>. The first relates to ALMPs that provide services that help disabled people access the labour market (job search, subsidized employment, training). The second relates to income security and financial incentives such as in-work benefits to ‘make work pay’. The third element encompasses welfare support and services that address health and childcare needs. The fourth element involves governance and social partners that empower sick or disabled benefit recipients to negotiate the welfare to work system and how they represent recipients’ voices and needs within different policy and governance structures.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s in Britain the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) was established for people claiming long-term Incapacity Benefit (IB) as part of the suite of New Labour activation measures. It was a voluntary programme that involved health and employment counselling and signposting to training and job broker services. As NDDP reached a relatively small target group, the government established the Pathways to Work model in 2003, concentrated mainly in the post-industrial regions. This was extended in 2006, with national coverage from 2008. The Pathways programme involved a step-change in activation programmes by offering a suite of enabling and support measures including access to personal adviser support, condition management for long-term health conditions and financial assistance to move into work. Initially targeted at claimants of the new Employment and Support Allowance (which replaced IB), the Labour government’s intention was to extend Pathways to all existing IB recipients. The National Audit Office (NAO) has highlighted that 15 percent of participants in the Pathways programme moved into employment, but this was often not sustained beyond the period during which outcome payments were made to providers. There is no doubt that Pathways has had some positive impact but this is limited in terms of increased employment rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711425265">National Audit Office, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In Denmark the flex-jobs scheme is integral to an occupational health intervention model for employed and unemployed people whose working capacity is reduced by at least 50 percent, and sickness benefits are an important pathway to flex-jobs. Within 8 weeks of sick leave the local authority verifies eligibility to sickness benefits and sets in motion appropriate measures and instruments that will facilitate a speedy return to work. These include counselling, work capacity assessment, vocational rehabilitation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928711425265">2</xref></sup> job training and phased return to work. Intervention measures are undertaken in liaison with relevant agencies and trade unions. If ordinary work is not possible, then a subsidized flex-job under special conditions is offered to benefit recipients who have been assessed as having at least 50 percent reduced capacity to work. The flex-job itself involves specific work tasks, in-work support and reduced working hours. Local authorities also operate a sheltered employment scheme for people with more severe disabilities, but flex-jobs continues to be the main activation programme for disabled people, combined with other support services such as personal assistance, career counselling and access to training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425265">Det Centrale Handicapråd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928711425265">Høglund et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The key difference between employability programmes for disabled people in Denmark and the UK relates to the fact that the flex-jobs scheme is part of a comprehensive programme involving preventative measures to ensure that people who are in salaried employment do not become ‘economically inactive’ due to their long-term health condition. Second, ensuring that those who do become ‘inactive’ can be given a work placement to enhance their employability and maintain a connection to the labour market. The other difference is the extent and nature of subsidy. In Denmark this is focused around a relatively generous wage subsidy paid by the local authority of a half to two-thirds of the salary to a maximum 286,075 DKK per annum (about 38,000 Euro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928711425265">Det Centrale Handicapråd, 2009</xref>: 17, 24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928711425265">3</xref></sup> Those eligible for flex-jobs but who are waiting to join the scheme receive an unemployment allowance which is equivalent to unemployment insurance, averaging about 80–90 percent of the highest rate of daily social benefits. In the UK the Return to Work Credit (RTWC) is an earnings supplement for disabled people entering work via Pathways that lasts for 12 months. Flex-jobs constitute about 70 percent of activation programmes for disabled people, whereas in the UK the RTWC has only been taken up by between 5 and 13 percent of Pathways participants. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928711425265">Table 3</xref> shows, there has been a significant increase in the number of people on flex-jobs as well as those awaiting a flex-job, as the programme has been unable to meet demand. About 50 percent were unemployed due to their health condition and vulnerable to becoming detached from the labour market before they entered the flex-job programme, whilst the remainder had an (ordinary) employment contract.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425265">Greve (2008</xref>: 143) reports that after 1 month nearly 28 percent of people in flex-jobs move into permanent employment, although this tails off to 16 percent after 12 months. Although there is evidence of ‘deadweight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928711425265">Gupta and Larsen, 2008</xref>), other evaluations suggest that ‘the great majority of flex-jobbers would not have been in employment without the schemes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425265">Bengtsson, 2009</xref>: 4). Further, in Denmark the Rehabilitation Programmes run by the Jobcentres had a positive direct effect in assisting people into the open labour market:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the flex-jobs scheme is not without its problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425265">see Center for Alternativ Samfundsanalyse, 2009</xref>). One is the ‘stigmatizing’ effect of being on a special programme ‘because they are situated between the ordinary labour market and the social system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928711425265">Høgelund and Greve Pedersen, 2002</xref>: 22). Second, social rights are different to those in the ordinary labour market in terms of qualifying for unemployment benefits. Jobcentre staff interviewed acknowledged that these issues were a problem for some participants in activation programmes, particularly in municipal-run schemes. Interviews with Jobcentre staff suggested that they appeared to be committed to ensuring quality; however, criticisms have been made of the poor quality of schemes in some of the public sector workplaces (interviews with Danish academics and trade unions; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425265">Center for Alternativ Samfundsanalyse, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The trade unions have expressed their concerns regarding the resources and methods used in activation and the pressure placed on Jobcentres to meet performance targets, leading to variable quality of schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425265">Landsorganisation, 2009</xref>). The public sector trade unions are responding pro-actively and have formulated an action plan proposing major revisions to agreements in relation to implementing activation programmes (interviews with senior trade union officials).</p>
<p>Social security and activation reforms in the UK under both New Labour and the current governments have involved an increase in means testing and erosion of the role of insurance-based benefits. In the UK the Working Tax Credit is used to supplement low-paid jobs and, as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711425265">NAO (2010)</xref> suggests, many disabled people are moved into such work, utilizing the Disabled Persons Tax Credit in addition to the National Minimum Wage. The current government’s policy to move people from more generous disability benefits to unemployment benefits is driven by the desire to cut the welfare bill. By contrast, in Denmark welfare dependency has not historically been an overt policy driver for Danish labour market policy, apart from for young unemployed people and immigrants where ceilings have been imposed on social benefits and tighter conditions on eligibility. In-work benefits have been introduced, such as an employment deduction in 2004 and a transferable tax allowance for couples. However, ALMPs have been combined with other universal welfare policies in recognition of the inter-dependencies between the two. In Denmark income distribution plays a key role and all income transfers are indexed to wages (that is, to median real income), which is central to Denmark possessing the lowest poverty rates within the EU (Andersen and Pedersen, 2008: 12).</p>

<sec id="section7-0958928711425265">
<title>Governance and social partners</title>
<p>The 1994 Danish activation reforms were accompanied by an enhanced role for the social partners in the management of labour market policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928711425265">Etherington, 2008</xref>). Public sector reforms, beginning in 2007, considerably reduced the number of local authorities and replaced county councils with four regional councils. The ‘municipalization of employment policy’ (2007–10) retained the role of the social partners in the creation of Local Employment Committees (Lokal Beskaeftelses Rad (LBR)), whose role is to advise and monitor Jobcentre performance, establish local priorities and pilot or develop projects in accordance with these priorities. A key feature of the Danish model is the role of the social partners in both strategic policy making and delivery through the local regional and national employment committees. This provides a link between benefit recipients and trade union officials engaged with activation policy.</p>
<p>The devolution of Danish labour market policies to the local level represents significant rescaling, producing institutional and territorial changes in the policy implementation of activation programmes. The Local Employment Committee has as its central objective to use its capacities and resources to assist those most disadvantaged in the labour market: ‘Work around the unemployed young people and people with health problems are examples where the LBR does provide a direction where it is required and can influence significantly through its input into the employment plan where we set out our priorities’ (Jobcentre Manager).</p>
<p>Although in relative terms the reforms are still in their infancy, they have met with a mixed response from stakeholders. The Danish Local Government Association (employer association for local government) commented that the reforms presented local authorities and politicians with opportunities (as well as challenges) to engage and bring ALMPs within the political process in a way that had not happened before. This may be because the previous formal structures over-played the actual role of the social partners. A number of Local Employer Council (LEC) and trade union interviewees commented that the new structure in fact reduces power away from the social partners by altering their role. However, one senior trade union official commented that it potentially brought the trade unions closer in terms of involvement with labour market policy than under the previous regional labour market councils. The latter viewpoint is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928711425265">Damgaard and Torfing (2010)</xref> and was highlighted by a senior Jobcentre officer, who stated that all of their programmes involved consultation with the trade unions so that unemployed people on work placements would be protected. It is possible that the role of the social partners is in practice larger than the advisory position they are assigned in the formal structures.</p>
<p>However, some stakeholders – including LEC representatives and trade unionists – found that the reforms involved greater central control and threats to the ‘democratic’ process due to it being ‘centralized and target driven’. As one LEC representative stated: ‘We are increasingly operating around nationally-determined rules and regulations and this can constrain our ability to innovate when it is necessary.’ This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop’s (2002)</xref> suggestion that rescaling does not necessarily result in devolution of power. These tensions and constraints tend to be reinforced by what one stakeholder termed the ‘obsession’ by the Government to enforce contracting-out, which was considered to undermine the capacities of the LECs to influence local ALMPs. Such contracts are negotiated directly between the central employment services and providers and did not require any input from the LECs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928711425265">Bredgaard and Larsen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although contracting-out provides challenges for Jobcentre provision, the LECs do provide scope for intervening at the local Jobcentre level to prioritize resources for disadvantaged groups. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928711425265">Caswell et al. (2010</xref>: 398) highlight, Danish Jobcentres use categorization tools (match-categories) to assess individuals’ distance from the labour market, but such administrative processes can constrain the flexibility of personal advisers at the frontline. However, in our interviews with Jobcentres we found that the action plans negotiated between clients and advisers provided scope to meet individual requirements and this was particularly prevalent in the flex-jobs scheme. Municipalization devolved the delivery of employment services to local authority-run Jobcentres and was designed to activate all groups as quickly as possible by providing ‘one-stop shops’ for health, social support and job counselling. Jobcentre Advisers also prepare an education plan with a potential of 6 weeks of relevant vocational or practical workplace training. In other words as Danish local authorities provide social and certain health services, this is of a particular advantage for Jobcentres to coordinate relevant provision in support of activating people on disability and long-term sickness benefits.</p>
<p>In the UK the previous Labour government’s City Strategy Pathfinder (CSP) pilot was established in 2006 by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with the primary aims of tackling worklessness in the most disadvantaged areas and raising employment rates for the most disadvantaged groups, the majority claiming IB. The City Strategy Pathfinder was seen as a vehicle to promote an element of devolved responsibility to local partnerships in delivering Pathways and was thus seen as a bottom-up process involving potential rescaling. Partnerships and consortia were formed by local employment services along with local authorities, and the private, voluntary and community sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425265">Green and Orton, 2010</xref>). However, recent evaluation of the City Strategy found that the link with and involvement of employers is often tenuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928711425265">Green and Orton, 2010</xref>) and this is supported by our findings. As one UK employer stakeholder commented: ‘the current system is so complex that many of our members are put off from getting involved’.</p>
<p>In contrast to Denmark, in the UK there is no formalized regulated framework for stakeholder and social partner engagement in labour market policy and trade unions were rarely invited as representatives on the boards of the CSPs. As one senior TUC Officer stated: ‘we have for many years pointed out to the [Labour] government that we are out of step with the rest of Europe but still they do not listen and we are rarely consulted about the development of the New Deal’ (cf. Green and Orton, 2009). The key voice for unemployed people on sickness benefits is the NGOs, which provide support and enabling services and in many instances negotiate or advocate on their behalf with employment and health agencies. In their evaluation of the CSPs, Green and Orton (2009: 621) found that ‘the views of workless people are relayed by voluntary groups … but this is not systematic and relies on a representation of views by proxy rather than the individuals having their own capability of voice’. Furthermore, as one Mental Health worker interviewed commented, ‘the voluntary sector is seen as important as providers, but has considerable challenges in terms of lack of resources’. In many respects their capacities to engage with the complex and numerous forums and committees that make up the partnerships are severely limited. The scope for the CSPs to respond to local conditions appears to be further constrained by the centralized nature of labour market policy, compounded by the shift towards large-scale contractors (begun under Labour and continued by the current government) which may undermine the influence of local partnerships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928711425265">National Audit Office, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, in the UK it is important not to underestimate the capacities of the organizations that lobby on behalf of disadvantaged groups in the labour market. One example is the collaboration between the NHS, employment services and NGOs with respect to the User Employment Service for people with mental health conditions that was implemented in our case study Jobcentre Plus districts. Furthermore, in recent years the TUC has been more pro-active at the national level in coordinating a coalition of interests whereby disability rights organizations and the anti-poverty network have mobilized to formulate responses to changes in welfare reforms (interview with Senior TUC Officer). As in Denmark, we found in our UK interviews that the commitment of frontline policy actors was important in both signposting clients to support services and in their reluctance to use sanctions that might cause clients to exit the systems of support.</p>

<title>Encroaching workfare, enabling policies and the inclusive labour market</title>
<p>Increasing workfare in both the UK and Denmark has been encroaching upon policies that have the potential to facilitate a more inclusive labour market. However, in Denmark this has so far not restricted the space for the facilitation of an inclusive labour market for people on long-term sickness benefits. First, in Denmark the retention of benefit levels indexed to average earnings reduces the movement of disadvantaged groups into poverty. Second, Danish ALMPs provide services (such as job search, subsidized employment, training) that help disabled people to access the labour market. Furthermore, enabling welfare services address both healthcare and childcare needs. Although in the UK reforms under Labour went some way to providing such enabling services, they have not gone far enough, particularly in relation to addressing wider barriers to work such as access to suitable, affordable childcare. Childcare costs are often higher for disabled parents, who may take longer to get to and from work and may have problems transporting their children to childcare or school that are not recognized within the current funding system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711425265">Child Poverty Action Group, 2006</xref>: 19). One study of Pathways stated that ‘customers with dependent children were seen to be experiencing insurmountable difficulties in accessing suitable childcare’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928711425265">Dixon and Warrener, 2008</xref>: 48). By contrast, the enabling capacity of the Danish welfare state is augmented by day-care which is publicly funded and provided by local authorities and which has been fundamental to accessing employment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928711425265">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928711425265">3</xref>).</p>
<p>The welfare model for disabled people introduced by the previous Labour Government had a strong inclusive element (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928711425265">Department for Work and Pensions, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928711425265">Gregg, 2008</xref>), but at the same time the increased focus on compliance and assumed dependency tends to act against these principles. In the UK one in three disabled adults of working age is a parent, and about a quarter of children living in poverty have a disabled parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928711425265">Child Poverty Action Group, 2006</xref>: 5). Both welfare rights and health workers identified poverty as one of the main barriers to overcome in gaining access to employment: ‘many people are faced with financial hardships and debt which can be debilitating when trying to live on a level of benefits which are clearly inadequate’ (UK Welfare Rights Worker). The most genuinely socially inclusive elements of the Danish model are the retention of relatively generous social benefits and universal childcare provision, because they are effective in facilitating access to employment.</p>
<p>The consistently high levels of expenditure for activation measures even by the Danish Liberal–Conservative government more committed to the market explains the comparatively higher levels of performance and outcomes from the activation programmes. Denmark has retained its level of expenditure on employability programmes, constituting 1.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 0.3 percent for the UK, one of the lowest of all EU countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928711425265">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>: 128). One Danish trade union official suggested: ‘The money that you pay for active labour market policies is not an expenditure, it’s an investment.’ This is supported by the OECD, which states that, ‘an interesting feature of Denmark’s financing of labour market policies is that the national budget for ALMPs is adjusted according to the government’s official unemployment forecasts. Hence, during recessions, sufficient funding is available to support the large number of unemployed persons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928711425265">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>: 129).</p>
<p>The key question is how far this is likely to continue, as it was acknowledged by Local Government Association interviewees that the reforms have placed significant pressures and demands upon local authority Jobcentres, which has resulted in a reduction in the quality of employment programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928711425265">Center for Alternativ Samfundsanalyse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928711425265">Landsorganisation, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Recognizing the role of interest representation and the inclusive labour market</title>
<p>State rescaling in terms of shifts towards regionalization and localization in both countries represent ‘variegated’ attempts to improve the effectiveness of policy and governance arrangements in the area of employment, because institutions and actors are mobilized to intervene and plan at the spatial scale of local labour markets and economies. The essential difference between the Danish and British approaches is the importance in Denmark of flex-jobs as subsidized work placements in both the public and private sectors, whereas in the UK Pathways tends to engage only private employers.</p>
<p>This is related to the fact that in the UK the governance arrangements do not allow for the involvement of key actors such as employers and trade unions; this is particularly problematic when combined with policy interventions at different spatial levels. By contrast, the Danish LECs as regulated corporatism provide some space for including the interests of deprived groups within the adaption of centrally determined programmes. In terms of partnerships and representation the role of the trade unions as social partners is prescribed through the regulated corporatist bodies of the LECs and there is already evidence that they are influencing local agendas and provide at the very least important ‘watchdogs’ with respect to ensuring that weaker groups in society are not adversely affected by the welfare to work schemes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928711425265">Walker and Sankey, 2008</xref>). For example both the Regional Employment Council and LEC have an important role in ensuring that strategic performance and target-setting for flex-jobs and rehabilitation programmes are adhered to. However, stakeholders interviewed had different perspectives, with some suggesting that the new institutional arrangements present quite significant changes to the balance of forces between labour and the state and a significant dilution of traditional corporatist arrangements (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928711425265">Jørgensen, 2009</xref>). This accords with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop’s (2002)</xref> suggestion that such scalar shifts in governance may also lead to increased state centralization.</p>
<p>In terms of governance arrangements in the UK, the Coalition Government’s proposals for a unified Work Programme and increasing contractualism with the private and third sectors have inherent shortcomings due to the perverse incentives of outcome-based funding which can constrain innovation and flexibility. It also has obvious implications for the extent to which local partnerships and social actors that are reflective of such ‘destatization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928711425265">Swyngedouw, 2005</xref>) can shape and influence their implementation at the sub-national level. However, the renewed policy focus on reducing the numbers of people on disability and long-term sickness benefits, combined with expenditure cuts, will possibly galvanize representation and contestation by NGO coalitions at the national level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0958928711425265">
<title>Denmark as a model for policy learning?</title>
<p>In Denmark income security is ensured through social benefits at a sustainable level and this is a key aspect of activation strategies for an inclusive labour market that is missing from the UK Government’s proposed reforms. There are inherent contradictions in its proposals for reducing the scope for enabling programmes through public expenditure cuts and benefit reductions and a further shift towards workfare. In comparison, the Danish Conservative–Liberal government has not moved in this direction for people on long-term sickness benefits. The UK Government proposes to continue Labour’s plans to reassess all existing IB recipients for its replacement Employment and Support Allowance; however, the Danish experience suggests that reassessing IB claimants’ work readiness in a depressed job market is unlikely to result in higher employment outcomes for such disadvantaged groups unless the employment services engage more proactively with employers. The intensification of workfare also risks exacerbating the ‘revolving door’ of short-term work followed by return to benefits, which can lead to increased social security expenditure in the longer-term.</p>
<p>The comparative success of the Danish model is that it challenges the dichotomy of active/passive labour market policies. Danish services for disabled people are based on integration, retention and up-skilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928711425265">Greve, 2008</xref>: 124), although it is important to highlight that this is under threat by the Liberal government in its increasing policy orientation towards work first strategies. Workfare has been present to some extent in Danish activation since the 1990s, but it has become more explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928711425265">Rosdahl and Weise, 2001</xref>) in the form of ‘workfare light’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928711425265">Goul Anderson and Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 15). However, this has not so far significantly undermined the universalist principles of the Danish welfare state, particularly in relation to disabled people. Whereas in Denmark the strategy since the late 1990s has been to limit the number of disability pensioners and to both increase the number of disabled people in employment and the number of enterprises employing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928711425265">Bengtsson, 2009</xref>: 6), in the UK the focus is on reducing the number of benefit recipients. There are a number of elements that this study suggests are crucial to achieving a more inclusive labour market strategy in the UK.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In our overall conclusion we wish to emphasize that there is little evidence that ALMPs create new jobs for unemployed people in the longer-term. In the context of current economic challenges and the recession, both the Danish and UK systems are under pressure in terms of enabling an inclusive labour market. In both countries activation and the shift towards workfare has failed to address the lack of demand-side approaches. Nevertheless modes of governance and representation combined with the requisite social and welfare services shape labour market inclusion and exclusion for people on long-term sickness benefits. As a recent think-tank report highlights ‘these elements of policy can be found in the UK today, but they have been relatively under-resourced (we spend too little on the New Deal and Jobcentre Plus) and have never been brought together in a coherent narrative, partly because the collective voice elements of the model are so unpalatable to British employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928711425265">Progressive Economics Panel, 2010</xref>: 6). The example of ALMPs for disabled people highlights that welfare regimes and industrial relations are interlinked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928711425265">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928711425265">Trampusch, 2006</xref>). In an increasingly competitive market in activation in both countries, providers will need to effectively engage with employers, but this needs to be enabled by the institutional set-up.</p>
<p>In Denmark subsidized employment schemes for disabled people ensure that both public and private sector employers engage directly with the Jobcentre services. This destatization redefines the state–civil society relationship, but in a different way to the UK model. In the Danish corporatist mode of governance consultation processes that facilitate an inclusive labour market are institutionalized, but this is not the case in the UK liberal market economy. In both countries there has been some element of ‘rescaling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928711425265">Jessop, 2002</xref>) towards local labour market conditions. However, these scalar shifts have resulted in differential re-ordering in the two countries. In the UK City Strategy Pathfinders the opportunity for the bottom-up involvement of actors was constrained by centralist policymaking and by lack of employer and trade union engagement. The multi-scalar nature of such governance in Denmark is less complex and does not involve the coordination problems seemingly inherent in the sub-national architecture in the UK. The new provider model in the UK seems to involve greater centralization and the delivery of ALMPs will potentially by-pass LEPs in terms of control or influence.</p>
<p>The involvement of social partners in both Danish social security and labour market policy has a long history. Drawing on other literature on policy learning (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928711425265">Lendvai and Stubbs, 2007</xref>), we do not infer that it is possible to uncritically transfer or translate the Danish model to the UK context. Nevertheless, it can still provide guiding principles on which to base the policies that enable sick or disabled people (and other disadvantaged groups) to access the labour market. In the final conclusion, it is important to reflect upon the conditions for a sustainable politics of inclusion. The first point to emphasize is the broader range of social reproduction issues which form the conditions for labour market integration and which guarantee health and well-being. Furthermore, the way a policy field is structured can give more or less place to the articulation of the needs and aspirations of disadvantaged groups. Therefore power and representation need to be centre-stage – in the longer term this is unthinkable without more fundamental changes in the power balance between actors in favour of the disadvantaged through representation in the governance structures.</p>
