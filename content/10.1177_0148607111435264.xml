<p><italic>Background</italic>: Patients with head and neck cancer frequently require gastrostomy feeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy with push-type gastrostomy tubes using a rupture-free balloon (RFB) catheter under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopic guidance in patients with head and neck cancer with swallowing disturbance or trismus. <italic>Methods</italic>: Percutaneous CT and fluoroscopic gastrostomy placement of push-type gastrostomy tubes using a RFB catheter was performed in consecutive patients with head and neck cancer between April 2007 and July 2010. The technical success, procedure duration, and major or minor complications were evaluated. <italic>Results</italic>: Twenty-one patients (14 men, 7 women; age range, 55-78 years; mean age, 69.3 years) underwent gastrostomy tube placement. The tumor location was the pharynx (n = 8), oral cavity (n = 7), and gingiva (n = 6). Gastrostomy was performed in 15 patients during treatment and 6 patients after treatment. Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy was technically successful in all patients. The median procedure time was 35 ± 19 (interquartile range) minutes (range, 25–75). The average follow-up time interval was 221 days (range, 10–920 days). No major complications related to the procedure were encountered. No tubes failed because of blockage, and neither tube dislodgement nor intraperitoneal leakage occurred during the follow-up periods. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Percutaneous CT and fluoroscopic-guided gastrostomy with push-type tubes using a RFB catheter is a relatively safe and effective means of gastric feeding, with high success and low complication rates in patients with head and neck cancer in whom endoscopy was not feasible.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Enteral feeding is an essential factor to maintain good quality of life for patients with head and neck cancer who have a feeding disorder but in whom percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is not possible because of deformity of the pharynx and oral cavity or trismus in some cases. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement using a rupture-free balloon catheter without endoscopic assistance was introduced in this study. This new technique is relatively simple and minimally invasive compared with existing percutaneous radiological gastrostomy tube placement. We believe that it will be useful for nutrition support in these patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gastrostomy tubes are well tolerated for long-term nutrition supplementation, generally provide improved quality of life when compared with available alternatives, and limit disorders of intestinal motility by maintaining gastrointestinal tract function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111435264">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111435264">3</xref></sup> Gastrostomy tubes can be placed surgically, endoscopically, and fluoroscopically; a review of the literature supports radiologic and endoscopic techniques as superior to surgery, requiring less sedation and less invasive placement techniques, having lower complication rates, and being less costly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111435264">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111435264">6</xref></sup> Over the past 20 years, an endoscopic or a radiologic approach has been used for percutaneous gastrostomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111435264">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111435264">8</xref></sup> Particularly in the past several years, a percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement under endoscopic assistance has become the most common method worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111435264">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435264">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Enteral feeding is a very important factor to maintain good quality of life for patients who have a feeding disorder caused by head and neck malignancies, but percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is not possible because endoscopists cannot insert the endoscope into the stomach in patients with serious deformity of the pharynx and oral cavity due to the tumor and/or posttreatment trismus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435264">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111435264">13</xref></sup> In this prospective study, simple, safe, minimally invasive, percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopic guidance using a rupture-free balloon (RFB) catheter, which is usually used in percutaneous transesophageal gastrostomy (PTEG),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111435264">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111435264">15</xref></sup> was developed for placing commercially available endoscopic push-type gastrostomy tubes. In this method, push-type tubes were advanced over the guide wire, through the mouth, down the esophagus, and out the gastrostomy site.

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>This study is a retrospective review that was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for all procedures.</p>
<p>Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomies using an RFB catheter were performed in 21 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer between April 2007 and July 2010. Gastrostomy was performed in 15 patients during treatment and 6 patients after treatment. Inclusion criteria were as follows: all patients had no obstructive lesions of the stomach and/or small bowel and could not take adequate nutrition by mouth, and percutaneous endoscopy could not be performed because of deformity of the oral cavity or trismus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1a</xref>). When a gastrostomy was required in patients with trismus in the departments of otolaryngology and gastroenterological medicine at our institution, they were referred to the radiology department, and a gastrostomy tube was placed using the new technique as the first-line choice for enteral feeding tube placement. Exclusion criteria included abnormal coagulation status (an international normalized ratio value &gt;1.5 and a platelet count &lt;70,000), poor general performance status, and an unfit to undergo conscious sedation.</p>

<title>Technique</title>
<p>Prior to the procedure, patients fasted overnight, if possible, or for a minimum of 6 hours if the procedure needed to be performed the same day. Coagulation times and platelet levels were confirmed to be in the normal range. Pentazocine hydrochloride was injected to provide sedation, and Xylocaine 10% oral spray was sprayed onto the posterior wall of the oropharynx to reduce the gag reflex under oxymetric monitoring. A 150-cm-long, 0.035-inch guide wire with a 45-degree angled, 3.0-cm soft tip (Radifocus guide wire, TERUMO, Medical Products, Tokyo, Japan) was carefully inserted into the stomach via the oral route under fluoroscopic guidance with the interventional CT (IVR-CT) system (Somatom Plus 4 and Multistar Top; Siemens, Malvern, PA) with the patient in the supine position.</p>
<p>An RFB catheter (balloon diameter 35 × 20 mm; Sumitomo Bakelite Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was carefully inserted into the stomach via the mouth over the guide wire, and the RFB was inflated with approximately 20 mL of contrast material (Iopamidol 150; Bayer Japan, Tokyo, Japan) diluted with normal saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1b</xref>). Next, after performing a computed scanogram and tomogram to ensure that the balloon was inflated sufficiently, the stomach was punctured under fluoroscopic guidance while avoiding the left lobe of the liver and the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1c</xref>). The skin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine, and an incision was made in the anterior abdominal wall. An 18-gauge needle without the inner stylet (HAKKO, Nagano, Japan) was inserted through the incision into the balloon in the stomach under breath holding, and backflow of the contrast material from the balloon was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1d</xref>). A 0.035-inch, 260-cm-long Benson-type guide wire with a soft tip (MEDICOS Hirata, Tokyo, Japan) was quickly inserted through the needle into the balloon and was sufficiently coiled up in the balloon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1e</xref>). The balloon was immediately deflated to capture the wire under fluoroscopic guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1f</xref>). The deflated balloon that captured the wire was drawn up and dragged away through the mouth, passing the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1g</xref>). Consequently, the guide wire that was inserted though the abdominal wall was pulled out the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1h</xref>). After removing the balloon catheter, an 8-French angiographic dilator (TERUMO Medical Products, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the stomach from the puncture site over the guide wire to dilate the gastrostomy tract. Then, a 20-French endoscopic push-type gastrostomy tube (Neofeed PEG kit; Top Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was gently pushed over the guide wire into the stomach from the oral side and out the puncture site. The gastrostomy tube was then secured with a locking ring, the dilator portion of the tube was cut off, and a universal feeding adapter was fitted. The guide wire was removed, and contrast material was injected into the gastrostomy tube to confirm that the tube was correctly positioned in the stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435264">Figure 1i</xref>). No prophylactic antibiotics were used for this procedure. The procedure time from arrival at the IVR-CT unit to completion of the entire procedure was recorded for all patients.</p>

<title>Postprocedure Feeding</title>
<p>From the next day after the procedure, dextrose in body temperature warm water was given via the feeding tube for a few days. Tube feeding was initiated 3 days after tube placement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111435264">
<title>Monitoring and Definition of Complications</title>
<p>Procedure-related major and minor complications were also evaluated. Major complications were defined as procedure-related mortality, complications that required surgery or intensive care, or bleeding that required specific treatment. Minor complications were defined as self-limited wound infection, minimal leakage, or need for tube exchange because of occlusion, breakage, or dislodgment. Complications that occurred during the first 30 days were considered short-term; subsequent complications were considered long-term. Follow-up information was obtained in all patients with at least bimonthly evaluation of complications, tube disturbance, and the adequacy of feeding support. All available charts and records were reviewed in all cases. All procedures for gastrostomy tube placement were performed by 2 abdominal interventional radiologists (TF, MT) with 21 and 10 years of experience, respectively.</p>

<title>Technical Results</title>
<p>The RFB catheter could be inserted into the stomach, and the balloon was punctured under the CT and fluoroscopic guidance in all cases. There were no difficulties in capturing the guide wire with the balloon, and the deflated balloon that captured the wire could pass smoothly through the gastroesophageal junction. The soft bumper of the push-type gastrostomy tube could also pass through the deformed oral cavity. Therefore, the percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy was technically successful in all patients. The median procedure time was 35 ± 19 (interquartile range) minutes (range, 25–75 minutes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0148607111435264">
<title>Complications</title>
<p>No major complications related to the procedure were encountered. As minor complications, peristomal inflammation occurred in 7 patients (33.3%), although no abscess or peritonitis developed, and no surgical manipulation was needed. The average follow-up time was 221 days (range, 10–920 days). No tubes failed because of blockage, and neither tube dislodgement nor intraperitoneal leakage occurred during follow-up. There was no mortality related to the PEG procedure.</p>

<p>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) have both been shown to be safe and efficient alternatives to surgical gastrostomy because both techniques have significantly lower rates of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111435264">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111435264">8</xref></sup> Recently, PEG has been performed at many medical facilities because of the widespread use of the endoscopy procedures by skilled endoscopists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111435264">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111435264">20</xref></sup> However, a PEG is not possible in head and neck cancer patients with trismus in whom endoscopy is not feasible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435264">11</xref></sup> In these cases, percutaneous, radiologically guided placement of the gastrostomy tube is an alternative technique. Several methods of percutaneous radiological placement of the gastrostomy tube have been already published, such as a Seldinger technique using ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance or an anchor technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111435264">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111435264">23</xref></sup> Some studies reported that the significant advantages of PRG over PEG include higher success rates, shorter procedure duration, and fewer major complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111435264">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111435264">25</xref></sup> On the other hand, Neeff et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111435264">26</xref></sup> reported that, although the insertion success rate of PEG was lower than that for PRG, the total complication rate was also significantly lower.

<p>Various methods of percutaneous placement of gastrostomy tubes have been published, such as PEG or PRG, but the most crucial issue is that the incidence of puncture is kept to a minimum to avoid colonic perforation, liver injury, and intra-abdominal bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111435264">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111435264">21</xref></sup> In the PRG with anchor method, needle punctures are necessary 2 or 3 times in one session.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111435264">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607111435264">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607111435264">30</xref></sup> Because only a single puncture is enough to make the gastrostomy, our method is better than the current method employed for PRG placement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although only a single puncture is needed in the PEG method, colon or liver injury can sometimes occur because the position of the planned gastrostomy site may dislocate after endoscopy insertion and extension of the stomach by supplied air.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607111435264">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607111435264">33</xref></sup> In our technique, the planned gastrostomy site never migrates, so puncture of the transverse colon and the left hepatic lobe is avoided using CT and fluoroscopic guidance. The errant puncture of large vessels, massive abdominal varices caused by severe portal hypertension, or ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with hydrocephalus can be also avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111435264">23</xref></sup> The guide wire can be accurately advanced to the balloon in the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance in a short period of time. The RFB catheter has the balloon at the distal end and is usually used for PTEG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111435264">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111435264">15</xref></sup> This balloon cannot burst immediately after a needle puncture and therefore can securely capture the guide wire inserted through the abdominal wall. In the placement of the gastrostomy tube under endoscopic guidance, the guide wire inserted through the abdominal wall is grasped with the forceps via the channel of the endoscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111435264">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111435264"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111435264">9</xref></sup> However, with our method, the guide wire inserted though the abdominal wall is grasped with a deflated balloon. van Sonnenberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607111435264">34</xref></sup> first reported percutaneous gastrostomy using intragastric balloon support in 1984. Their balloon was used only as the target for a needle puncture under ultrasound guidance. The balloon in our study has the function of being both the target for a needle puncture and the forceps for grasping the inserted guide wire. The advantage of our method is that the insertion and acquisition of the guide wire are safely and surely performed within one needle puncture under CT and fluoroscopic guidance. Inserting a 14-Fr RFB catheter into the stomach via the oral route is not even a challenge and does not inflict much suffering on the patients because the caliber of the RFB catheter is as thin as that of the gastric tube. Therefore, this method could be used in patients who are unable to undergo normal endoscopy because of oral or esophageal stricture due to malignant head and neck tumors. If the Radifocus guide wire can be inserted into the stomach through the patient’s mouth, the gastrostomy tube can be securely placed.</p>
<p>However, there are some drawbacks to push-type tubes. Wound infection is more frequently encountered using push-type tubes than the PRG technique, such as introducer-type tube placement, due to contamination of the wound with oropharyngeal bacteria because the tubes traverse the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus during the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111435264">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111435264">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435264">11</xref></sup> In this study, peristomal inflammation occurred in 7 patients, although no patients developed either a subcutaneous abscess or serious peritonitis. However, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not used in our series because there is no clear evidence demonstrating a decrease in the infection rate; antibiotic administration might be considered after the procedures and may decrease the infection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111435264">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are 2 important limitations to this study. First, this procedure is not feasible in patients whose stomach lies high above the costal junction or in patients whose liver or transverse colon overlies the stomach. It is not possible to safely puncture the balloon by the needle in these cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435264">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111435264">21</xref></sup> However, this is a limitation of all percutaneous techniques.</p>
<p>Second, this uncontrolled, retrospective study involved a small number of patients at a single institute. No major complications occurred in this study, but with the rate of major complications being reported as approximately 2.8%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111435264">35</xref></sup> we would speculate that our technique would have found a similar rate if 100 to 200 patients had been observed. Moreover, all procedures were performed by only 2 experienced radiologists; thus, the results might be biased.</p>
<p>In addition, transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (TN-EGD) has recently become one of the frequently used methods of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in some countries. TN-EGD is applied in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, nasoenteric feeding tube placement, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607111435264">36</xref></sup> Therefore, TN-EGD might be used for gastrostomy tube placement in our series.</p>
<p>Tube feeding is usually started the day after the creation of gastrostomy at many institutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111435264">12</xref></sup> Tube feeding was initiated 3 days after tube placement in this study, after we administered warm water to confirm that there was no leak from the gastrostomy site over 2 days.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy using CT and fluoroscopic guidance with push-type tubes and an RFB catheter is a safe and effective method for gastrostomy insertion in patients with head and neck cancer in whom endoscopic gastrostomy is not feasible. CT and fluoroscopy provide detailed imaging of the soft tissues and surrounding structures of the epigastric region within one diagnostic tour, which then allows the safest identification of an access path for tube insertion. Although CT guidance is not necessary in all cases, and the benefits are difficult to measure, this ability does increase operator confidence and overall safety for high-risk patients.</p>
<p>In patients with head and neck cancer in whom endoscopy is not feasible, our results show that a percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy using CT and fluoroscopic guidance with push-type tubes and an RFB catheter is a safe and effective means of gastric feeding, with a high technical success rate and few complications. This technique is relatively simple and quick, and it could offer several advantages over both surgical and endoscopic gastrostomy and provide an alternative to the more frequently used introducer-placed gastrostomy tubes under fluoroscopic guidance. We recognize that this is a small and single-center study with a limited number of patients. Therefore, future randomized trials with other nonsurgical methods for gastrostomy tube placement are needed to compare clinical success and risk of complications, with particular attention given to safety.</p>
