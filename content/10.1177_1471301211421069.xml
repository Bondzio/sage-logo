<abstract>
<p>In this study, we examined the social relatedness of people in the moderate stage of dementia as defined by their performance on standard tests and clinical examination. The individuals herein were observed in the natural social environment of an adult day center that they attended on weekdays. A number of important aspects of mutually desired, independently initiated, supportive social relationships were observed to exist, through which the principals revealed semiotic, or meaning-driven, behavior that would not be predicted by their meeting the criteria that contributed to their diagnosis. Losses in social functioning described in the DSM and associated with the clinical diagnosis of dementia appear to be caused more by social dynamics involving healthy others than by brain injury alone. Implications for the non-pharmacological treatment of people with dementia are explored and discussed within the context of Kitwood's idea of positive person work.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421069" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421069">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), dementia is defined as having the hallmark feature of memory impairment, accompanied by one of the following features: aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia, and a disturbance in executive function, which cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning that is a significant decline from previous levels of functioning. It is clear that dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD) can result in the person so diagnosed having difficulties with some of the avenues through which he or she can relate to others. Problems include finding desired words and organizing them in correct syntactic patterns, thereby making it difficult for the person to express him or herself efficiently, and problems with explicit memory abilities such as the recall of recent events, thereby making it seem as though the person diagnosed does not know, or fails to remember, information easily recallable in healthier days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421069">Howard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421069">Morris &amp; Kopelman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421069">Squire, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Standard neuropsychological tests reveal dysfunction in a variety of cognitive abilities such as word-finding, verbal fluency, attention, problem-solving, and visual perception and these deficits are included in the classic clinical diagnosis of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421069">McKhann et al., 1984</xref>). For many years, the cognitive ability of people diagnosed with dementia was thought to be measurable in a valid way via the administration of such standard tests. Despite all this, it is not necessarily the case that these deficits and those enumerated in the DSM are the direct causes of losses in social functioning during the early or mild stages of AD. In recent years, research has indicated that declines in social functioning may be a more direct outcome of the ways in which the person diagnosed is positioned and treated by healthy others, including family as well as formal caregivers such as staff members at day centers and residential homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421069">Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421069">Sabat, Napolitano, &amp; Fath, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421069">Snyder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421069">van Langenhove and Harré, 1999</xref>). In addition, research has revealed that the same situation obtains in the moderate to severe stages of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421069">Hughes, Louw, &amp; Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421069">Kontos, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421069">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421069">Sabat, 2001</xref>). If a person diagnosed with dementia is positioned negatively, it is often the case that instances of his or her appropriate behavior will be misinterpreted, because of the influence of the biomedical model of dementia, as being pathological and symptomatic of dementia rather than being symptomatic of innocently dysfunctional social treatment provided by healthy others. This is an example of what social psychologists refer to as the Fundamental Attribution Error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421069">Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1972</xref>), wherein a person's actions are interpreted (in individualistic cultures) as being ‘dispositional’, or due to the person's way of being, rather than ‘situational’, or due to the circumstances confronting the person in question.</p>
<p>For instance, a person diagnosed with dementia resides in a nursing home and a staff member enters his room in the morning and tells him that it's time to take a shower. The resident, a retired army General, does not want to take a shower. The staff member becomes more and more insistent and the General resists more and more, eventually struggling physically with the staff member. The staff member labels the resident's behavior as ‘uncooperative’, ‘aggressive’, and ‘irrationally hostile’, all of which are ‘symptoms' of dementia and the General is given medication for this aggressive behavior that renders him far less able to engage socially with others than he would be in the absence of the tranquilizing effects of medication. When viewed in the larger social context, including the history of person with dementia, we may interpret his behavior in an entirely different way. The General is an adult person, and is hardly accustomed in his adult life to being told, or ordered, to do anything. After all, as a career commissioned officer, on most occasions he has been the one to give, rather than receive, orders and when he has received orders, they have been issued by someone whom he recognizes as being a person of a rank superior to his own. He is also a person who has spent his entire adult life taking care of such ablutions on his own and certainly not at the behest of someone far younger than he, who could be a stranger. In this context, his resistance is hardly a species of irrational hostility or uncooperativeness but, rather, righteous indignation at having someone treat him with what is, in his view, insistent and escalating disrespect. At the same time, the General's behavior is also an assertion of desire or will and of self-respect, both of which are Indicators of Relative Well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421069">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>). These actions are instances of behavior found in healthy people in daily social life and are positively valued in the local culture, for their opposites, apathy and no self-worth, are considered worrisome at the very least. So, indicators of relative well-being found in people diagnosed with dementia would constitute common ground between the healthy and those diagnosed if they were seen as such rather than as pathological symptoms of dementia.</p>
<p>It must be noted, however, that the misinterpretation of the General's behavior in the above scenario is, as Kitwood and Bredin asserted, quite innocent for the following reasons:
<list id="list1-1471301211421069" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the staff member does not understand or is not aware of the sound reasons for the anger being expressed by the General;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the staff member is interpreting the behavior in question on the basis of the original pre-positioning of the General as an instantiation of dementia, so that any behavior that seems to deviate from the ‘norm’ or what the staff member desires in his or her efforts to ‘manage the resident/patient’ is henceforth viewed as being symptomatic of dementia rather than symptomatic of dysfunctional social treatment.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Misinterpretation of this type has been identified as ‘labeling’, which is a form of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421069">Kitwood (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421069">1998</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421069">Kitwood and Bredin (1992)</xref> termed ‘malignant social psychology’. Malignant social psychology is malignant, or dangerous, because it leads to depersonalization of the individual with dementia and is, itself, an assault on the person's self-worth. For example, to treat the General as a person would not entail ‘telling him’ that it is time to take a shower. Ordering him in this way demeans him, for no one tells an adult person when to bathe and tries to force the issue when the adult person declines. To treat a person in this manner can inspire a very hostile reaction and rightly so. To label the hostile reaction as a form of pathology (‘irrational hostility’ or ‘uncooperativeness’) is to demean the person so labeled. One might just as easily make the claim that it was the aide, in refusing to take the General's ‘no’ for an answer, who was being ‘uncooperative’.</p>
<p>This kind of treatment can lead to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421069">Brody (1971)</xref> called ‘excess disability’, which is defined as a deficit in performance beyond what would be predicted on the basis of neuropathology alone. Such excess disability has been found in the case of a person with moderate AD when her primary caregiver prevented her at home from engaging in helpful actions of which she was perfectly capable and that she demonstrated at the adult day center she attended. The caregiver mistakenly attributed his wife's doing nothing around the house to AD, rather than his own intervention that prevented her from doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421069">Sabat, 2001</xref>). When treated in these ways, people with AD can become increasingly withdrawn and are then incorrectly described as being ‘apathetic’ due to the disease. With this as a background, we now explore how this dynamic can affect the social lives of people with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421069"><title>Social cognition</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421069">Sabat and Collins (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421069">Sabat and Gladstone (2010)</xref> reported detailed case studies of women in the moderate stage of AD who displayed many forms of intact social cognition in their interactions with participants in the adult day center they attended. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421069">Washburn, Sands, and Walton (2003)</xref> defined social cognition as the
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… collection of cognitive abilities that enables us to make sense of our social world and to interact effectively with others … social stimuli include the self, other individuals, and social situations … [that] are personally relevant and mutable’ (p. 203).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To be more concrete, social cognition includes the ability to interpret other people's faces and facial expressions, their tones of voice, posture, the ability to make judgments about the personalities and motives of others, predicting their likely behavior, and planning the quantity and quality of one's interactions with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421069">Adolphs, 2005</xref>). It is important to note that, by definition, dementia entails problems in cognition that are assessed objectively by neuropsychological tests of cognitive abilities taken one at a time. The items on these examinations, unlike the stimuli in natural social situations, are most often not personally relevant to the individual being tested. Oddly enough, many of the very abilities that are said to be dysfunctional in people with dementia as shown in the clinical testing situation are themselves required in order for those same people to have intact social cognition. For example, in order to be able to do all that is entailed in social cognition, one must be able to have functional levels of attention, visual information processing, working memory, language and communication skills, and emotional coherence in a variety of situations. This means that the abilities that must be dysfunctional in order to diagnose a person with dementia are not necessarily dysfunctional in the same person in natural social situations.</p>
<p>There are at least three possible reasons for this apparent dissociation. One is that the cognitive functions assessed in clinical testing situations are tapped by standard tests that are created to measure each function separately, one at a time. One might say, therefore, that the testing situation is geared to examine the <italic>elements</italic> of cognitive function. In contrast, in everyday social situations, many of the same cognitive functions are deployed simultaneously, so that one might say that we are looking at <italic>compounds</italic> of cognitive function in social situations. It may be that in social situations the use of many cognitive abilities simultaneously allows for the possibility of strengths in some to make up for deficiencies in others. A second possible reason for the dissociation is that the clinical testing situation is a relatively unnatural social situation for an adult, and for a person with dementia the testing situation may inspire feelings of anxiety and embarrassment in the face of potential and actual failure to answer questions correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421069">Sabat &amp; Harré, 1994</xref>), and anxiety has negative effects on test performance. A third possible reason for the dissociation is that the test items are decontextualized and may often have little personal relevance for the individual being tested. On the other hand, a social situation at a day center or care home does not necessarily place the person diagnosed in similar positions of potential and real failure and anxiety, and the ‘stimuli’ are relevant to the person because they are part of a larger social, interpersonal context. Thus, a person diagnosed with dementia may be far more able to engage in appropriate, functional social behavior than would be predicted on the basis of the neuropsychological test scores that supported a diagnosis of dementia in the first place. Clearly, persons should be able to perform well even on decontextualized items contained in such tests, but the failure to do so on tests does not necessarily mean that a person's performance on such tests can be generalized so as to predict his or her performance in the natural, everyday social world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421069"><title>Friendship</title>
<p>Social cognition would seem to be required in order for a person to develop warm interactions or even friendship with another and it is clear that there are at least some instances of people in the moderate stage of AD who have intact social cognition ability and in principle, therefore, the ability to develop and enjoy friendships with others. It has been clear that social contact is important in human life just as is physical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421069">Bowlby, 1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421069">1980</xref>). Friendships have been shown to be beneficial for the psychological well-being and morale of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421069">Mor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421069">Phillipson, 1997</xref>). As the human lifespan increases, the probability of being diagnosed with dementia increases as well and how to improve the quality of life of people thus diagnosed becomes a matter of ever increasing importance. In the same vein, with the increasing costs of health care and pharmaceutical intervention, it becomes increasingly important to identify non-pharmacological approaches to enhancing the quality of life of people diagnosed with dementia.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, though, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421069">Buckley and McCarthy (2009)</xref>, cognitively intact residents in a long-term care setting in Ireland reported feeling more socially disconnected and withdrew from residents who had cognitive impairments because they were fearful for their own mental health. Thus, residents with cognitive impairment were stigmatized and isolated to a degree, but this is often compounded by the fact that those whose cognitive impairment was deemed severe are isolated further than those deemed less cognitively impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421069">Chen, Ryden, Feldt, &amp; Savik, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The degree of isolation that people experience may be related, however, to the extent to which they are able to exercise choice regarding those with whom they congregate in their daily lives. Indeed, the ways in which people freely organize themselves within a social context may reveal the extent of their emotional identification with others in their environment and their interest in seeking out others for support and feelings of belonging. Clearly, living with dementia in a residential care setting can be an emotionally distressing experience as has been shown in research aimed at a psychosocial understanding of the experience and recently attested to again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421069">Clare, Rowlands, Bruce, Surr, &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>). It may be that some of the distress of the experience can be ameliorated by social interactions and friendships that help to maintain peoples’ sense of self as a result of successful communication with others, be it verbal or non-verbal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421069">Hubbard, Cook, Tester, and Downs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421069">Sabat, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The ways in which people with dementia freely choose to associate with others may be reflective of their mutual interest in one another as desirable social partners and may reflect the psychological and social closeness that exists at the foundation of friendships. In what follows, we report on the ways in which people diagnosed with dementia who attended an adult day center developed patterns of what appeared outwardly as positive social interaction and sustained, supportive, communication. We then explore the possible meaning of all this for the social lives of people diagnosed with dementia in other social settings, such as that of long-term care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421069"><title>Observations of social interaction</title>
<p>The observations reported herein were made over a period of 4 months at an adult day center attended by people with a variety of central nervous system problems, including dementia. Although some participants were healthy, most had been diagnosed with dementia. Among those diagnosed with dementia, most were in the moderate stage cognitively according to their MMSE scores. Some of these participants chose to sit in the same locations together, such as the same table for the lunch meal, or the same table or close to one another for other programmed activities. Their verbal and non-verbal exchanges suggested sustained meaningful communication with one another as well as mutual emotional understanding and support. A number of examples are presented in the following.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421069"><title>Indication of shared experience</title>
<p>Ms M and Ms E, who did not know each other prior to attending the day center, sat next to one another throughout the course of their days at the center, during different activities and in different venues. In the main activity room, the table at which they sat was located such that it offered a full view of the entire room as well as a view of the area immediately outside, including trees, a playground, and a garden. The adult day center is housed in a building that also houses a children's day care center and the children often play outside and also at times visit with the participants in the adult day center.</p>
<p>When asked why she chose to sit in that location, Ms M replied, pointing to the scene outside, that she was watching the children playing. Ms E then leaned over to include herself more fully in the discussion and said, ‘That's what we do here. We watch people’. Ms E's comment suggested that the women chose to sit in that location so that they could have a good view of the social interactions occurring inside and outside. That she used the first person plural, ‘we’, suggested that she and Ms M were engaged together in ‘people watching’ and that they were sharing the experience together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421069"><title>Inviting, and choosing, the experience of mutual company</title>
<p>One of the activities at the day center is a prayer meeting for those wishing to attend. Some participants typically attend, others do not, but the choice is always there for each person to make for themselves. On one occasion, Ms M put her hands on Ms E's shoulders and, looking at her, asked, ‘Do you want to join us [at the prayer meeting]?’. Ms E replied that she was not keen on attending because she is not religious. Ms M nodded and said, ‘Okay’, and then walked across the hall, with the assistance of the second author, to the room in which the prayer meeting was to be held. A few minutes after Ms M was settled in her seat, Ms E entered the room and walked to where Ms M was seated and sat down in an empty seat next to Ms M. This choice becomes even more significant when one realizes that there were many empty seats from which to choose, but Ms E chose to sit next to Ms M. It is also noteworthy that the two women do not share the same attitudes toward religion, but that fact seemed to be less salient than was their interest in sharing one another's company. Thus, the actions of each woman in this situation could be understood as forms of <italic>semiotic behavior</italic>, behavior that is driven by the meaning of the situation. In order to appreciate the meaning of the situation, each person had to have interpreted the nature of the situation and evaluated it in terms of what it meant to her personally and together. In order to have evaluated the situation, each had to have attended to the details inherent in the situation, held those details in working memory, and engaged in executive function of the ‘if … then’ variety. Specifically, Ms M had to have evaluated her desire to attend the prayer meeting vis-á-vis her desire to share Ms E's company, and Ms E had to do the same. Having evaluated the alternatives, each had to have arrived at a personally satisfying conclusion and acted accordingly. Ms M extended an invitation, Ms E initially declined, but then seemed to have changed her mind (presumably having weighed the alternatives) and proceeded to join Ms M in the prayer meeting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421069"><title>Requesting and providing help</title>
<p>Physical proximity is also helpful to some degree when participants seek to interact through the use of non-verbal communication. Some participants at the day center have varying degrees of ability in their use of words and creation of syntactically correct sentences and for them it is often important to retain the ability to maintain eye contact and use gestures. Ms M had word-finding problems and often conveyed her needs via extra-linguistic forms of communication such as gestures, facial expressions, body posture, and touch. For example, Ms M touched Ms E's arm to obtain the latter's attention and then pointed to a section of the newspaper to convey that she, Ms M, wanted to read it at that time. Ms E proceeded to reach across the table and picked up the newspaper for Ms M. Ms M then smiled and nodded her head in response, indicating her appreciation. In this exchange, Ms M showed an expression of desire or will and evinced an appropriate expression of thanks, and Ms E also expressed agency in interpreting correctly the needs of her cohort and responding appropriately to a request, all of which can be subsumed among <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421069">Kitwood and Bredin's (1992)</xref> indicators of relative well being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421069"><title>Shared humor and interpersonal understanding</title>
<p>1. Participants diagnosed with dementia were observed to have shared humor, another indicator of relative well being, though non-verbal communication. Ms M was engaged in watching other participants interacting in one corner of the room, but her view was partially blocked by the head of another participant, Ms D. As a result, Ms M had to keep shifting her head from side to side to gain a better view. Ms D noticed Ms M's head movements, turned to find out what was happening, and realized that Ms M was having difficulty seeing around her. Ms D then explored the possibility of shifting her chair so as to give Ms M an unobstructed view, but quickly realized that it was not possible to adjust her chair to achieve the desired end. She then turned and looked at Ms M, smiled, and made a hand gesture that imitated the action of sawing off her head. Ms D assessed the situation wherein she was obstructing Ms M's view, attempted to rearrange her chair, to no avail, and then made a joke about sawing off her head as the only thing left for her to do to be of help. This entire interaction reflects meaning-making, or semiotic, behavior on the part of Ms D, who interpreted the exigencies of the situation, tried to correct it without success and then made a joke about the situation. It is also a species of goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421069">Stern, 1938</xref>). In addition, Ms D displayed an implicit understanding of Ms M's predicament in the situation and sympathized with Ms M by making the joking gesture of cutting off her head. This kind of sympathizing with the situation faced by another is a foundational element required for the building of friendship that entails a close (rather than distant) psychological connection with another.</p>
<p>2. Ms E, Ms D, Ms M, and Mr F were seated at ‘their’ table together and Ms E commented that she loved the fact that Mr F sat at the table with them. Mr F was looking at a magazine at that moment, heard the comment, and looked up at Ms E. Ms E went on to talk about how when she was 19 years old, she married a military man. Mr F, upon hearing this, shouted out, ‘Was it worth it?’, inspiring laughter in everyone who heard his comment. Good natured teasing is often part of warm interpersonal interaction among people who feel close connections and all of this was quite evident in the small group of people, diagnosed with dementia, at this table.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421069"><title>Empathy and helping to save face</title>
<p>1. Ms E and Ms M seemed to gravitate toward one another also because they appeared to complement each other and empathize with one another. They clearly preferred each other's company to that of other participants. It appeared that each had an awareness of the other's needs and a mutual understanding of their circumstances. On one occasion, the second author asked Ms M what she had done over the previous weekend. Ms M tried to reply but had difficulty finding the words she sought. After a few minutes' time, she shrugged her shoulders, laughed, and replied, ‘I can't remember.’ After a few moments, Ms E leaned toward Ms M, affectionately touched her arm and said, ‘You're just like me. You go in and out too’. In so doing, Ms E acted not only to help Ms M save face in the situation, but simultaneously created a bond or alliance of sorts, by indicating that Ms M was not alone in being unable to recount the weekend's events, but rather that she was in ‘good company’.</p>
<p>2. Ms M and Ms E were sitting next to one another in a ‘living room’ area of the day center and Ms E was looking at the pages of a magazine while leaning in such a way so that Ms M was able to look at the photographs as well. Having finished looking at the magazine, they closed it prior to replacing it on the shelf where it belonged. Ms M noticed the words, ‘Property of [name] Hospital’ stamped on the front cover, turned to Ms E, pointed to the stamped words, and asked, ‘What is this?’. Ms E looked at the words and read them aloud. Ms M looked rather puzzled and so Ms E gently said, ‘[Name] Hospital, that's where we are right now’. Looking around, Ms M said, ‘We are?’. Ms E then nodded her head slowly, stood up, and walked across the room to replace the magazine on the shelf where it belonged. In this situation, Ms E clearly showed patience toward, and understanding and acceptance of, Ms M's seeming confusion, another of the indicator of relative well-being described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421069">Kitwood and Bredin (1992)</xref>, and Ms M clearly evinced trust in relation to Ms E.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1471301211421069"><title>Seeking common ground</title>
<p>Aside from the common attribute of being participants at the adult day center, some participants seem to seek common ground that goes well beyond the present. Ms E, for example, was originally from a Midwestern state. It was she who initiated conversation with new participants who sat at the same table as did she, and when she did introduce herself, she also introduced Ms D and Ms M as all hailing from the same Midwestern state. Although it was true that Ms E was from that state, it was not the case that the other two women were, but they seemed to go along with the introductions just the same. Perhaps the perception of a shared background during healthier days was important as a way to cement feelings of togetherness and friendship that had already developed at the adult day center, but there was clear meaning for Ms E in creating this bond.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1471301211421069" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In his book, <italic>The Divided Self</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421069">Laing (1967)</xref> noted that:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Psychotherapy is an activity in which that aspect of a patient’s being, his relatedness to others, is used for therapeutic ends. The therapist acts on the principle that, since relatedness is potentially present in everyone, then he may not be wasting his time in sitting for hours with a silent catatonic who gives every evidence that he does not recognize his existence.’ (p. 26)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421069">Schofield (1964)</xref> made this point rather blatantly in the title of his book, <italic>Psychotherapy: The Purchase of Friendship</italic>. Although Laing and Schofield were asserting that relatedness or friendship could be an effective attribute to support the work of a psychotherapist and his or her client, it is not a great leap to suggest that relatedness can be, and is, therapeutic for lay people in their everyday lives. The predicament of people diagnosed with dementia can include being misunderstood (labeling, as noted earlier in this article), stigmatized, ostracized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421069">Kitwood, 1998</xref>), prevented from helping others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421069">Sabat, 2001</xref>) and these experiences can all be deleterious to their mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421069">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) as they help to create and exacerbate feelings of isolation, incompetence, loneliness, frustration, depression, and unworthiness.</p>
<p>As a result, the experience of warm, mutually satisfying social relationships with others becomes ever more significant for people diagnosed with dementia. The people with diagnoses of dementia discussed herein seemed to recognize and honor one another's needs, supported one another in caring, tender ways, sought to be helpful to one another and found ways of expressing acceptance of one another in spite of being in what, according to standard testing and clinical evaluation, was the moderate stage of dementia. In a sense, these people found in one another a kind understanding that was clearly <italic>person-centered</italic> and their interactions with one another reflected what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421069">Kitwood (1998)</xref> referred to as <italic>Positive Person Work</italic>: including such things as <italic>Recognition</italic>, where the person with dementia is acknowledged as a person, listened to carefully, given direct eye contact; <italic>Validation</italic>, in which others attempt to understand the frame of reference of another person and accept the reality of his or her experience in an empathetic way; and <italic>Celebration</italic>, in which moments are experienced together as joyful. The interactions of Ms M, Ms E, Ms D, and Mr F, in one or another way as described in this article all reflected positive person work.</p>
<p>It is more than interesting to note that when Kitwood discussed the definitions and virtues of positive person work, he was talking about the ways in which healthy others should interact with those diagnosed with dementia. That is, he was indicating that formal and informal caregivers ought to behave in these ways because interactions that embodied these qualities would be beneficial for those diagnosed as well as for caregivers. The fact that people diagnosed with dementia were treating each other in ways that could be characterized as positive person work is, itself, a testimony to their intact social cognition abilities and to their ability to seek out and sustain warm, understanding, supportive relationships. Indeed it is itself another indicator of relative well-being: an aspect of life shared with those who are otherwise healthy. Thus, the ability to engage in such important, positive, social interaction is not predicted, or even hinted at, by the very assessment measures that lead to the diagnosis of dementia in the first place. The meaning of this for formal caregivers, including staff members at adult day centers and long-term care homes, cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>The degree to which a person with dementia is seen as needing, or being able to benefit from, the kinds of supportive social relationships discussed herein cannot be viewed by staff members as having anything to do with his or her ‘stage’ of dementia as defined by neuropsychological tests. In other words, people with dementia cannot and should not be positioned as incapable of acting as social beings on the basis of their cognitive test scores or ‘stage’. To do so would be potentially harmful to their psychological health. More specifically, it must be noted that the persons reported on herein established close relationships with others in a very independent, open, way that reflected their own volition and choice. Clearly, they were able to make those choices for themselves without any ‘help’ from staff members. This may very well have important implications especially for staff members at long-term care residential homes where people with dementia are able (as indicated elsewhere in this Special Issue) to state quite coherently their ideas about and definitions of friendship, including intimacy, reciprocity, mutual respect, and the ability to confide in one another, all of which require evaluative abilities in cognitive domains not tapped by standard tests.</p>
<p>If persons with dementia in the moderate and perhaps severe stages are able to evaluate the social behavior of others such that they seek out one another exclusively rather than all people equally, they are able also to evaluate the social behavior of staff people. That is, people with dementia may well be able to discriminate the difference between what can be termed, ‘task-oriented’ as opposed to ‘person-oriented’ behavior. In the former approach, the person is often secondary to the task, for it is the task that must be completed: one must get the person with dementia to take the pills, drink the liquids, and so on. The person will then cooperate or be uncooperative with the staff member whose task is of primary concern. In the person-oriented approach, the task is secondary to the person, for even if the task is important, it is important only insofar as its benefit to the person is concerned and approaching the person first and interacting with him or her as a person first, can be of significant value to everyone concerned. This distinction and the benefits associated with being ‘person-oriented’ was examined and found to have tremendously positive effects in a study of Scottish community mental health nurses who were given training in person-centered psychosocial counseling skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421069">Weaks, Johnson, Wilkinson, &amp; McLeod, 2009</xref>). The effects were profound from the point of view of the nurses, for they changed from ‘working on’ their patients to ‘working with their clients', from ‘managing their patients' to ‘listening to and hearing their clients’. What began as what Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421069">Buber (1937)</xref> would call, ‘I–It’ relationships, became ‘I–Thou’ relationships. The nurses became more humane not only in their treatment of people with dementia, but also in their treatment of others in general, and more confident in themselves and more competent in their jobs. It is quite possible that approaches that are less task-oriented and more person-oriented might lead to more meaningful, positive social interactions between staff members and long-term care residents and thereby enhance the quality of life of all concerned. Being more person-oriented would include, in more concrete, practical, terms, allowing people with dementia to have more free-flowing, interactive, less ‘managed’, social experiences with one another so that they are able to find one another, as it were, and establish warm social interactions with those with whom they find positive connections. People in long-term residential care may have disagreements with some of their cohorts, much as people do in everyday life, but they need to have the freedom to find positive relationships without the ‘task-oriented’ approach to ‘managing’ social situations so that disagreements cannot ever occur.</p>
<p>No attempt is made to generalize from the people reported on herein, and further research will need to be undertaken to determine the degree to which the present findings are reflective of others diagnosed with dementia. Still, it is apparent that at least some people diagnosed with dementia clearly retain the ability to enjoy moments of genuine mutual support and consideration, humor, and can understand what is entailed in warm, mutually satisfying, relationships including friendships at level as deep, perhaps, as that of psychologists who contribute to the literature on the subject. It is clear from these data and from those of studies in the past 20 years that people diagnosed with dementia are not demented and should not be described and treated as if they were.</p>
