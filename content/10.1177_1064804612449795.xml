<p>On a four-hour flight recently, I noticed there was no in-flight entertainment (IFE) system. This may have been specific to the airline, or it could be a trend for aircraft used on short routes. If there happens to be an IFE system, I’m sure many of you have observed people using their tablets and smartphones instead.</p>
<p>Whether used or not, IFE systems are bound to remain available on aircraft on long flights. What about those passengers with disibilities who cannot view or listen to an IFE system? Authors Trisha O’Connell, Larry Goldberg, Bradley Botkin, and Caesar Eghtesadi report their insights on developing an IFE system that is accessible to users who have vision and hearing problems. They describe the development of caption displays and talking menus and discuss the development of recommendations for accessible designs within industry IFE standards.</p>
<p>As readers in the northern hemisphere clean out (or switch off) their fireplaces for the summer and those in the southern hemisphere begin to set them (or turn them on), everyone should reflect on the article by Carol Pollack-Nelson. This forensics investigation thoroughly describes the burn hazard for children who contact the extremely hot glass front of a gas fireplace. This informative article is a great example of the thorough forensic human factors/ergonomics evaluation of a common hazard.</p>
<p>Also in the forensics vein, Brian Peacock describes six accidents that resulted in serious injury as the basis for discussing specific human performance laws. The article is a great refresher on variability and basic performance principles while presenting some interesting forensic cases. Refamiliarize yourself with de Jong’s law, Hick-Hyman law, Weber-Fechner law, and Miller’s law. If you are wondering what these laws are about, I urge you to read the article!</p>

<p>I think there are some great reminders in the 10 lessons for those who are in HF/E practice.</p>

<p>Cara Bailey Fausset, Keith Bujak, Keith Kline, Jenay Beer, Cory-Ann Smarr, Anne Adams, Sara McBride, and John Burnett are students and faculty from the HFES Georgia Tech Student Chapter who collaborated to bring us a thought-provoking article addressing the lessons learned from conducting a real-life HF/E project outside the classroom. The project involved evaluating and redesigning the School of Psychology Web site. The authors share 10 lessons from the experience and provide concrete recommendations. The article is certain to be of value to faculty members and students. Speaking as a consultant, I think there are some great reminders in the 10 lessons for those who are in HF/E practice.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recently announced the release of a new ergonomics standard, ISO 26800:2001. James Williams contributes a useful update in the Laws and Rules department, describing what this standard is about and its context in the work of the ISO Ergonomics Technical Committee (TC 159). Williams also provides a general overview of ISO standards that are planned or being developed and some American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards that might be useful to practitioners.</p>
