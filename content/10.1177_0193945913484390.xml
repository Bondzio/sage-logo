<abstract>
<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines discourage elective deliveries before 39 weeks gestation, but clinicians continue to schedule elective inductions and cesareans resulting in births at 37 0/7 to 38 6/7 weeks gestation. These “early term” (ET) infants incur more morbidity and mortality than their 39-to-41-week counterparts. Using the Quality Health Outcomes Model, four hypotheses were tested: Among hospitals in one southwestern U.S. county, there are different rates of ET births, ET births preceded by elective labor induction, ET births preceded by elective cesarean section, and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admissions of ET infants. Analyses of 75,625 birth certificates involved 26,199 ET and 49,426 full term births in 16 hospitals. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences in rates among hospitals for ET births, ET births preceded by elective labor induction, and ET births preceded by elective cesarean section, but no significant differences in NICU admissions. Wide variance across hospitals demonstrated practice patterns amenable to improvements.</p>

<p>The field of obstetrics occupies a unique place in the realm of health science. Other medical specialties are traditionally associated with detecting and correcting underlying pathology. In contrast, uncomplicated pregnancy is merely an experience on the continuum of life and health. Perhaps it is this very normalcy that explains why the fundamental issue of the optimal length of human gestation has been largely unexamined for decades. The convention of classifying 37 weeks as the line of demarcation between preterm and term has been traced to the Second European College of Perinatal Medicine held in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913484390">Fleischman, Oinuma, &amp; Clark, 2010</xref>). Recent research suggests that this dated boundary between preterm and term gestation should be carefully examined and re-conceptualized because of its implications for maternal–fetal health care management and neonatal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913484390">Fleischman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945913484390">Reddy et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Early Term (ET) Birth</title>
<p>Mortality rates of (ET) neonates of 37 0/7 through 38 6/7 weeks gestation are significantly higher than the mortality rates of infants of 39 through 41 weeks gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945913484390">Reddy, Ko, &amp; Willinger, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, provider practice patterns such as elective labor inductions and elective cesarean sections are significant contributing factors to these increasing rates of ET births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913484390">Ohnsorg &amp; Schiff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484390">Oshiro, Henry, Wilson, Branch, &amp; Varner, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Framework</title>
<p>The Quality Health Outcomes Model (QHOM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913484390">Mitchell, Ferketich, &amp; Jennings, 1998</xref>) was the framework used to guide this study. Inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945913484390">Donabedian’s (1966)</xref> work on structure, process, and outcome, the QHOM was based on the original model but changed it from being predominantly linear into a reciprocal model. The four principal components of the QHOM are <italic>system</italic> (individual, organization, or group), <italic>client</italic> (individual, family, or community), <italic>interventions, and outcomes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945913484390">Mitchell et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, the <italic>system</italic> refers to the hospitals/physicians/providers and their practice patterns. <italic>Outcomes</italic> are the rates of ET versus full term (FT) birth and rates of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admissions. Elective induction and elective cesarean delivery are the <italic>interventions</italic> addressed by this study. The <italic>client</italic> component of the model represents women, their infants, and their demographic or sociological attributes.</p>

<title>Gestational Age</title>
<p>Determination of the fetal gestational age is one of the most crucial contributions obstetric health care providers make toward safeguarding pregnancies. Adding 7 days to the first day of a woman’s last menstrual period (LMP) and subtracting 3 months, known as Naegele’s rule, results in a predicted end of gestation after approximately 280 days or 40 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945913484390">Varney, Kriebs, &amp; Gegor, 2004</xref>). Despite the confounding factors that diminish the reliability of this calculation, such as irregular ovulation, contraceptive use, or breastfeeding, Naegele’s rule is still widely utilized today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913484390">Hunter, 2009</xref>). Technology has provided some notable refinement to the process of dating pregnancies. First trimester ultrasound has been shown to provide the most accurate estimation of gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913484390">Hunter, 2009</xref>), although variables such as maternal habitus, fetal position, and sonographer skill can all affect dating precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945913484390">Hunter, 2009</xref>). Physiological and developmental challenges for the ET infant should convince health care providers to strive to maintain healthy pregnancies until at least 39 weeks. One of the strongest cases for attempting to keep the healthy unborn in utero relates to particularly critical aspects of fetal growth and development. The fetal brain undergoes marked increases in mass and nerve growth (corticoneurogenesis) during the final weeks of pregnancy, a process best left undisturbed by unnecessary iatrogenic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945913484390">Adams-Chapman, 2009</xref>). The significance of the final weeks of gestation was formally acknowledged by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) in 2009. Labor induction guidelines now recommend that pregnancies lacking clinical indication for early delivery should not be induced before 39 weeks gestation or the establishment of fetal lung maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945913484390">ACOG, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>ET Versus Term Gestation</title>
<p>Much obstetrical and neonatal research about preterm birth uses term newborns as the comparative reference group. However, clearly, further along the continuum of viability, “term gestation” is increasingly becoming an elusive concept, not only for health care consumers but also for many health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945913484390">Bakewell-Sachs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913484390">Ohnsorg &amp; Schiff, 2010</xref>). These infants are frequently described as those who are at least 37 through 41 weeks gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945913484390">Abe, Shapiro-Mendoza, Hall, &amp; Satten, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945913484390">Bird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945913484390">Qin, Hsia, &amp; Berg, 2008</xref>). Yet, disparities in neonatal morbidity and length of stay have been demonstrated between those infants who were delivered across the stratified spectrum of “term,” 37 to 41 weeks. Among infants whose mothers were induced without medical indication, increased morbidity and length of stay were associated with those delivered electively at less than 39 weeks gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945913484390">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913484390">Engle &amp; Kominiarek, 2008</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945913484390">Gouyon et al. (2010)</xref>, neonatal morbidity and related health care costs decrease weekly until the marker of 39 completed gestational weeks. These documented differences in neonatal outcomes across gestational weeks have inspired the emergence of the classification “early term” in the obstetric and pediatric literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913484390">Engle &amp; Kominiarek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945913484390">Fleischman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Shifting Trend in Gestational Ages</title>
<p>The impact of ET birth is becoming more evident as the average duration of human gestation in the United States shortens. Birth rates for both the 34-to-36-week and 37-to-39-week groups have increased, whereas births beyond 40 weeks are decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945913484390">Davidoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). In the 10 years from 1992 to 2002, the average gestational age shifted dramatically from 40 to 39 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913484390">Damus, 2008</xref>). This shift was concurrent with “a significant decline in spontaneous vaginal births and a 41% increase in interventions (i.e. inductions and cesareans) with no change in preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) rate of about 3%” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945913484390">Damus, 2008</xref>, p. 591). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945913484390">Engle and Kominiarek (2008)</xref> purport that the gestational length shift can be linked to a wide variety of factors including the erroneous belief by health care providers and pregnant women that fetal maturity occurs at 34 weeks gestation, maternal autonomy, and practice patterns including elective induction or cesarean section without maternal–fetal indication. One driving force behind the growing phenomenon of maternal requests for scheduled delivery is the perceived benefit of controlling the timing of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484390">Oshiro et al., 2009</xref>). Although it is widely held that most mothers would make health care decisions based on the likelihood of optimum outcomes for their infants, the majority of women have not been apprised of the dangers of ET birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945913484390">Sinha, Bewley, &amp; McIntosh, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945913484390">
<title>Practice Patterns</title>
<p>Physician practice patterns such as induction and cesarean section directly affect the timing of deliveries and consequently neonatal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484390">Oshiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913484390">The Ohio Perinatal Quality Collaborative Writing Committee, 2010</xref>). A 15-year longitudinal study of physician practice patterns with the subject of cesarean section as the exemplar revealed a greater variation within health care markets, as opposed to across markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913484390">Epstein &amp; Nicholson, 2009</xref>). Analysis of adjusted cesarean section rates by an individual physician revealed that gender, race, and location of obstetrical residency program only minimally affect physicians’ treatment styles. Epstein and Nicholson interpreted that almost 30% “of practice variation is due to idiosyncratic physician perceptions regarding the appropriateness of specific treatments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945913484390">2009</xref>, p. 1127).</p>
<p>Recent research increasingly suggests that practice patterns affecting neonatal outcomes such as induction of labor and cesarean section should be explored. A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945913484390">Mozurkewich, Chilimigras, Koepke, Keeton, and King (2009)</xref> reported that widely utilized practice patterns involving induction of labor are not grounded in scientific evidence. A Dutch retrospective study of more than 20,000 cesarean sections of singletons spanning 7 years revealed a 50% elective induction rate accompanied by significantly higher neonatal morbidity and mortality among the &lt;39 weeks gestational age cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945913484390">Wilmink et al., 2010</xref>). This comprehensive research elicits the question of whether interventions exist that can positively affect practice patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945913484390">Macones, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945913484390">The Ohio Perinatal Quality Collaborative Writing Committee (2010)</xref> effort that resulted in a reduction of rates of elective delivery without medical indication for gestations of 36 0/7 through 38 6/7 weeks gestation from 25% to less than 5% suggests that physician practice patterns are amenable to change.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the research study was to explore ET birth trends across hospitals as well as the impact of provider practice patterns for elective inductions and cesarean deliveries on those trends. Rates of NICU admission for ET versus FT infants provided insight regarding immediate neonatal outcomes by gestational age.

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0193945913484390">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A retrospective secondary data analysis was utilized to explore the ET births in all hospitals of a large southwestern county where birth rates are among the highest in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945913484390">Texas Department of State Health Services [TDSHS], 2010</xref>). Birth certificate (BC) data for deliveries of singleton infants without congenital anomalies at 37 0/7 to 41 gestational weeks were analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945913484390">TDSHS, 2009</xref>). This data set facilitated comparisons between ET births (37 0/7-38 6/7 weeks) and those births occurring at 39 completed weeks through 41 completed weeks gestations by hospital. Hospital coding was maintained as confidential information that will not be published but will foster insight into practice patterns affecting gestational age outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945913484390">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>All county BC data for 2008-2009 comprised the accessible population. BCs of single live infants with gestational ages from 37 weeks through 41weeks were included. BC data from multifetal pregnancies, pregnancies resulting in infants born with major birth anomalies, and infants born at less than 37 weeks and greater than 41weeks were excluded. The total number of BCs in the study sample was 75,625. The range of births represented in this cohort by hospital was 228 to 25,544, with a mean of 4,727, median of 3,092, and standard deviation of 6,244. Approval was obtained through the TDSHS Institutional Review Board. The TDSHS removed all identifying infant, maternal, and paternal information.</p>
<p>This research study reflects data for 16 hospitals in the county with obstetrical services during the years 2008 and 2009, although two of them represented here have been purchased by or merged into other entities. Of the 16 hospitals, only 4 are designated as “for-profit,” while the remaining 12 are “not for profit”; 2 of them are considered primarily teaching institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945913484390">TDSHS, 2012</xref>). The number of licensed beds per facility ranged from 60 to 852. The mean number of licensed beds was 359, with a median of 251 and a standard deviation of 260 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945913484390">TDSHS, 2012</xref>). Six of the hospitals do not have their own NICU. Newborns delivered at those facilities in need of intensive care services were transferred out to neighboring hospitals equipped with the appropriate resources. The hospitals reflect an eclectic mix of payors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945913484390">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>BCs are federally devised documents designed to gather population data on births and issue an abbreviated certificate of live birth to parents documenting their infant’s citizenship. A list of all demographic and health-related variables recorded on the Texas Certificate of live birth form can be obtained through the TDSHS website. The certificate is completed in hospitals and birth delivery sites, entered into a standardized computer program, and transmitted to a local office that issues the BC to parents and to the state department. All states compile the data annually and transmit it to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS, a part of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), uses the data for analysis and reporting of national maternal and fetal health trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945913484390">Northam, Polancich, &amp; Restrepo, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Criterion validity studies of BC data compared the data with the medical record, which is considered the gold standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945913484390">Ananth, 2005</xref>). Errors have been documented in gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945913484390">Martin, 2007</xref>) and obstetric procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945913484390">Schoendorf &amp; Branum, 2005</xref>), which are variables this study will evaluate. Systematic error that may undermine validity is recognized as a limitation when BC data are used (NCHS, 2001). Despite the shortcomings of BC data, the involvement of experts in its development and revisions, the use of a consistent form by all states, the rejection of incomplete forms, and the training required of data collectors foster reliability and validity of the data. When used to gain a broad perspective about a perinatal phenomenon, such as rates of ET birth, use of BCs is appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945913484390">Roohan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945913484390">Siri &amp; Cork, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0193945913484390">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to assess maternal demographics, including age, education, ethnicity, marital status, and payer status. These variables were analyzed for the general study population as well as the two cohorts who incurred either elective inductions or elective cesareans at 37 to 38 weeks gestation. Gestational age based on data reported in Line 59 of the Texas BC was utilized to categorize ET and FT births for each hospital in the county with obstetrical services. Frequencies of ET births (37-38 weeks) for each hypothesis were calculated as a proportion of total births from 37 through 41 weeks; subsequently, chi-square analyses were used to ascertain if differences exist between hospitals for each of the four hypotheses addressed The hypotheses involving NICU admissions were explored in terms of inductions and cesareans separately.</p>
<p>Specific maternal health conditions and obstetric complications were conceptualized as conservative indicators of acceptable risk for the induction of labor. Those cases that demonstrated acceptable risk of induction were excluded from the population for Hypothesis 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913484390">Table 1</xref>). Following exclusion of cases, chi-square analysis was done to compare the differences among hospitals for the remaining elective inductions occurring for ET infants versus the FT infant cohort.</p>

<p>Acceptable maternal–fetal indicators for cesarean delivery were also established from a conservative perspective. All the aforementioned acceptable indicators of risk factors for induction were combined with complications of labor, including chorioamnionitis, moderate to heavy meconium, nonvertex presentation, induction, augmentation, prolonged labor, fetal intolerance to labor, failed forceps, failed vacuum, and previous cesarean, to create the operational definition of the acceptable indicators for cesarean delivery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945913484390">Table 1</xref>). This population at low risk for surgical birth was identified after all those cases with any identifiable risk factor were removed. Subsequently, a chi-square test of independence comparison for differences in rates of cesarean section by hospital for ET versus FT infants was conducted.</p>

<title>Demographics of Study Population</title>
<p>The complete data set of births from the large southwestern U.S. study county during 2008 and 2009 contained 85,272 cases. The study population consisted of 75,625 BCs for deliveries occurring at 37 to 41 weeks gestation. The maternal age range was 12 through 55 years. More than half of the births were to mothers between 20 and 29 years of age. Nearly one third of the mothers were 30 through 39 years old at the time of delivery. More than 43% of the maternal population achieved either their Graduation Equivalency Diploma (GED) or their high school diploma as their ultimate education. Baccalaureate education was completed by 13% of the mothers. The study cohort comprised more than 50% Hispanic mothers, which is considerably higher than the comparative national average of one third of the birthing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>); White (23.6%) and Black (18.1%) ethnicities cumulatively contributed to just over 40% of the study population. Only slightly more than half (52.2%) of the study group mothers were married, compared with 59% of married mothers nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Payor distribution for the study group was primarily divided into three classifications: private insurance (42%), Medicaid (35.7%) and self-pay (21.8%).</p>

<title>Hypothesis 1: Among County Hospitals, There Are Different Rates of ET Births</title>
<p>Based on chi-square analysis, the expected proportion of ET births to FT births was 34.6 ET:65.4 FT (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913484390">Table 2</xref>).

The lowest proportion of ET birth (22%) was found at Hospital A. The highest proportion of ET delivery occurred at Hospital O where 47.9% of their deliveries within the Estimated Gestational Age (EGA) range of 37 to 41 transpired between 37 and 38 weeks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ET births comprised 30.7% of the complete 2008-2009 data set for the county. This is approximately 3% higher than the national average of 27.7 for the same years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). When viewed solely as a proportion of singleton births without congenital anomalies from the 37-to-41-week gestation population, the percentage rose to 34.6 ET infants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945913484390">Table 2</xref>). These ET births that appear to occur for reasons outside of medical indications have been referred to as “iatrogenic” deliveries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913484390">Murthy, Grobman, Lee, &amp; Holl, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The wide variance of the proportion of ET births to FT births by hospital of 22% to 47.9% suggests that a variety of practice patterns are involved. These disparate findings provide evidence of the unique <italic>system</italic> component in the QHOM. Teaching institutions were represented in the above- and below-the-expected-norm category for ET births. Profit status did not appear to produce an impact on ET birth rates. Even hospitals within the county that function under the same corporate umbrella reported significant differences in the occurrence of ET births.</p>
<p>Elective induction of labor has been frequently cited as an antecedent to iatrogenic ET birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913484390">Murthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945913484390">Ohnsorg &amp; Schiff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945913484390">Oshiro et al., 2009</xref>). In 2009, the national average for induction of labor was 23.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>); for the 2 years from 2008 to 2009, the rate of induction for the study group (37-41 weeks gestation) averaged 23%, mirroring the national average. Of the 17,520 inductions that occurred within the study population, 14,060 of those lacked documentation of medical indication; ET infants comprised more than 27% of the induced-without-medical-indication cohort. Even if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945913484390">Bailit’s (2010)</xref> warning is accurate that BCs inflate numbers of elective induction by 11%, more than 12,500 neonates from the study group were potentially induced without cause.</p>
<p>Significant differences between hospitals for the proportions of ET births preceded by elective induction indicate a connection between practice patterns and interventions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945913484390">Murthy et al. (2011)</xref>, the rising rates of electively induced ET births are disproportionate to the degree of change that could be logically associated with “changes in medical practice such as improved dating by ultrasound or a rise in the severity of illness in the gravid population, both suggest that non-medical factors are present and influential” (p. 435.e5). The three hospitals with the largest numbers of deliveries all performed fewer elective inductions of ET infants than the amount expected to be demonstrated by individual hospitals. This could possibly be attributed to the large number of providers on staff at these facilities contributing to the heterogeneity of provider practice patterns. Profit status, teaching status, and corporate affiliation did not demonstrate effects on rates of elective induction of ET infants.</p>
<p>Besides elective induction of labor, elective cesarean delivery is the intervention most frequently associated with iatrogenic ET birth. The 2009 cesarean rate according to the National Center for Vital Statistics was 32.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945913484390">Martin et al., 2011</xref>); the study county reported a 29.1% average cesarean rate for the 2 years 2008-2009. The 37-to-41-week study cohort contained 4,125 cases of cesareans performed without indicated risk. In retrospect, the operational definition of cesarean risk in this study was extremely conservative and likely served to underestimate the frequency of surgical birth done without indication. Inductions and cesareans were conceptualized as mutually exclusive, despite the evidence that labor induction significantly heightens the risk of cesarean delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945913484390">Ehrenthal, Jiang, &amp; Strobino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945913484390">Wilson, Effken, &amp; Butler, 2010</xref>). Yet, no case that began as an induction without risk, even if it ultimately ended in cesarean birth without risk, was included. If these cases had been included, the cesarean without indicated risk population would have potentially grown 17% to 4,988 cases. Another factor that lessened the size of the cesarean-without-risk group was the decision by the researchers to exclude cases of mothers who had prior cesareans. This eliminated the confounding, often contentious, topic of the safety of vaginal birth after cesarean. Subsequently, more than 9,497 cases were eliminated from the study population before any other risks were evaluated. Of that eliminated group, repeat cesareans resulted in 4,017 ET births. Despite the conservative definition of risk, women in the low-risk population for cesareans experienced differing rates of operative birth across study hospitals. Although statistical differences did exist between the hospitals’ rates of ET infants born by elective cesarean, the similarities are also worth noting. With only three hospitals as outliers from the group, the mean rate of ET infants born surgically without apparent indication for 13 of the 16 hospitals in the county was 40.3% with a standard deviation of 5.75. This finding alone warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The two individual cohorts of mothers induced without risk and those delivered by cesarean without risk were examined for frequency of admission of their newborns to NICUs across hospitals. No statistical difference between study hospitals was noted. The researchers contend that the number of infants in these two samples was again underestimated related to the conservative approach to risk utilized. However, in the analysis of the sheer numbers of infants considered for this hypothesis, it seems fitting to explore the proportion of NICU admissions for ET versus FT births. Although the numbers are conservative based on the aforementioned risk exclusion, we are left with several thousand potential NICU admissions. Percentages then, of ET and FT infants who experience a NICU admission suggest a trend where the ET infants more frequently experience NICU admissions than the FT infants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945913484390">Figure 1</xref> depicts the differences in percentages of ET versus FT infants admitted to the NICU following elective delivery. For elective induction and cesarean, the proportion of infants admitted to the NICU was higher for the ET cohort. Despite the absence of statistical significance of differences in NICU admissions across hospitals, the human and fiscal significance of iatrogenic illness resulting from elective delivery is worthy of consideration. In Texas, maternal–fetal stakeholders have noted the consequences of interventive birth. The Healthy Texas Baby Initiative was launched in 2011 as an effort to decrease perinatal health care costs and improve neonatal outcomes. Eliminating elective birth before 39 weeks has been identified as a key factor in achieving this important goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945913484390">Healthy Texas Babies, 2012</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite the conservative operational definitions of appropriate indications for inductions and cesarean sections, significant differences in rates by hospital were found. This may be a marked underestimate. In the years 2008-2009, more than 5,000 ET infants were delivered in the study county without apparent cause. This finding underscores the probability that practice patterns greatly influence interventions and, subsequently, maternal–newborn outcomes.</p>
<p>Recently, The Joint Commission named elective induction of ET infants without indication as a Perinatal Core Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945913484390">2012</xref>). Such national attention by a well-known accrediting body should cause health care providers and facilities to examine and amend their obstetrical practices accordingly. This study provides a key benchmark for future inquiry to evaluate whether indeed the number of ET inductions decreases in response to The Joint Commission’s influence.</p>
<p>Arguably, decisions about interventions fall primarily to the health care provider and the patient. However, nurses are far from powerless to intercede on behalf of mothers and their unborn. Nursing professionals are held in high esteem by the American public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945913484390">Jones, 2010</xref>). Nurses must harness their collective voice to educate women regarding the current guidelines for optimum maternal–newborn outcomes and the associated potentially negative sequelae of interventive birth without indication. When viewed in light of the QHOM, nurses, as members of a predominantly female profession, simultaneously embody the powerful dual roles of system and client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945913484390">McAlister, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, this positions nurses as uniquely suited stakeholders, responsible for creatively advocating optimal maternal–fetal care.</p>
