<abstract>
<p>It is widely accepted that customers derive value through resource integration, by integrating their own resources with those provided by organization and other network actors. This perspective implies that customers must acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to be effective resource integrators as they engage in activities that facilitate or create value. Supporting customer learning, then, is a pressing new challenge for firms that recognize customers engage in resource integration in the course of their value-creating processes. This article builds on an interactive model of self-directed learning to develop a model of customer learning for resource integration that identifies the characteristics of learning contexts, interactive elements of the learning process and links learning to customers' effectiveness in resource integration activities. A future research agenda is set out, organized around the elements of our conceptualization that can generate much required managerial insights into the interactive process-based nature of customer learning and customers' effectiveness as resource integrators. For practitioners who recognize the resource integration roles customers play, the authors raise a set of questions that will assist in developing marketing programs that support customer learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ideas around value creation and cocreation are transforming marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1094670512442805">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670512442805">Sheth and Uslay 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512442805">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670512442805">2008</xref>). There is increasing acceptance among academics and practitioners that value is created by customers for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670512442805">Heinonen et al. 2010</xref>) and that organizations have opportunities to support value-creating processes by providing resources that customers can deploy independently or during interactions with service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512442805">Grönroos 2011</xref>). One important implication of this perspective is that customers must acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to be effective resource integrators as they engage in activities that facilitate or create value. Part of an organization’s supportive role, then, is to support customer learning. Many commercial firms such as Home Depot, Nikon, Charles Schwab, and Weight Watchers have already developed learning resources for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670512442805">Bitner et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512442805">Honebein and Cammarano 2005</xref>). Common tools include traditional media such as professional advice, seminars, advertising, frequently asked questions, and booklets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670512442805">Burton 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1094670512442805">Xie, Bagozzi, and Troye 2008</xref>), and new media including online videos and simulations. Companies can also facilitate the exchange of information and knowledge with and among customers via blogs and forums (e.g., eBay, Microsoft; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670512442805">Bitner et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670512442805">Dholakia et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512442805">Gruen, Osmonbekov, and Czaplewski 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1094670512442805">Nambsian and Baron 2007</xref>). However, there has been a lack of theoretical development to explain the processes by which customers learn to be effective resource integrators and a lack of guidance for organizations that want to develop strategies to support customer learning as a means of enhancing their competitiveness. In this article, we address this gap in the emergent literature on customer value creation and take the first step in developing a model that will enable organizations to analyze the factors that drive and shape learning in specific contexts and to build an understanding of customers' learning processes that will lead to more effective resource integration.</p>
<p>Recognition that customer learning is important for successful marketing is not new. The service management literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670512442805">Bitner et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1094670512442805">Lovelock and Young 1979</xref>) has long acknowledged that organizational effectiveness is dependent on customers being motivated and able to develop skills and knowledge that facilitate customer participation in service delivery. Curiously, research into customer learning has not been prominent within the field of service marketing and there is only a small body of literature that has examined the relationship between customer learning and participation, which includes studies of customer socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670512442805">Evans, Stan, and Murray 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512442805">Groth 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512442805">Kelley, Skinner, and Donnelly 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512442805">Lengnick-Hall, Claycomb, and Inks 2000</xref>), customer education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670512442805">Burton 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512442805">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670512442805">Honebein and Cammarano 2005</xref>), customer training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>), strategic communication of customer skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670512442805">Hennig-Thurau 2000</xref>), and initial postpurchase learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512442805">Mittal and Sawhney 2001</xref>). Despite the various labels, this range of studies has shared the common goal of understanding how customers learn to perform participative roles and has provided valuable insights. However, a clear managerial ethos has underpinned this research; studies have typically conceived customer participation in its narrow sense, “which includes only required behaviors necessary for the successful service creation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1094670512442805">Yi, Nataraajan, and Gong 2010</xref>:88) and have concentrated on the effectiveness of firm-generated, one-way communications to educate or train customers. Hence, this literature has limited potential to inform understanding of customer learning that enhances a customer’s resource integration processes.</p>
<p>While firms can play an important role in supporting customer learning, customers are not passive recipients of firm-provided education. We recognize customers to be agentic actors who operate within contemporary communications landscapes that offer access to a wide range of learning resources. We depart from previous literature that regards customers as exchange partners who are “educated” or “trained” by firms. Instead, we conceptualize learning as a “customer-controlled” process by which they build their capacity to be effective resource integrators. Accordingly, we advance a theoretical framework grounded in the principles of self-directed learning (SDL; Tough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512442805">1971</xref>) and synthesized with the conceptualization of resource integration processes. Building on an interactive model of SDL advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref>, which accounts for cognitive, emotional, and volitional elements of learning, we set out a model of customer learning for resource integration that identifies the characteristics of learning situations, interactive elements of the learning process and links learning to customers' effectiveness in resource integration activities.</p>
<p>In the following section, we introduce the notion of customer value creation and review prior literature that has examined the relationship between customer learning and participation before considering the role of customer learning as a means to improve their effectiveness as resource integrators. We then present our theoretical framework before setting out a future research agenda and considering the management challenges associated with developing programs to support customer learning.</p>

<title>Learning to Create Value</title>
<p>Recent marketing scholarship has challenged the firm-centric view of markets in which firms create goods and services for exchange and use/consumption by customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1094670512442805">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000</xref>). A key criticism centers on the preoccupation with exchange in traditional marketing paradigms, which has led to undue focus on the role suppliers as sellers and customers as buyers. Meanwhile, the other roles played by customers, firms, and other network actors, which generate different types of value, have been neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670512442805">Sheth and Uslay 2007</xref>). Customers play a variety of roles including designer, manufacturer, chooser, order processor, negotiator, payer, consumer/user, quality controller, maintainer, repairer, and disposer (Frow et al. 2010; Storbacka and Lehtinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670512442805">2001</xref>) as they undertake activities that create value in their own right (e.g., taking a canoeing trip on vacation) or are instrumental in achieving value later on (e.g., decorating a room to facilitate aesthetic, emotional, and social value in consumption). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512442805">Grönroos (2011)</xref> usefully distinguishes between such activities as value creation and value facilitation activities. While we recognize this distinction, we use the term “value creation” to refer to both types of activity for ease of reference.</p>
<p>Considering how customers create value, scholars have come to regard them as resource integrators. Initially, only firms were recognized to be resource integrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512442805">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>) but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670512442805">Arnould, Price, and Malshe (2006)</xref> argued that whereas firms regard customers as operant resources, the reverse is true of customers who regard firms as one of the various sources of resources available to draw upon to achieve their goals. And so it was quickly acknowledged that consumers and households also have value networks (e.g., social ties, consumption communities, media, and other firms) and similarly perform a resource integration role (Lusch and Vargo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094670512442805">2006</xref>). Drawing on resource-based theory, strategic marketers have differentiated between operant resources, which include skills, knowledge, competences, values, and ideologies, and operand resources that are the material resources that are “acted upon” by operant resources to produce effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512442805">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>). Focusing on consumers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670512442805">Arnould, Price, and Malshe (2006)</xref> distinguish between cultural, social, and physical operant resources and between the material possessions and physical spaces that constitute their economic, operand resources. Customer resource integration refers to “the processes by which customers deploy their resources as they undertake bundles of activities that create value directly or that will facilitate subsequent consumption/use from which they derive value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512442805">Arnould 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670512442805">Baron and Harris 2008</xref>). When they have insufficient personal resources, they turn to resources afforded by organizations and other network actors. As will be discussed later in the article, we define customer resource integration effectiveness, as <italic>customers' proficiency in deploying resources as they engage in value-generating processes.</italic>
</p>
<p>There is some debate about the claim that customer are always cocreators of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670512442805">Vargo and Lusch 2008</xref>), for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512442805">Grönroos (2011)</xref> argues that value is only cocreated when customer resource integration occurs within interactive service processes, whereas their use of goods within self-service processes is simply a value creation process. But, there is general agreement that the generation of value is a customer-centric process. The firm’s role, then, becomes one of facilitator, supporter, and collaborator in customer value creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670512442805">Normann 2001</xref>) and there is a need to understand how it can aid customers, contributing to the pool of resources that they have at their disposal and assisting them in using those resources. This perspective stems from long-standing arguments advanced by service researchers that the distinction between goods and services is a false one and that marketers need to regard their offerings in terms of the service that they render (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670512442805">Gummesson 1995</xref>). However, an important implication of the assumption that customers control value creation processes is that they need adequate knowledge and skill to be able to use available resources. Hence, another key role for organizations is to support customer learning in order that they can use available resources effectively as they pursue their projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512442805">Arnould 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512442805">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>). While marketing scholars have recognized the importance of customer learning to facilitate value creation, research is required to understand the processes by which customers learn and how these processes impact customers' capacity for resource integration.</p>
<p>In addressing these questions, we extend the lineage of service research into customer learning and participation. As detailed below, previous research into customer learning within the service management tradition has various limitations in terms of its applicability to customer resource integration processes. Here, we consider customer learning afresh in light of the conceptualization of resource integration and value creation. Previous research that has examined the customer learning participation relationship can be split into three phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670512442805">Dong, Evans, and Zou 2008</xref>). Early research considered educational inputs as a means to solicit customer participation in place of employee labor (Mills and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094670512442805">1986</xref>), with a focus on the productivity gains for the firm. In a second phase of research scholars moved on to consider how customers could be managed as “partial employees” and applied employee management models to build understanding of ways to improve participation and satisfaction with the outcomes. Drawing from theories of organizational socialization, research examined the potential of customer socialization (i.e., building appreciation of an organization’s values, norms, and required patterns of behavior) to improve service quality and sought to identify psychological and behavioral mediators and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670512442805">Claycombe et al. 2001</xref>; Dabholkar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670512442805">1990</xref>; Kelley, Donnelly, and Skinner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670512442805">1990</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, research has examined the effectiveness of firms' educational inputs in encouraging and facilitating customers' performance of in-role behaviors (e.g., use of self-service technologies (SST), adherence to a diet) necessary for successful service outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>). Researchers have drawn on various theories and streams of literature including social learning theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670512442805">Bandura 1977</xref>), role theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670512442805">Biddle 1986</xref>), services marketing literature, technology adoption, and employee management literature. Together, these studies have produced a reasonable amount of empirical evidence that educating customers has positive impacts on customer participation in service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512442805">Groth 2005</xref>). More specifically, studies have identified features of learning resources (e.g., source credibility, argument quality) that increase educational effectiveness and have evidenced the impact on behavioral (e.g., customer compliance, actual and intended usage, task performance) and psychological (e.g., satisfaction, emotional value) outcomes and relationship development (e.g., customer loyalty; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512442805">Beuningen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512442805">Mittal and Sawhney 2001</xref>). Research that has examined mediating processes has shown that role readiness variables (e.g., role clarity, self-efficacy/ability, motivation) and relational factors (e.g., trust and satisfaction with learning resources) are key evaluative processes that follow from customers' use of learning resources to influence their participative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512442805">Beuningen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this research has provided valuable contributions, it has limitations for understanding customer learning to facilitate resource integration. One key issue is that a narrow, firm-centric view of customer learning has been predominant within previous literature. Hitherto, research has been underpinned by a clear managerial ethos; it has typically investigated the effects of firm-generated communications through a single channel (e.g., written instructions, demonstrations, interactions with sales staff) seeking to find tools to promote and enable customer participation in service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>) or simply to instruct customers on how to perform roles as prescribed by the firm (i.e., for coproduction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>). This research has provided some insights on how to support customer learning but it fails to recognize that firms are just one source of learning resources within the contemporary communications landscape. With advances in information technology, there has been a proliferation of channels through which customers can access educational content from a variety of sources (e.g., other customers, independent experts) and many more opportunities for interactive communications have opened up. For example, a customer trying to repair an appliance might consult instructions on the supplier’s website, ask for and read tips on online forums and watch an illustration shown on YouTube.</p>
<p>A second limitation of prior research is that it regards customers as passive subjects. There is an implicit assumption that when firms provide education or training customers use it. But customers are not simply “acted upon” by firms; they are agentic actors and to understand customer learning, it is vital to acknowledge that customers are in control and selectively manage which resources to use to meet their unique learning goals. They also regulate how much of their own resources (e.g., time, effort, mental, and emotional energy) to invest in learning activities. As indicated above, a variety of theories and bodies of literature have been drawn upon to conceptualize the relationship between customer learning and participation but theory development has focused on characterizing key features of educational inputs and customers' evaluation of learning outcomes rather than understanding the drivers and nature of learning activities. Surprisingly, service marketing literature has not tapped into recent scholarship on teaching and learning where it is now widely acknowledged that learning occurs within rich learning environments and that an individual plays an active and independent role in his or her learning (Scheerens, Bosker, and Creemers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512442805">2010</xref>). In the field of education, attention has shifted from its previous focus on teaching effectiveness. Contemporary models of learning conceptualize learning as self-directed and attend to the important issues of learning motivation, affect, and volition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512442805">Merriam, Caffarella and Baumgartner 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094670512442805">Valle et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we work toward a framework for understanding customer learning for resource integration. Moving away from a focus on the effectiveness of firms' educational inputs, we consider learning as a customer-centric process that takes place within a rich and varied learning environment. We assume that customers are in control of their own learning processes, motivated by the value anticipated when they are able to proceed with resource integration processes (outcome-based value) and/or the value derived from the learning activity itself (process-based value). We acknowledge that research is also needed to examine how customer learning affords opportunities for firms to be educated by customers and, so, contributes to the cycle of value augmentation. Accordingly, our discussion highlights elements of our framework that provide relevant insights. But we do not address this issue in detail, as a separate approach is required to rigorously examine how firms learn from customers to improve various business processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094670512442805">Sawhney, Verona, and Prandelli 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>An Agentic View of Customer Learning</title>
<p>To build understanding of customers learning processes, we draw on theories of SDL. Adults' nonformal, intentional learning practices have been studied over four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512442805">Tough 1971</xref>). They are considered to be self-directed in that they are initiated and controlled by the individual. Context-specific learning episodes are referred to as self-directed learning projects (SDLPs), defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512442805">Tough (1971)</xref> as “deliberative efforts to gain certain knowledge or skill or to change in some other way” (p. 1). Early research demonstrated that many of the SDLPs that people undertake are work-related or vocational and the concept has been widely applied to gain insights into performance improvements in the field of human resource development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512442805">Ellinger 2004</xref>), including sales force management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670512442805">Artis and Harris 2007</xref>). Customers similarly undertake SDLPs to develop the knowledge and skills to undertake various activities from relatively simple endeavors to more complex ones. The resources that customers deploy to be able to learn include both their own operant (e.g., intelligence, imagination) and operand resources (e.g., books, technological devices) and the operant (e.g., specialist knowledge, skills as mentors or coaches) and operand resources (e.g., simulation software) afforded by organizations and other network actors. It is through integration of these resources in the course of learning processes that customers are able to develop their knowledge and skills for other resource integration activities. Hence, we conceive of customer SDLPs as resource integration activities in their own right, that is, customer learning resource integration defined as: <italic>any self-initiated or self-directed set of activities in which customers integrate learning resources afforded by organizations and other network actors with their own operant and operand resources with the primary purpose of learning in order to increase their effectiveness in other resource integration processes</italic>.</p>
<p>Early conceptions of SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512442805">Knowles 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670512442805">Tough 1971</xref>) suggested that individual and environmental factors promote or inhibit SDL and that, once initiated, SDL follows a linear process. Within organizational contexts, motivation, self-efficacy beliefs and learning strategies, or styles have been identified as important individual determinants of SDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670512442805">Farr and Middlebrooks 1990</xref>; Warr and Bunce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094670512442805">1995</xref>) while environmental influences on SDL include learning options, learning resources available and support within organizational settings (Confessore and Kops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512442805">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>). Several scholars have sketched the process of SDL, which typically involves a sequence of climate setting, diagnosing learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670512442805">Knowles 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1094670512442805">Tough 1978</xref>). There is however compelling evidence that SDL is less a function of individual factors than context and that learning does not follow a neat linear process that is carefully planned. Reviews of the SDL literature have highlighted that research into individual determinants of SDL has produced mixed and inconclusive findings (Caffarella and O’Donnell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670512442805">1987</xref>). Candy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670512442805">1991</xref>) reported that, while individual differences undoubtedly influence people’s SDL intentions, their explanatory power is limited and he argued that situational factors are stronger determinants of the learning activities that people undertake. Further support for this view comes from qualitative analyses of SDLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670512442805">Berger 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512442805">Rager 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>), which have found that learning projects are typically triggered when individuals find themselves in situations in which they are motivated or compelled to learn. For instance, none of the participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512442805">Rager’s (2003)</xref> study of women with breast cancer indicated that their learning activities were preplanned. Once events had provided the impetus for their SDLPs, the courses of action that the women pursued were largely dictated by circumstances—referred to by Spear and Mocker as “organizing circumstances”—and did not follow a linear progression. Such findings have strengthened the view that SDL is an interactive process involving various steps that may be repeated over the course of a learning project as individuals direct and regulate their learning but that are not performed sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670512442805">Cavaliere 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512442805">Rager 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670512442805">Valente 2005</xref>). Several models that reflect this interactive learning process have been advanced in the SDL literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512442805">Brockett and Hiemstra 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670512442805">Garrison 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670512442805">Spear 1988</xref>). To develop our understanding of customer learning, we draw on a model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref>, who elaborates on previous models by drawing on theories of learning self-regulation to offer a refined view of the motivational, cognitive, and volitional elements of the learning process.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512442805">Figure 1</xref>
, we outline a model of customer learning processes that facilitate resource integration. The three main components of the model are (1) the characteristics of learning contexts, (2) the learning resource integration process, and (3) customer resource integration effectiveness. Our discussion of the model, below, draws on SDL and marketing literature on value creation to provide an overview of the key factors within each part of the model and considers points of comparison with the extant service research into customer learning.</p>

<title>The Characteristics of Learning Contexts</title>
<p>When early qualitative studies indicated that there was no preplanning involved in many SDLPs, scholars started to ask “How do learners get started on their learning?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>). Interactive models of SDL that were subsequently advanced typically acknowledged that some kind of trigger event (e.g., a life event, a new operating system) provides the impetus for learning when an individual is motivated by internal or external incentives (Robertson and Merriam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512442805">2005</xref>). It was also recognized that conditions must be conducive to learning, that is, individuals' must have the capacity (e.g., past knowledge) and opportunity (e.g., access to learning resources) to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670512442805">Spear 1988</xref>). These three elements feature within people’s initial cognitive-motivational appraisal of learning opportunities. With few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512442805">Beuningen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512442805">Gruen, Osmonbekov, and Czaplewski 2006</xref>) prior research into customer learning, which has centered on the effectiveness of customer education provided by firms, has neglected the issues of whether customers are motivated to learn. As a consequence, understanding of the appraisal processes that precede learning remains a major gap in the service marketing literature.</p>
<p>In applying this framework to the context of customers learning, we propose that value creation opportunities constitute contextual triggers for customer learning which, together with environmental and personal factors, shape subsequent learning processes. We recognize that these factors may interact with one another but understanding of such interactions requires an in-depth program of research that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<sec id="section5-1094670512442805">
<title>Value Creation Opportunities: Trigger Events for Learning</title>
<p>Individuals' goals, rooted in a value system, provide incentives for and guide their behavior. The value that customers seek is phenomenologically defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670512442805">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>) and encompasses various benefits (i.e., functional, social, emotional, epistemic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670512442805">Holbrook 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094670512442805">Sheth, Newman, and Gross 1991</xref>) and sacrifice dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1094670512442805">Zeithaml 1988</xref>). When individuals enact behaviors that make them better-off in some respect, they do so by applying their own resources and by drawing on facilitative resources afforded by organizations and other network actors in either self-service processes or through interactive encounters with service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670512442805">Grönroos 2011</xref>). These opportunities to create value act as trigger events for learning when individuals are motivated by potential value benefits but lack the knowledge or skills to make effective use of the resources that they need to deploy in value-generating processes.</p>
<p>Scholarship that has examined differences between learning projects has indicated that trigger events vary in the degree to which learning is compelled by another party (e.g., a firm) or driven by an intrinsic interest, whether or not people anticipate the need to learn, and whether an SDLP will involve a single learning episode or a series of learning episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512442805">Clardy 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>). With regard to value creation contexts, there are differences between resource integration opportunities in terms of each of these factors that would similarly be expected to impact on subsequent learning processes.</p>
<p>Customer learning undertaken to develop the knowledge and skills to engage in resource integration activities varies considerably in the extent to which it is compelled or intrinsically driven. The principle that customers selectively manage resource integration, choosing which resources to use and how to expend their own resources, implies that customers elect to learn when it delivers value benefits. This applies to situations such as an individual learning to use a photo editor, when he or she is intrinsically motivated or, at least, identifies with the personal importance of learning due to its instrumentality for achieving higher order goals (Ryan and Deci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670512442805">2000</xref>). Arguably, customers should not be compelled to learn; if they do not want to learn, then there is an opportunity for suppliers to relieve customers of the task. However, customers often have limited options in the marketplace (e.g., cost or access restrict them to certain suppliers), they are heavily committed to a particular resource (e.g., they have paid for a good or service and are at a stage of creating value through usage, maintenance, or repair) or service benefits cannot be derived without their input (e.g., health). Learning to use a firm’s resources may be demanding but customers try to learn because choosing <italic>not to learn</italic> is too costly in terms of the overall value generation. In addition, customer learning varies in terms of customers' expectations of whether and how much they will need to learn. For instance, customers may not expect to have to learn to use updated software or, at least, they may not anticipate the nature or level of personal resources that need to be invested to be able to use it effectively. A primary concern for organizations that seek to support customer learning is to identify roles (e.g., design, use, maintenance) for which their customers are motivated or compelled to learn, do or do not expect to learn, and how they are influenced by features of products (including level of complexity and customization), markets, channels (including service design), and marketing relationships. Prior research has emphasized that customer learning is necessary and expected in contexts characterized by technically complex goods and services and new markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094670512442805">Meuter et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1094670512442805">Mittal and Sawhney 2001</xref>), but research is needed for more comprehensive scoping of contextual factors that influence learning for resource integration. From the firm’s perspective, it is preferable to avoid compelling customers to learn when they are unmotivated or daunted by the prospect and, instead, to account for customer preferences and capabilities in designing service systems. However, if it is necessary due to constraints on the service system design, it is vital to understand how customer learning is affected when they feel compelled to learn and examine the implications for supporting learning.</p>
<p>It is also useful to distinguish trigger events for learning in value creation contexts that are single events as opposed to one of a series of events that, over time, contribute to a broader set of learning goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>) as the “organizing circumstances” for an earlier event tend to influence individuals' approach to subsequent learning. Learning to garden or to self-manage a health condition for example, is achieved through a number of learning episodes. Customers develop expectations about ways to learn to cocreate based on initial learning episodes, which may be difficult to change in the event that effective learning in subsequent episodes requires a different approach. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512442805">Clardy (2000)</xref> reported that some individuals engage in “scanning,” that is, ongoing learning activities stemming from a deep interest in a particular domain. This extended multiepisode learning activity is of vital importance for value cocreation scholarship, as customers who are highly committed to learning over time are most likely to derive value from instructing other customers or educating the firm. Given that previous customer education research has typically focused on single learning episodes (e.g., for an online purchase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670512442805">Groth 2005</xref>), there is little understanding of how learning practices and processes develop across multiple learning episodes and for customers who engage in “scanning.”</p>

<sec id="section6-1094670512442805">
<title>Features of the Learning Environment</title>
<p>Features of the learning environment that influence customers' learning processes include learning opportunities, resources, and support (Confessore and Kops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512442805">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512442805">Ellinger 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670512442805">Spear and Mocker 1984</xref>). Learning opportunities are afforded by structural factors, such as access to libraries, local organizations, online forums and time available for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670512442805">Ellinger 2004</xref>), or chance events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670512442805">Spear 1988</xref>) like meeting an old friend with interests relevant to a learning opportunity. Learning resources are suggested to include the human and material learning resources that are available for customers to draw upon, including support in the form of coaching, mentoring, guidance, and feedback available from instructors and through peer collaboration and communication (Robertson and Merriam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670512442805">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670512442805">Song and Hill 2007</xref>). SDL emphasizes that learning is socially situated; it is interactive and cooperative and learners learn from other learners, instructors, peer groups, and so on, often becoming members of communities that benefit from shared experience and reflexivity. There is ample evidence that these factors influence SDL in work contexts. For instance, scholarship has demonstrated the importance of encouraging open communication channels and information systems, training policies that support flexible learning, facilitation of new learning, and the role of supervisors and managers in creating conditions that support learning by serving as coaches, mentors, and learning facilitators and providing multisource feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670512442805">Beattie 2006</xref>; Confessore and Kops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670512442805">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512442805">Ellinger, Ellinger, and Keller 2003</xref>). With regard to customers, a key question concerns the nature of learning environments that motivate and facilitate learning for different customer segments. Previous service research into customer learning has addressed immediate managerial questions concerning the features of educational materials that influence effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>) but there has been little attention to the fundamental issues of what types of learning opportunities, resources, and support need to be made available to particular groups of customers. However, whereas learning literature has centered attention on human and informational resources for learning, resource theory would advocate consideration of the full range of organization-based operant and operand resources that can be packaged into training sessions, advice services, simulations, facilities to practice new skills (e.g., a car for driving lessons), trial goods and services, instruction manuals, and so on, to facilitate customer learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1094670512442805">
<title>Personal Factors</title>
<p>Much SDL scholarship has focused on personal attributes of learners that underlie their capacity to learn. This research has produced mixed findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512442805">Merriam, Caffarella, and Baumgartner 2007</xref>). However, there is strong support for the notion of self-directedness or autonomy as a personal characteristic that is conducive to self-motivated and controlled learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670512442805">Brockett and Hiemstra 1991</xref>; Candy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670512442805">1991</xref>). There is a situational element to autonomy in that an individual’s resourcefulness and persistence in SDL varies across contexts. Four key variables that influence an individual’s propensity for SDL include their technical skills related to learning processes, their domain-specific knowledge (knowledge about facts, symbols, conventions, definitions, formulas, concepts, rules, etc), their sense of self-efficacy as a learner and their commitment to learning at the given point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670512442805">Merriam, Caffarella, and Baumgartner 2007</xref>). These dimensions of autonomy, which constitute cultural and physical resources, are expected to be key determinants of customers' learning resource integration activities. However, a resource integration perspective on learning implies that customers' operand resources (e.g., information technology (IT) facilities, transport) and other operant resources (e.g., social ties, commercial relationships, technology readiness) are also among the personal factors that shape learning. Prior customer learning literature has recognized that customers' experience, knowledge, self-efficacy, and involvement are important moderators of the effects of educational inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670512442805">Goodwin 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2008</xref>). Regarding customers as resource integrators, our conceptualization suggests that research should also seek to identify other customer-based resources that shape learning and, as such, are important segmentation variables when considering how to develop learning environments suitable for particular groups of customers.</p>

<title>Learning Resource Integration Processes</title>
<p>Following the cognitive process model of learning developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref> and adapted by Seidel and Shavelson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512442805">2007</xref>), we distinguish five self-regulatory processes to conceptualize the learning resource integration process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670512442805">Figure 1</xref> details the five cognitive activities involved in learning: (a) goal setting, (b) orientation, (c) execution of learning activities, (d) evaluation of the process and results, and (e) regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref> and Seidel and Shavelson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512442805">2007</xref>) acknowledge that learning is not an orderly, time-sequenced process but propose that all components are interrelated. Learning occurs as individuals switch back and forth between cognitive processes. Although starting with goal setting seems reasonable, goal setting may also result from orientation, learning activity, or evaluation. Adoption of this model represents a marked departure from the theoretical frameworks adopted in prior service research on customer learning. Most customer learning research has represented learning as a linear sequence and, because it does not recognize learning to be in the control of the learner, has concentrated almost exclusively on the evaluation component of the learning process, seeking to understand how well customer education has prepared individuals for participative roles. Below we consider five activities inherent to learning to explore learning as a resource integration process.</p>
<sec id="section9-1094670512442805">
<title>Goal Setting</title>
<p>The model assumes that learning is goal-directed and intentional. When trigger events provide an impetus for learning, people either integrate goals set by others (e.g., instructors, marketers) or set their own learning goals (Seidel and Shavelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512442805">2007</xref>). Individuals typically take more ownership of their learning goals as their familiarity with the domain increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670512442805">Creemers 2005</xref>) and when they are process-oriented learners rather than simply motivated by performance (outcome) goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094670512442805">Valle et al. 2003</xref>). In the context of learning for value creation, goals might be set by firms. For instance, firms providing a “getting started” manual with a new product set out basic product knowledge that customers require to be able to use the appliance. Customers may simply adopt the externally set goals because they “have to” learn but, if they are motivated by the new opportunity or circumstance (e.g., an energy company providing Smart Meters), they may take greater control of setting learning goals. Further, there are many situations in which learning is self-initiated and voluntary, in response to either positive prospects (e.g., the chance to improve the performance of an existing appliance motivates learning about a new technology) or constraints (e.g., the high cost for a repair service motivates an individual to learn to mend a product him or herself; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512442805">Clardy 2000</xref>). Whereas learning goals tend to be upper bounded by the attainment of specific new knowledge and skills when people “have to” learn, learning goals are likely to be broader or even open-ended when individuals are more intrinsically motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670512442805">Clardy 2000</xref>). Intrinsically motivated learning is crucial for cocreation as customers who pursue more open-ended learning goals are more likely to be in a position to provide education to the firm that can inform business processes and contribute to improved resources, service design, and value offerings. There is a need for additional research that informs our understanding of the factors motivating customer learning. Studies that examine how features of learning contexts influence motivation will provide initial insights into this issue but for a comprehensive understanding of learning motivation, research is also needed to explore the interplay between learning goals and other elements of the learning process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1094670512442805">
<title>Orientation</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref> suggests that orientation involves an individual mobilizing prior knowledge (gained from similar past experiences or other sources) and considering possible ways to advance toward his or her learning goal. When investigating possible routes, people search for information, social, and material learning resources, identify opportunities for action and plan learning activities. These aspects of orientation would similarly be expected to characterize customer learning processes, but acknowledgment that customers are resource integrators highlights that when individuals search for external learning resources and develop strategies they are cognizant of the personal resources that they can bring to bear in subsequent learning activities (i.e., learning execution). Under some conditions (e.g., when completing an ordering process), learning requires very little planning and most customers are likely to rely on a small range of learning resources that are immediately available in the performance environment. However, in other contexts, particularly where learning is characterized by broader learning goals, customers may draw on an array of learning resources and in such circumstances, it is important for firms to understand learning orientation for different customer segments and identify determinant operant and operand resources. For instance, do customers prefer to speak to a mentor because they lack basic knowledge to make sense of written instructions? Do people use online forums because they do not have transport or child care to enable them to attend a local group meeting? Do customers refer to independent websites because they deem them to be more credible than company websites? Progress in understanding customers' learning orientation has been inhibited by the tendency for customer learning studies to examine the effectiveness of a single educational input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>). Some insights can be drawn from the few studies that have examined features of the learning environment and learning resources that influence customer preference and usage of learning resources. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670512442805">Gruen, Osmonbekov, and Czaplewski (2006)</xref> showed that an individual’s propensity to take advantage of customer-to-customer know-how exchange was influenced by the customer’s perceived opportunity to access forums and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512442805">Beuningen et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated that a customer’s preference for learning resources is influenced by qualities such as credibility of the source and the quality of arguments in the content. However, there are considerable gaps in our understanding of customers' learning orientation and the influences on it.</p>

<title>Execution of Learning Activities</title>
<p>There is a cognitive and volitional dimension to the execution of learning activities, that is, it concerns both the strategies that individuals adopt and their effort and persistence in pursuing those strategies. Social interactions, direct experiences, and information processing are all activities through which individuals develop knowledge and skills (Seidel and Shavelson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670512442805">2007</xref>). There is considerable evidence in teaching and education research that the nature of learning goals is clearly related to the types of strategies adopted and willpower exerted in persisting with learning activities. Research has shown that when individuals' learning goals focus on performance (outcomes) they are more likely to engage less in learning and to use simple information processing strategies, whereas learning-oriented individuals are prone to invest greater effort in learning, to be more persistent and to use deep processing (Dweck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670512442805">1986</xref>; Pintrich and De Groot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670512442805">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670512442805">Seifert 1995</xref>). Customers who enjoy the learning process are likely to invest more effort in developing knowledge but also know-how. For instance, a fashion enthusiast might develop a deep knowledge of a new season’s fashion through elaborate processing of information derived from reading magazines and shopping but also builds know-how for wearing the season’s fashions using online avatars that can be dressed in the new styles and trialing styles with items already in their wardrobe. Scholars have found that executing learning activities is often an emotional process, especially if people struggle to find and use learning resources to achieve learning goals, and emotional reactions and emotional self-control impact persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670512442805">Rager 2003</xref>). Consumer research has devoted considerable attention to consumers' information processing of marketing communications (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670512442805">Petty and Cacioppo’s 1986</xref> model of elaboration likelihood) but, to understand learning for resource integration, information processing needs to be examined alongside issues of effort and persistence in learning. More specifically, recognizing customers to be resource integrators, research is needed to examine how customers' learning activities are influenced by the various personal resources available to them (e.g., social support, emotional control) and to explore how resources afforded by firms and other network actors impact on customers' effort and persistence.</p>

<sec id="section12-1094670512442805">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Evaluation of the process and results of learning is not proposed as a final activity but a diagnostic activity that can lead to renewed orientation, other learning activities or a change in goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis 2003</xref>). Evaluations of learning affect causal attributions and individuals' judgments about their personal control and self-efficacy regarding the task requirements for the current episode as well as expectancies for similar tasks in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1094670512442805">Valle et al. 2003</xref>). Prior customer learning research has made considerable progress in understanding the evaluative element of the learning process. Service management scholarship has shown that, following use of learning resources, customers evaluate their readiness to perform the participatory role at hand, measured via role clarity, self-efficacy/ability, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670512442805">Zaho, Mattila, and Tao 2008</xref>), while recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670512442805">Beuningen et al. (2009</xref>; Beuningen, de Ruyter, and Wetzels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670512442805">2011</xref>) has emphasized that self-efficacy is a primary outcome of learning that motivates customers' behavior. Where learning resources are afforded by the firm, customers reflect on their trust in and satisfaction with the firm and its support for learning, although there are some contradictory findings about the impact of these relational factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670512442805">Challagalla, Venkatesh, and Kohli 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670512442805">Evans, Stan, and Murray 2008</xref>). This provides a valuable starting point for understanding evaluation in the context of learning for resource integration. However, the conceptualization of learning for resource integration requires that evaluations account for different learning outcomes; readiness for resource integration (rather than role readiness, which assumes roles are dictated by the firm) and the value derived from the learning process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670512442805">Hennig-Thurau et al. 2004</xref>). Further, attention is due to how learning evaluation interacts with other elements of the learning process, for instance, if self-efficacy has not increased, do customers revise their learning goals, turn to alternative learning resources and put more effort into learning?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1094670512442805">
<title>Regulation and Monitoring</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670512442805">Bolhuis (2003)</xref> suggests that regulation of the process reflects an individual’s ultimate control over learning. She proposes that regulation has two parts: it involves monitoring the execution of other learning processes and, as such, it is part of the executive activities of setting goals, mobilizing prior knowledge and resources, executing learning activities and evaluating achievements. In addition, it involves regulating the processes as a whole and deciding to change focus from one component to another. Educators can guide learning regulatory processes by providing feedback and support (Pintrich and De Groot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670512442805">1990</xref>). In some consumption settings, customers take sole responsibility for regulating their learning, but organizations are often in a position to contribute, for instance, when doctors advise patients on sources of learning about and managing a medical condition (e.g., suggesting joining the local Parkinson’s group) or computerized systems providing feedback to customers and directing them to new learning resources (e.g., online videos). A range of other network actors might similarly contribute to learning regulation. However, there has been little research pertaining to the regulation and monitoring of learning in consumption settings. Therefore, we have few insights into customers' ability to regulate their own learning and the potential role of other network actors to provide feedback and support.</p>

<title>Customer Resource Integration Effectiveness</title>
<p>In previous studies of customer learning, the direct outcomes have been conceptualized in terms of the quality of customer role performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670512442805">Kelley, Skinner, and Donnelly 1992</xref>), customer compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>), customer participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670512442805">Eisingerich and Bell 2006</xref>), and coproduction (defined as customer participation in service creation and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670512442805">Auh et al. 2007</xref>) or “needed tasks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670512442805">Lengnick-Hall et al. 2000</xref>). Our conceptualization moves on from a service management perspective to recognize that customers engage in learning processes to develop their capacity to use available resources effectively as they pursue their consumption goals and projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670512442805">Arnould 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1094670512442805">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>). We define customer resource integration effectiveness as <italic>customers' proficiency in deploying resources as they engage in value-generating processes.</italic> There are additional factors that influence resource integration processes, such as inadequate operant and operand resources (e.g., malfunctioning equipment, poor-quality products, service failures, lack of physical strength) and situational factors. However, these are beyond the scope of our model and the focus here is on customers' proficiency. Because learning involves several process elements and is conceived as an interactive process, there is not a neat causal relationship between any one element and customer resource integration effectiveness. Rather, research that examines this relationship should explore how each of the five elements of learning and the interplay between them affect customers' capacity to deploy resources.</p>

<title>Research Directions and Practical Implications</title>
<p>Supporting customer learning is a pressing new challenge for firms that recognize that customers engage in resource integration in the course of their value-creating processes. In this article, we have delineated the concept of “customer learning resource integration” and advanced a new framework outlining contextual factors that shape customer learning resource integration, distinguishing elements of the interactive learning process, and linking learning to customers' effectiveness in resource integration. The ideas that we have presented have a number of implications for future research and for practice.</p>
<sec id="section16-1094670512442805">
<title>Future Research Directions</title>
<p>A new program of research is needed to advance understanding of customer learning for resource integration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512442805">Table 1</xref>
 sets out key research questions for future studies, organized around the elements of our conceptualization, that can generate managerial insights. As a matter of priority, research is required to understand features of learning contexts that provide the impetus for learning and shape the learning process, to gain insights into the interactive, process-based nature of customer learning and to understand how it impacts customers' effectiveness as resource integrators.</p>

<p>A primary challenge for future research is the interactive, process-based nature of customer learning for resource integration. These assumptions call for a shift in customer learning research toward more in-depth investigations designed to enable processual and, in some cases, longitudinal, analysis. This type of study is needed to appreciate the interactivity among learning process elements and so obtain a valid view of customer learning resource integration. Processual studies of learning resource integration will be able to explore the broader role of motivation and volition in learning and examine the interplay between learning goals, customers' learning orientation and their persistence and effort in learning. Our conceptualization also recognizes that learning can be an emotional process, especially when customers encounter challenges and threats in the course of executing learning activities. Emotions have not previously been examined in the context of customer learning but they have an important impact on motivation and volition and merit specific attention in future research.</p>
<p>In-depth studies of learning processes will also be able to investigate customers' self-regulation of learning and consider the suitability of particular learning environments for customer segments that differ in terms of their learning skills and capacity to self-manage learning processes. Research in other formal and informal learning contexts (Ellinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670512442805">2003</xref>; Scheerens, Bosker, and Creemers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1094670512442805">2010</xref>) suggests that customers who are confident and capable learners are likely to thrive in learning environments in which the learning opportunities, resources, and support are designed to afford a high degree of customer control over learning. In contrast, customer segments that lack learning capabilities may benefit from a more structured learning environment where the firm or other network actors exert greater control over the learning process. Such studies may also illustrate how learners who differ in their capacity to self-manage learning contribute to the education of firms and other network actors in relation to value creation.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific research questions set out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670512442805">Table 1</xref>, theoretical and empirical research is needed for further conceptual development, including refinement of key constructs. Because much prior customer learning literature has sought to assess the effectiveness of company-generated educational resources, research into factors that characterize the contexts in which customers embark on learning resource integration is sorely lacking. Of the elements of the interactive learning process (goal setting, orientation, execution, evaluation, and regulation/monitoring) outlined in this article, marketing scholars have conceptualized and empirically examined customers' evaluation of learning episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670512442805">Dellande, Gilly, and Graham 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094670512442805">Meuter et al. 2005</xref>) but the conceptualization of learning evaluation within resource integration contexts needs to be adapted and considerable new scholarship is needed to refine the conceptualization of other process elements which, hitherto, have been thoroughly neglected.</p>

<title>Practitioner Issues</title>
<p>Customers engage in learning resource integration because it is vital to facilitate their value-generating processes and, in some contexts, it is gratifying as an activity in its own right. By offering appropriate learning support, firms can improve customer experiences and build relationships with them. Thus, a firm’s customer learning support is a powerful means by which to differentiate their offering in the marketplace and should be treated strategically. Our model provides a framework for firms (and other network actors such as nonprofit service providers and regulators) to understand customer learning and consider how they might support it (e.g., acting as a learning resource hub vs. a contributor within an existing rich learning environment) as a means of facilitating customer resource integration and customer value. The characteristics of learning contexts (i.e., value creation opportunities as learning trigger events, learning environment, and personal factors) offer practitioners a starting point to assess customer learning contexts and to segment customers in terms of their learning capabilities and needs for learning support. The distinction of key learning process elements affords firms a clear conception of the elements of learning that require attention when developing strategies to support customer learning. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1094670512442805">Table 2</xref>

<p>In making decisions about ways to support customer learning firms also need to think how customers' learning processes afford them opportunities to learn <italic>from</italic> customers, which is vital to be able to cocreate value with customers over time. For instance, it may be those customers who cast their nets most widely and draw on learning resources from a wide range of sources who are best placed to bring new insights to firms.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article challenges organizations to carefully consider customers' learning needs and to regard customer learning as interactive and process-based. By recognizing that customers integrate resources as part of their value-creating processes, the role of organizations is to support their customers in acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to derive the required value from the offering. Building on an interactive model of SDL, a conceptual model of customer learning for resource integration has been developed. The model differentiates between the characteristics of learning contexts, interactive elements of the learning process, and links them to customers' effectiveness in resource integration activities. The elements of the conceptualization serve as building blocks for a future research agenda that highlights the shortcomings of our understanding of customer learning from an interactive, process-based perspective that is concerned with the effectiveness of customers as resource integrators. The article sets out specific questions that will guide practitioners in developing effective marketing programs that support customer learning.</p>
