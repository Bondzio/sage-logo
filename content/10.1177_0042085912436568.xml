<abstract>
<p>In a preexperimental study of preservice practitioners’ professional dispositions, we examined the relationship between an innovative culturally responsive teaching model in a social studies methods course and teacher candidates’ culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy. Findings indicate preservice teachers exposed to an in-depth culturally responsive teaching epistemology were more confident in their abilities to employ culturally relevant teaching practices. Participants noted increased willingness to work in diverse communities. Preservice teachers were more efficacious in their abilities to teach multicultural social studies content. Our study suggests that a comprehensive culturally responsive, social studies methods course inspired efficacious attitudes toward teaching diverse learners and content.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912436568">James Banks (2008)</xref> suggests that for our nation to develop and sustain a civic democracy, education should promote a “cultural democracy” that enfranchises the learners’ via their experiences, background, and ethnic values. However, given the narrowed, prescriptive, and Eurocentric scope of social studies curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912436568">Bohn &amp; Sleeter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912436568">Cornbleth &amp; Waugh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912436568">Crocco, 1998</xref>), preservice teachers (PSTs) often perceive it as difficult to integrate culturally relevant instruction into their practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). In addition, a majority of PSTs are White and female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912436568">Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085912436568">Ingersoll, 2001</xref>). Research suggests that these students often harbor implicit racial biases that can be counteracted by programmatic diversity training in their teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912436568">Bakari, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042085912436568">Sleeter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0042085912436568">Wiggins, Follo, &amp; Eberly, 2007</xref>). Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) has been advocated by numerous teacher educators as a proactive pedagogy for meeting the needs of diverse classes and encouraging practitioners to reflect on the diverse needs of their students. However, culturally responsive pedagogy is more than “good teaching,” it requires practitioners to advocate for social justice, maintain a sociopolitical consciousness, and possess an eagerness to work with students of diverse backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912436568">Au, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912436568">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While numerous studies offer an ideological epistemology for teaching within this paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">Gay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912436568">Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0042085912436568">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2007</xref>), we sought to develop an explicit model for introducing CRT to middle/secondary social studies preservice teachers. Our model was based on three principles, <italic>Review, Reflect, and React</italic> (3Rs), in which PSTs critique the social studies curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912436568">Crocco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085912436568">Marri, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042085912436568">Sleeter &amp; Stillman, 2005</xref>), reflect on how curriculum is currently enacted given the classroom community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085912436568">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; González, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042085912436568">Ross, 2006</xref>), and pedagogically react via culturally congruent instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">Gay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>). Though students developed lesson plans that exhibited components of CRT in an earlier study of the 3Rs program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett, Starker, &amp; Good, 2010</xref>), we explored the veracity of our framework by examining students’ culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE) to determine if our model was associated with positive attitudes and beliefs regarding culturally responsive teaching principles.</p>
<sec id="section1-0042085912436568">
<title>A rationale for Culturally Responsive Teaching in Social Studies Classrooms</title>
<p>Social studies has traditionally been associated with developing and asserting civic and democratic virtues. In his book, <italic>Teaching Democracy</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085912436568">Parker (2003)</xref> suggests a refined democratic citizenship that “embraces individual differences, multiple group identities, and a unifying political community all at once” (p. 25). Yet, as research and theory suggest, students in social studies classrooms are often subjected to standardized, curriculum that perpetuates dominant cultural values at the expense of non-White student groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912436568">Crocco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085912436568">Marri, 2005</xref>). These canonical traditions continue even as the demographics of our nation’s schools become increasingly diverse. Recent data from the U.S. Census Department reveal that the number of non-White students enrolled in schools at approximately 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085912436568">Davis &amp; Bauman, 2011</xref>). Projections suggest that these numbers will rise exponentially in the upcoming decades. In urban schools, the proportion of students of color is even greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085912436568">Lippman, Burns, &amp; McArthur, 1996</xref>). These changes in classroom demographics are not reflected in the curriculum and teaching of social studies, which often remains situated in Eurocentric, Westernized ideals that fail to consider non-White perspectives. Thus students suffer a disconnect between their own lived experiences and the essentialist truths propagated in daily social studies lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042085912436568">Salinas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0042085912436568">VanSledright, 2004</xref>). Lacking access to the curriculum, students become ambivalent and uninterested in historical and civic issues, which, in turn, implicitly perpetuates a cycle of racialized disenfranchisement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085912436568">Kincheloe, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings (2011)</xref> advocates for a “sociopolitical consciousness” that affords students the opportunity to “better understand and critique their social position and context” (p. 41). Given the perceived, stifling nature of current standardization, nurturing such an epistemology among learners requires transformative instructional planning that transcends current social studies teacher education.</p>
<p>The issue of curricular bias against non-White individuals is compounded by traditional social studies teacher education, which has largely minimized the importance of race and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042085912436568">National Council for the Social Studies, 2010</xref>). Social studies teacher candidates often carry misconceptions regarding students’ cultures that manifests as biases or deficit-model thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912436568">Kidd, Sanchez, &amp; Thorp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042085912436568">Sleeter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042085912436568">Ukpokodu, 2002</xref>). In a study of teacher candidates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085912436568">Ng (2006)</xref> noted that PSTs avoided teaching in urban schools due to misperceived discipline problems and lack of engagement among students of color. These erroneous assessments are symptomatic of the cultural dissonance between the lived and schooling experiences of White teachers and the experiences of students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912436568">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912436568">Milner, 2011</xref>). In social studies, cultural bias among practitioners is further revealed as teachers’ unwittingly collude to propagate Eurocentric ideals due to a perceived fear that deviation from the prescribed curriculum will take away from instructional time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912436568">Crocco &amp; Costigan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912436568">Hargreaves, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for the reluctance to break from the traditional narrative in social studies education is the disorganization of teacher training. Teacher education programs often include issues of diversity education as an ancillary component to instructional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912436568">Haberman &amp; Post, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0042085912436568">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0042085912436568">Zeichner et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, teaching principles are divorced from the learning context of students. Not surprisingly, research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912436568">Bakari, 2003</xref>) suggests that PSTs, particularly those described as White and middle class, experience higher reluctance and lower sensitivity toward teaching students’ of color. In their description of characteristics and dispositions for teachers of urban schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912436568">Haberman and Post (1998)</xref> infer that most successful teachers of diverse students are not “. . . young White females from small towns or suburbs with grades of A in student teaching . . .” (p. 101). Given these studies and the evidence that we are producing teachers to the contrary, it is necessary for teacher education programs to integrate cultural awareness and responsiveness into instructional praxis.</p>
<p>To counter this phenomenon, Gay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912436568">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">2002</xref>) offers a model of culturally responsive teaching (CRT). Five principles undergird this pedagogical approach: (a) developing a cultural diversity knowledge base (b) developing a culturally relevant curricula, (c) demonstrating cultural caring and building a learning community, (d) exhibiting effective cross-cultural communications, and (e) delivering cultural congruity in classroom instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">Gay, 2002</xref>). Teaching among diverse populations requires PSTs to understand the cultural similarities shared among students and between teacher and student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). Often associated with “funds of knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085912436568">Moll et al., 1992</xref>), building a cultural diversity knowledge base requires not only acknowledging differences but also championing the lived-experience as viable classroom resource. Developing culturally relevant curricula suggests teaching that rises above the traditional, myopic canon and draws from sources, histories, and ways of thinking that characterize diverse learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085912436568">1995b</xref>). Caring, community, and discourse are essential to CRT in that they encourage practitioners to establish a classroom environment in which open discourse and community-building encourage empathy among students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912436568">Bondy, Ross, Gallingane, &amp; Hambacher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912436568">Hess, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042085912436568">Ukpokodu, 2006</xref>). Cultural congruity requires teachers to shift from the objectivist prescription of standards and objectives to constructivist paradigm that acknowledges the subjective nature of learning and schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912436568">Hargreaves, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). Implementation of a CRT model can enact change in PSTs’ praxis and disposition toward diverse learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912436568">Kidd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0042085912436568">Wiggins et al., 2007</xref>), so long as it is not structurally static but inclusive of both the theory and practice of CRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912436568">El-Haj, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085912436568">C. Grant &amp; Gilllette, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085912436568">Knuston, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0042085912436568">
<title>Developing Culturally Responsive Teaching Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>For PSTs to successfully enact culturally responsive pedagogy, they have to feel efficacious in their ability to implement this praxis in the context of their own classrooms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912436568">Bandura (1977)</xref> defined the concept of self-efficacy as an individual’s belief in his or her ability to perform a specific task. Confidence in one’s abilities is a powerful moderator of task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912436568">Albeson, 1979</xref>), as knowledge of a principle alone does not ensure its practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912436568">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Two individuals may have the same content knowledge of mathematics, however, their teaching styles and outcomes might differ entirely due to their belief in their teaching efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042085912436568">Pajares, 1992</xref>). Within the field of teaching, desire to engage students, instructional practice, and willingness to work in challenging environments are outcomes of teacher self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042085912436568">Tschannen-Moran &amp; Hoy, 2001</xref>). Practitioners who perceive themselves efficacious within a particular domain are often more successful in their abilities to instruct and manage a given classroom environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042085912436568">Pajares, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Successful CRT implementation is predicated on teachers’ understanding and belief in its principles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085912436568">Ng’s (2006)</xref> analysis of PSTs revealed that candidates were apprehensive in the current climate of <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic> to work with diverse students. Specifically, they felt that they were underprepared to work in urban schools given the perceived challenges often associated with students of color. Additional studies have found similar results, suggesting that PSTs often lack the skills and dispositions for teaching diverse student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912436568">Bakari, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). The construct of culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE) is a practitioner’s perceived efficaciousness regarding “their ability to execute the practices of culturally responsive teaching” and “believe in the positive outcomes associated with this pedagogical approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2007</xref>, p. 1087). PSTs who exhibit CRTSE are more inclined to incorporate culturally responsive pedagogy and more confident in their ability to work with diverse student populations further along in their teaching careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu &amp; Starker, 2010</xref>). However, the context of school matters. Research studies indicate that PSTs leave their teaching education programs feeling much less efficacious to teach in diverse, urban communities compared to suburban environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085912436568">Ng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2011</xref>). Consequently, the least confident teachers are less likely to be attracted to, or retained in, urban environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042085912436568">Tschannen-Moran &amp; Hoy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This begs the question, “Who is teaching students of color?” Among social studies teachers, teachers tend to self-segregate. Analysis of National Center of Education Statistics data indicates that practitioners of color are significantly more likely to work in more diverse settings than White teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912436568">Fitchett, 2010</xref>). Ware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0042085912436568">2006</xref>, p. 452) refers to a “warm demander pedagogy” whereby African American teachers balance high academic expectations with a caregiver mentality. Yet the majority of students of color are taught by White teachers, who regularly lack a cultural connection with their classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912436568">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912436568">Bondy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912436568">G. R. Howard, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912436568">Haberman and Post (1998)</xref> note that teacher education needs to develop practitioners who are trained to work in the unique context of urban and/or diverse student environments as opposed to the current one-size-fits all mentality. Among social studies practitioners, the teaching of diverse students is further problematized by a curricular precedent that excludes non-White, non-Western content and concepts.</p>

<title>Building a Pedagogical Scaffold for Culturally Responsive Social Studies Teaching</title>
<p>Preservice teacher education provides a unique opportunity to foster CRT dispositions and develop instructional strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912436568">Bergeron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085912436568">Massey, 2006</xref>). Though practitioners frequently want specific “best practice” examples of CRT proffered, the subjective nature of cultural responsiveness renders this request next to impossible, nor advisable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 2011</xref>). Thus these two elements of teacher education, culturally responsive teaching and instructional practice, are often emphasized separately. Making connections between CRT and practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085912436568">Milner (2011)</xref> suggests “instructional principles that can assist teachers in transforming and moving their good intentions into actions that make a real difference for students . . .” (p. 56). Without essentializing practices, instructional principles offer teachers’ pragmatic directions for teaching. Similarly, it was our intention to join CRT dispositions within real world pedagogical atmospheres. Actualizing cultural responsiveness via our pedagogical scaffold, we hoped to offer PSTs examples and opportunities to enact CRT social studies instruction.</p>
<p>The curricular tradition of social studies has long been critiqued for cultural biases toward nonmajority peoples, an avoidance of controversy, and a social reproduction agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912436568">Apple, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912436568">Bohn &amp; Sleeter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912436568">Cornbleth &amp; Waugh, 1995</xref>). The non-White, “other” is represented as subjugated, culturally lacking, or inherently inferior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912436568">Chandler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0042085912436568">Willinsky, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the standardization and objectification of content is construed as pedagogically limiting to many practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912436568">Bohn &amp; Sleeter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912436568">Crocco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912436568">Crocco &amp; Costigan, 2007</xref>). These canonical representations of non-White peoples perpetuate a “dominance paradigm,” which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085912436568">G. R. Howard (2006)</xref> defines as “a pervasive and persistent worldview wherein White assumptions are held to be true and right, White ignorance of other groups is the norm, and White privilege flourishes essentially unchallenged and unacknowledged” (p. 68).</p>
<p>These criticisms have been leveled not only at the content but also at the social studies profession as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings (2011)</xref>, in a pointed critique, took aim at social studies education aims and purposes. She directed specific criticism at the National Council for the Social Studies for intentionally avoiding race in their mission statement. Omission of race is also prevalent in championed pedagogical tools. In her content analysis of popular social studies education texts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085912436568">Gay (2003)</xref> noted that textbooks were either completely devoid of racial issues or speciously mention racism in politically correct passages. PSTs receive an implicit message from social studies education that the inclusion of race is controversial and should be avoided.</p>
<p>These factors have a significant impact on the development of social studies teaching. Teachers risk losing the participation and motivation of learners when they fail to recognize the unique positionality of students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042085912436568">Salinas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042085912436568">Salinas, Franquez, &amp; Reidel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0042085912436568">VanSledright, 2004</xref>) and how they conceptualize society both past and present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912436568">2009</xref>). From a pedagogical stance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu and Starker (2010)</xref> note that the quality, not quantity, of interaction with culturally responsive teaching influences a teacher’s CRTSE. In response, the purpose of our program was to provide secondary (6-12) social studies PSTs with a distinctive, pedagogical bridge between the theory and praxis of culturally responsive ideology.</p>
<p>Research suggests that integrating elements of CRT into teacher education helps to build confidence of PSTs to engage diverse classroom environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu &amp; Starker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0042085912436568">Tucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0042085912436568">Wiggins et al., 2007</xref>). However, as Tyrone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912436568">Howard (2003)</xref> posits in his meta-analysis of social studies research journals, very few studies have explored the crossroads of race, diversity, and pedagogy. We designed an in-depth CRT model within a secondary social studies methods course titled, <italic>Review, Reflect, and React</italic> (3Rs). In keeping with Gay’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912436568">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">2002</xref>) conception of CRT and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu’s (2007)</xref> dimensions of preservice teachers’ CRTSE, we developed purposeful steps in our CRT model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042085912436568">Figure 1</xref>). In the first phase, <italic>Review</italic>, candidates reviewed their standard course of study asking critical questions of who is represented within the curriculum, who is marginalized, and in what capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085912436568">Marri, 2005</xref>). Analyzing the standard curriculum, PSTs were able to critically examine the canon for its implicit message of Eurocentric sociocultural hegemony. This preliminary analysis perpetuated an iterative discourse among students and instructor as to the hidden nature of the formal curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912436568">Crocco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">Gay, 2002</xref>). Discussion centered on what is missing or absent from the curriculum in addition to what is present or essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912436568">Bohn &amp; Sleeter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0042085912436568">Willinsky, 1998</xref>). In the second phase, <italic>Reflect</italic>, candidates interviewed the learners of their student teaching classroom to better understand the cultural context of the class and took field notes on how their cooperating teachers pedagogically engaged the various learners within the class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912436568">Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085912436568">Moll et al., 1992</xref>). Informed by class data and critical analysis of the standard course of study, PSTs wrote critical reflections on how their cooperating teachers’ instruction recognized (or dismissed) the diverse identities of the classroom community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085912436568">Moll et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042085912436568">Ukpokodu, 2006</xref>). In the third phase of the model, <italic>React</italic>, practitioners devised culturally relevant lesson plans and taught these lessons to their students. Informed by the pedagogical suggestions of CRT theory and practice and their critical reflections of current practice in their clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912436568">Banks, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042085912436568">Ukpokodu, 2006</xref>), PSTs constructed and implemented dynamic pedagogy. As a final step, candidates wrote reflections on their experiences teaching their lessons to better understand the purpose of planning and the importance of critical self-examination to improve on instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912436568">Costigan &amp; Crocco, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912436568">Gay &amp; Kirkland, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In a previous qualitative examination of the 3Rs model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett et al., 2010</xref>), we ascertained that the PSTs involved with the model developed insightful critiques of the curriculum and developed CRT-specific social studies lessons. Successful cultural responsiveness among teacher candidates included examples of “ambitious teaching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912436568">S. G. Grant, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912436568">2007</xref>) whereby instruction was designed to circumvent the essentialist narrative of the curriculum and acknowledged the cultural contributions of the students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, PSTs who engaged in culturally relevant pedagogy were more likely to exhibit a command over the content and use sources outside of the textbook. While informative, the scope of our study was limited to analysis of lesson plans, reflection, and informal class discussion. Though the participants wrote appropriate lessons (knowledge), we questioned whether their attitudes toward culturally responsive pedagogy changed due to the model as well (belief). Specifically, we wanted to explore efficacy among PSTs to implement CRT in their own practice following the 3Rs program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912436568">Bakari, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu &amp; Starker, 2010</xref>). We also wanted to establish if the program was associated with increased confidence to teach the “sociopolitical consciousness” content of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). Last, we sought to ascertain if the 3Rs program could contribute to teachers’ willingness to teach among diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912436568">Bakari, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912436568">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085912436568">Ng, 2006</xref>). As an extension of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett et al., 2010</xref>), we wanted to determine whether the 3Rs model might be associated with a positive dispositional change in the level of CRTSE among the preservice candidates. In our analysis of pretest/posttest survey data, we examined three research questions:</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>For this study, we employed a sample of convenience—a class of 20 students in a middle/secondary (6-12) social studies methods course (taught by one of the principal investigators) at a large, urban university in the southeast. The participants were part of a graduate licensure program that provides social studies teaching credentials to postbaccalaureates. All of the students in the class held bachelor’s degrees in social studies-related fields (i.e. history, political science, etc.). Demographically, the class cohort consisted of 10 White females, 2 Black females, and 8 White males. Approximate age range of the participants was 23 to 60 years of age.</p>

<title>Instrument<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042085912436568">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>The Culturally Responsive Teaching Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2007</xref>) was used to elicit information from preservice teachers regarding their efficacy to execute specific teaching practices and tasks that are associated with teachers who have adopted a culturally responsive pedagogy. The scale consisted of 40 items in which participants were asked to rate how confident they were in their ability to engage in specific culturally responsive teaching practices (e.g., I am able to identify the diverse needs of my students) by indicating a degree of confidence ranging from 0 (<italic>no confidence at all</italic>) to 100 (<italic>completely confident</italic>). In the development of a culturally responsive teaching inventory, items were interpreted and theoretically validated via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912436568">Bandura (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042085912436568">Siwatu (2011)</xref> self-efficacy constructs. Responses to each item were summed and divided by the total number of items to generate a CRTSE strength index. This index was a quantitative indicator of the strength of each preservice teacher’s CRTSE beliefs (α = .92). In our own reliability analysis of the CRTSE inventory, interitem reliability was substantially high (α = .98). Given the level of measurement scrutiny conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu (2007)</xref> and the similarity of our findings, we interpreted individual scales to be accurate in their reliability to gauge PSTs’ confidence in CRT dispositions. The CRTSE scale has been subsequently employed in other studies examining the efficaciousness of culturally responsive practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042085912436568">Siwatu, Polydore, &amp; Starker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu &amp; Starker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu (2007)</xref> conducted factor analysis and other tests of reliability to develop an inventory for CRTSE attitudes, we believed that the development and implementation of the 3Rs program uniquely emphasized five specific items of confidence to incorporate culturally responsive instruction. To measure cultural responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), five items (range 0 to 100) were selected based on the theoretical foundations of the 3Rs’ epistemology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912436568">Gay, 2002</xref>): (SCHOOL CULTURE) confidence indentifying ways that school culture is different from students’ home culture—<italic>identifying a culturally diverse knowledge base</italic>; (MISMATCH) efficaciousness in implementing strategies to minimize the effects of the mismatch between students’ home culture and the school culture—<italic>developing a culturally relevant curricula</italic>; (HOMELIFE) confidence in obtaining information about students’ home lives—<italic>demonstrating cultural caring and community building</italic>; (VARIETY) confidence in using a variety of teaching methods—<italic>delivering culturally congruity in classroom instruction</italic>, and (EXP) confidence in using examples familiar to students from diverse backgrounds—<italic>exhibiting effective cross culture communications</italic>. For interpretative purposes, these items were combined into a single aggregated component, CRT Confidence (CRT_CONF) with a range of 0 to 500. Cronbach’s alpha results determined interitem reliability to be strong (α = .868). In addition, a principal component analysis was conducted to examine the validity of the data reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085912436568">Joliffe, 2002</xref>). The proportion of individual item variance explained by CRT_CONF ranged between 0.50 and 0.78. Approximately, 66% of the total variance was attributed to the construct.</p>
<p>To measure PSTs’ confidence for teaching in a culturally responsive setting (CRT_SET), we compared results from a single attitudinal item from both the pretest and posttest (range 0 to 100): <italic>How likely is it that you will teach in a setting where students are culturally different than you?</italic> The use of a single item in social science research is fraught with issues of low reliability. However, previous studies have concluded that when the item is narrowly defined, such as expectancy, then single-item analysis is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085912436568">Ilgen, Nebeker, &amp; Pritchard, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042085912436568">Wanous, Reichers, &amp; Hudy, 1997</xref>). Thus we deemed it appropriate to analyze the aforementioned item to determine the likelihood (expectancy) of PSTs teaching in a culturally diverse setting.</p>
<p>Ladson-Billings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">2011</xref>, p. 41) advocates a “socio-political consciousness” for culturally relevant teaching—allowing students opportunity to critique their personal history and lived-experience. Similarly, previous social studies research has suggested that for social studies practitioners to develop culturally responsive practices, they have to be confident in their abilities to teach culturally diverse, and at times, sensitive material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912436568">Epstein, Mayorga, &amp; Nelson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912436568">Hess, 2009</xref>). Thus, in addition to measuring general culturally responsive attitudes, we revised the Siwatu inventory to include items examining PSTs’ confidence to teach culturally sensitive materials. In measuring confidence in teaching diverse social studies content, we developed items related to confidence in teaching diverse social studies content (pre- and post-3Rs): slavery (CONF_SLVRY), discovery of America (CONF_DSCVAMER), Trail of Tears/Indian Removal (CONF_TRLT), Holocaust/Genocide (CONF_HOLOCAUST), civil rights (CONF_CVRTS), women’s rights/women’s suffrage (CONF_WMNRT), immigration (CONF_IMMIGRAT), globalization (CONF_GLOBAL), and religious persecution (CONF_RELG). As social studies methods instructors, we chose these content emphases based on prior experience with teacher candidates and knowledge of related social education literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912436568">Chandler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912436568">Crocco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912436568">Epstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085912436568">T. Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085912436568">Loewen, 2009</xref>). As with the original Siwatu instrument, items were scaled 0 to 100. These items were aggregated into a single construct, social studies content confidence (CONTENT_SS_CONF) with a range of 0 to 900. A Cronbach’s alpha test reported substantially high interitem reliability for this latent variable (α = .828). Principal component analysis of CONTENT_SS_CONF indicated that approximately 50% of the variance was attributed to the construct. Proportion of individual item variance attributed to the component ranged from 0.20 to 0.77.</p>
<p>The instrument was administered prior to and following implementation of the 3Rs model. We employed a single group pretest/posttest format. Because this study included self-reported data, issues of social desirability bias had to be taken into account. We attempted to address this threat of validity by having respondents complete the survey with the principal investigator and class instructor out of the room. Moreover, participants were told that their results were anonymous. Incentive to take part in the study, extra credit on a class project, was awarded prior to completion of the post-3Rs survey. While this preexperimental design is traditionally plagued by issues of internal reliability, a number of practical issues including course scheduling and ethics prevented us from selecting a control group. Moreover, qualitative findings from model implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett et al., 2010</xref>) have confirmed that 3Rs was associated with culturally responsive lesson planning, thereby suggesting validity of the treatment.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912436568">Fitchett et al., 2010</xref>), we examined students’ classroom observations, lesson plans, and reflections to better understand the context of successful CRT planning in a preservice social studies classroom. Analyzing documents and artifacts associated with the 3Rs implementation provided contextual examples of successful and unsuccessful culturally responsive instructional planning. While informative for social studies education, we extended our analysis to examine CRTSE as a means of investigating the attitudinal effects of the 3Rs program on a middle/secondary methods course.</p>
<p>In a preexperimental quantitative analysis of the 3Rs culturally responsive teaching program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912436568">Creswell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042085912436568">Montgomery, 2009</xref>), we examined pre- and posttest descriptive statistics of the respondents at each of the constructs (CRT confidence, confidence for teaching in a culturally responsive setting, and social studies content confidence). Then, we conducted paired <italic>t</italic> tests to determine whether differences in means scores prior and post the 3Rs model implementation were statistically different. In addition, we calculated post hoc power analysis and effect size (partial η<sup>2</sup>) to examine how much variance in scores can be attributed to differences between the two survey implementations. Power was calculated with each model to determine the possibility of a Type II statistical error—failure to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis (i.e., 3Rs is associated with an increase in preservice teachers’ culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy) is true.</p>

<p>Next, we conducted a paired <italic>t</italic> test to determine whether CRT Confidence measured differently before and after model implementation. Post test attitudes toward CRT confidence (<italic>M</italic> = 425.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 54.28) was significantly greater than pretest attitudes of CRT confidence (<italic>M</italic> = 380.69, <italic>SD</italic> = 71.27), <italic>t</italic>(19) = 3.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Results suggested that participant confidence in CRT increased significantly following the 3Rs model. In addition, we ran General Linear Models of Repeated Measure to ascertain the power and effect size of these findings. Results illustrated that power was high (<italic>p</italic> = .925). Partial eta-squared results indicated that approximately 40% of the variance in CRT confidence is associated with model implementation (partial η<sup>2</sup> = .40). Box Plots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042085912436568">Figure 2</xref>) showed substantially less variation in CRT confidence in the posttest—implying the participants not only showed attitudinal improvements toward CRT confidence but also a shared disposition toward culturally relevant instruction.</p>

<p>Paired <italic>t</italic> test results indicated that posttest confidence in teaching in culturally diverse settings (<italic>M</italic> = 84.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.13) was significantly greater than pretest confidence to teach in diverse settings (<italic>M</italic> = 74.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 23.30), <italic>t</italic>(19) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Generalized linear model (GLM) repeated measures ANOVA indicated power within this model was moderate (<italic>p</italic> = .617) and effect size to be small to moderate (partial η<sup>2</sup> = .230) with minimal overlap in distribution between pre- and post-item results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042085912436568">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that implementation of the 3Rs model is associated with a significant, albeit small, effect on social studies PSTs’ confidence to teach in culturally different surroundings. Variability among respondents’ confidence to teach in a culturally diverse setting diminished following 3Rs implementation, suggesting a change in attitude among participants. Also, we noted that the interquartile range of scores (25% to 75% percentile) has substantially diminished in size for post-3R responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042085912436568">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests less variability in CRT confidence to teach in a cultural setting. As a collective, PSTs exposed to the 3Rs program indicated greater desirability to work in a culturally diverse school.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912436568">Bartolomé (1994)</xref> suggests that the “best practices” mantra that inundates many preservice teacher education methods courses perpetuates a divorce from pedagogy and the sociocultural realities of learners. Unfortunately, this one-size-fit-all approach to teaching diversity has become rule rather than the exception. Critical teacher educators worry that these homogenized how-to manuals might actually be part of the problem rather than the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042085912436568">Sato &amp; Lensmire, 2009</xref>). Instead of propelling the academic achievement of diverse populations, they encourage deficit thinking, whereby teachers seek to “remedy” students of color from their cultural context rather than embrace them. Consequently, teachers exposed to these programmatic pedagogies often associate difference with fault and cultural dissonance with students’ obstinacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042085912436568">Smiley &amp; Helfenbein, 2011</xref>). Culturally responsive teaching can serve as a “humanizing pedagogy” that encourages preservice teachers to view learners as “subject rather object” and incorporate students’ lived-experiences in their instructional epistemology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912436568">Bartolomé, 1994</xref>, p. 177).</p>
<p>Previous social studies research of humanizing, culturally responsive instruction has focused on how such pedagogies embrace the diverse lived experiences of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912436568">Epstein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085912436568">Jones, Pang, &amp; Rodriguez, 2001</xref>). In her study of critical teacher research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042085912436568">Manfra (2009)</xref> noted that social studies practitioners who incorporate reflective teaching strategies developed greater attentiveness to the race and ethnicity of students, recognizing that CRT requires making connections between classroom cultural and the curriculum. While these previous studies focused on current practitioners, little extant research examined the development/affirmation of these traits among social studies teacher candidates. In developing the <italic>Review, Reflect, and React</italic> pedagogical framework, we encouraged a similar CRT mentality in social studies methods instruction. In this analysis of culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy, we sought to extend our previous research by examining the dispositional impact of the 3Rs model on preservice teacher efficacy to work with and among diverse students. Results indicate that there is a significantly positive relationship between the 3Rs model and confidence to use CRT practices. These findings suggest that a research-driven model can improve PSTs’ confidence in enacting culturally responsive pedagogy. Evidence of efficacious attitudes toward CRT praxis into instruction implies that teachers are willing and able to meet the content and contextual needs of diverse student populations.</p>
<p>Our study explored PSTs’ confidence to teach in a culturally diverse setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912436568">Boyd and colleagues (2005)</xref> found that teachers are more likely to teach where they live. Consequently, the highest quality teachers are often unwilling to work in culturally diverse environments that are often socioeconomically different from their own neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912436568">Boyd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912436568">Fitchett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912436568">Guarino, Santibãnez, &amp; Daley, 2006</xref>). Findings from our study offer hope that teacher dispositions can shift from provincial to cosmopolitan. More importantly, considering the demographics of our participants, we anticipate that the 3Rs model or another well-developed CRT program can counteract latent biases and stigmatization of White practitioners toward working with diverse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912436568">Kidd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042085912436568">Sleeter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042085912436568">Young, 2010</xref>). Given that the majority of the teaching work force in urban and diverse environments do not mirror the demographic makeup of the students they teach, integration of culturally responsive practice and disposition is necessary.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that social studies teacher candidates can develop efficacious attitudes toward CRT if a program is embedded in a methods course. A pedagogical scaffold should be only one facet of that cultural responsiveness. PSTs should have the opportunity to actively engage diverse students through clinical placements, professional development school partnerships, or comparable service-learning ventures. Research indicates PSTs’ prolonged interaction with students of color has a substantial impact on the willingness and quality of instructional interaction among students and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912436568">Boyle-Baise &amp; Kilbane, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912436568">Fitchett &amp; Heafner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0042085912436568">Wiggins et al., 2007</xref>). PSTs’ immersion into culturally diverse classrooms is a necessary component to provide future practitioners an appropriate intersection of theory and practice so that they are more efficacious in their interactions with students. Future research should examine how these dispositions mature (or diminish) as PSTs leave the academy and enter their profession.</p>
<p>Within social studies, results from our study demonstrate that a CRT model designed for PSTs improves teachers’ confidence to teach diverse, culturally responsive content. Considering the lack of diversity so often associated with social studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912436568">Banks &amp; Diem, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912436568">Cornbleth &amp; Waugh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042085912436568">Sleeter &amp; Stillman, 2005</xref>), it is important for teachers to serve as curriculum gatekeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042085912436568">Thornton, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042085912436568">2005</xref>)—willing to move beyond the formal, prescribed curriculum to enact meaningful pedagogy that offers a diverse view of American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085912436568">Ladson-Billings, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042085912436568">Ross, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085912436568">Hess (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042085912436568">Merryfield and Kasai, (2004)</xref> note that teaching controversial public issues and global awareness serve to engage students in issues of diversity and social justice. Our study confirms that social studies PSTs, though inundated with a prescribed curriculum, can become confident in their abilities to teach beyond the traditional, Eurocentric social studies canon; exhibiting a willingness to expose learners to a more socially conscious, and at times controversial, content. Integrating a culturally responsive framework within a social studies methods class has the potential to not only inform students of multicultural dispositions but also increase their efficaciousness to interact with diverse learners, work in diverse environments, and instructionally engage learners in culturally diverse content.</p>
<p>In acknowledging limitations of this study, convenience sampling hindered external validity. Previous research has recognized the importance of lived experiences and academic backgrounds in influencing PSTs’ attitudes on teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085912436568">Jarvis-Selinger, Collins, &amp; Pratt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042085912436568">Powell, 1992</xref>). In this study, we recruited nontraditional teacher candidates who had unique and different views on instruction, professionalism, and education than traditional PSTs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042085912436568">Powell (1992)</xref> noted that nontraditional teachers typically report their expanded work histories and personal experiences as teaching influences while being less influenced by family members and prior schooling examples. We, therefore, recognize that our findings do not necessarily mirror the attitudes and dispositions held by other preservice social studies teachers. Furthermore, given salary considerations and current job opportunities in current economic climate, likelihood to work in a culturally diverse setting is substantially confounded by issues not addressed in this study. As a direction for further research, we hope to compare CRSTE attitudinal scores between PSTs from traditional and nontraditional pathways to determine if a licensure pathway is associated with differences in teachers’ efficacy to incorporate cultural responsive instruction. It should be noted that each of the participants in this study worked in schools surrounding a large, metropolitan area. While opportunities for diverse teaching experiences might be unique to this study, we contend that CRT should be modeled in classrooms regardless of demographic background. Culturally responsive teaching is not an additive model, put on urban classrooms of color. Instead, it supports cultural democratic principles—a lesson that all preservice social studies teachers should promote.</p>
<p>A second limitation of this preexperimental study is the lack of a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085912436568">Creswell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042085912436568">Montgomery, 2009</xref>). Due to course scheduling and issues of ethics, establishing a comparison group was prohibitive. As such, we recognize that external validity issues complicate findings from our study. However, the purpose of this study was not to recommend a singular, statistically valid model of culturally responsive teaching. Moreover, it is not our contention that the program we have implemented be replicated across teacher education programs. Rather, we suggest that social studies methods courses integrate CRT practices into their rationale and offer teacher candidates the opportunity to reify their understanding of cultural responsive pedagogy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>CRTSE is the belief in the ideology of culturally responsive teaching and confidence in one’s abilities to enact the underlying pedagogical principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042085912436568">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0042085912436568">Siwatu &amp; Starker, 2010</xref>). Too often, educational research examines artifacts of diverse, pedagogical training while ignoring issues of attitudinal change associated with CRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085912436568">Kidd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085912436568">Siwatu, 2007</xref>). We sought to move beyond the knowledge paradigm of CRT training and ideology. In our pretest/posttest analysis of the 3Rs model, we examined dispositional changes in preservice candidates before and after introduction to culturally responsive theory and practice. Our findings indicate that beyond extolling the virtues of CRT through lesson planning and critical reflection, our culturally responsive model (3Rs) inspired positive, efficacious attitudes toward teaching diverse learners. More directly, preservice social studies teachers exposed to a culturally responsive-integrated methods course are more likely to exhibit confidence to work among diverse students and explore culturally sensitive content. If acknowledgment of a cultural democracy is a necessary precursor toward realization of a political one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912436568">Banks, 2008</xref>), then the development of culturally responsive, efficacious social studies teachers is an important step toward these goals.</p>
