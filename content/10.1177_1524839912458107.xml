<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>. African American infants in San Francisco suffer a mortality rate two to three times higher than Whites, yet prior discussion groups with African American residents suggested they were unaware of this disparity. <italic>Methods</italic>. Social marketing techniques were used to develop and implement three campaigns to increase awareness. The campaign themes were (1) infant mortality disparities, (2) proper infant sleep position, and (3) taking action to reduce disparities. Mediums to carry messages included bus ads, radio ads, church fans, and posters and cards distributed at clinics, daycares, agency waiting rooms, and community organizations. Campaign effectiveness was evaluated using telephone surveys of African Americans. <italic>Results</italic>. Almost 62% report some exposure to Campaign 1, 48.5% to Campaign 2, and 48.9% to Campaign 3. Chi-square analyses reveal a statistically significant increase in awareness of the disparity (39.6% vs. 62.7%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0005, odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-3.2). Although there was no overall significant increase in knowledge about proper sleep position, respondents who report any exposure to this campaign are more likely to know about sleep position (70.7% vs. 63.8%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, OR = 2.2, CI = 1.6-3.2). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Social marketing is an effective tool to increase disparity awareness, especially among groups disproportionately affected by the disparity.</p>

<p>Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher asserts that to end our nation’s racial and ethnic disparities in health, we will need a broad social movement for health equity (keynote address, Society for Public Health Education, 2007).</p>
<p>This assertion is consistent with increasing evidence that supports the role of social determinants of health and community level risks factors being at least as important as traditional individual level biological and behavioral risk factors as underlying causes of these disparities. Regarding infant mortality, leading researchers postulate that social justice issues, including the inequitable distribution of goods, resources, service, and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912458107">Green, Lewis, &amp; Bediako, 2005</xref>), repeated adverse experiences across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912458107">Lu &amp; Halfon, 2003</xref>), low levels of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912458107">Kawachi &amp; Berkman, 2000</xref>), and experiences of racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912458107">Collins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912458107">Mustillo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912458107">Rosenberg, Palmer, Wise, Horton, &amp; Corwin, 2002</xref>), internalized racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912458107">Butler, Tull, Chambers, &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>), and institutional racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912458107">Gee, 2002</xref>) may play critical roles in explaining these disparities.</p>
<p>The persistence of many disparate health outcomes between African Americans and Whites in the United States, the magnitude of disparities, and the growing recognition that racial discrimination is a root cause suggests that individual action alone will be unable to reverse this trend. A social movement for health equity will be necessary to eliminate health disparities. Creating a social movement involves people working together to improve the situation of their group (also known as collective action) and presents significant challenges. A common assumption among social movement theorists is that before a person will be motivated to act, he or she must first become aware that the group he or she belong to has far less access to the goods, services, opportunities, or other resources (including access to high-quality health care services, safe and clean neighborhoods) than other groups have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912458107">McAdam, McCarthy, &amp; Zald, 1996</xref>). Raising awareness among group members about their comparative disadvantage is seen by many theorists as an essential component in the development of a social movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912458107">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912458107">2002 Institute of Medicine</xref> report <italic>Speaking of Health: Assessing Health Communications Strategies for Diverse Population</italic> focuses on the importance of using theoretically grounded, culturally appropriate health communication and education strategies to decrease persistent disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912458107">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>). Recommended approaches include the use of social marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>In this article, we report on the effectiveness of a social marketing (SM) campaign conducted in San Francisco, California, aimed at increasing awareness among African Americans of (1) the infant mortality (IM) disparity between African American babies and White babies and (2) proper infant sleep position to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839912458107">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Few studies have been done to assess awareness of Americans in general or African Americans specifically regarding racial/ethnic health disparities. In 1999, the Kaiser Foundation conducted a survey measuring Americans’ awareness of health disparities and found the majority of Americans were unaware that IM is higher for Black infants than for Whites, with 54% of Whites being unaware and 58% of African Americans unaware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912458107">Lillie-Blanton, Brodie, Rowland, Altman, &amp; McIntosh, 2002</xref>). They also found misperceptions about life expectancy, with most Whites and African Americans unaware of the shorter life expectancy for Blacks.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking 2003 Institute of Medicine report <italic>Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care</italic> documents the existence of widespread racial/ethnic disparities in health care outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912458107">Smedley, Stith, &amp; Nelson, 2003</xref>). In response, the Harvard School of Public Health and the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation collaborated on a poll of Americans’ views of health care disparities. Overall, only 32% thought the problem of getting quality health care is worse for minorities, with 44% of African Americans and 54% of Hispanics holding this view compared with just 25% of Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912458107">Robert Woods Johnson Foundation &amp; ICR/International Communications Research, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A national survey done in 2010 modeled after the 1999 Kaiser Foundation survey found only modest improvement in Americans’ awareness of disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912458107">Benz, Espinosa, Welsh, &amp; Fontes, 2011</xref>). Awareness of the IM disparities between African American and White babies remained essentially unchanged among Whites (45% in 1999 vs. 43% in 2010), but showed improvement among African Americans (42% in 1999 vs. 56% in 2010). Still, the authors conclude that much work remains to increase awareness about disparities.</p>
<p>One increasingly popular approach to raising awareness and motivating individuals to adopt more healthy behaviors is the development of SM campaigns. This approach uses commercial marketing concepts to promote behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912458107">Andreasen, 1995</xref>). SM has been used to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912458107">Coriel, Bryant, &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>), and use of prenatal care, mammography, and the Supplemental Food and Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912458107">Bryant et al., 2001</xref>). Physical activity levels among young teens have been increased through the Centers for Disease Control’s VERB™ campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912458107">Wong et al., 2004</xref>), and teen smoking reduced through the TRUTH™ campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912458107">Farrelly et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In San Francisco, African American infants suffer a mortality rate two to three times higher than White infants, with the most common cause of death being SIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912458107">Bosley &amp; Evans, 1998</xref>). In an effort to reduce the IM disparity in San Francisco, the local public health department secured funding from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Reach 2010 initiative to create the Seven Principles for African American Infant Survival and Community Unity Project. Initial findings from focus groups conducted during the planning process suggested that most African Americans were unaware of this disparity. A cross-sectional telephone survey of 804 African American San Francisco residents in 2003 (Time 1) found that 57.3% had never heard that African American babies in San Francisco are two to three times more likely to die than White babies and almost a third were unaware prone infant sleep position is the main preventable risk factor for SIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912458107">Oliva, Rienks, &amp; Smyly, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings prompted the adoption of SM campaigns as one of the project’s main strategies to increase awareness of the IM disparity and proper infant sleep position. A follow-up survey in 2005 (Time 2) assessed changes in awareness as a result of the campaigns.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1524839912458107">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The Seven Principles Project conducted three campaigns with the purpose of increasing awareness among African Americans in the four San Francisco neighborhoods where most African American births occur. An African American media consultant convened workgroups of residents and service providers to develop themes for campaigns one and two. Fourteen focus groups were used to provide feedback on draft campaign materials, with the later groups shaping the themes and messages of campaign three. The three campaign themes were (1) awareness of the IM disparity, (2) the importance of proper infant sleep position, and (3) the need to take action to reduce IM disparities. The same mediums were used in all campaigns: ads on buses and bus stops, posters, cards, brochures, handouts, church fans, and public service announcements on the radio.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of the SM campaigns, a 15-minute telephone survey (Time 2) was conducted at the conclusion of Campaign 3 with African Americans in the priority communities. Participants were selected randomly from lists of phone numbers for those areas. To be eligible, respondents needed to identify as African American, Black, or African American or Black combined with some other race, be between 18 and 64 years old, and reside in one of the priority neighborhoods. The survey was administered over 3 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839912458107">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>The survey consisted of 69 items. Demographic measures included age, gender, and education. Awareness questions included how often a respondent had heard that Black babies in SF were two to three times more likely to die than White babies and whether or not they agreed that putting a baby to sleep on its back would reduce SIDS risk. The Time 2 survey also assessed exposure to each of the four media used to convey the messages for the three SM campaigns and asked if respondents had participated in the Time 1 survey.</p>
<p>To measure the social environment within the African American community, we used original and modified questions from the Social Capital Community Benchmark survey, developed by Saguaro Seminar at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912458107">Sagraro Seminar, 2000</xref>) and from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912458107">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls’s (1997)</xref> study of neighborhoods and violent crime. Included items address feeling a sense of belonging, frequency of participation in social and community activities, barriers to participating, types of volunteering, and a scale to measure social cohesion. To assess level of social cohesion, respondents were asked how much they agreed with statements such as, “I am proud to tell people what neighborhood I live in.” Other statements from Saguaro were modified to make them more specific to the African American community within the priority neighborhoods and included “I regularly stop and socialize with other African American people in my neighborhood,” “African Americans in this neighborhood are close knit,” “African Americans in this neighborhood can be trusted,” and “African Americans around here are willing to help their neighbors.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912458107">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data from the Time 2 surveys were analyzed using SAS version 9.1 statistical software. Frequencies were computed for key variables, and <italic>T</italic> tests were performed to compare mean ages and education levels of respondents to the two surveys. Summary variables of exposure to each of the three campaigns were created to indicate any exposure and total exposure. Odds ratios were calculated and used to compare the percentage of respondents aware of the IM disparity and sleep position to reduce SIDS risk in the first versus second survey and to examine whether exposure to campaign media differed significantly by gender, age, and education level. Finally, multivariate logistic regressions were done to determine if exposure to the campaigns, age, gender, participation in the Time 1 survey and education were statistically significant predictors of knowledge about the IM disparity and of proper sleep position.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For the Time 1 survey, 16,463 phone calls were made in the fall of 2003, identifying 993 eligible respondents. Of those eligible, 163 refused and 26 terminated the interview prior to completing the survey, resulting in a 19% refusal rate and a sample size of 804. During the fall of 2005, 6431 calls were made, identifying 799 eligible respondents to complete the Time 2 survey. Of those eligible, 80 refused and 65 terminated the interview prior to completing the survey, resulting in an 18% refusal rate and a sample size of 654.</p>
<p>The majority of Time 2 respondents were female (67.3%) and 43% were 55 to 64 years old, 36.4% were 40 to 54 years old, 12.7% were 26 to 39 years old, and 8% were 18 to 25 years old. With regard to education, 13.8% had not graduated from high school, 32.4% had a high school diploma or equivalency, and 32.9% had some college or technical/vocational school, and 21% were college graduates. Analyses of means on key demographic variables reveal Time 2 respondents were older and less well educated than Time 1 respondents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912458107">Table 1</xref>). When asked if they had participated in the Time 1 survey, 56 (8.6%) said yes, 537 (82.2%) said no, and 60 (9.2%) said not sure.</p>

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912458107">Figure 1</xref>, data from Time 2 reveal substantial exposure to the awareness campaigns. Almost 62% of respondents report exposure to Campaign 1 on disparities, 48.5% to Campaign 2 on sleep position, and 48.9% to Campaign 3 on taking action. In total, 30.4% of respondents reported exposure to all three campaigns, 23.2% reported exposure to two campaigns, 20.3% reported exposure to one campaign, leaving 26% without any exposure.</p>

<p>Among respondents reporting exposure to one or more of the campaigns, most reported exposure to more than one medium. Across all campaigns, bus advertising was the most frequently reported form of exposure, with 52.6% seeing at least one bus ad, 48.6% hearing at least one radio ad, 46.2% seeing at least one poster, and 40.4% seeing one handout or church fan.</p>
<p>Odds ratio (OR) calculations revealed no difference in exposure to different mediums related to gender or education level. For age, significantly more respondents younger than 40 years reported exposure to bus ads (65.5% vs. 49.3%) and posters (55.6% vs. 43.9%) than did those older than 40 years.</p>
<p>When examining having heard about the African American IM disparity in San Francisco, analyses of means revealed a significant increase in frequency of hearing about the disparity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912458107">Table 2</xref>.).

<p>For sleep position, there was no overall increase in the percentage of respondents who knew placing a baby on its back to sleep could help reduce SIDS risk (Time 1 = 70.4% vs. Time 2 = 71.7%). However, chi-square analyses from Time 2 examining those who were exposed to Campaign 2 on sleep position compared with those who were not revealed a significantly higher level of awareness that proper sleep position can reduce SIDS risk among those exposed (70.7% of exposed vs. 63.8% of not exposed, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, OR = 2.2. CI = 1.6-3.2).</p>
<p>Logistic regression modeling was done with Time 2 data using ever heard about the IM disparity as the outcome variable. Predictor variables explored included age, education, social activity, social cohesion, neighborhood of residence, knowing a local organization working to improve the health of Black babies, having participated in activities to benefit the African American community within the past year, participation in the Time 1 survey and any exposure to each of the three awareness campaigns, and interactions of age and education with exposure to the three campaigns.</p>
<p>None of the interactions were significant in any of the models tested; nor was education, social activity, social cohesion, or exposure to the second awareness campaign on sleep position. Variables that were significant and included in the final model were: any exposure to the first and third awareness campaigns, knowing a local organization working to improve the health of Black babies, participation in activities to benefit the African American community within the past year, and having participated in the Time 1 survey. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for this model indicated good fit between expected and predicted values (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.00, <italic>df</italic> = 9, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .74). The variables in the model account for 20% of the unstandardized variance and 28% of the standardized variance in ever having heard of the African American IM disparity in San Francisco. The strongest predictor of respondents ever having heard about the disparity was exposure to Campaign 1, followed by exposure to Campaign 3, participation in the TIME 1 survey, knowing a local organization working to improve the health of Black babies, and participation in activities to benefit the African American community (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912458107">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SM campaigns using bus and bus stop ads, posters, cards, brochures, handouts, church fans, and public service announcements on the radio appear to have effectively increased awareness about the IM disparity between African Americans and Whites in the four priority neighborhoods in San Francisco. Although there were no overall increases in awareness of proper sleep position to reduce SIDS risk, any exposure to Campaign 2 on sleep position was associated with a higher level of knowledge of proper sleep position, suggesting campaign exposure may have increased knowledge. The lack of a significant increase in overall awareness of proper sleep position may be a result of the fact that the Time 1 survey revealed a high level of knowledge (almost 70%) about this before the campaigns began.</p>
<p>Other important findings that persisted from Time 1 to Time 2 were the significant associations between awareness of the IM disparity and knowing a local organization working to improve the health of Black babies and having participated in activities to benefit the African American community within the past year. This suggests that social networks and connectedness, components of social capital, also contribute to awareness, perhaps by serving as ways to diffuse health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912458107">Kawachi &amp; Berkman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912458107">Rogers, 2003</xref>). Participation in activities to benefit the African American community can bring the participant in contact with people who can share information about the community and the disparities the community faces, and these people can also become opinion leaders for the participant. Respondents who know a local organization that works to improve the health of Black babies may also get information from the organization about the Black IM disparity.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. First, we did not use a longitudinal design, meaning the majority of respondents who completed the survey in Time 2 were not the same respondents at Time 1. Only 8% of respondents thought they had participated in the previous survey and 9% were not sure. Overall, Time 2 respondents were slightly older and less educated. It is possible but unlikely that the sample at Time 2 was better educated about this issue, regardless of exposure to the campaigns. The findings from the logistic regressions indicate that education was not a significant predictor of IM disparity awareness while exposure to Campaigns 1 and 3 emerged as the strongest predictors. At the conclusion of the Time 1 survey, respondents were informed about the disparity, thus leading to the possibility that prior participation in the survey resulted in the higher levels of awareness found at Time 2. When we controlled for participation in Time 1, exposure to Campaigns 1 and 3 still emerged as the most significant predictors of awareness. Given the cross-sectional nature of the study design, however, there is no way of knowing if there was some other reason for the increased awareness besides exposure to the campaigns and participation in the Time 1 survey that was not measured.</p>
<p>Identifying eligible respondents was challenging, and the use of landline telephone–based surveys excluded African Americans who did not have a telephone or use only a cell phone. This likely resulted in our sample being slightly older than the general adult African American population in San Francisco. For Time 1, many phone calls had to be made to identify eligible participants. For Time 2, the zip codes that yielded very few African American respondents were dropped, and the number phone calls needed to identify eligible respondents for Time 2 decreased considerably.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the results suggest that SM campaigns designed for and by African Americans can be a useful tool for increasing awareness of disparities. Certainly, campaigns like these will by themselves not create a social movement for health equity. They can, however, play an important role in raising awareness that a problem exists and that the problem is specific to a particular group. The framing of health disparities as an African American community issue, as we did in Campaigns 1 and 3, has important ramifications for how people will respond to issues.</p>
<p>Most health education messages focus on changing individual behavior to prevent individual health problems, and for many health problems this is effective. However, when it comes to eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, particularly in African American IM, individual action alone cannot solve the problem. Researchers have demonstrated that even African American women with higher income and education levels, and those who access appropriate prenatal care, still have a higher risk of having a baby that dies than a similarly positioned White woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912458107">Lu &amp; Halfon, 2003</xref>). Thus, it is important to frame the issue of the IM disparity as a group issue to encourage group level actions to address the social inequities that are contributing to the disparity.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The disparity in Black IM is a persistent problem about which much of the African American community has historically been unaware. Campaigns to increase awareness can be effective and may be an important step in engaging this community in efforts to reduce this disparity. Previous health promotion efforts may have contributed to increased health disparities because of unequal access to health promotion campaigns or a lack of cultural relevance in these campaigns. Therefore, concerted efforts need to be made to reach minority and underserved populations with culturally sensitive and specific health promotion messages.</p>
<p>As many social movement theorists have asserted, before individuals will participate in a social movement, they must believe the problem disproportionately affects their group and that individual action will be unable to solve the problem. In such circumstances, they conclude that collective action is required to address the problem. In the case of the IM disparity in the African American community, members must be made aware that individual action by African American mothers cannot completely eliminate the increased risk of death their infants face. Although awareness of disparities itself clearly will not remedy this disparity, awareness that this is a group problem is an essential first step if one hopes to mobilize a group-level response.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>For those seeking to raise awareness of a health issue among a particular group, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of SM techniques. These techniques are useful in ensuring that one reaches one’s audience through effective targeted channels, for example, radio stations that have data to show they have a large number of African American listeners. The SM approach is essential in developing the right message for one’s audience, including the use of representative focus groups to provide feedback on messages that will get the attention of the audience and be easily understood. For those interested in building a social movement to reduce health disparities and hoping to mobilize members of the groups that have disparate outcomes, it is important to recognize that many affected groups are not aware of the disparities. A successful effort should begin by assessing awareness of disparities within the community followed by a tailored multimedia SM campaign to increase awareness and frame the health disparities as a group issue.</p>
