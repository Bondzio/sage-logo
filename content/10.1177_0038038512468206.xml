<abstract>
<p>The article ‘Climate Change and Society: The Chimera of Behaviour Change Technologies’ by Janette Webb, <italic>Sociology</italic> February 2012 vol. 46 no. 1, pp. 109-125 [DOI: 10.1177/0038038511419196] is corrected as follows:</p>
<p>The statement ‘energy consumption itself is not necessarily seen as a cause of climate change, with only 36 per cent of respondents making this connection (Defra 2009)’ (p.116) is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Table 4 from Defra 2009 shows that, when given a list of statements which suggest that there is a causal connection between energy use and climate change: 85% of respondents indicated that they thought climate change was caused by energy use. The Report states on p.19 that: ‘A little more than a third (36%) of respondents said they thought that climate change was caused by energy use <italic>and</italic> they were doing either “quite a number of things”(27%) or “a lot of things” (9%) to reduce their energy use and emissions’.</p>
