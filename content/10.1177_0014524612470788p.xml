<p>This monograph, tracing the long-term historical geography of the Maeander river valley in Asia Minor, is a revision of the author’s award winning doctoral thesis written at Oxford University. The study tracks the interaction between human activity and the natural environment around the Maeander river valley from the fourth century BC to the thirteenth century AD. The book is richly illustrated with maps, photographs, and other figures.</p>
<p>The first chapter describes the area that is the focus of the study. It is noted that the Maeander <italic>was</italic> the longest river in Asia Minor (around 329 miles), with a drainage basin of around 10,000 square miles (pp. 19-20). However, Thonemann draws attention not only to the fact that there have been shifts in the watercourse, but that ‘in antiquity, the Maeander was firmly distinguished from its affluent the Lycus, and from the river Cayster to the north. Both rivers in recent times have been conceptualized as parts of the Maeander river-system.’ (p. 21). These changes – along with the conceptual decision of determining the <italic>perceived</italic> space of a river valley, are highlighted as reasons why defining ‘the boundaries of the Maeander “region” … [is primarily related to] contemporary perception and usage.’ (p. 23).</p>
<p>The following chapters then look at six separate aspects of the relationship between the peoples of the Maeander and their local environment. In turn, these relate to sacred geography (Chap. 2); markets and mobility (Chap. 3); mental maps and conceptual boundaries (Chap. 4); pastoral dynamics (Chap. 5); elite behavior and interaction (Chap. 6); and the productive rural landscape (Chap. 7). For readers of this journal the chapter dealing with sacred geography entitled ‘Hydrographic heroes’ (pp. 50-98) will be of particular interest. The early Christian communities at Laodicea, Colossae, and Hierapolis situated along the Lycus branch of the river system receive attention in chapter 2. Legends created to offer aetiological explanations of the hydrographic landscape are analyzed. Specifically, the <italic>Miracle of St Michael</italic> illustrates how landscape and sacred perspectives interplay. This lengthy text describes the attempts of local pagans to divert the river Chryses to destroy a holy spring with healing properties, which miraculously emerged after a visit of the apostles John and Philip. According to the story, as the floodwaters neared the chapel the Archangel Michael appeared opening a deep gorge to redirect the floodwaters. This not only accounts for the pilgrimage church of St Michael near Colossae, but it suggests that ‘the Chryses was the ancient name for the Honaz Çayi, the small stream that flows steeply down from Honaz past the eastern flank of Colossae’ (p. 78). This is just one of the significant insights discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p>As a whole the book utilizes a vast range of sources of different types. All are brought to bear on tracing the historical geography of the Maeander river with skill and careful scholarly judgment. This will remain a standard work on the subject for decades to come, and will richly repay close study.</p>
