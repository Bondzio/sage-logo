<p>In our evolving international policy landscape there is continued pressure to ensure that students are attending school, achieving targets and making appropriate levels of progress. Regular readers of this journal are familiar with editorial arguments that, where performance, target- and test-driven regimes dominate, this threatens pedagogical processes and the breadth of the curriculum and neglects the vital purposes of schooling in working towards social justice and equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212452657">Wrigley, 2012</xref>). Where such regimes are less prevalent, there are still considerable and continual challenges in identifying and implementing strategies to ensure that schooling is engaging, relevant and life-enhancing in supporting the learning and well-being of all children and young people. There are further challenges in exploring opportunities for enabling schools to draw upon the rich learning resources beyond their boundaries, in turn enhancing the involvement and experience of families and local communities in a reciprocal educational process.</p>
<sec id="section1-1365480212452657">
<title>Leading learning through ‘breakthrough practice’</title>
<p>This special issue of <italic>Improving Schools</italic> is particularly concerned with the quality of educational experience for marginalized and vulnerable individuals and groups, who are often the first casualties as systemic educational change marches on at their expense, or might remain unnoticed in complacent, stagnant or limited educational environments. In proposing this special issue of the journal, the aim was to offer an opportunity to explore, through different perspectives, how creative approaches to learning are developed through valuing diversity as a resource, encouraging active, inclusive participation within schools and communities. This issue offers views, examples, ideas and frameworks from contrasting cultures and contexts for school improvement. The authors contribute a range of professional and academic viewpoints to consider issues of educational access and inclusion, aspiration and achievement, citizenship and voice. Each article tackles the question of how <italic>everyone</italic> can be involved, inspired and inspiring in their learning, by turning attention to particular individuals and groups. In the process these perspectives pose important additional questions about educational purpose and process more generally.</p>
<p>The articles in this issue are all concerned with ‘breakthrough practice’, which David Frost identifies in his article as practice that breaks through barriers to instigate innovation. The significance of this concept is its contrast with models of training and ‘roll-out’ of what is deemed to be effective (‘good’ or ‘best’) practice, models which are characteristic of the grand narratives of large-scale reform. Breakthrough practice is led by those who recognize localized and individual needs and take initiative to address them. Operating tactically and strategically, these leaders work within, and sometimes despite, the given socio-political conditions and limitations, tackling previously unnoticed or intransigent problems to effect authentic school change. This changes people’s learning experiences in unique contexts, whether in terms of access to schooling, engagement in the classroom or the removal of other constraints on their learning and achievement. The authors offer examples and illustrations but, importantly, all build on the case studies and vignettes of breakthrough practice and their readings of wider research, to offer frameworks, models and principles to guide processes of school improvement and leadership of change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1365480212452657">
<title>Shifting cultures through ‘responsive practice’</title>
<p>The projects, programmes and initiatives represented by this set of articles share common contextual factors that make ‘blanket’ reform impossibly challenging, ineffective, inappropriate or irrelevant. This tends to be either because systemic change has not reached certain groups or individuals, or because the developments described penetrate different areas of learning than those normally prioritized. First, each example involves recognizing the needs of individuals and groups who had become marginalized and disenfranchised from schooling: ethnic minority groups in Southeast Europe where parents were disengaged from the educational process; primary school children in the UK who their teachers felt merited attention in literacy; bilingual learners in the USA; students from disadvantaged social backgrounds in Lao PDR and a class of disaffected 14–15-year-old students in the UK. Second, each example demands what Amy Heineke and colleagues refer to as ‘responsive practice’ (citing Gay, 2010; Lucas et al., 2008) to address unique and context-specific issues and needs for individuals, families and communities. Third, in order to introduce responsive practice on more than a case by case basis, each example concerns the development of theories, principles and frameworks that scaffold non-standardized approaches, relying on the skills, innovation and connections of key individuals with the energy, vision and commitment to lead change in context. Finally, each example is to a greater or lesser extent counter-cultural. Sometimes this is made explicit from the outset, as in the ‘Teachers researching literacy lives’ project conceived by Teresa Cremin and colleagues, in which the home visits by teacher researchers inculcated a less ‘school-centric’ professional viewpoint, leading to new conceptions of difference and diversity. Not only are teachers, consultants and researchers working against or despite formal policy, but each project, programme or approach has the potential to be culture-shifting in its longer term impact.</p>
<p>For the students involved, or potentially involved, in such approaches, the culture <italic>has</italic> to shift, otherwise it fails to support them in effective learning. For different reasons these individuals and groups are identified as those for whom the education system is not working, or at least not working well. They may be struggling or existing reluctantly within it, defined primarily in terms of lack of motivation, poor behaviour, failure or disability. They may be culturally distanced from the formal educational system, for example by differences in language, or they may be unable to engage at all. Without people’s ingenuity and commitment to develop responsive, breakthrough practice, we default to deficit models of schooling where children and young people, families, groups and communities are seen as problems when they do not ‘fit’ the structures and processes of mainstream systemic reform, are inevitably reluctant to engage, cannot keep pace, are unnoticed or absent. Too often the solution is for schools and teachers to be exhorted to work even harder, often in punitive ways, to make people and communities comply with ever more standardized systems and meet universal quantitative benchmarks of achievement and progress. We fall continually into the trap of assuming that equity is achieved through equality. In the process, as Amy Heineke and colleagues suggest, students ‘fall through the cracks’. In the UK, if unsuccessful in mainstream terms, blame may fall both on these individuals and families and on their local schools, headteachers and teachers. Here, schools are caught up in dangerous games in order to demonstrate statistical success, with the kinds of tactical manoeuvring, reactionary publicity and posturing that we see in our football league. Elsewhere, children may fall through the cracks for a variety of other reasons. In Laos, one of the poorest countries in the world, Peter Grimes and his colleagues from Save the Children and the Lao PDR Ministry of Education have been working with schools on inclusion, accommodating children who might otherwise spend their time catching frogs in the fields, and opening up new ways for teachers and children to learn together.</p>

<sec id="section3-1365480212452657">
<title>Diversity as a resource for learning</title>
<p>The intention for this issue of <italic>Improving Schools</italic> is not, therefore, to demonstrate ways of achieving a better fit with standardized systems. The articles explore, compare and contrast creative, imaginative and inspiring approaches where the diversity of individuals, schools and settings is seen as a rich resource for learning and improvement. This kind of initiative rests in most cases with teachers, who reach out to children and young people, drawing them into new realms of learning. Significantly, many of the examples here involve making connections with families and local community groups. However, these characteristics do not require us to revert to idiosyncratic approaches in which we revel in the details of the particular, but are unable and unwilling to contribute to our collective knowledge about school improvement. Rather, the authors of this series of articles draw out, from their diverse settings, valuable ideas, principles and frameworks that can be used to structure bespoke, contextualized developments, such that participants are not the ‘subjects’ or ‘recipients’ of improvement, but work appropriately as agents in their own settings. Each project or programme has thus challenged individual and organizational practice and policy and carved a new path for change.</p>

<sec id="section4-1365480212452657">
<title>Re-professionalization for teacher leadership</title>
<p>The crux of the change process – the reliance on key individuals responding to needs in local circumstances – needs careful consideration. Often in schools, the people who are most committed to addressing inequities are teachers, who may not hold formal leadership responsibility or consider themselves to be directly involved in school change; they adopt ‘non-positional teacher leadership’, as David Frost puts it. It is important to recognize that this is not the preserve of a few specially gifted champions of innovation, but can be nurtured and supported universally. The series of articles here offer frameworks for school self-evaluation and development, for teacher-led development work and for creative learning and teaching and a set of principles for supporting teacher leadership. Models for multi-layered research and development and for building a linguistically responsive school are focussed here on literacy and language respectively, but are clearly transferable to other areas of development. All these models, frameworks and principles purport a concept of change that involves re-professionalization of teachers and other education professionals. Andy Howes, in his review of John Cornwall and Lynn Graham Matheson’s edited book <italic>Leading on inclusion</italic>, notes that the emerging answer to our failure to educate so many young people lies in confident teachers, collaborating in enquiry to solve problems in situ. Collaborative activity is structured for planning, enquiry and knowledge building. This increases people’s sense of self-efficacy, confidence and ambition beyond existing structures, working on the premise of maximizing participation, involvement and voice.</p>
<p>Within a supportive professional climate, teachers such as Claire Corner, whose article describes a creative learning project she led in her school, can confidently describe the way in which the rules that normally govern their practice can be identified and then broken, in the name of pushing learning to its limits for those who are not thriving within the system (and perhaps, too, for those who are apparently succeeding). Significantly, Claire works in a school where, within a resolutely target-driven system and competitive local environment, the headteacher supports such calculated risk-taking and teacher leadership is recognized as a powerful engine for school change. However, through enquiry-based, systematic approaches, this confidence is underpinned and mediated by criticality and self-reflection. It does not require recklessness, arrogance or maverick tendencies that would alienate much of the profession. Teachers in Laos, working on school self-evaluation, express their efficacy with balance, dignity and humility. Their words offer a reality check; they know they cannot change everything, but they identify aspects of their school that are ‘not good enough’; they recognize the strength to be gained from collaboration and they commit to ‘doing their best’. As a result, they know that children and teachers have made the school ‘a better place for learning together’ – a simply put, yet fundamental ambition for school improvement.</p>
<p>Again this is counter-cultural to the grand assurances, success criteria and individualism of large-scale reform. In complex socio-political and organizational territory there has to be room for risk-taking and mistake-making, for trying together, for hopefulness. The kind of leadership required is that which flattens hierarchies, gives voice and scaffolds inclusive, collaborative, innovative working. Validity is assured not through sample sizes and statistical testing but through subjecting the work to the scrutiny of those who can test its authenticity and value in context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212452657">Somekh, 1995</xref>). In scaling up this kind of activity, what is needed is not dissemination of the same ideas to be translated into other contexts (the ‘sharing best practice’ model), but sharing of breakthrough practice and responsive approaches. Here, teachers can not only reapply ideas but inspire and empower one another with stories of change, offer peer support for local leadership strategies and value the work that has been done. In a quotation from David Frost’s article, a teacher from Sarajevo explains the ways in which these discussions engender mutual respect and self-esteem that push her beyond her previous limits and goals, motivating her politically and emotionally as well as practically. Limitations, then, are not entirely a function of the imposed and prescriptive policy environments, financial and resource constraints within which teachers work but can be attributed to their interpretations of professionalism. ‘Breakthrough practice’ might be conceived not only in terms of breaking barriers to innovation, but also in terms of inspiring and supporting teachers’ roles and identities in relation to that innovation, such that they see their agency and voice as integral to school improvement.</p>

<title>Narrative methodologies and insider enquiry</title>
<p>Statistics are not given prominence by these authors. Across these examples, there is evidence of attendance and parental involvement increasing, children at school who have never been before, previously disaffected, drifting or ‘invisible’ students connecting and learning and attainment improving. There is also evidence that teachers are invigorated and inspired by enquiry and innovation, which leads to re-commitment, raised expectations and aspirations and broader ambitions for educational purpose. It is difficult to see how these could be counter-productive to the raising of standards but, much more importantly, they breathe life and meaning into the connections between children and young people and their teachers, families and schooling, where these have become tenuous or dysfunctional.</p>
<p>This kind of work demands particular methodologies which are embodied in this series of articles, employing predominantly qualitative and narrative methods and case studies within rigorous and systematic evaluative processes and developmental frameworks. Teachers, along with agents, advisers and consultants external to the school, collaborate in eclectic and multi-layered research and self-evaluation, drawing in parents, students and other community members. The wider developmental projects make use of this multi-layered approach to gather and share a wide range of data, feeding back to participants to support the developmental process. An additional layer of research investigates and theorizes the process itself, building in the personal perspectives of external supporters of school development. The research stance of Peter Grimes and his colleagues, working as school improvement consultants in Laos, for example, helps them to make sense of rich evidence and personal cultural challenges as the development progresses. There is a true sense of a research community, too, in the multi-authored account by those who engaged with teachers in ‘Researching Literacy Lives’, and in the exploration by colleagues from Loyola University Chicago of ways in which schools can develop support for bilingual learners. The latter began with mutual interest and dialogue in a seminar which led to critical conversations and scholarly investigation of the research literature. There is strong commitment here, as in the other articles, to providing a research-based framework and recommendations, on the basis of multiple perspectives, to enable teachers to find ‘implementational space’ in order to effect change.</p>
<p>Most of these accounts contain the stories of individual students and teachers and their schools. Jo’s technological literacy puts the school’s provision to shame and challenges his teacher’s pre­conceptions of his application and motivation. Rachita listens through a ‘Skype’ internet connection to her grandmother’s stories of childhood in India and is differently revealed to her teacher as she demonstrates traditional dances. Jelena, in rural Serbia, involves parents in creating a school yard that becomes a community sports facility, welcoming Roma families, while Zana, in Kosovo, works with local parents to generate a ‘Music Lab’, celebrating and sharing the cultural skills and traditions of different communities. Claire Corner, suspending her normal professional judgement, finds herself drawn into her students’ classroom world as a participant and learner, creating personal learning toolkits and imaginary new worlds. All the characters in these accounts – students, teachers, researchers and external consultants – are participants in enquiry, exploration and investigation within their own situations, extending into new territories and forging new collaborative spaces.</p>
<p>Narratives of students and their teachers enable people to engage with local complexity. People’s stories of change contain contextual and process knowledge and also knowledge about how to act strategically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212452657">Tooth &amp; Renshaw, 2012</xref>). They enable people to tussle with real issues and provide mutual support to tackle problems. This was experienced powerfully by teachers where storying was structured into the linked ‘APREME’ and ‘International Teacher Leadership’ projects during project meetings, conferences and network events across Southeast Europe. The ‘Building Communities: Teachers Researching Literacy Lives’ project also held whole group and regional meetings, while teachers, parents and community members in Laos met more locally. In Claire Corner’s classroom, students initially struggled to enter the storytelling world; significantly, she believes that they had been conditioned out of this way of thinking by the educational regime to which they had been subjected. Her narrative contains contextual, process and strategic details of how trust was built and reservations were overcome, through storytelling, to the extent that students entered a state of ‘flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212452657">Csíkszentmihályi, 1997</xref>). In all these cases, sharing of stories was engaging and inspiring, enabling people to navigate their own local landscapes in relation to their own values and concerns, paving the way for change.</p>
<p>This kind of collaborative enquiry process helps to blur boundaries such that dualities (academic/practitioner; researcher/respondent; teacher/learner) become less marked. Learning, enquiring and critical dispositions are evident in all these authors’ accounts as an essential dimension of work within and alongside schools. In particular, research that develops ethnographic dimensions is less orientated towards gathering ‘evaluation’ data and more concerned with understanding people and the issues they face in their specific settings. These insights are transferable not in terms of content, but through realizations about the significance of individuality and cultural context, the importance of micro-political literacy, and in developing greater understanding of how networks and communications are helped or hindered. This enables people to identify the political levers that need to be pulled in order to establish climates more conducive to fine-grained, localized developments.</p>

<title>Small steps towards sustainability</title>
<p>The series of articles in this issue argue and exemplify that a new mindset of extended professionalism, inclusion, learning and leadership can quickly gather momentum locally as it is shared, acknowledged and celebrated. In a previous issue of this journal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212452657">Clarke (2009)</xref> argues that human communities need to develop the resilience and adaptability required for sustainable development. Resilience, according to ecological models, requires particular features: the ‘diversity’ that comes from responsive development to local situations and needs, the ‘modularity’ of connection and sharing of ideas that is dependent on many sources and ‘tight feedback’ in which people learn from the consequences of their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212452657">Clarke, 2009</xref>, citing Levin, 1999, 2003). The point is therefore not to identify ‘best practice’ in order to organize centralized dissemination and replication of ‘what works’. Resilient, sustainable development involves sharing stories, identifying problems and exploiting connections, through which people find common ground, spark ideas and imagination, experiment with processes and structures of support, and take action. They thereby build capacity to change what needs to be changed, organically, in a way that suits their context, and to learn from the process.</p>
<p>Often this is uncomfortable and requires courage to adjust to new ways of working. In this risk-taking, counter-cultural development work, the flexible, responsive methodologies for enquiry and feedback informing and underpinning change are difficult to implement and to synthesize, requiring high levels of micro-political literacy and intercultural understanding. However, organizational, local and regional systems can provide the conditions within which this important activity can flourish. Enlightened government or agency backing, or the vision and practical endorsement of a supportive headteacher, can empower individual agents and local groups, encouraging them to ‘open their classroom doors’ and enabling them to negotiate policy and mandates, as colleagues from Loyola University suggest, to construct more appropriate support for learners and better organizational environments for learning and development. Diversity, participation and creativity in <italic>learning</italic> require the same attributes in organizational and systemic <italic>leadership</italic>. As people realize what is possible, the culture begins to change and capacity is built to self-generate such activity organically within schools and communities. Thus in Laos, funding has ended but many schools are committed to continuing their self-evaluation work, to increase inclusion and engage families and communities with educational development. The quotations from teachers in the other projects show that they, too, have changed their professional mindset. In David Frost’s article, an enhanced sense of participation and voice is evident amongst teachers, along with realizations of the power of collaborative enquiry and development. Teresa Cremin and colleagues have seen teachers gaining confidence in assuming a research disposition and developing greater reciprocity and interaction with children and families. Claire Corner has renewed commitment and conviction in leading creative learning in her school.</p>
<p>Creative school and system leadership and external support focuses on allowing teachers and other participants not only the implementational space, but also engagement with the kinds of ideological principles and theoretical and practical frameworks offered in all these articles, to maintain the necessary balance between the enactment of imposed policy and the construction of localized environments supportive of learning. This transcends policy and the boundaries of ‘school’. In the examples here, children’s funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212452657">Moll &amp; Greenberg, 1990</xref>) are brought into the school and classroom to support both literacy development and language learning, while creative approaches to support for bilingual learners aspire towards global citizenship. Teacher leadership in Southeast Europe is gathering increasing political momentum, founded on the cumulative evidence of many small-scale, teacher-led projects that are contributing to inclusion, enhancing learning and participation within fragmented communities. Students involved in Claire Corner’s creative learning project have reconnected with learning by imagining – designing – their own new worlds, raising fundamental questions amongst this small group of young people about science, society and human and ecological sustainability. For this kind of work, children and young people, their teachers, families and communities need more space beyond the normal restrictions of curriculum and pedagogy, to ask their own questions and build their own solutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1365480212452657">
<title>Challenging school-centricity</title>
<p>Amongst the many hurdles and pitfalls of this complex work, the research evidence presented here shows that there is much to delight, satisfy and affirm teachers, students and those who support them in improving schools from the inside. This work is not merely aspirational, it is happening now. The accounts contain revelations, joyful moments and deeply significant encounters. Where research meets development, the accounts evidence a rich tapestry of learning through participating together in gatherings and conversations, music, dancing, games and sports, arts, crafts and construction, enquiry, technological communication and different forms of storying. The narratives, activities and artefacts generated are tools for exploring and developing the cultural landscape, reinforcing that diversity is a powerful resource for learning. Nurturing difference, and the creativity it generates between individuals and organizations, builds resilience in the face of increasing challenges of educational purpose.</p>
<p>These projects and frameworks do not substitute for performativity, but they do offer a counterbalance to the current hegemony. They demonstrate not one-off interventions, but an initial culture shift, where responsive, breakthrough practice is a catalyst for meaningful improvement. In order to take genuine account of the current and future needs of children and young people, families and communities, this must be underpinned by inclusive processes and collaborative enquiry framed by research-informed models, principles and protocols. With enlightened, context-sensitive leadership from school principals and headteachers within districts and regions, these approaches can enable schools to provide local leadership towards more sustainable ways of working. This involves facing up to the fragility of current, flawed systems, which, in their knee-jerk reactions to save face and solve the problems of the day, fail to address human inequities and social and political instabilities that hinder our ability to meet the challenges of the future. Somewhat paradoxically, there are many examples here of schools and teachers challenging pervading school-centric approaches to education. The examples offered deliberately create tensions with ‘school as we know it’. Beyond performance tables, government and international targets and centralized accountability, the boundaries between school and home are blurred, connecting with families, drawing communities in and letting imagination and innovation transform lives and learning.</p>
