<p>Crossing the faraway ocean to arrive in America,</p>
<p>Leaving behind my hometown, family and friends—</p>
<p>Who would have expected to be stranded in a wooden building,</p>
<p>Not knowing when I can hold my head up with pride? (Lee &amp; Yung, 2010, p. 104)</p>
<attrib>-Lee Puey You, detainee on Angel Island, 1939</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the immigrants who passed through the Angel Island Immigration Station during its three-decade operation from 1910 to 1940 experienced varying levels of interrogation and detainment. Lee Puey You pursued several layers of legal litigation during a 20-month struggle to gain admission into the United States. Though Lee Puey You’ s was one possible experience of the immigrants that passed through Angel Island, so too was the experience of Australian Reverend Hugh Linton. Reverend Linton and his wife were held at the station overnight while awaiting inspection of their immigration documents. Having been separated from his wife, and forbidden to hold a conversation with her during their overnight stay, the Reverend expressed outrage at U.S. immigration laws that “treats a man as if he were a criminal” and “imprisons him for a length of time to suit the fancy of the authorities” (p. 30).</p>
<p>The range of immigrant experiences documented by Erika Lee and Judy Yung in <italic>Angel Island: Immigrant Gateway to America</italic> describes the practices of an immigrant processing station that was a physical manifestation of U.S. immigration laws and their influence on who could and couldn’t become Americans. Through oral history interviews, government documents, writings by various participants of the immigration process on Angel Island and photographs, Lee and Yung construct a book that encompasses the experiences of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, Russian, Mexican, and Filipino immigrants on Angel Island. Lee and Yung’s exhaustive investigation exposes immigration policies that included some and excluded others based on race, class, and gender, ultimately defining an idealized American identity.</p>
<p>The book begins by describing the logistics of common inspection, examination, and detention procedures of the Angel Island Immigration Station. Many of the procedures were dictated by class, nationality, race, and immigrant status of the arriving individual. For example, those arriving in first-class sections of ships—passengers who were mostly White, wealthy U.S. citizens or European visitors—were given cursory medical inspections, while those of lower classes were subjected to more intrusive and demeaning examinations to promote exclusion based on mental incapacities and physical conditions such as communicable diseases. Further segregation was based on race to “protect non-Asians from Asians and the contagious diseases that they allegedly spread” (p. 34). This perception was based on the notion that immigrants from impoverished nations harbored contagious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986313487620">Guskin &amp; Wilson, 2007b</xref>). The section continues with Lee and Yung describing those enforcing the law, as well as how those laws were interpreted, providing a backdrop for how the various racial and national groups entering Angel Island were treated, detained, admitted, or expelled.</p>
<p>Lee and Yung organize the following seven sections based on racial and national groups though without providing rationale for their order. With approximately 100,000 detainees during its operation, the Chinese were the largest immigrant group to be filtered through Angel Island. Chapter 2 focuses on their experiences of navigating the challenges of landing given the Chinese exclusion laws, prompting legal opposition and inventive strategies such as the creation of “paper sons” to thwart them. This chapter is especially poignant given that this group had to combat legislation designed to exclude them based exclusively on race. At the same time, it is inspirational in that the Chinese were able to circumvent the exclusion laws by navigating the U.S. legal system, and by augmenting their own identities.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Lee and Yung describe how diplomatic relations were the main factor in the treatment of the Japanese immigrants on Angel Island, where the Japanese government secured more lenient interrogation and detention procedures for its citizens as compared to Chinese immigrants. In particular, this created a wave of immigration of Japanese “picture brides” that prompted immigration inspectors to focus on aspects of morality to ensure that women were not prostitutes, highlighting gender issues and their role in immigrant history.</p>
<p>The theme pervading Chapter 5 is related to refugee status, as Koreans fleeing Japanese imperialism made harsh journeys to attempt immigration into the United States. Though at a relatively small number—1,000 immigrants—Lee and Yung make the case that it is worthwhile to examine this group’s unique citizenship status as “a people without a country” (p. 178). The U.S. government’s general leniency toward these Korean refugees demonstrated how its foreign policy objectives shaped its attitude toward differing groups of refugees, a concept that is just as substantial today as it was at the beginning of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986313487620">Guskin &amp; Wilson, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986313487620">McBrien, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is an important description of immigration to Angel Island from the point of view of White Europeans, as Russians and Jews made their way through this station. Though they were the most diverse group in terms of religious affiliation, profession, and political leaning, Russians and Jews from across Europe were grouped by race, and therefore subject to laws and policies that were far different from those of Asians. Though low economic status and political convictions did result in rejections, their admission rates were better than those of their counterparts on Ellis Island. The experiences of Russians and Jews at Angel Island reinforce the idea that European racial groups were favored by U.S. immigration policy based on the theory that they can assimilate fully into American society.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this book is its ability to demonstrate how, for nearly a century, U.S. immigration policy was governed by racism, both blatant and subtle. Primarily, Chinese immigrants faced the most discrimination when seeking admittance to the United States by way of Angel Island. Anti-Chinese sentiment rooted in fears of economic and moral corruption led to the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and a series of other laws that aimed to prohibit the settlement of people of Chinese descent in the United States. Medical examinations on Angel Island to root out “Oriental diseases” (p. 77) were culturally insensitive and extremely humiliating, which included having applicants strip naked, submit stool samples, and be probed by militaristic health inspectors. Chinese men and women were separated and detained on the island, often for days or weeks, and had to submit to intense interrogations that scrutinized minor details, such as the exact size of one’s bedroom or the furniture that existed at a mutual relative’s house in their hometowns, to establish credibility to their relationships. Detainees were housed separately based on race, and the facilities for Asians were designed to prevent escapes, even at the expense of safety as there were no fire escapes with windows perpetually locked. The Chinese were detained more often and for longer periods of time than any other racial group, leading to despair and frustration since they were kept in what essentially was a prison. Their anguish is documented in the hundreds of surviving Chinese poems carved into barracks walls during their weeks of confinement, such as the poem by Lee Puey You above.</p>
<p>To subvert the Chinese exclusion laws, which were contested by many to be unconstitutional, some Chinese males pursuing immigration invented false identities to become “paper sons.” As a paper son, one claimed to be a son of either a merchant or native-born U.S. citizen already in the United States as these were classes that were exempt from the exclusion laws. By some estimates, 90% of Chinese immigrants passing through Angel Island did so with false documentation. However, documentation did not guarantee admittance, as wary immigration officials tried to counter the paper son system. Harsh, lengthy interrogations could include up to 900 questions about the most intricate of details, often inclusive of threatening and intimidating undertones. These enforcement practices led to many Chinese to choose between exclusion or taking a “the crooked path” (p. 84) to land.</p>
<p>Through this book, Lee and Yung provide a rich history of immigration to the United States by framing the Angel Island experience from the perspectives of the various groups that passed through its gates. The authors touch on many facets of immigration law and policy that governed the decisions that were made at the immigration station dealing directly with the notion of who could and should be American. They make a strong case for why Angel Island should be recognized not only for its role in immigrant history, but also for its role in forging a national American identity.</p>
