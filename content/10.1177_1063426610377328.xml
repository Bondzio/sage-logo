<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors examined the concurrent validity, predictive validity, and concurrent and predictive classification accuracy of using schoolwide behavior expectations as a universal behavioral screener. Three elementary schools implementing schoolwide positive behavior supports (SWPBS) participated. Within each school, the entire school population was screened using items derived from schoolwide behavior expectations. Structural equation modeling revealed moderate to strong associations between SWPBS expectations and constructs formed from the criterion measure. SWPBS expectations converged with the school problems, externalizing problem behaviors, and adaptive skills constructs but diverged from the internalizing construct. Concurrent classification with a norm-referenced screener was generally adequate but varied depending on school and index. Predictive classification analyses using office discipline referrals also yielded comparable results as the norm-referenced screener. Although not without limitations, this study provides initial evidence of the validity of using SWPBS expectations to screen for behavioral risk.</p>

<p>In response to mounting concerns about school discipline and problem behaviors that disrupt academic learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063426610377328">Rochkind, Ott, Immerwahr, Doble, &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426610377328">Rose &amp; Gallup, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>), many schools are electing to implement schoolwide positive behavioral support (SWPBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). SWPBS is a multitier prevention-oriented model designed to address behaviors that violate school norms (e.g., noncompliance, disruption, and aggression) by emphasizing the teaching, monitoring, and encouragement of prosocial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). SWPBS is currently implemented at some level in most states, and implementation of the approach is supported through the National Technical Assistance Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pbis.org">www.pbis.org</ext-link>). Based on prevention science and applied behavior analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>), SWPBS reflects many of the features of response to intervention (RtI) by emphasizing a multitier approach to prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063426610377328">Gresham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426610377328">Hawken, Vincent, &amp; Schumann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>) that includes a focus on (a) data-based decision making, (b) universal screening, (c) continuous progress monitoring, (d) continuum of evidence-based practices, (e) implementation integrity, (f) content expertise and fluency, and (g) team-based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1063426610377328">
<title>Multiple Tiers of Behavior Support</title>
<p>Evidence supporting the effectiveness of SWPBS as a preventive approach is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426610377328">Barrett, Bradshaw, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426610377328">Bradshaw, Koth, Bevans, Ialongo, &amp; Leaf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426610377328">Bradshaw, Koth, Thornton, &amp; Leaf, 2009</xref>). SWPBS focuses on multiple tiers of behavioral support: primary (Tier 1), secondary (Tier 2), and tertiary (Tier 3). Within SWPBS, approximately 80% of the student population is projected to benefit from primary (i.e., Tier 1) behavioral supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). Primary tier behavior supports focuses on implementation of evidence-based practices that involve teachers, parents, and community members that are directed toward all students in all settings to prevent problem behaviors from occurring. In particular, at the primary tier, behavior supports include the development of a discipline plan that includes the defining, teaching, and reinforcement of schoolwide behavior expectations. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai and Horner (2006)</xref> explained, there is a smaller proportion (10%–15%) of a school’s student population that will likely be nonresponsive to primary tier behaviors supports and, therefore, requires secondary and/or tertiary tiers of behavioral supports. Examples of secondary tier behavior supports include social skills instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426610377328">Lane et al., 2003</xref>) and behavioral intervention and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610377328">Fairbanks, Sugai, Guardino, &amp; Lathrop, 2007</xref>). Finally, a smaller proportion of a school’s student population (approximately 5%–10%) will likely fail to respond to both primary and secondary tier intervention efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>) and will require tertiary tier behavioral supports. Examples of tertiary tier behavior supports are function-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610377328">Fairbanks et al., 2007</xref>), wraparound services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426610377328">Eber, Sugai, Smith, &amp; Scott, 2002</xref>), and multisystem (i.e., school, family, and community) academic and behavioral interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426610377328">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Basic Features of SWPBS</title>
<p>Five basic process features of SWPBS are addressed by school teams implementing the approach at the primary tier. Although the “look and feel” of SWPBS depends on the needs of a given school, these general features are the same across implementations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). The first feature of SWPBS is the establishment of a small set (3–5) of positively worded behavioral expectations. These expectations (e.g., being respectful, cooperative, or prepared) consist of prosocial attributes, social skills, and/or specific positive behaviors identified and valued by the school and worded to convey what students <italic>should</italic> do rather than what they should not do. For example, the SWPBS expectation “be respectful” might entail positive traits such as “showing kindness and consideration” or more discreet prosocial behaviors such as “listening quietly during instruction” and “raising a hand in class and waiting to be recognized.” The second essential feature of SWPBS is the direct teaching of the three to five positive behavior expectations to all students by all staff in a school. The instruction is planned, detailed, and specific, mirroring the methods typically used to teach academic skills. The third feature of a SWPBS implementation involves schoolwide positive reinforcement strategies to increase and maintain the extent to which all students follow, and display, representative behavior of those schoolwide expectations. The fourth feature of a SWPBS implementation entails predictable and consistent follow-through when students violate schoolwide expectations. These disciplinary consequences are designed to decrease problem behaviors that interfere or compete with students’ adherence to the schoolwide behavior expectations. The final feature of a SWPBS implementation involves data-based decision making. A variety of data are collected and used for decision making, universal screening, and progress monitoring during SWPBS implementation, including office discipline referrals (ODRs).</p>

<title>Universal Screening for Secondary and Tertiary Tier Behavioral Supports</title>
<p>Universal behavioral screening has gained attention for use within SWPBS as a means of proactively identifying students who are nonresponsive to schoolwide primary tier interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426610377328">Hawken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610377328">B. Walker, Cheney, Stage, &amp; Blum, 2005</xref>); moreover, it is one of the defining features of an RtI approach. To clarify, this study uses the term <italic>universal behavioral screening</italic> to refer to a systemic approach for identifying students who exhibit problem behaviors or demonstrate characteristics that may place them at behavioral risk. <italic>Behavioral risk</italic> generally refers to problem behaviors or characteristics that are associated with the development of emotional and behavioral problems. Behavioral risk characteristics related to conduct problems and acting out problem behaviors are of special interest as they are often a defining characteristic of students referred for emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) as well as of students who generate most ODRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker et al., 2004</xref>). Within the context of SWPBS, universal behavioral screening focuses on identifying students who are nonresponsive to SWPBS and require secondary or tertiary tier interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610377328">Fairbanks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610377328">B. Walker et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1063426610377328">
<title>ODRs</title>
<p>ODRs are one source of schoolwide data schools implementing SWPBS use for universal screening. ODRs document violations of expected school behavior. Schools summarize these data in a number of ways, including the total number of referrals generated within a school per day or per month as well as by student, grade level, location, type of violation, and time of day. Schools then use this information to determine focus areas of need and the tier of the behavioral intervention needed and to monitor responsiveness to intervention at each of the three tiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426610377328">Sugai, Sprague, Horner, &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>). For schools that consistently assign ODRs and evaluate those data, the number and/or type of ODRs a student receives is also used as a general screener for behavioral risk. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426610377328">Sugai et al. (2000)</xref>, earning zero or one ODR in a school year reflects low risk, receiving two to five ODRs indicates moderate risk, and receiving six or more ODRs suggests high behavioral risk.</p>
<p>Although useful as general indices of behavior risk, some aspects of ODRs have not been well researched, for example, whether ODRs for major rule infractions should be weighted the same across infraction categories (i.e., violent and aggressive vs. nonviolent/aggressive problem behaviors) in determining behavioral risk. Moreover, as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426610377328">Kern and Manz (2004)</xref>, variables such as teacher interpretation of whether a rule violation has occurred, teacher tolerance for problem behaviors, and perceived level of support from administration are all variables that influence the validity of ODRs. In addition, although ODRs are a readily available data source for problem solving in SWPBS, a primary limitation of using ODRs to identify students who are at behavioral risk is that they must exhibit several incidents of problem behavior that are frequent or intense enough to violate school rules for an intervention to be triggered. Ideally, it would be beneficial to identify students early on, before multiple ODRs are generated.</p>

<sec id="section5-1063426610377328">
<title>Behavior rating instruments</title>
<p>Behavior rating instruments are another option for universal screening in schools implementing SWPBS. Behavior rating instruments, especially those that are relatively brief and contain externalizing items, are appealing. Most notably, the <italic>Systematic Screening for Behavioral Disorders</italic> (SSBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker &amp; Severson, 1990</xref>) has been used extensively in conjunction with SWPBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610377328">B. Walker et al., 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, despite the pairing of instruments such as the SSBD with SWPBS, many schools continue to be reluctant to engage in universal behavioral screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610377328">Severson, Walker, Hope-Doolittle, Kratochwill, &amp; Gresham, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Prevention approaches vary with respect to what types of behavioral risk are targeted for intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426610377328">Lochman &amp; the Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610377328">Glover and Albers (2007)</xref> suggested that school adoption and use of behavior rating instruments for universal screening are influenced by whether the instrument is (a) aligned with relevant constructs of interest, (b) contextually appropriate, (c) usable, and (d) compatible with local service delivery needs. In the case of SWPBS, a major goal, especially during the first phases of implementation, is to improve school discipline and reduce behavioral risk by promoting prosocial behaviors and reducing problem behaviors associated with the SWPBS expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>). Given this emphasis, many SWPBS teams may not see the immediate relevance of using screening instruments that use items or taxonomies that are secondary to this schoolwide intervention goal.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1063426610377328">
<title>Universal Screening Using SWPBS Expectations</title>
<p>We propose that SWPBS expectations may be a potentially viable option for SWPBS teams that are interested in universal screening but are reluctant to adopt a behavioral screening instrument or do not want to rely entirely on ODRs for screening. The main purpose of using SWPBS expectations for screening would be to identify students whose prosocial behaviors fail to meet local normative behavioral standards at the primary tier. Using items anchored in SWPBS expectations for screening would not specifically screen for the range of emotional and behavioral problems reflected by other screening instruments such as the SSBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker &amp; Severson, 1990</xref>) or the <italic>BASC-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System</italic> (BASC-2 BESS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>). Moreover, using SWPBS behavior expectations as a screener would not reference a nationally normed sample or focus on identification based on specific diagnostic criteria or a taxonomy of symptoms related to specific EBD, which is important for special education eligibility determinations. Instead, this procedure would function as an individualized, brief, teacher-friendly, low-cost, criterion-referenced screening to prioritize identifying students having difficulty meeting their school’s behavioral expectations. Thus, the focus is on identifying students whose behavioral risk is associated with failure to meet local normative standards of prosocial behavior referenced or indexed by school-specific SWPBS behavioral expectations.</p>
<p>Using SWPBS expectations for screening is intuitively appealing and has potential for assisting in SWPBS implementations for several reasons. First, school teams implementing SWPBS often spend a considerable amount of time identifying, defining, and gaining campuswide buy-in on their SWPBS expectations. Expanding the potential uses and benefits of SWPBS expectations would assist in achieving active support and participation by staff members at the schoolwide level. Second, identifying and defining SWPBS expectations serves as the foundation for primary tier SWPBS interventions, especially for schoolwide behavioral teaching and reinforcement. Third, many schools seem hesitant to screen their students on behavior because of concerns regarding labeling, usability, cost, and/or time commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610377328">Severson et al., 2007</xref>). The use of behavior expectations tailored to a school’s SWPBS implementation may make universal screening more acceptable by minimizing labeling, increasing usability, decreasing cost, and improving time efficiency. Fourth, many secondary and tertiary interventions currently being used focus on SWPBS expectations as the basis for intervention, thereby providing immediate linkages. For example, the Check, Connect and Expect program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426610377328">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426610377328">Cheney, Flower, &amp; Templeton, 2008</xref>), check-in check-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610377328">Fairbanks et al., 2007</xref>), and the Behavior Education Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426610377328">Crone, Horner, &amp; Hawken, 2004</xref>) use SWPBS expectations as the basis for both intervention and progress monitoring. Last, using SWPBS expectations as the basis for screening provides a local, contextually relevant reference point for each student with respect to his or her connection to the schoolwide language and standards of expected behavior. For students requiring secondary or tertiary tier interventions, screening data may also serve as a comparison baseline for judging progress and intervention effectiveness.</p>
<p>Because SWPBS schools invest substantive amounts of time and effort in the development, teaching, and reinforcement of their behavioral expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426610377328">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>), using SWPBS expectations as the basis for behavioral screening makes both sound conceptual and applied sense for those schools. To date, no study has investigated the validity of using SWPBS expectations as the basis for screening behavioral risk. Our purpose in this study was to provide initial evidence of the validity of a universal behavioral screener anchored to SWPBS expectations that could be used to identify students who are at risk of behavioral failure because of relative unresponsiveness to schoolwide primary tier interventions.</p>

<title>Instruments and Measures</title>
<p>Two types of teacher rating instruments were used. A teacher behavior rating protocol was developed from each participating school’s SWPBS expectations and administered. In addition, the BASC-2 BESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>) was administered at approximately the same time. Both these instruments were used in the concurrent validity and classification analysis. As a third measure, the number of ODRs was collected from the participating schools and used in the predictive classification analysis.</p>
<sec id="section10-1063426610377328">
<title>SWPBS expectations</title>
<p>Each school’s individual SWPBS expectations served as the item descriptors for the teacher behavioral ratings. A class list was generated for each participating teacher, and they were given the following directions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Listed below is your student roster. Please respond to the question regarding the degree to which each student listed meets your schoolwide expectations. Please rate each on 1 through 5. Please mark every item. If you don’t know or are unsure of your response to an item, give your best approximation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The item SWPBS descriptors were placed on a 5-point Likert-type scale so teachers could rate the degree to which a student met a particular behavior expectation. The Likert-type scale descriptors were <italic>never or almost never</italic> (1), <italic>rarely</italic> (2), <italic>sometimes</italic> (3), <italic>often</italic> (4), and <italic>always or almost always</italic> (5). The item descriptors reflecting the SWPBS expectations for School D were (a) be nice, (b) be honest, and (c) be respectful. School N’s SWPBS expectations were (a) responsibility, (b) respect, (c) eagerness to learn, (d) awesome attitude, (e) caring, and (f) honest always (RREACH). Finally, School W’s SWPBS expectations were (a) prepared, (b) respectful, (c) involved, (d) determined, and (e) encouraging (PRIDE).</p>
<p>Because of other competing school priorities, the schools declined to participate in a systematic test–retest sampling plan. However, test–retest correlations were conducted using a sample of convenience with Schools N and W within a 2- to 3-week time frame to gain some sense of the reliability of using the SWPBS ratings. Both of these schools had several teachers who were open to rerating their students. Teachers who rated students from School N had a total score correlation of .66 with an <italic>n</italic> of 110. Teachers from School W had a total score correlation of .83 with an <italic>n</italic> of 135. Individual school SWPBS expectations for School N were as follows: (a) responsibility .55, (b) respect .44, (c) eagerness to learn .65, (d) awesome attitude .65, (e) caring .60, and (f) honest always .42. Reliability correlations for School W’s schoolwide behavioral expectations were as follows: (a) prepared .74, (b) respectful .69, (c) involved .77, (d) determined .68, and (e) encouraging .76.</p>

<sec id="section11-1063426610377328">
<title>BASC-2 BESS</title>
<p>We used the teacher child and adolescent form of the BASC-2 BESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>) as a concurrent validity and classification criterion measure. The BASC-2 BESS consists of 27 items empirically derived from items of the <italic>Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children</italic> (BASC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426610377328">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>). Items reflect externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skills. Each area includes six items, except for internalizing problems, for which the instrument oversamples with nine items. The BASC-2 BESS uses a 4-point Likert-type scale (<italic>never, sometimes, often, always</italic>). The individual items for this teacher rating are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610377328">Table 2</xref> along with the four constructs they represent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>). The BASC-2 BESS does not provide subscale total scores or norms for externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skills. Rather, it translates scores reflected by these constructs into a total behavior risk score, which is then compared to a national norm and used to place children into risk categories: normal, elevated risk, or extremely elevated risk. The elevated and extremely elevated risk categories provided by the BASC-2 BESS were collapsed in this study into two risk categories for analysis. Students identified as having elevated levels of risk are administered the BASC-2 to determine the specific symptoms related to EBD. According to the BASC-2 BESS manual, the test–retest reliability of the BASC-2 BESS is .91 with a split-half reliability of .96. Correlations between the BASC-2 BESS and the BASC-2 teacher rating scales are .80 for externalizing problems, .64 for internalizing problems, .89 for school problems, –.85 for adaptive skills, and .91 for the behavioral symptoms index.</p>

<title>ODRs</title>
<p>We used each school’s extant ODRs as an end of the year predictive classification criterion. Data were downloaded from the Referral Assessment Management Portal (RAMP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426610377328">Education Service Center Region XIII, 2010</xref>). RAMP is a web-based data system developed for systematically summarizing and reporting ODR information and is supported by a local regional center serving the three participating schools. The number of ODRs by student was downloaded from the beginning to the end of the school year for each of the three schools. For coding of behavioral risk, a total of zero to one ODRs was considered an indicator of nonrisk whereas a total of two or more ODRs was considered to be an indicator of increased behavioral risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426610377328">Sugai et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>We recruited as participants three schools located in a suburban area of central Texas, whose school district was implementing SWPBS and RtI. Each school (a) had received team training in SWPBS, (b) had school SWPBS leadership teams, and (c) was receiving ongoing SWPBS and RtI support from district-level behavioral coaches. Moreover, each school was implementing SWPBS with a high degree of fidelity, as reflected in total scores greater than 80% on the <italic>School Evaluation Tool</italic> (SET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426610377328">Horner et al., 2004</xref>). A SET score greater than 80% indicates a relatively high degree of implementation integrity of primary tier interventions and systems.</p>
<sec id="section14-1063426610377328">
<title>Piloting SWPBS items</title>
<p>We initially field-tested the administration procedures for the SWPBS expectations with the SWPBS teams in the participating schools. To do so, the school expectations were provided to each school’s SWPBS leadership teams along with their school behavioral matrix. Gaining reliability during the field testing proved to be difficult when including the SWPBS behavior matrix. For example, some teachers on the leadership teams wanted to assign a rating for each area defined by the matrix (classroom, cafeteria, recess, etc.) rather than an overall global rating regarding the degree to which a particular student met the SWPBS expectations. Thus, a decision was made for school teams to review the matrix with teachers ahead of time to familiarize them with their SWPBS expectations but not to include it in the administration protocol. As a result, similar to the administration format of the BASC-2 BESS, teachers were simply asked to make an overall judgment regarding each item.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1063426610377328">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The study was conducted as part of the participating school district’s ongoing SWPBS activities. We coordinated data collection with each school’s coach and the district’s coordinator of behavioral services. Passive parental consent was used in which parents were informed of the district’s policy regarding behavior screening and procedures for opting out. The SWPBS expectation-based screener and the BASC-2 BESS were then administered in the fall (October) of the school year. The former was administered online using a website developed for the study. Teachers were given a password that provided them access to a webpage that listed both the class lists of participating students and the schoolwide behavioral expectations for their school. For each behavioral expectation, teachers were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert-type scale the degree to which a particular student met the expectation. The data collection for the SWPBS expectation screener lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Once all teachers had responded to the schoolwide behavioral expectation screener, folders were distributed through the district’s SWPBS coaches that contained BASC-2 BESS instruments for each student on a teacher’s class list. Teachers were allowed 2 weeks to complete and return the BASC-2 BESS. Each school’s SWPBS coach followed up on any missing data. Last, ODR data were downloaded from the districts’ database at the end of the school year.</p>

<sec id="section16-1063426610377328">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics as well as the correlations between the SWPBS expectations and the BASC-2 BESS items were generated. Most of the correlations between SWPBS expectations and BASC-2 BESS items represent negative rather than positive relationships because of scale construction and scoring. Because SWPBS expectations are positively worded, higher scores are more desirable on the SWPBS expectations screener, indicating that a particular student was more likely to meet school expectations. However, most BASC-2 BESS items are worded so that lower scores are more desirable (i.e., low levels of risk). The exception is Item 1 (pays attention) and the adaptive skill items, which are positively worded. These items were reverse coded per the BASC-2 BESS manual to obtain researcher-constructed subscales and the BASC-2 BESS total score. For example, on Item 1 (pays attention), a <italic>never</italic> or <italic>sometimes</italic> response would indicate an increased level of behavioral risk and would, therefore, be reverse coded, whereas on Item 2 (disobeys), the same response would indicate a lower level of behavioral risk.</p>
<sec id="section17-1063426610377328">
<title>Structural equation modeling</title>
<p>We used structural equation modeling (SEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426610377328">R. B. Kline, 2004</xref>) to examine the concurrent validity of the SWPBS expectations and BASC-2 BESS items. SEM enables analysis of measurement and structural models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426610377328">R. B. Kline, 2004</xref>) and measurement error so that relations may be examined among error-free constructs. The behavioral screening data from the predictor (SWPBS expectations and the BASC-2 BESS) were used to form five constructs, or latent factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063426610377328">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063426610377328">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1063426610377328">3</xref>). These constructs included externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, adaptive skills, and the SWPBS behavioral expectations. The first four constructs were from the BASC-2 BESS. The items and the structure of the four constructs were hypothesized to be the same across all schools. Except for the scale of internalizing problems, which contains nine items, each of the other three constructs contains six items.</p>

<p>The construct formed from the SWPBS expectations was anchored in each school’s individual schoolwide expectations. Both the number of items and their content varied across schools. For example, School D developed a three-expectation construct, whereas Schools N and W developed six-expectation and five-expectation constructs, respectively. The school expectations-based latent variable was hypothesized to be moderately to strongly associated with the four constructs from the BASC-2 BESS. Because of the uniqueness of each school’s behavior expectations, the relationship between school expectations and the BASC-2 BESS constructs was examined separately for each school.</p>
<p>To account for the dependency among observations (student) within clusters (teacher), we used the Type = complex routine in Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426610377328">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>) for data analysis. This procedure takes the nested structure and the nonindependent observations into consideration by adjusting the standard error of the estimated coefficients. The overall model was evaluated by using root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426610377328">Steiger, 1990</xref>) and its 90% confidence interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426610377328">MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996</xref>), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426610377328">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998</xref>), and comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063426610377328">Bentler, 1990</xref>). The fit of the model was determined by the commonly used criteria, including RMSEA less than .08, SRMR less than .08, and CFI greater than .90. Once SEM models for each school had been constructed, the variance explained by the expectation-based construct was determined. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was obtained by subtracting the residual variance of the latent factor from 1, given that no other predictor exists and that all coefficients are standardized so that the variance of latent factor equals 1.</p>

<title>Concurrent and predictive classification accuracy</title>
<p>The concurrent and predictive classification accuracy of the SWPBS expectations for behavioral screening was examined using logistic regression (LR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063426610377328">Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000</xref>). The BASC-2 BESS risk levels served as the criterion variable for concurrent classification, and the number of ODR discipline infractions during the academic school year served as the outcome for predictive classification analysis. LR uses an iterative maximum likelihood model to optimize the prediction based on the smallest overall number of errors (false positives and false negatives) and also permits differential weighting of these two types of errors based on social desirability for a particular context. For a universal screener, high value is usually placed on identifying a large percentage of true at-risk students (true positives), even at the cost of overidentifying students who are not at risk (false positives; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426610377328">Altman, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063426610377328">Swets, Dawes, &amp; Monahan, 2000</xref>) outputs were used to identify cutoff scores that would minimize false positives while maintaining a desirable true positive rate. This procedure generally results in reduced overall classification accuracy but improved capture rates of true at-risk students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426610377328">Pepe, 2003</xref>). Both the sensitivity index (i.e., the probability that the screener positively identifies “at-risk” students) and the specificity index (i.e., the probability that the screener positively identifies typically functioning students) from the ROC analyses were used to identify a cut score. With the goal of creating a decision model, a sensitivity rate of 70% was targeted, even though others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>) have indicated that a lower level of 50% may be acceptable for a screener depending on the other indices. In addition to examining the classification indices for each school, standardized cut scores using <italic>z</italic> scores were created and classification was examined across all three schools.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610377328">Table 2</xref> provides the means and standard deviations of the SWPBS expectations for the three schools. Because of the large number of intercorrelations among items, only the concurrent criterion-related correlations between the schoolwide expectations for a particular school and the BASC-2 BESS items are shown. Items within a construct were significantly correlated with each other (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) for all five constructs across all schools, with correlations ranging from .22 to .88.

The total scores for each of the school expectations were also correlated with the BASC-2 BESS (see the shaded area in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426610377328">Table 2</xref>).

In addition, we examined the total expectation score for each school and the BASC-2 BESS subscales. Correlations for the total expectation score and total subscale scores were as follows for the three schools, respectively: (a) .77, .65, and .77 for school problems; (b) .75, 76, and .73 for externalizing; (c) .44, .44, and .50 for internalizing; and (d) .49, .61, and .73 for adaptive skills.

<title>School D</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063426610377328">Figure 1</xref> provides the modified model for School D. The overall fit of the original model was not fully satisfactory (CFI = .873, RMSEA = .071 with 90% CI = .067, .075, and SRMR = .074). To improve the overall fit, the model was modified by adding four correlated residuals between (a) Item 15 and Item 22 of the internalizing problems subscale, (b) Item 14 and Item 25 of the internalizing problems subscale, (c) Item 8 and Item 10 of the school problems subscale, and (d) Item 5 and Item 24 of the adaptive skills subscale. Correlated residuals may suggest substantive content overlap or similar phrasings; allowing residuals to be correlated is sometimes necessary for model improvement and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426610377328">Brown, 2006</xref>). These correlated residuals were added only between items <italic>within</italic> a specific subscale or construct. Compared to the original model, the modified model fit the data better (CFI = .906, RMSEA = .061 with 90% CI = .058, .065, and SRMR = .072). All coefficients demonstrated a similar pattern and significance between the models with and without correlated residuals. All the items of the five constructs were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and positively loaded on the corresponding constructs. In addition, the SWPBS expectations factor negatively predicted the externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skill constructs. In other words, the more likely a student was to meet a school’s behavioral expectations, the less likely he or she was to be at behavioral risk on the BASC-2 BESS. All the path coefficients were standardized and statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 after controlling for three student-related demographic variables, grade, gender, and ethnicity. SWPBS expectations explained (a) 62% of the variance in the externalizing problems construct, (b) 26% of the variance in the internalizing problems construct, (c) 32% of the variance in the school problems construct, and (d) 23% of the variance in the adaptive skills construct.</p>

The original model without correlated residuals was not fully satisfactory for School N either (CFI = .865, RMSEA = .069 with 90% CI = .065, .072, and SRMR = .073). Six correlated residuals were added between (a) Item 13 and Item 11 of the internalizing problems subscale, (b) Item 15 and Item 22 of the internalizing problems subscale, (c) Item 8 and Item 10 of the school problems subscale, (d) Item 9 and Item 27 of the adaptive skills subscale, (e) Item 19 and Item 17 of the adaptive skills subscale, and (f) respect and caring cooperative of the SWPBS expectations-based scale. All correlated residuals were added only between items within a specific subscale. As illustrated, the modified model fit the data better (CFI = .902, RMSEA = .059 with 90% CI = .055, .063, and SRMR = .067). The pattern and significance of the coefficients were in the same directions as those without correlated residuals. The four BASC-2 BESS constructs, namely, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skills, were all predicted by the school-developed SWPBS expectations factor. All coefficients were standardized and were statistically significant (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) after controlling for students’ grade level, gender, and ethnicity. Similar to the findings for School D, the SWPBS expectations factor explained 64% of the variance in the externalizing problems construct and 23% of the variance in internalizing problems construct. In addition, SWPBS expectations explained a similar portion of variance for both the school problems (50%) and adaptive skills (48%) constructs.</p>

Similar to the other two schools, the original model for School W without correlated residuals resulted in a mediocre fit (CFI = .887, RMSEA = .062 with 90% CI = .059, .065, and SRMR = .071). By adding two correlated residual errors between (a) Item 15 and Item 22 of the internalizing subscale and (b) Item 5 and Item 24 of the adaptive skills subscale, the fit of the model was improved (CFI = .901, RMSEA = .058 with 90% CI = .055, .062, and SRMR = .071). As illustrated, with or without correlated residuals, the model demonstrated the same pattern and significance of coefficients. Consistent with the findings from the other two schools, the School W–developed SWPBS expectations still predicted the externalizing problems, internalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skills constructs of the BASC-2 BESS. All coefficients were standardized and were statistically significant (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) after controlling for students’ grade level, gender, and ethnicity. A substantial amount of variance in the four BASC-2 BESS factors (i.e., 61% of externalizing problems, 33% of internalizing problems, 64% of school problems, and 54% of adaptive skills construct) was explained by School W’s SWPBS expectations factor.</p>

<title>Concurrent Classification Accuracy of BASC-2 BESS Risk Status</title>
<p>The ROC analysis used BASC-2 BESS risk categories as the grouping variable and the SWPBS expectations total scores as the numeric independent variable. The BASC-2 BESS produces three categories of classification (normal, elevated, and extremely elevated), but the current analysis compressed the extremely elevated and elevated categories into a single at risk variable. The resulting analysis was a 2 × 2 comparison of BASC-2 BESS elevated and normal categories to the SWPBS expectations numeric scores. The ROC analysis yielded area under the curve (AUC) estimates of .889, .831, and .920, respectively, for Schools N, D, and W. The AUC indicates a high likelihood that a randomly selected student with an “elevated” score on the BASC-2 BESS would have a lower sum score on the SWPBS expectations-based screener than a randomly selected student without an “elevated” score on the BASC-2 BESS.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426610377328">Table 3</xref> lists the range of classification outputs, showing the results of different cut scores and indices of classification accuracy for each school. The cut scores for the 4th through 24th percentiles are provided using the SWPBS expectations as the classification predictor. As illustrated, overall classification accuracy was above 80% regardless of cut score. Sensitivity ranged from 17% to 68% for School D, from 20% to 72% for School N, and from 24% to 80% for School W depending on the cut score, with acceptable levels being observed at the 24th percentile. Specificity was high for all three schools, with the lowest classification being 89%. Positive predictive value (PPV) varied from 91% to 66% for School D, from 89% to 63% for School N, and from 91% to 67% for School W.

<title>Predictive Classification Analysis With ODRs</title>
<p>We examined the predictive classification of SWPBS expectations with ODRs. Moreover, as a comparison, we examined the predictive classification of the BASC-2 BESS with ODRs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1063426610377328">Table 5</xref> provides the results of a predictive classification analysis conducted between the total score of SWPBS expectations and end of year risk status as determined by ODRs. Cut scores are provided for the 7th through 24th percentiles for School D, the 5th through 15th percentiles for School N, and the 2nd through 17th percentiles for School W. As illustrated, the overall predictive classification accuracy of low versus high risk as determined by ODRs was greater than 80% regardless of cut score. Sensitivity ranged from 42% to 85% for School D, from 43% to 70% for School N, and from 18% to 47% for School W. Thus, an acceptable level of sensitivity was observed for Schools D and N but not for School W. Specificity was acceptable for all three schools, with the lowest classification being 82%. PPV varied from 53% to 32% for School D, from 53% to 26% for School N, and from 46% to 17% for School W. NPV ranged from 94% to 98% for School D, from 97% to 98% for School N, and from 95% to 96% for School W.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated the validity of a brief, criterion-referenced, universal screener developed from SWPBS expectations. The results from this initial study are promising in some areas and mixed in others. First, we found the moderate to strong relationships in the correlation matrix between the SWPBS expectations and externalizing problems, school problems, and adaptive skills encouraging. Moreover, the SEM models mirrored the correlation matrix, and we found moderate to strong structural coefficients in the expectations-based constructs and the externalizing, school problems, and adaptive skill constructs. The externalizing and school problem items all yielded moderate to strong negative associations. As a student’s total criterion score for SWPBS expectations increased, the student was less likely to display the characteristics reflected in these constructs. Moreover, as the criterion score for SWPBS expectations increased, adaptive skills generally showed a moderate to strong increase.</p>
<p>We also found the SWPBS expectation factor explained substantive amounts of variance for the externalizing, school problems, and adaptive skill constructs. Sensitivity was initially low but increased to acceptable levels as the total score for the SWPBS screener was raised toward the 25th percentile, or 60% to 70% of the total expectation criterion score. In addition, we observed sensitivity levels of 68%, 72%, and 80%, respectively, at the 25th percentile. These estimates are generally consistent with other behavioral screeners in the research literature, including the SRSS (Student Risk Screening Scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610377328">Lane et al., 2009</xref>), the BASC-2 BESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>), and the SSBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426610377328">B. Walker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker &amp; Severson, 1990</xref>). Moreover, we found predictive classification indices for SWPBS expectations to be comparable to the BASC-2 BESS in predicting ODR risk status for two of the three schools.</p>
<p>However, despite some positive outcomes, other aspects of the results were mixed. For example, although somewhat expected, correlation and SEM results indicated weaker associations with internalizing problems. This divergence from the internalizing items indicated that SWPBS expectations did not relate to this aspect of behavioral risk. We also found low reliability levels for some individual expectations. Moreover, the sensitivity with ODRs was adequate for two schools, but for one school (School W) it was unacceptably low until the 33rd percentile was reached. We address these issues further in the limitations section.</p>

<title>Implications for SWPBS Practice</title>
<p>Screening using SWPBS expectations has several practical implications for schools implementing SWPBS and RtI. First, at the primary tier, this screening procedure provides SWPBS teams with a relatively low-cost, user-friendly, brief behavioral screener for identifying students who are not responding to SWPBS primary tier interventions. Whether because of a lack of contextual appropriateness, compatibility, or usability, many schools seem unwilling to engage in universal behavioral screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426610377328">Glover &amp; Albers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610377328">Severson et al., 2007</xref>). Screening using SWPBS expectations provides teams implementing SWPBS with a procedure that has congruence with their implementation efforts. Given this congruence, more schools implementing SWPBS may be inclined to screen for behavioral risk. In addition, screening data have the potential to provide SWPBS teams with an additional form of data for schoolwide problem solving and examination of patterns of risk depending on the expectation being violated. For example, if substantive numbers of students were identified as not meeting the expectation of “being respectful,” schoolwide social skills and reinforcement could be targeted toward that expectation by SWPBS teams. Moreover, there is potential for schoolwide “benchmarking” where schools implementing SWPBS are screened on their expectations at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year.</p>
<p>Second, at the secondary and tertiary tiers, students who are at risk because of failure to meet school expectations can be proactively identified and provided intervention before multiple ODRs are generated. The results of this study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1063426610377328">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1063426610377328">5</xref>) indicated that the bottom 25% of the students screened had a SWPBS criterion total score of 60% to 70%, with most students (75%) scoring above this criterion level. In other words, most students would likely be rated as meeting the SWPBS expectations (e.g., be respectful) either <italic>often</italic> or <italic>almost always</italic>/<italic>always</italic>. However, if teachers perceive students as meeting the SWPBS expectations <italic>sometimes, rarely</italic>, or <italic>never</italic>/<italic>almost never</italic>, then the total additive criterion score would drop and place them in the behavioral risk category. Most students from the three participating schools were rated by teachers at a criterion level not indicative of behavioral risk and would not be assessed any further. However, for the 25% of students rated as meeting the SWPBS expectations below the 60% to 70% level (as indicated by the total SWPBS expectation criterion score), then they would be vetted, whether through SWPBS teams or through additional assessments, for possible secondary and tertiary tier behavioral supports. Fortunately, many SWPBS schools are implementing secondary and tertiary tier behavioral supports that rely on monitoring progress on SWPBS expectations. For example, secondary tier programs like the Behavior Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426610377328">Crone et al., 2004</xref>) and the Check, Connect, and Expect programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426610377328">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>) and some tertiary tier function-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426610377328">Fairbanks et al., 2007</xref>) include a focus on SWPBS expectations. The SWPBS expectation screening procedure examined in this study provides immediate portability and linkages to these interventions.</p>
<p>Third, although not specifically explored in this study, it seems reasonable that screening using SWPBS expectations could be used as an initial gate for universal screening in conjunction with a multigating approach. Other screening systems use a similar approach to better identify student needs and their specific areas of behavioral risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426610377328">Severson et al., 2007</xref>). For example, the SSBD uses rank-ordered teacher nominations to determine who will receive additional, more in-depth assessment, and the BASC-2 BESS uses the 27-item screener described in the current study to determine who will receive the more comprehensive BASC-2. In a similar manner, SWPBS expectations could be used as an initial gate at which all students in a school implementing SWPBS are screened, followed by a more comprehensive assessment as a second gate for the reduced pool of students identified from the screener as being at behavioral risk.</p>

<title>Caveats, Limitations, and Future Directions</title>
<p>Although the results from this study are encouraging, several caveats and limitations must be noted. These and corresponding future directions for research are now considered. First, the correlations and SEM models showed evidence that SWPBS behavioral expectations diverged from the internalizing items on the BASC-2 BESS. Thus, screening using SWPBS expectations is a poor choice if the goal of school teams is to identify students with internalizing problems. While acknowledging this limitation, the results observed are not unreasonable given the purpose of the procedure within SWPBS. As a point of comparison, the BASC-2 BESS developers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426610377328">Kamphaus &amp; Reynolds, 2008</xref>) compared BASC-2 BESS risk status classification with four BASC-2 composite scales using LR (behavior symptoms index, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and school problems). Using a <italic>t</italic> score of 60, the BASC-2 BESS showed a high level of specificity (greater than .90) on each of the four BASC-2 behavior composite scales. However, sensitivity rates were more variable, with the behavioral symptoms index at .80, externalizing problems at .71, internalizing at .53, and school problems at .70. Although the BASC-2 BESS shows acceptable levels of sensitivity for three of the behavior domains, internalizing problems remained modest, indicating the difficulty of screening students in this area. In another recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426610377328">Lane et al. (2009)</xref> compared the SRSS to the SSBD in a similar effort to validate a brief screening procedure. Lane et al. found that the SRSS was better at classifying externalizing than internalizing problems, yielding high sensitivity rates for students with externalizing behaviors (.81 to .95) but much lower sensitivity rates for students with internalizing behaviors (.44 to .65). With regard to predictive classification, classification rates of other behavioral screeners using ODRs as an outcome measure were not available in the research literature.</p>
<p>Second, the consequential validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426610377328">Messick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426610377328">Shepard, 1997</xref>) of using SWPBS expectations may be of concern. Consequential validity refers to the positive and negative, as well as the intended and unintended, consequences of the inferences consumers, in this case schools, make from an assessment. As mentioned, the positive consequences of using SWPBS are the potential increased use of behavioral screening by schools implementing SWPBS. The ease of use, contextual fit, and ability to individualize screening to match prosocial behaviors that are being targeted for intervention by schools make screening using SWPBS expectations intuitively appealing. However, there are potential drawbacks to not using a standardized norm-referenced screener. Most notable, many of the norm-referenced behavioral rating instruments can be used to cast a wider screening net beyond students captured by SWPBS expectations. For example, the BASC-2 BESS can be used in conjunction with the BASC-2 to develop a student profile that reflects a range of emotional and behavioral symptoms (attention problems, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, somatization, etc). Moreover, instruments like the BASC-2 BESS have national norms that can be used to determine risk, whereas screening using SWPBS expectations is criterion referenced and based on local normative standards. Therefore, schools considering implementing the procedure should be aware that screening using SWPBS expectations is not intended for identification of all forms of behavioral risk and that its purpose is more narrowly defined within the context of SWPBS. Some schools implementing SWPBS may want to dedicate resources toward other forms of behavioral risk than that represented by SWPBS expectations, especially in the later phases once fidelity of implementation is achieved. If so, they should review other screening systems (e.g., SSBD or BASC-2 BESS) that focus on a broader range of learner characteristics associated with behavioral risk.</p>
<p>Third, the test–retest reliability and predictive classification of the SWPBS ratings may be a concern. A reliability score of .70 is recommended as adequate and .80 or greater is recommended for good reliability for screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426610377328">P. Kline, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426610377328">Salvia &amp; Ysseldyke, 2001</xref>). In this study, the total score reliability for School W was stronger (.83) than for School N (.66). Also, there was variability in reliability depending on the specific behavioral expectation. Based on these “rules of thumb,” the total score for School W would have good reliability and School N would approach adequate reliability. As a comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1063426610377328">H. M. Walker et al.’s (1988)</xref> seminal article reporting the initial results of the SSBD indicated that at Gate 1 there was an average test–retest reliability of .76 with a range of .33 to .98 for externalizers and an average test–retest reliability of .74 with a range of .45 to .94 for internalizers. To increase test–retest reliability, future research should focus on administration formats that better integrate the SWPBS behavioral matrix and the operational definitions of the expectations. Better specification of the behavioral expectations for administration will likely lead to better teacher judgments and improved classifications of risk status. Moreover, because a sampling of convenience was used in this study to examine reliability, a more systematic sampling plan is needed using a larger sample of students and a larger number of expectations to better establish the reliability of the SWPBS expectation screening procedure.</p>
<p>Fourth, we did not collect social validity and consumer satisfaction data. The inference was that, because the participating schools were implementing SWPBS, they would find the SWPBS expectations-based screener more acceptable as a screening approach. Not unexpectedly, therefore, we received anecdotal reports during data collection suggesting that teachers preferred the SWPBS expectations screener over the longer BASC-2 BESS. Specifically, the SWPBS teams reported that teachers preferred the SWPBS screener because of the smaller number of items and better alignment with their goals. However, further studies are needed on the social validity of this approach.</p>
<p>Finally, further research is needed on how school teams implementing SWPBS should use the data in conjunction with other aspects of RtI (i.e., problem solving, progress monitoring, and intervention development). In this study, the universal screening served as an initial screening, and then the risk lists generated from this study were provided to each school’s SWPBS team, who then vetted the pool of students found to be at risk and determined which of the students would receive additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 behavioral supports. As mentioned earlier, it seems reasonable that screening using SWPBS expectations could be used as part of a multiple gating approach to determine who should receive additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 behavioral supports. However, additional research is needed on how the results of SWPBS expectation screening can be integrated into various SWPBS implementations and RtI models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, additional research is needed on viable, brief, low-cost methods of universal screening that can be combined with SWPBS. Discussions are ongoing within the professional literature on how SWPBS may align with universal behavior screening and RtI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426610377328">Hawken et al., 2008</xref>). The present study provides initial evidence of the validity of a brief criterion-referenced approach to universal screening anchored in school-based expectations. Although not without limitations, the procedure has the potential to improve screening practices for schools implementing SWPBS and further link research to practice.</p>
