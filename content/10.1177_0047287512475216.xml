<abstract>
<p>Long wait times for rides and restaurants are major sources of visitor dissatisfaction with theme and amusement parks. Crowding is often worse than it needs to be because park visitors distribute themselves unevenly. In this paper, we discuss a novel method of routing visitors to less crowded areas by offering them well-timed incentives and information on mobile devices. Two large field studies (<italic>n</italic> = 910 and <italic>n</italic> = 1,370) were conducted to test how receptive visitors were to altering their paths in response to incentives and information. The results indicate that a system such as ours can mitigate suboptimal crowd distribution in real time in a typical theme park environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Crowding is a major source of dissatisfaction among visitors to amusement and theme parks and also a significant reason why people do not visit parks in the first place. Visitors want to avoid lines and park operators want to make the most of their capital investments. If visitors are somewhat flexible in their itineraries, there is an opportunity to improve their experiences by directing them to less crowded parts of a park and to attractions that they might otherwise overlook. The practice of directing variable demand in a closed system is sometimes referred to as “load balancing,” a term originating in mechanical engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512475216">Park, Caught, and House 1914</xref>), and which has since expanded to include leisure-demand management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512475216">Simons, Scholten, and Jansen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512475216">Hamhoum and Kray 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512475216">Canora et al. 2008</xref>). In this study, we investigated ways to use geo-tracked mobile devices to mitigate the crowding problem, both to increase visitor satisfaction and intent to visit and revisit.</p>
<p>In particular, we studied the effectiveness of incentives and information delivered to mobile devices in influencing how visitors navigated and experienced two major theme parks. We measured visitors’ receptivity to a wide variety of informational, experiential, and commercial incentives. We experimented with ways to manage the deployment of incentives, including the use of behavioral profiling to target visitors appropriately and the use of real-time interfaces for park operators to deploy incentives and monitor their performance. We also report on the user experience with our device hardware and software.</p>
<p>In the next section, we outline related work. We then describe our experimental methodology. Finally, we present our results, and conclude with a discussion of open issues and future research opportunities.</p>

<sec id="section2-0047287512475216">
<title>Related Work</title>
<p>We are not aware of another published experiment or case study on real-time load balancing in theme parks via incentives and information delivered on mobile devices. However, there is related work on several themes: crowding as a source of dissatisfaction in theme parks; reservation systems for park attractions; advertising and marketing on mobile devices; the simulation of pedestrian crowds; and the technical and behavioral aspects of mobile computing for tourism applications.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512475216">McClung (1991)</xref> surveyed heads of households from 10 metropolitan areas in the United States on the topic of theme park attendance and noted that crowding is an important issue for both visitors and nonvisitors. For park visitors deciding whether or not to attend, crowding ranked fifth in importance as an influencing factor, behind climate, park-type preference, children’s desire to visit, and cost. For nonvisitors, crowding ranked third in influence, behind lodging and climate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512475216">Pikkemaat and Schuckert (2007)</xref> surveyed theme park managers in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland regarding the factors affecting the success of their parks. In their study, the scores given to capacity and queue management ranked just below the mean score for all factors considered.</p>
<p>While crowding is a macro problem, it most frequently manifests to theme park visitors as long queue waits for attractions and restaurants. Dissatisfaction from queuing and stratagems to counter it are well-studied phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512475216">Maister (1985)</xref> developed a number of principles for reducing the perception of wait times that are used today by many queue designers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512475216">Durrande-Moreau (1999)</xref> provides an overview of empirical research in queue design and management. However, reducing actual wait times through crowd management addresses the root cause of the queue problem and is therefore our focus.</p>
<p>To date, the most successful and widely adopted approaches to crowding mitigation in theme parks have been based on the concept of virtual queuing or reservation. Several ride reservation systems have been patented that work much like restaurant reservations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512475216">Mahoney and Ragsdale 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512475216">Laval and Hale 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512475216">Sim 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512475216">Ackley, Hale, and Schweizer 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475216">Hale et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512475216">Waytena, Raubvogel, and Sachs 2011</xref>). Of these, the best-known implementation is Disney’s Fastpass™ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512475216">Dickson, Ford, and Laval 2005</xref>). The primary goal of such capacity-control systems is to obviate the need for park visitors to stand in long lines, but load balancing can be a secondary goal or a side effect. They all share one key characteristic: the visitor must request a reservation in person at the attraction, at a kiosk or web terminal, or via a mobile device. In contrast to this “pull” approach, in our study we took a proactive approach: reserved attraction tickets, incentives, and information were “pushed” to study participants without them explicitly requesting anything. The idea of pushed incentives for theme park load balancing was anticipated briefly in another patent application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512475216">Simons, Scholten, and Jansen 2002</xref>) but never implemented and the application was subsequently abandoned.</p>
<p>In another context, however, pushed incentives have become very popular. Advertising and discounting via mobile devices was first described by multiple authors in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512475216">Barwise and Strong 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475216">Munson and Gupta 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512475216">Ranganathan and Campbell 2002</xref>), and later in that decade became the basis for several start-ups, the most notable of which is Groupon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512475216">Dholakia 2011</xref>). In this approach, the goal is to optimize the revenue of the vendors that advertise; any load balancing that occurs in the environment is unintentional and serendipitous. In contrast, our goal is the global optimization of the resources in an entire entertainment ecosystem. This requires a coordinated and planned approach to the deployment of incentives and information that is very different from the simple mass dissemination of ads and discounts as practiced by Groupon and similar companies.</p>
<p>The simulation of pedestrian crowds has been studied extensively for several applications, including the optimal design of the built environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512475216">Zhou et al. 2010</xref>). However, to be useful for our purposes, the behavior of simulated crowds must correlate strongly with the behavior of real crowds. While this is the subject of ongoing research, simulation tools are not yet capable of modeling crowd behavior with the fidelity needed to accurately describe and predict the responses of crowds to the kinds of incentives and information that we wanted to use.</p>
<p>There is great potential for mobile computing to revolutionize tourism. This possibility was anticipated by the early work of several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512475216">Cheverst et al. 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512475216">Cheverst et al. 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475216">Schmidt-Belz et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512475216">Brown and Chalmers 2003</xref>). The survey paper of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512475216">Kenteris, Gavalas, and Economou (2011)</xref> and the book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512475216">Molz (2012)</xref> provide current snapshots of the field of mobile computing for tourism and other location-based applications.

<title>Experimental Methodology</title>
<sec id="section4-0047287512475216">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Previous approaches to solving the crowd-mitigation problem have mostly exploited reservation systems, virtual-queue systems, and capacity control mechanisms. Our novel contribution is to describe and test a new mechanism: pushed incentives on mobile devices. Our premise is that a globally aware system that understands real-time crowding, coupled with an intervention to incentivize large numbers of individuals to move to less crowded areas, will result in better crowd flow and distribution. In essence, the summation of individual choice results in positive mass movement. Thus, the research question is to test, in a natural field experiment, whether this premise holds given the real-world complexity of a theme park experience.</p>
<p>For our research methodology we chose what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512475216">Harrison and List (2004)</xref> call a “natural field experiment” design. This method has the potential advantage of greater external validity as participant behavior takes place in a natural environment with naturalistic decision making. However, it also introduces potential risks from external influences that may be uncontrolled or unaccounted for. Field experiments are somewhat rare in the hospitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512475216">Baloglu and Assante 1999</xref>) and tourism fields (inferring from the statistical methods reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475216">Reid and Andereck’s [1989]</xref> tourism meta-study). A significant reason for the rarity of this approach is the time and cost involved in a field experiment. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512475216">Nykiel (2007)</xref> argues that field experiments may be appropriate when the management decisions hinging on the outcome may be large. Since our goal was to understand the potential relationship between mobile incentives, marketplace behavior, and crowding, a field-experiment methodology was appropriate to evaluate the performance of our intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287512475216">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We designed and conducted two field experiments to study how theme park visitors responded to pushed incentives and information that they received on mobile devices. The first test, T1, took place at a theme park in the United States (P1) over a five-day period in Summer 2010 and involved 910 visitor groups, with an average of 3.56 visitors per group. The second test, T2, occurred eight months later at a European resort that comprises two separate but connected parks, P2A and P2B. Test T2 ran for 10 days and involved 1,370 visitor groups, with an average of 4.17 visitors per group. In both tests, we recruited visitors at the park entrances during the first three hours of operation. We asked every 10th party to participate. We excluded visitors who already had a park-related mobile application on a personal cell phone, who were in groups of more than five people, who were not planning on spending the whole day in the park, or who worked for the park operator. The study participation rate was higher than 95% for approached parties. We gave participants a short survey to collect demographic information and then instructed them on the use of our test application. To preserve participant privacy in test T1, participants’ names and phone numbers were kept separate from and unlinked to all other data. In test T2, we collected no identifying information from participants at all.</p>
<p>In test T1, participants were instructed to return the device at the end of the day as they left the park. In test T2, participants could switch between the two parks P2A and P2B and keep the device for the whole day; 6% of participants kept it throughout a multiday stay. On returning the device, the participants were asked to provide feedback on the device functionality and usage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0047287512475216">
<title>Materials and Software</title>
<p>We lent participants a mobile device running our custom software application, which took approximately eight man-months of software development time. For test T1, the device was an HTC Eris running Android 1.6 with a 1700-mAh battery (4-5 hours of battery life). For test T2, we used a Samsung Captivate running Android 2.2 with a 3300-mAh battery (~12 hours of battery life). We encased both phones in a custom housing to prevent participants from accessing any functionality other than the custom application. No additional infrastructure in the parks was needed to support the test.</p>
<p>For test T1, the interface was in English only; for test T2, the participant could select English, French, and Spanish versions. The test app included the following functionalities:</p>
<list id="list1-0047287512475216" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An interactive map that showed the participant’s current location as determined by GPS.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A listing of attraction wait times that were updated via cellular communication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A listing of theatrical show times.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other entertainment experiences unrelated to the study objectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Information and incentives.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The incentives and information appeared in a dedicated section of the app called “Bonus.” Upon receipt of a new bonus, the device would buzz and ring to notify participants. Bonuses were informational (e.g., notification of the current wait time at a particular attraction), experiential (e.g., preferred seating at a theatrical show), and commercial (e.g., a discount coupon for food or merchandise) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512475216">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512475216">2</xref>). Participants redeemed the experiential and commercial bonuses by showing them to park staff at the target location.</p>

<p>The system architecture, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512475216">Figure 1</xref>, consists of a central server, a control interface, and multiple clients (participant devices). Client locations were computed on the participant devices using GPS and sent back to the server. Other client-to-server communication included time-stamped activity on the device, such as when a particular screen was viewed.</p>

<p>The control interface allowed real-time observation of all device locations as well as historical information of the path each device had traveled through the park. Monitoring also included real-time information on bonus redemption tied to each particular participant group.</p>
<p>The control interface also allowed real-time control of the delivery of information and incentive bonuses. Bonuses could be selected and pushed to devices in a gross fashion by delivering to all devices, to all devices in a certain geographical area, and to all devices in a certain geographical area at a specified future time. In addition, bonuses could be individually targeted at a particular device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0047287512475216">
<title>Descriptions and Structure of “Bonuses”</title>
<p>We worked with park operators to design a set of bonuses and trigger criteria that would achieve the goal of crowd mitigation while also meeting operational considerations such as point-of-sale operation, staff training, ease of accounting, and noninterference with other park operations. Simultaneously, we wished to ensure that our bonuses (and the mobile application in general) would create a positive experience for participants, as this was a natural field experiment in which participants had paid for regular admission to the park.</p>
<p>The T1 bonuses were intended to elicit the following participant behaviors:</p>
<list id="list2-0047287512475216" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To increase visitation to an underutilized restaurant at lunch time (T1.a).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To draw participants to a less popular attraction pavilion (T1.b).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To reduce current demand for a popular attraction by immediately drawing participants to neighboring attractions (T1.c, T1.d).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, we wanted to conduct some initial experiments to gauge the relative drawing power of experiential bonuses (T1.e) and to test a novel discounting scheme (T1.f).</p>
<p>Based on our experiences with test T1, we were able to develop a more sophisticated set of bonuses for test T2. The T2 bonuses were designed to elicit the following behaviors:</p>

<list-item><p>To increase visitation to underutilized restaurants at various times from the late morning to the late afternoon (T2.a, T2.b, T2.c).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To draw participants to a sparsely attended theater show (T2.d).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To entice participants to move to or stay in the less populated Park P2B in the afternoon (T2.e, T2.f, T2.g).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, to demonstrate the ability to customize and personalize our system we experimented with targeting bonuses at specific guests based on their behavioral profiles (T2.h).</p>
<p>Except as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512475216">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512475216">2</xref>, the dollar and euro values of the bonuses were not communicated to the participants. For reference, the range of prices for quick-service restaurants and tea was $8-$14; the buffet restaurant price in T2.b was €24; and the range of prices for the merchandise item in T1.b was $6-$12.</p>
<p>In order to assess the effectiveness of the system and bonuses, most of the elements in both tests T1 and T2 needed a visitor pool as a point of comparison. In test T1, attraction and restaurant visitation rates were available for the overall visitor base during the time period of the test. Therefore the control group in T1 was defined as the overall visitor base. It was not possible to exclude our 910 participant groups from this overall pooled data, but the test participants represented only 2.1% of the total visitors to the park during the test and so had little influence on the aggregate data.</p>
<p>For test T2 we did not have similar park-wide data, so we assigned participants to control groups that did not receive the bonuses in question.</p>
<p>In test T1, all participants were eligible to receive all the bonuses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512475216">Table 1</xref> if they met the trigger criteria, which typically involved being present in the park with the device after a certain time or moving into a specified area of the park. The magnitude of the desired detours was greatest for T1.a, which typically required participants to traverse a park for redemption, a distance of about 1,000 meters.</p>
<p>In test T2, most bonuses were activated according to time and location triggers as in test T1. The magnitude of the detours was greatest for T2.e-T2.g, which typically required participants to move to the less populated park for redemption, a distance of approximately 825 meters.</p>
<p>The one exception to time and location triggers was bonus T2.h, in which a small set of participants received custom bonuses based on real-time monitoring of park conditions and their recent histories in the park. The specific trigger criteria and bonuses comprised the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0047287512475216" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If participants’ paths indicated they had experienced relatively few attractions for the amount of time they had spent in the park, possibly suggesting a poor experience, they were sent a bonus for a free merchandise item.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If participants’ paths indicated a pattern of exclusive use of attractions targeted at the youngest visitors, suggesting that the group contained small children, they were given preferred seating for a suitable stage show.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If participants’ current locations indicated they were waiting for a parade, they were given a merchandise bonus for parade regalia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If participants’ current locations indicated they were near an attraction that was temporarily closed, they were given a timed reservation for a comparable attraction elsewhere in the park.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Even though triggers in both tests included multiple factors such as time, location, park conditions, and inference about participants’ preferences, these criteria were opaque to the participants. From their point of view, bonuses appeared randomly and participants could freely decide whether to utilize bonuses or not.</p>

<title>Effectiveness of Bonuses</title>
<p>A primary goal of our experiments was to measure how effective the various bonuses were in eliciting the specific goal behaviors that we had targeted. In test T1.a, the percentage of participant groups in our study who ate lunch at the underutilized restaurant almost tripled relative to control, which is highly significant according to a one-tailed <italic>Z</italic>-test (<italic>Z</italic> = 9.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, attendance at the adjoining underutilized attraction almost doubled (<italic>Z</italic> = 6.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The situation for test T1.b was more complex. Relatively few test participants used their discount bonus to purchase what is typically a very unpopular item, but participants experienced the adjoining attraction at a rate that was 47% higher than normal (<italic>Z</italic> = 4.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Therefore, the bonus was enough to entice a significantly greater number of visitors to enter the pavilion, but it was not attractive enough to cause many of them to buy the discounted item. Finally, there was no compelling evidence to suggest that tests T1.c and T1.d immediately pulled participants away from the most-popular park attraction to nearby attractions, even though there was a high redemption rate for the merchandise-discount bonuses (T1.d) at these nearby attractions by day’s end. We concluded that the attraction in question is so popular that drawing people away from it with any immediacy using our incentives was unlikely to work.</p>
<p>Although we lacked comparison data for tests T1.e and T1.f, both proved very effective, with high participation rates. Test T1.e demonstrated the potential for experiential bonuses, and in test T1.f we broadly replicated the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512475216">Gneezy et al. (2010)</xref> with regard to pay-what-you-want pricing with and without charitable giving.</p>
<p>In test T2, almost twice the number of participants receiving a food-and-beverage bonus (T2.a-c) ate at the targeted restaurants during the specific time windows than did participants in a control group (<italic>Z</italic> = 5.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The results were similar for preferred seating at targeted theater shows during specific time windows (T2.d): participants were 76% more likely to go to the shows than control participants (<italic>Z</italic> = 3.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>Pulling participants to the less populated park was a little more difficult. Timed reservations for particular attractions (bonus T2.e) were not effective. This was something of a surprise, because visitors will often queue for a long time to visit these attractions. Likewise, low-value free items (bonus T2.f) were not effective. However, the three most-expensive free items, those with a retail value of €10 or more, were quite effective (bonus T2.g), pulling in 83% more participants into the second park (<italic>Z</italic> = 3.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002). It is important to note that the actual costs of the free items in bonus T2.g are considerably less than the retail costs, so this kind of bonus was the most cost-effective method of moving people from crowded to less crowded areas.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bonuses that were targeted at specific participants based on their current location and past paths through the park (T2.h) showed promise, with several anecdotal successes. However, these scenarios were not tested with enough participants to achieve statistical significance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0047287512475216">
<title>Device Usage</title>
<p>In addition to monitoring actual usage of the device and how the device affected participant movement, we wanted to understand how participants perceived the device. Participants provided valuable feedback on our system through the concluding survey. In 43% of the groups, the primary device user was an adult older than age 35 years. However, children frequently controlled the interaction; in 13% of the groups, the primary device user was in the 10-14 years age range. In both tests, approximately 65% of the participants rated the device as Excellent or Very Good. Participants gave no indication that they felt the device was overly commercial. Indeed the features that were perceived as the greatest benefits to the participants were the wait times and the map, with the bonuses being the third-best benefit. And although 56% of participants in test T1 and 56% of those in test T2 said that the device had influenced their day, no participant in either study commented about feeling manipulated. It appears that if structured correctly, participant agency can be maintained while providing subtle influence to improve the overall visitor distribution throughout the park.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section13-0047287512475216">
<title>Key Findings</title>
<p>The three major findings of our field experiments are: incentives pushed to mobile devices can be a valuable crowd mitigation mechanism, with significant crowd movement being easily achieved through cost-effective incentives; the use of these incentives benefits not only the recipients but all park visitors through better crowd distribution; and deployment of a mobile app like ours can be easily achieved without additional park infrastructure and large capital outlay.</p>
<p>While some might speculate that theme park visitors would be open to deviating their itineraries in response to incentives, this result was by no means a certainty. Theme parks are stimulating environments. Visitors could easily prefer to visit nearby attractions, restaurants, and shopping facilities where the appeal is visible rather than visit unknown, distant locations. Furthermore, visitors could be reluctant to abandon plans to attend “preferred” (crowded) attractions even in response to incentives. Visitors could put significant value on maximizing their time and energy expenditure in the park and not be willing to walk long distances. Incentives could even have a negative effect, with visitors speculating that incentivized locations must inherently be inferior, else why would they be incentivized. Lastly, visitors’ responsiveness to incentives on mobile devices might be thwarted by practical issues in a theme park such as visitors not being able to hear a notification that a bonus was received, not knowing how to reach a specified location, or even ignoring a mobile device altogether in the rich environment.</p>
<p>The success of the two tests suggests an obvious question: why were the bonus-redemption rates so high? It is hard to find published redemption rates for localized coupons that are appropriate for a theme park context. In our experience, a typical rate is 2%-3%. Almost all of our bonuses had higher redemption rates, some substantially higher. One possible answer is that our bonuses were individually more enticing than many typical coupons. Another possible answer is that targeting the coupons by location, time, and prior behavior on mobile devices increases redemption rates. A third possibility is that the repetitive offering of bonuses on a mobile device in the context of a theme park conditions redemption behavior. Probably all of these factors affected redemption rates, but further research is needed to tease out their relative impact and to tune the bonuses for optimal performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0047287512475216">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The practicalities of deploying two field tests of this magnitude (thousands of participants, hundreds of devices, dozens of staff, months of software development and integration with and minimal disruption to an ongoing business) necessitated a narrowing of the research questions that could be tested. While this research focused on whether or not incentives could be used to mitigate crowding, the most interesting direction for future investigation is the nature and structure of the incentives themselves. To deploy an economically and operationally optimal system and tailor effective bonuses, managers will need to understand a great deal about human behavior on a micro- and macro-scale. What other incentives might be offered and which ones work best in various situations? How do phenomena such as weather and holidays affect receptivity? Do infrequent or first-time visitors (the majority of theme park visitors) exhibit different response patterns relative to frequent visitors? How is offer value perceived and weighted? Do these findings replicate in various locales and with various cultures? These investigations could take advantage of the flurry of recent research into consumer behavior and “push” marketing via mobile phones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512475216">Leppäniemi and Karjaluoto 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512475216">Varnali and Toker 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512475216">Persaud and Azhar 2012</xref>). Fortunately, modular computer systems such as ours are well suited to rapid experimentation and all these questions could be quickly answered.</p>
<p>The fact that the field study was conducted in the midst of an ongoing and unmodified business operation created another limitation: overall park experience was unlikely to significantly change for those in our study. Ideally, metrics such as perceived crowdedness or perceived wait times could be used to determine the value of the experience to the participant. However, since only a very small fraction of the park’s visitors were participants (and thus being incentivized to change their location), crowdedness and wait times in toto were unchanged. Moreover, the fraction of a participant’s day spent in less crowded areas as a response to our incentives was not likely to offset the overall impression of crowdedness or wait times. While the results were promising in terms of individual behavior, important measures like these will not be calculable until mass deployment is achieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0047287512475216">
<title>Caveats</title>
<p>Practitioners should be cautious of introducing various negative emotions through a system such as ours. In particular, additional concerns of visitor autonomy and fairness may be injected into an industrial sector that already struggles with those concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512475216">Wright 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512475216">Alexander et al. 2012</xref>). The goal of preserving autonomy in economic decision making, while also encouraging choices that lead to good outcomes (e.g., choosing low-wait experiences over long-wait experiences), has been coined as “light paternalism” in the behavioral-economics literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512475216">Loewenstein and Haisley 2007</xref>). An incentive- and information-based crowd-management system should aim to provide enough information and personally appropriate incentives to the visitor that his personal experience only improves, should he choose to act on the incentives and/or information. In addition, the overall decrease in systemwide wait times (providing benefits to all visitors) is a fundamental metric. Both the personal and the systemic benefits should be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that no participant is sacrificing the quality of his visit for the good of the whole.</p>
<p>The monetary nature of our system also introduces the possibility of other negative emotions. Those that respond to bonuses may regret the opportunity costs of missed experiences. Those that don’t respond may regret “passing” on a discount, particularly if they end up paying more during a subsequent experience. Those that miss out on a pricing promotion, especially when hearing about it postpurchase (e.g., a lunch bonus that arrives just after the visitors have eaten lunch), have been found to experience negative emotions such as anger, disappointment, and regret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512475216">Chen, Tsai, and Chuang 2010</xref>). Care must also be taken to avoid actual or perceived unfairness. Targeted promotions, which provide differentiated prices to various consumers, can induce negative emotion, especially when consumers become aware of the prices that other customers are paying. The resulting negative emotions, perception of unfairness, and potential decline in perceived value may influence purchase intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475216">Tsai and Lee 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0047287512475216">
<title>Practical Deployment Issues</title>
<p>Optimizing bonus-redemption rates is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for optimal mitigation of crowding within a park. The deployment of bonuses must be coordinated appropriately to achieve optimal crowd flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512475216">Ahmadi 1997</xref>). In our experiments, we used a control system in which bonus-deployment decisions were made centrally. The inputs to the decision process primarily came from the participants’ devices: their prior and current location data. We also had access to participants’ prior bonus-redemption behavior, although we did not use that data in the current study. In addition, we had real-time data regarding the queue lengths at major attractions. But we lacked fine-grained data regarding the local conditions at minor attractions, theater shows, restaurants, etc. A distributed system that allowed the operators of all park venues to report their statuses and to attract or disperse visitors through dynamic bonus requests might be superior to our centralized system. And in fact we did a very small-scale experiment during test T2 to allow some store managers to dynamically deploy bonuses for their locations. While it was enthusiastically received by our small sample of managers, the design of a fully decentralized control system that can achieve globally optimal crowd mitigation will be a major research challenge.</p>
<p>In our system, crowd mitigation comes at a cost since some of our bonuses involve merchandise or food-and-beverage discounts. A proper business evaluation of our system would compare these costs with the benefits derived from crowd mitigation. However, the costs are not easily accounted for because many of the discounted items have limited shelf life or low turnover. Moreover, the analysis is further confounded since the savings that a visitor accumulates might be offset by incremental spend elsewhere in the park. And finally, it is very difficult to quantify the financial benefits of crowd mitigation, real though they are.</p>
<p>An economic analysis is complicated by the potential for a tiered service model. Reservation systems for rides and restaurants can help mitigate crowding as a secondary effect, but they are primarily designed to minimize wait times for some visitors—the ones with reservations—at particular venues. However, this comes at the cost to these visitors of introducing some rigidity into their park visits, and also lengthens the wait times for visitors without reservations. If desired, the incentives in our system could be configured to minimize the wait times of certain visitors as the primary goal. An interesting future research project would be to compare the efficacy of rigid reservation-based systems versus flexible incentive-based systems for reducing the wait times of specific visitors and improving the overall satisfaction of their park experience.</p>
<p>Two major systemic issues that surfaced during our tests were screen legibility and battery life. The difficulty of reading the screen outdoors was noted by many of our participants. Fortunately, this is a problem that the display industry will solve for us within a few years: future mobile devices may utilize reflective displays (“e-paper”) that are more legible and use less power in bright sunlight. The other main power drains are geolocation and wireless communication (GPS and cellular telephony, respectively, in our tests). Absent an unanticipated major advance in power-storage technology, improvement in battery life will require new, lower-power versions of these two subsystems. One advantage that theme parks enjoy is the possibility of instrumenting the park environment in ways that allow for novel approaches to geolocation and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512475216">Vukadinovic and Mangold 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the tests, we were worried about our system being hacked or subverted by test participants, of participants feeling manipulated by our bonus regime, and by concerns over privacy. These issues did not materialize, but of course this does not mean that they will not be factors in future deployments of similar systems. And indeed expectations and behaviors with location-based incentives on mobile devices may well vary over time as these systems become more common in everyday life.</p>

<title>Mobile Computing Research and Tourism and Leisure</title>
<p>Mobile computing is creating a profound shift in the experience of tourism and leisure time. Smartphones are now owned by well over 50% of U.S. and U.K. adults younger than age 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512475216">Google 2012</xref>), with the average smartphone owner using applications on his or her device for 77 minutes per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475216">Flurry Analytics 2012</xref>). The geolocation and “push” capabilities of mobile devices, when coupled with their ubiquity and regular usage, create an immediacy and scale of response that is not possible with other incentive- or information-delivery mechanisms in a tourism setting, such as paper coupons, maps, or fixed-location message boards.</p>
<p>Future research is needed to understand the exact parameters of when mobile incentives can and cannot be used to solve crowding issues outside of theme parks. For instance, how generalizable are these findings to other locations such as shopping malls, casinos, pedestrian city centers, or perhaps even heavily trafficked cities? While significant current research streams are addressing the consumer behavior around mobile computing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512475216">Varnali and Toker 2010</xref>), few controlled experiments have addressed the potential for these systems to solve complex problems at scale. It could be that theme park visitors, in a highly insulated environment, are much more receptive to changing their plans based on incentives. However, one could imagine that in a competitive environment, such as a shopping mall, incentives might be more prized by consumers, since opportunity costs would be fewer.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that mobile experimental test-beds like ours can be used for a variety of other research activities: market research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512475216">Kawase, Yohei, and Yabe 2012</xref>), other forms of operations research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512475216">Rajaram and Ahmadi 2003</xref>), and the testing of new creative concepts such as augmented reality and crowd games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512475216">Montola, Stenros, and Waern 2009</xref>). Mobile computing has the capacity to have a profound effect on tourism and location-based entertainment, and we are only beginning to investigate the opportunities.</p>
