<p>Ordinary life is full of signs of remembrance, even if very often there is a loss of its historical quality. A young tourist passing by the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio in the center of Milan is wearing a second-hand blouse she bought at the “Mercatino Dei Navigli” the day before, and listening to Frank Sinatra on her mp3 player. Does she realize that the design of her blouse was inspired by the golden age of fashion, that Sinatra died in 1998, and the Basilica of “Sant’Ambrogio” was first built in the 4th century? Inside the communicative processes of human relationships with objects and places, the past acts both as a talkative and silent – yet expressive – image.</p>
<p>In the search to comprehend human nature, we dig into the past looking for clues to describe and interpret which way we behave the same and/or differently: the music we listen to, the way we dance, the clothes we wear, the places we go, the rituals we practice, and so on. When talking about identity, the past becomes a question we must return to, being tied to its ornaments in ways we cannot acknowledge completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X12456717">Lehmann, 2012</xref>). But how do we gain such comprehension of the past? The deconstruction of the past has the power to give sense to our actions in the present towards the future and that way, the temporal passing of signs seems to be the only way to be near to its infinite sets. Besides, the boundaries of our comprehension also belong to the way we approach to temporality, and the way we remember the past.</p>
<p>In the search to hold personal experience in its social, cultural and historical resonance, we move by the processes of <italic>schematization</italic> – simplification of human heterogeneity in its affective, mental, personal, and interpersonal manifestations, and <italic>pleromatization</italic> – the intention to heterogenize human experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354067X12456717">Valsiner, 2006</xref>). That way, by the use of semiotic mediators (e.g. linguistic or iconic symbols) we can bring the past into the present in order to comprehend a historical event, or to remember situations of our life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354067X12456717">Valsiner, 2006</xref>). But, which senses do we involve in the interpretation of the past? When approaching to any kind of symbols during the study of human phenomena (e.g. History or Psychology), we gather a mainly visual manifestation. For instance, even if linguistic symbols have an acoustic property (voice), scientific studies predominantly focus on interview transcriptions, pictures taken in the context, observations of any kind, written questionnaires, and so on. Visualist contemporary academics make “writing” and “reading” “texts” the legitimized way to understand culture and cultural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456717">Classen, 1997</xref>). That way, as Müller points out precisely:<disp-quote>
<p>… for the greatest part of the history of humanity we do have only a very restricted way to appropriate the past – our historical memory is full of images, but almost void of sounds. The inaudibility of the greatest part of history cannot be overcome, since the sounds of history have irrevocably died away. As historians we must apparently be content with the “sound of silence”. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller, 2012</xref>, p. 444)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this commentary, I seek to develop the “sound of silence” metaphor used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller (2012)</xref> in order to question the ways we approach to human phenomena and the necessity to involve both the expressive quality of senses and silence through pointing out the usefulness of poetic images for pleromatization and schematization dialectics.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1354067X12456717"><title>The voice of memories: From historical resonance to human experience</title>
<p>We can both wake up listening to the singing birds outside our window and an airplane passing by, which are different – yet not exclusive – sounds in the 21st century. But this fact was certainly impossible to occur before the first aircraft flight in 1903. Our experience of sounds changes through history, and the way we make sense of such experience is closely related to social and cultural instances. That way, “‘hearing’ shall rather be regarded as a social and cultural capacity that shapes men’s and women’s concepts of their world and influences their actions in given historical contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller, 2012</xref>, p. 446). Indeed, when a Colombian student living in Milan listens for first time in Italy to the sound of a helicopter, she instantly thinks about War, rather than wondering if Berlusconi is being transported. This is because she grew up in one of the Colombian states where the FARC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354067X12456717">1</xref></sup> has more strength, and each time she speaks with her parents by webcam and hears helicopters, she does not wonder if Juan Manuel Santos is traveling somewhere, because she assumes it is about a combat between the army and the guerilla in the towns near the city where her parents live.</p>
<p>In between the membranes of psychology and history, one could wonder how sounds from the context promote sense-making. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X12456717">Zittoun, Valsiner, Vedeler, Salgado, Gonçalves, &amp; Ferring (2012)</xref> recall to the metaphor of a melody when talking about human life course because human lives are full of melodies that develop diverse functions and have permanence through time. To return to the example of the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio, its structure has been very similar towards time, even if more than three reconstructions have been necessary. During the World War II, the cupola was destroyed, changing the acoustics of this Catholic temple; so how can we be sure that the acoustics is the same after the reconstruction? Furthermore, how did the experiences of catholic Milanese people coming back to the temple change in the early times after the war? Maybe chants and litanies did not have the same external resonance, but the inner experience of these voices gave a sense of protection and faith.</p>
<p>Sense-making from auditory experiences involves an <italic>affective resonance</italic> that permeates the self developing <italic>the voice of memories.</italic> For instance, as well as we can talk about voices from the environment, we can make reference to voices of the self as voices inside the society of mind, and thus we acknowledge the ever-dialogical nature of human kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X12456717">Hermans, 2001</xref>). Müller realizes that in the distant approach to sounds of history, historians must deal with the “sound of silence”. In the path back to the past, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller (2012)</xref> reiterates the importance of hearing to the history, an act that involves the paradox of reconstructing in the present something belongs to the past and that is silent. Here, silence means the absence of sound within the longing of remembrance. In a museum, for instance, the historical function of places changes (an antique palace/castle/house becoming a place for remembrance of persons, epochs and vanguards) where, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller (2012)</xref> points out, relics and other physical objects, such as texts, are the core tools in historical research.</p>
<p>However, in museums, a literal and metaphoric structure of silence is maintained too. When one goes to a museum, one feels that she/he is supposed to stay silent, and one finds silence in the past one cannot hold completely, and where reconstruction is an interpretation. And thus, how can we scholars interpret the social, historical, cultural, and phenomenological experience of silence? Silence and sound face the inclusive separation of an A-non-A dialectic relationship in the sense-making process where the silence emerges as a presence while also meaning the absence of something. Thus, either being positioned as an absence or a presence, the study of silence itself becomes a field for psychological comprehension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1354067X12456717"><title>Human experience of silence: The musical scores of the self</title>
<p>The affective resonance of experiences, auditory or not, is hard – sometimes impossible to put in words, which makes it a hypergeneralized semiotic field (for levels of affective regulation of experience see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X12456717">Branco &amp; Valsiner, 2010</xref>) and its comprehension challenge traditional approaches from scholars. In between the dance of silence and language, poetry makes it possible to evoke the vibration of experience, and it becomes a path for semiotic cultural psychology approach to affective regulation in sense-making and decision-making processes. As long as poetry is a field itself, the zone I begin to explore is the poetic philosophy of Octavio Paz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X12456717">Lehmann, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X12456717">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz (1994)</xref>, the human world is the world of sense and signification, an affirmation that entails any artistic or technical masterpiece in the universe of history because no material or signification transcends man; any masterpiece moves towards something – has intentionality, gaining a signification in a certain history. Furthermore, any artist, Paz says, is a poet, a creator of images.</p>
<p>Paz, a son of his time, gathers a wide comprehension of sight and audition in the universe of meanings. For instance, words of poems – yet being a simplifying experience, are the door to the plurality of significations, because they evoke the dynamic and necessary coexistence of contraries and their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1994</xref>). Written signs do not repose in a certain space, but are considered to be in a surface always in transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1967</xref>). Poetic images are real or unreal signs of imagination, the poem does not say what is (often untellable) but what could become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1994</xref>). Words of poems compose a verse, and a verse is rhythm: the musicality of sound and meaning revives, makes possible to come back to the real experience, in Husserl’s phenomenological terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if Paz states the crucial role of rhythm in poems, he predominantly makes reference to poetic images in terms of “vision” or “enlighten” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1994</xref>) which would be a schematization of affective experience. But poetic images are rather the pleromatization of affective resonance: an evocation of vibration, color, smell, taste, and texture of time passing in the universe of language, and transcending it. Our experience of plurality and ambiguity of the real is redeemed in the field of meanings, as ordinary perception, the poetic image reproduces the plurality of realty and gives it unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the same line of ideas, the unity of a poetic image beholds silence, precisely in between the dialectics of schematization and pleromatization of experience. Silence emerges in the process of what is said and what is not, but there is a difference in the intentionality of the emergence of silence, here being exemplified in three cases.</p>
<p>First, when one decides to say something instead of another thing. For instance, when someone finds the person she/he likes in the office, and instead of saying “I like you”, or “Shall we take a cup of coffee?”, they ask if they can borrow a piece of paper, or if they have seen the boss today. Second, by taking turns in a conversation – when the “platonic love” answers “no, I haven’t seen the boss today”, the first person hears the answer, even wondering what to ask next in order to keep the conversation going, or thinking how beautiful she/he looks today. The third is by staying silent, both because the social settings promote it, such as staying silent in museums, or because one seeks to experience silence as the nearest experience to contemplation and unity, such as practicing yoga.</p>
<p>Intentionality in the ambivalence of signs is dialectic. The poetic activity is born in the desperation of the powerlessness of the word, realizing the omnipotence of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1990</xref>). When seeking silence one seeks to find God, avoiding internal and external noise in order to listen to the “real” voice of things, in the sense of a mystic experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X12456717">Paz, 1990</xref>). Silence, in the field of senses, also holds the incapability of language to express the whole immersion of human experience.</p>

<p>Objects and landscapes of remembrance develop infinite qualities us humans gather by senses, even if us scholars are more used to abstract information from sight. The hearing act is a source of information, a tool of orientation, a way to gather experience, and a prime component of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller, 2012</xref>). The melodies of living are attempts to give account of the uniqueness of human trajectories in the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X12456717">Zittoun, et al., 2012</xref>) by identifying rhythms and tones of human experience both in a literal and metaphoric way. In the ambivalence of the sacred and the banality of the course of human life, sounds of narrations, objects, places, and animals are crucial components of rituals. Electronic music in malls and stores, mantras or Gregorian chants, water falling on a stone, the musicality of personal – yet social experience plays an important role in the act of remembering, but also on transcending the impending finitude.</p>
<p>Certainly, the path back the “sounds of history” proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X12456717">Müller (2012)</xref>, has also a social, cultural, and historical quality. The Enlightenment, which is in fact a visual metaphor, can be considered the epoch that “relegated hearing to an inferior cultural rung” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X12456717">Rosenfeld, 2011</xref>, p. 322). For Western culture, sight and hearing have been the predominant senses to construct knowledge, but from the 20th century, sight has become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X12456717">Classen, 1999</xref>). Although in other epochs, such as the non-literate world, oral–auditory tradition was crucial for metaphysical and mundane cultural transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X12456717">Rosenfeld, 2011</xref>). Still, cultural studies focusing on sound, even if necessary, can also limiting paradigm because our attempt as cultural scholars should be focused on the five senses, rather than just visual or auditory ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X12456717">Classen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As long as sounds change through history, the dynamicity of silence in ordinary – and extraordinary experiences is meant to become a field in human studies. The dialectics of presence–absence of signs goes beyond words. We cannot forget that resonance and vibration are corporal experiences, which are not just about hearing, but predominately about feeling and evoking aromas, images, rhythms, flavors, and textures of experience. When talking about the language of image in the infinite sets of poetry, words become schematized signs that evoke the plural quality of affective resonance. But, we, scholars, need to acknowledge that, as the Argentinean poet Alejandra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X12456717">Pizarnik (2007)</xref> says in the epigraph, when one returns back in the seek of the antique seeking, night closes itself as the water falling on a stone, as the air on a bird, as two loving corps. Yet, before – and hopefully after becoming scholars, we are humans, and experiencing the self is the very best way to legitimize “knowledge”. In the closing and opening doors of human comprehension, we need to go back to sensations and the metaphors to express such experiences in context in order to comprehend why we act in the way we do: dancing, writing, painting, cooking, following, and braking traditions; creating and becoming poets of our lives.</p>
