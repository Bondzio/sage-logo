In many countries, these senior leaders are judged on student outcomes as measured by public examination and test results. In England, and elsewhere, conformity with government policy is policed through a national inspection regime, which grades leadership as well as classroom practice. The consequences of an ‘unsatisfactory’ grade are profound and may lead to the school being labelled as ‘failing’, with the possibility of closure. In this climate, it is unsurprising that most leaders adhere closely to national prescriptions and work hard to enhance published learning outcomes. In England, this may lead to leaders being focused mainly on ‘borderline’ students, such as those on the C/D boundary in GCSE examinations. A related practice is ‘teaching to the test’, where learning is closely aligned to test outcomes, rather than wider knowledge and understanding. Where leaders operate in this way, they might be regarded as sacrificing their professionalism on the altar of accountability.</p><p>The first article, by Neil Cranston, examines this issue. He begins by arguing that ‘the constraints of accountability on school leaders need to be framed by a new liberating professionalism’, framed around notions of professional responsibility. He reinforces the accepted mantra that leadership is vital to school success and student learning and comments that the rhetoric of self-management has not led to school leaders driving educational priorities. He outlines four principles for school leadership and concludes that professionally responsible leaders need to understand their fundamental values, and position themselves as proactive leadership professionals, not reactive managers.</p><p>Leadership practice is inevitably influenced by principals’ socialisation experiences. This is the focus of the second article, by Ed Bengtson, Sally Zepede and Oksana Parylo. They examine organisational socialisation, linked to principal succession, in the state of Georgia in the USA. Drawing on 29 interviews with principals, superintendents and other central office leaders in four systems, the authors note that collective leadership training is common, what they describe as ‘serial socialisation’. They point to the importance of succession, and retention, of principals and conclude that socialisation ‘can no longer be left to chance’.</p><p>In the third article, Matti Kuittenen, Anu Puusa and Oksana Parylo examine the concept of organisational identity, linked to strategic change. Drawing on interviews with senior lecturers and managers at a Finnish university, they note similarities and differences in interpretations of identity. Notions were similar within groups but rather different between managers and lecturers. Managers were perceived to be future-oriented but lecturers claimed that this was at the expense of current activities. They also note the ‘fragmentation of identity’ because of separate sub-group cultures. They conclude by claiming that the concept of organisational identity has ‘considerable explanatory power’.</p><p>Marlene Morrison and Linet Arthur, in the next article, examine what they describe as the ‘clamour’ for inter-service collaboration in England. They claim that leadership theory has neglected the implications of integrated service provision. Drawing on literature from education, health, social care, and social work, they assess the validity of school-based theory and practice in the context of inter-agency work. They explore differences between apparently similar concepts, including partnership and collaboration, and conclude that researchers need to move beyond school-centric spaces that have dominated the educational leadership and management literature.</p><p>The fifth article, by Janet Goodall, examines the process of selecting new members for high performing school leadership teams in England. She identifies four factors which underpin this process in her nine case study schools. The most important factor was adherence to the ethos of the school and this usually led to an internal appointment because such adherence had been established in applicants’ previous work. This was more important than relevant qualifications and experience, as the schools preferred training to be undertaken as a team. As the title implies, ‘recruit for attitude’ trumps candidates’ pre-appointment skills.</p><p>In the sixth article, Chye Ong and Clive Dimmock discuss streaming in Singaporean secondary schools, and principals’ engagement with low ability students. They point to Singapore’s high standing in international comparisons of student achievement and note that almost all government secondary schools have three streams; express, academic, and technical. They interviewed principals of 10 such schools on two occasions. They conclude that principals have ‘selective engagement’ with the lower ability technical stream students, linked to their own individual values and dispositions.</p><p>The final article, by Dale Holt, examines the role of subject coordinators in Australian higher education. He argues that these leaders operate at the ‘coal face’ of higher education, with responsibility for subject components of courses or programmes. Drawing on 445 responses to an online survey of subject coordinators at four universities, he notes that they perceive themselves as leaders, and concludes that they play a significant role in shaping, developing and creating effective learning environments.</p></body></article>
