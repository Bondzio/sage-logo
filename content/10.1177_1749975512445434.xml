<abstract>
<p>The cosmopolitan has re-emerged as a popular figure within the social sciences, primarily as a means of addressing (the potential for) new forms of experience and sociability in an increasingly mobile and interconnected world. Investigations into practical or everyday cosmopolitanism have been useful in grounding some of the more theoretical of these debates but problems remain in terms of both defining and operationalizing the concept. The first section of the paper briefly addresses some key theoretical debates. In the second section, attention is focused on methodological issues, with regard to both data collection and interpretation. In particular, I suggest a move beyond labelling people and practices as cosmopolitan and, instead, emphasize the contradictory and rhetorical aspects of these engagements, drawing on empirical data. In this way, the temporal, conditional and often fragile aspects of such ‘cosmopolitan’ practices can be foregrounded.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the key challenges facing the social sciences at the current time is developing new theoretical frameworks for making sense of what has been labelled a ‘borderless world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512445434">Beck, 2006</xref>). The idea of the cosmopolitan has become the subject of renewed interest as attempts are made to understand (the significance of) processes of interaction and imagination that extend beyond local or national contexts.</p>
<p>The recent upsurge in writing about the subject belies a long-standing, though intermittent, interest dating back to the Stoics and, thereafter, most closely associated with the work of Immanuel Kant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512445434">Pollock et al., 2000</xref>: 585). Kant’s cosmopolitan philosophy outlined a range of normative principles based on the (presumed) values shared by ‘citizens of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1749975512445434">Vertovec and Cohen, 2002</xref>: 10). Some of these broader themes have also re-emerged in contemporary works as part of an ethical stance that has emphasized a common humanity over more parochial interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512445434">Nussbaum, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512445434">Appiah, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Increasingly, these ethical/philosophical debates, which are beyond the scope of this paper, have been supplanted by both macro-level theorizing, where a new era of cosmopolitan relations is advanced, and the analysis of a bewildering array of micro-processes that are used to evidence cosmopolitan forms of imagination, identification and so on. Both approaches have generated important insights but are undermined by weak theoretical foundations. In the first place, they build on rather abstract definitions, suggesting openness towards, awareness of and/or engagements with other people. These tend to provoke more questions (What is ‘openness’? Which ‘others’?) than answers. Although some have suggested that this lack of agreement over a broad definition is a positive thing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512445434">Pollock et al., 2000</xref>: 577), its utility as a category of analysis becomes significantly reduced. As Sinisa Malešević has observed in relation to the explosion of writing on identity, concepts lose their analytical edge if they are used to explain (almost) any and every social process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512445434">2006</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>Similarly, while attempts to trace the parameters of the concept through empirical studies are welcome, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating the meaning and commensurability of widely differing social practices. In other words, labelling those who take part in various activities – travelling overseas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512445434">Molz, 2006</xref>), selling trinkets to tourists at a holiday resort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512445434">Kothari, 2008</xref>), working alongside ‘foreign’ colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512445434">Kennedy, 2004</xref>), shopping for exotic foodstuffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512445434">Beck, 2002</xref>), showing appreciation for opposing football teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512445434">Giulianotti and Robertson, 2007</xref>), sex tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512445434">O’Connell-Davidson and Sanchez-Taylor, 1995</xref>) – under the banner term of ‘cosmopolitan’ does not tell us much about the significance of such processes for those involved or their relative importance in generating or sustaining a more open attitude towards others. The question of how we actually study cosmopolitanism has also been largely overlooked.</p>
<p>This paper is divided into three main parts. The first briefly assesses current approaches to theorizing cosmopolitanism. The second examines how the concept is being operationalized, acknowledging the dis/advantages of the various approaches. Finally, the issue of data analysis is addressed by emphasizing the dilemmatic aspects of people’s engagements with or reflections on other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">Billig et al., 1988</xref>). In this section, I draw on illustrative examples from my own research on social identities in England.</p>
<p>Paying closer to attention to these issues is important, for at least two reasons. First, it reminds us that any analyses of social practices (whether cosmopolitan or otherwise) must be grounded in the wider social circumstances (and constraints) in which they emerge, are studied and, sometimes, become embedded. Second, it allows us to more effectively assess the extent to which global mobility, in increasing interactions between disparate peoples, may be generating novel forms of sociability and community that are both <italic>meaningful</italic> and <italic>durable</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1749975512445434">
<title>Theorizing Cosmopolitanism</title>
<p>The growing popularity, and differing uses, of cosmopolitanism means that it is in danger of becoming ‘an abstracted discourse with no tangible meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1749975512445434">Harvey, 2000</xref>: 547). Its very elasticity may make it attractive as an explanatory device, but in order to assess its utility we need to try and make sense of what it is being used to explain.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prominent accounts of cosmopolitanism have been in the form of macro-sociological theories of social change and communal relations, which suggest that we are entering ‘a new era, the era of reflexive modernity, in which national borders and differences are dissolving and must be renegotiated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512445434">Beck, 2006</xref>: 2). On many levels this is an attractive thesis, as it draws in numerous high profile debates around, for example, economic liberalization, political integration, pandemics, media penetration, terrorism, tourism and travel.</p>
<p>Yet there is an inherent problem in operating through a dichotomy that contrasts ‘national modernity … [and] the second modernity where everyday life is banally cosmopolitan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512445434">Beck, 2006</xref>: 133). As Daniel Chernilo observes, ‘the nation-state has been historically opaque, sociologically uncertain and normatively ambivalent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512445434">2006</xref>: 15) so that those who posit a new era of global or cosmopolitan realities simply end up reifying the myth of a historically stable, coherent nation-state.</p>
<p>These ‘teleological vision[s] of social change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512445434">Savage and Burrows, 2007</xref>: 895), where a mythical past is mobilized in order to put forward the notion of a cosmopolitan present (and future), are even more surprising given their association with attempts to debunk what has been labelled as methodological nationalism. This is the idea that ‘nationally bounded societies are … the naturally given entities to study’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512445434">Wimmer and Glick-Schiller, 2002</xref>: 304). In many academic disciplines, the idea of a world of nations divided into ‘integrated societies has become so pervasive that many theorists don’t even see the need to make it explicit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512445434">Kymlicka, 2001</xref>: 221).</p>
<p>Such critiques are of fundamental importance in sensitizing us to the limitations of using taken-for-granted social categories as units of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512445434">Brubaker, 2002</xref>: 165). However, it is not clear what advantages there are in labelling such a perspective as ‘methodological cosmopolitanism’. As Daniel Chernilo asserts, the remedy for methodological nationalism cannot be methodological cosmopolitanism as the latter is itself based on the premise of ‘a methodologically nationalist conceptualisation of the nation-state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512445434">2006</xref>: 13). Instead, we need to move away from these ‘one-sided accounts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512445434">2006</xref>: 14) to think about the challenges associated with defining and studying cosmopolitanism. In the first case, cosmopolitanism is perhaps best characterized as a perspective on the world which, while drawing in broad notions of (global) sociability, involvement and responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512445434">Holton, 2009</xref>: 20–21), can only be effectively theorized in relation to the contexts in which it arises. In other words, it is a perspective that is <italic>periodically</italic> articulated, embodied and materialized, rather than being an inherent property of particular individuals, groups or situations.</p>
<p>This, in turn, means paying particular attention to the spatial, temporal and ethical aspects of these engagements. When and where do they occur and what are the circumstances that provide for or constrain such activities? Which ‘others’ do they involve? How do social actors make sense of and debate their own and others’ actions or attitudes? Can they be labelled as instrumental, designed to achieve certain objectives, or are they part of what individuals do, say and feel on a routine basis?</p>
<p>In the next section, I extend some of these arguments by looking at how cosmopolitanism has been operationalized, both in relation to the types of people, places and activities that have been studied and the research methods employed. In doing so, I am certainly not attempting to provide the definitive guide to studying the topic. Rather, it is my intention to try to generate a debate over these important methodological issues as a means of grounding this somewhat ‘abstract discourse’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1749975512445434">
<title>People and Places</title>
<p>In relation to the question of who we might study, there is a curious tension between the broader theoretical assertions concerning the changing status of the human condition, and empirical analyses, which have often focused on particular groups. In the recent past, cosmopolitanism was often seen to be the preserve of highly mobile and capital-rich elites, living within a privileged socio-cultural bubble of business centres, health clubs, international airports and so on. More recent studies have, however, challenged the notion that ‘cosmopolitanism is a conscious and voluntary choice … [largely associated with] elites’, as this tends to overlook the ‘<italic>unintended</italic> and <italic>lived</italic> cosmopolitanism[s … that emerge] … primarily [as] a function of coerced choices or a side-effect of unconscious decisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512445434">Beck, 2002</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>The emphasis on individual mobility has also been questioned, with studies focusing on the activities of those who engage with otherness (people, products, ideas) without moving themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512445434">Notar, 2008</xref>), or pointing to the crucial role of the media in increasing awareness of different cultures and social issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512445434">Ong, 2009</xref>). This dramatic expansion of the scope of enquiry has been necessary in sensitizing us to the varying forms of cosmopolitanism and correcting a Western-centric bias in many debates around the subject. At the same time, it has complicated the question of who to study and how to generate an effective sample for research purposes. Perhaps not surprisingly, there has been a variety of ways in which the problem has been tackled, although methodological issues are rarely addressed explicitly.</p>
<p>Some have continued to concentrate on groups or individuals that represent what we might label cosmopolitan exemplars. That is, members of more ‘elite’ groups that travel widely, engage with a variety of cultural groups and practices, work or live abroad or represent the vanguard of ‘global’ social, political or cultural movements. Recent work on United Nations’ employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512445434">Nowicka and Kaweh, 2009</xref>), skilled EU migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1749975512445434">Kennedy, 2004</xref>), Western backpackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512445434">Molz, 2006</xref>) and transnational activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512445434">Tarrow, 2005</xref>) is indicative.</p>
<p>An alternative perspective has emerged in the work of those who have focused on the other ends of the socio-economic spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1749975512445434">Pecoud, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512445434">Kothari, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512445434">Notar, 2008</xref>). In these studies, questions of power, agency and coercion have been foregrounded, reminding us again that an engagement with the ‘other’ may be neither chosen nor welcome, but what one does in order to survive.</p>
<p>The question of ‘who’ has also come to focus on particular ethnic or religious groups who are seen to be cosmopolitan in outlook or orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512445434">Falzon, 2009</xref>: 37). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1749975512445434">Werbner (1999)</xref> emphasizes the importance of religious and kinship ties in the creation of ‘working-class cosmopolitanisms’, while Falzon argues that ‘belonging to the Sindhi ethnic group constitutes a powerful and well-trodden trajectory into the … cosmopolitan way of engaging with the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512445434">2009</xref>: 39). The key issue here is exploring the idea that groups can be defined by both ethnicity and a willingness to engage with others, often through trading networks, whilst avoiding any form of reductionism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1749975512445434">
<title>What Is Missing?</title>
<p>Using select groups, as exemplars, representatives of new forms of (marginal) cosmopolitanism or ethnic/religious case studies, allows one to narrow the field of enquiry and dig down into the lives of particular, inter-connected individuals. Like most forms of thick description, these studies tell us a lot about the activities and attitudes of relatively few (often quite specialized) people, and the social places they inhabit or move through. The latter tend to vary quite dramatically in scale but often represent a familiar roll-call of border towns, global cities (with a particular emphasis on multi-cultural quarters and diasporic nodes), multi-national companies and educational establishments.</p>
<p>What is perhaps missing here is attention to what Zlatko Skrbis and his colleagues label ‘the sedentary underclasses and … sedentary glocals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512445434">Skrbis et al., 2004</xref>: 121). These are the vast numbers who remain relatively rooted but engage with the ‘other’ in more limited or restricted ways, primarily through consumption practices, media connectivity and, in some cases, travel. The very fact that such groups do not represent the vanguard of global change and often cannot or do not want to take advantage of the potentialities offered by technological or social transformations should not make them any less worthy of our investigations. Indeed, it is through examining their activities and attitudes that the more extravagant claims about cosmopolitanism can be evaluated. Shifting attention away from the most mobile groups also allows for a more effective assessment of the role of the media in generating knowledge, and, perhaps, a greater understanding, of different cultural forms, political interests and social inequalities.</p>
<p>The more limited purview provided by qualitative approaches has yet to be complemented by an equivalent range of quantitative studies looking to research cosmopolitanism among larger populations. Indeed, the question of how we might generate a manageable and representative sampling strategy for this purpose warrants further attention. Those employing quantitative techniques have often relied on existing data sets, related to specific national populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512445434">Mau et al., 2007</xref>) or the European Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512445434">Pilcher, 2008</xref>). Another way of tackling the issue has been to focus on a particular area, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512445434">Savage et al.’s (2005)</xref> mixed-methods study of different constituencies in greater Manchester, England. The next step may be to combine such data from different parts of the globe to offer comparative analyses of urban or regional populations.</p>
<p>Moving away from the type of people we choose to research, a further significant issue concerns the fact that many studies seem to suggest (however unintentionally) that, once identified, cosmopolitans remain cosmopolitan in perpetuity. As a result, there is a real need to introduce a temporal dimension into our analyses. That is, to ask at which moment(s) do people exhibit a more open attitude towards others and/or participate in activities that involve different cultural groups or forms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1749975512445434">
<title>When (and How) to Be Cosmopolitan</title>
<p>As I have already suggested, the list of activities identified as ‘cosmopolitan’ in the literature continues to grow apace. There is no space to address the value of each here. Instead, I want to argue that addressing the key question of <italic>when</italic> is crucial in generating a more grounded and nuanced account of cosmopolitanism in practice. Furthermore, it demands acknowledging three crucial points.</p>
<p>First, that people move between more (or less) cosmopolitan attitudes and perspectives, so that showing solidarity with an individual or group at one moment does not preclude the utilization of cultural stereotypes or support for exclusionary practices at another. Therefore, we should examine how different practices and articulations work in relation to each other and in conjunction with particular identity formations. In the words of Becky Erikson, ‘instead of ignoring or trying to get rid of inconsistency in the [presentation of] self, we need to study it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512445434">1995</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>Second, a focus on the relative significance of different identity formations means acknowledging that some will be more important than others. As Craig Calhoun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1749975512445434">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512445434">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512445434">2007</xref>) has consistently argued, cosmopolitan theories not only tend to posit a <italic>new</italic> era of multiple allegiances, but also fail to account for the significance of established forms of solidarity. Rather than dismissing more local allegiances as regressive or primitive, Calhoun encourages us to understand why they continue to matter. The point he makes is that some forms are more meaningful because they have become grounded in people’s everyday lives, ‘offer[ing] individuals a sense of location and context vital to a strong sense of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512445434">2003</xref>: 30). In attending to this viewpoint, we are better able to conceptualize the different commitments that people have to particular identity formations and why some may come to trump others, particularly during more unsettled or crisis periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512445434">Skey, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, it should be acknowledged that cosmopolitanism, as a way of being and becoming, is not only developed and expressed in particular contexts but is also designed ‘to suit particular purposes’ and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512445434">Ong, 2009</xref>: 454). For instance, recent studies have emphasized the pragmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512445434">Weenink, 2008</xref>), instrumental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512445434">Giulianotti and Robertson, 2007</xref>) and strategic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1749975512445434">Kothari, 2008</xref>) aspects of these engagements</p>
<p>In this respect, a typology or typologies would allow us to more effectively assess their relative meaning and significance. Let me put forward a number of possibilities. The first involves a simple distinction between cultural, political and ethical forms of cosmopolitanism. It is important to note that these categories are not always mutually exclusive, but such classifications may go some way to assessing the commensurability of, and commitments to, different ‘cosmopolitan’ practices. For instance, we need to be able to distinguish between, say, the act of buying a ‘foreign’ indigenous group’s music CD or art, sending money to NGOs that support that group’s work and taking part in active demonstrations (physical or virtual) designed to advance the group’s social or political rights. While of all these practices might be labelled cosmopolitan using many current definitions, there are obviously major differences between them, in terms of the motivations of and consequences for those involved.</p>
<p>Leading on from this, I want to suggest a decoupling of the normative/practical dimensions of cosmopolitanism. This would mean focusing on more progressive and regressive forms, ranged along a broad continuum. At one end, we find the ideal type, involving a concern for human rights, cultural sensitivity and an ability to acknowledge (if not advance) multiple viewpoints. Moving away from this point, we might find more or less calculated acts or expressions of self-promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512445434">Ong, 2009</xref>: 456; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1749975512445434">Pitcher, 2009</xref>: 171–3) and an awareness of the other that generates neither compassion nor understanding but rather disdain or disinterest.</p>
<p>At the other end of this continuum can be found the crudest forms of exploitation that are often linked to rising global inequalities. To take an extreme example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512445434">O’Connell-Davidson and Sanchez-Taylor (1995)</xref> have studied sex tourists in the Dominican Republic who proclaim a desire to ‘immerse’ themselves in the local culture and understand other ‘ways of life’. In these instances, the normative idea(l) of the cosmopolitan is used (alongside racist stereotyping) as a self-serving mechanism to justify the abuse of marginal ‘others’. Yet as analysts we need a language that is able to first distinguish and then critique these sorts of encounters with ‘difference’ by emphasizing both questions of power and inequality and the rhetorical strategies that are designed to mask them.</p>
<p>The third typology draws on Berger and Luckmann’s distinction between theoretical and common-sense forms of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512445434">1991</xref>: 27) and is included as a possible means of distinguishing between active and banal forms of cosmopolitanism. This can be used to identify those moments or periods <italic>when</italic> different cultural forms become routinely incorporated into everyday life or attending to the needs and perspectives of different groups becomes habitual, rather than a conscious effort or a (perceived) burden that causes resignation or resentment.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the links between different forms of openness and varying access to social, cultural, economic and political resources is not meant to denigrate such practices as inconsequential or to deny the potential for longer-term trends towards ‘thicker’ forms over time. Rather, it is designed to better understand how we label and then interpret these disparate processes. This, in turn, can be used to more critically reflect on how cosmopolitanism is studied and evaluated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1749975512445434">
<title>Researching Cosmopolitanism</title>
<p>It should be noted at this juncture that many of the issues I will be discussing are not limited to studies of cosmopolitanism. Indeed, students of nationalism and ethnicity are involved in similar debates as part of what might be labelled as a more agent / practice-orientated approach to processes of identification and the wider social structures that both inform and constrain them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512445434">Brubaker et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet researching cosmopolitanism brings its own distinct challenges, as the discussion around how to define an effective population and sample have demonstrated. I first want to address the use of survey data as it offers a useful starting point for thinking about some of these broader issues. As we have seen, those studying cosmopolitanism have generally used data from existing surveys to evaluate responses to questions about mobility, cultural tastes, identity and values. Such analyses seem to be particularly effective in outlining some of the key attributes of those who present (at least when questioned) a more cosmopolitan outlook.</p>
<p>The key problem with surveys is a reliance on pre-determined categories, which means they do not permit a sustained analysis of attitudes and/or processes of categorization in relation to different topics or across contexts. This is particularly true for those surveys, designed for census purposes, which are commonly used for secondary analyses. The other major weakness of surveys is that they can only be used to assess what people say in principle and, as a result, are less effective in investigating ‘the variable meaningfulness and salience of different identity categories in people’s lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512445434">Brubaker et al., 2006</xref>: 168).</p>
<p>There is, of course, some scope for building surveys that are able to explore, with more rigour, the reporting of cosmopolitan practices and attitudes among more representative samples of a population. However, it is my contention that the rather static snapshot provided by most existing survey data must be complemented by studies of both what it is people do in their everyday lives (not only what they report they do) and a more in-depth understanding of what this means to them, articulated in their own words.</p>
<p>Given this call, we should not underestimate the promise of ethnography in offering powerful insights into how particular individuals engage with different groups and make sense of their social relations across contexts. For instance, Gerd Baumann’s study of a multi-ethnic suburb of West London examined the ways in which people exhibited a ‘dual discursive competence’ when discussing culture and identity ‘depending upon their judgements of context and purpose’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512445434">1996</xref>: 189). The first reified culture in relation to a particular bounded community, while the second offered a more open and fluid understanding of self and other. Similarly, Les <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512445434">Back’s (1996)</xref> exploration of everyday discourses of race and identity in South-East London demonstrated how young people in the area moved between racist and more inclusive ‘community’ discourses in relation to changing social opportunities and pressures.</p>
<p>However, alongside the cost, time and emotional commitments of undertaking such in-depth research, is the aforementioned problem of balancing the richness of the data with its general applicability. Yet, even the most sophisticated (not to mention, well-funded) multi-sited ethnography cannot be the only answer. The point is that while ethnography allows the researcher to examine responses and attitudes across contexts as a result of a sustained engagement with particular groups, those relying on other methods may be required to generate those contexts themselves.</p>
</sec>

<title>Exploring the Contexts of Cosmopolitan Openness</title>
<p>Experimental studies do this rather well and different exercises and prompts have been used to tease out the ways in which individuals shift between more open and closed perspectives by drawing subtle, often implicit, distinctions between (national/ethnic) in and out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512445434">Devos and Banaji, 2005</xref>). Other researchers have used similar techniques to investigate the significance of group entitativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1749975512445434">Sacchi et al., 2008</xref>) and group symbols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512445434">Butz, 2009</xref>) by analysing their subjects’ responses to changing scenarios involving a range of social actors. To my knowledge, such an approach has not been employed in a specific study of cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p>Likewise, semi-structured interviews and workshops provide an excellent opportunity for examining how research subjects draw on shared understandings as well as negotiate both their own and others’ use of competing discursive frameworks. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1749975512445434">Skrbis and Woodward (2007)</xref> asked interviewees to discuss a range of topics ranging from personal mobility and patterns of consumption to attitudes towards environmental issues. As a result, they were able to demonstrate how cosmopolitan experiences and dispositions (often represented by travel and other economic activities) were often undermined by ‘deeply structured feelings and allegiances regarding self and others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1749975512445434">2007</xref>: 744).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512445434">Kyriakidou (2008)</xref> used photographs of a series of humanitarian disasters (Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, Kashmiri earthquake) to explore the ways in which her Greek research subjects responded to the suffering of distant others. She was thus able to pinpoint in more detail the limits of her subjects’ ‘cosmopolitan’ memories and openness. These kinds of analyses can also be extended to the virtual sphere, where blogs, chat-rooms and message-boards provide an accessible source of longitudinal data, which can be used to pinpoint changing attitudes over time. Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512445434">Millward’s (2007)</xref> study of football chat-rooms is a good example of this. He examined fans’ attitudes towards overseas players, which noticeably shifted in relation to the changing fortunes of their teams, again evidencing a limited, situated and instrumental form of openness towards others.</p>
<p>Finally, there is enormous scope for investigating the degree to which different cultural products and political processes are orientated towards more cosmopolitan, rather than national or ethnic, sensibilities. In the cultural sphere, this might apply to the global production of a range of symbolic forms and artefacts (film, documentary, art, music, fashion, food and drink) and the marketing strategies that accompany them. Likewise, we need to know more about how (and why) such goods and services are consumed. Only by investigating underlying motivations, and the ways in which different products are disseminated, utilized and evaluated, can we assess the claims of those who posit a link between omnivorous cultural tastes and a more cosmopolitan disposition (see, for a critical analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512445434">Calhoun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512445434">Skrbis et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the political arena, attention could be focused on the institutionalization of cosmopolitan values through the study of, for example, legal frameworks that focus on human rights, models of economic co-operation between sub/supra-state actors and political movements that seek to move beyond the nation-state. What needs to be stressed in both these instances is that we examine the production and reception of these products and texts not as isolated units that either confirm or refute cosmopolitanism but as part of a <italic>process</italic> that is grounded, contested and linked to the activities of particular social actors.</p>
<p>Having briefly examined a possible approach to data collection, using a selection of illustrative studies, I would now like to shift focus and extend some of these arguments to the realm of data analysis. In this case, it will be suggested that those who study cosmopolitanism in practice are faced with another interesting challenge when looking to interpret their data. Put simply, there is a wealth of research that suggests there is a powerful social incentive for research subjects to adopt a more reasonable and open attitude towards other people, in order to avoid the stigma of prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">Billig et al., 1988</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>Evidence for this is not hard to find. Increasingly, surveys dealing with identity and belonging ask respondents to put forward their own and ‘most peoples’ views. This is because individuals generally present themselves ‘as more open or tolerant than most people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1749975512445434">McCrone and Bechhofer, 2008</xref>: 1253). Similarly, experimental studies have noted ‘a tension … between abstract ideals and concrete reality’ in studies of in-group belonging. Research subjects privilege ideas around equality when asked explicitly but tend to classify different groups in hierarchies of belonging when undertaking practical tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512445434">Devos and Banaji, 2005</xref>: 448). As a result, analysts need to be attuned to the possible discrepancies between ‘how people respond in principle’ and how they react to certain topical issues or ‘actually behave in real life situations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1749975512445434">McCrone and Bechhofer, 2008</xref>: 1253).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512445434">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>I want to explore this idea in more detail by, first, presenting some findings from an influential study of ‘ordinary cosmopolitanisms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">Lamont and Aksartova, 2002</xref>). Then, drawing on Michael Billig and his colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>) writing on ‘ideological dilemmas’, it will be argued that a more critical reading of these forms of ‘openness’ might be offered if we pay more attention to their rhetorical or contradictory aspects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1749975512445434">
<title>Building Bridges between ‘Us’ and ‘Them’</title>
<p>Lamont and Aksartova’s study is based on the results of a series of interviews with college-educated white and black workers in the United States and white and North African workers in France. Interviewees were asked to talk about ‘the types of people they feel superior and inferior to, and the types of people they describe as “their sort of folks”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">2002</xref>: 3). One of the most important features of the work is in the identification of the ‘types of evidence used by the … groups under consideration to show that we are the same’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">2002</xref>: 3). For instance, the following statements are indicative of the fairly narrow range of arguments made by white interviewees who generally emphasized the importance of judging individuals, not the social groups they represent.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>People are people. … There’s good whites, there’s bad whites.</p>
<p>There are blacks and there are niggers. There are whites and there is white trash. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">2002</xref>: 4–5)</p>
<p>… they are people who work and who are serious. These are people that I like and have respect for … and for me, whether they are black or yellow or red, it is the same thing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">2002</xref>: 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lamont and Aksartova suggest that these types of statements express the ‘universality of human nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512445434">2002</xref>: 6)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512445434">2</xref></sup>.Yet, as Wetherell and Potter argue, a focus on the individual as the source of either tolerance or prejudice must be seen as a particular rhetorical strategy which puts forward the idea that ‘racial harmony comes from the considerate and unbiased treatment of all fellow human beings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1749975512445434">1992</xref>: 209).</p>
<p>Not only does this vision of tolerance presume a society of equals, it also underplays structural considerations and, as a result, focuses attention on ‘changing people’s attitudes rather than modes of social organisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1749975512445434">1992</xref>: 210). Therefore, while these types of statements indicate an adherence to processes of bridge building at the explicit level, they might also be viewed as a particular strategy of members of a dominant group, positioning themselves against possible accusations of prejudice or ‘conferring upon themselves a degree of moral probity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1749975512445434">Pitcher, 2009</xref>: 173).</p>
<p>This is not to argue that such expressions are deliberate obfuscations or the work of avowed racists posing as liberals. It simply suggests that apparently clear-cut statements need to be carefully scrutinized in terms of ‘the[ir] contrary or dilemmatic aspects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">Billig et al., 1988</xref>: 20). Furthermore, these deeper or implicit counter-themes can only be understood in relation to the context in which they are uttered – in this case, the peculiar dynamics of a relatively formal interview setting. In the following sections, the concept of ideological dilemmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">Billig et al., 1988</xref>) will be introduced as a means of providing a critical edge into the analysis of this type of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1749975512445434">
<title>Dilemmatic Thinking</title>
<p>In their study of ideological dilemmas, Michael Billig and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>) draw attention to the contradictions that people must deal with as they puzzle over and argue about their lives. This ‘stress upon argumentation and the dilemmatic aspects of common sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>: 19) rejects the idea that individuals strive for consistency in their thoughts and, instead, focuses attention on the ways in which people attempt to manage (potential) counter-arguments and, in the process, present their own views as rational and disinterested. The authors suggest that by focusing on both the explicit and implicit aspects of argumentation it may be possible to examine how ‘contrary themes of social knowledge are revealed in everyday discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Of particular relevance here, is the suggestion that ideas about prejudice and tolerance are drawn together in a dialectical relationship, with the latter underpinned by long-standing Enlightenment ideals concerning rationality, objectivity and equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>: 100–6). In modern liberal democracies such as Britain and the US, dilemmas concerning prejudice and tolerance are often discussed in relation to race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Moreover, in these places post-Enlightenment values of fraternity and equality still operate as a normative ‘trump card’, meaning that more parochial views must be carefully formulated and justified as reasonable. As Billig et al. contend, ‘an ambivalence is to be expected between the universalism of Enlightenment themes and the particularism of [parochial] ones, with the latter needing to avoid the taint of “prejudice” as defined by the former’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">1988</xref>: 105). It is with reference to this argument that the idea of impression management becomes particularly salient and can be used to guide, or, at least, to inform, our analyses of ‘everyday talk’ about other people.</p>
<p>Returning to the earlier statement by whites concerning the need to treat individuals equally, it may be possible to offer a more critical reading if closer attention is paid to the ways in which such formulations are employed, consistently or otherwise, in relation to different topics and/or ‘others’. That is, to use an earlier analogy, to observe when bridges are both built and dismantled, in relation to whom and at which moments. This again points to the importance of introducing a notion of conditionality when discussing processes of identification, whether in relation to more cosmopolitan perspectives or, indeed, those that continue to articulate symbolic boundaries between ‘them’ and ‘us’.</p>
<p>In the next section, I outline how this perspective might be employed by examining an <italic>illustrative</italic> example from a group interview carried out as part of a research project investigating the articulation of social identities among people living in England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512445434">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Analysis: Dealing with Dilemmas</title>
<p>The extracts I want to examine come from a group that consisted of two, middle-class, married couples aged between 40 and 50.The first extract involves an exchange between Lesley, her husband Geoff and their friend Alison, which points to the dilemmatic nature of everyday conversations.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Geoff:</speaker>
<p>But … what I’m saying is, if you had ten people in the same room and five of them were American and five of them were British, then the Americans may go one way and the British go the other, that’s where it’s quite interesting …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lesley:</speaker>
<p>But one’s not any better than the other is it, so, why would, why would … um … your … where you come from makes no difference.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Geoff:</speaker>
<p>(Laughs) Where you come from makes no difference but it does help you …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Alison:</speaker>
<p>… influence …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Geoff:</speaker>
<p>… understand why you’re here and why you do what you do, does it not? We’re getting very ethereal, oh dear … we’ve changed the, we’ve changed the direction of the conversation.</p>
</speech>
<p>Here people are drawing on competing discourses in order to account for individual motivations and actions. Geoff argues that national traits are important because they can help one understand why people behave as they do, while Lesley draws on a more cosmopolitan discourse, which emphasizes commonalities over difference. By drawing on the ‘traditions of universalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512445434">Billig et al., 1988</xref>: 36), Lesley is able to portray herself as disinterested and largely removed from more narrow forms of parochialism. As his wife has adopted the more ‘enlightened’ perspective, Geoff responds by attempting to manage his own arguments as a means of inoculating himself against any potential accusations of prejudice.</p>
<p>First, he suggests that national differences may be ‘quite interesting’ before (laughingly) agreeing with his wife by repeating her statement. He then posits a question as a means of seeking agreement for his own position and finally defuses the situation by claiming that they have moved away from a rational discussion by ‘getting very ethereal’. As a result, what we see is the ‘general concern to avoid the imputation of a stake – that is, of a potentially prejudicial interested perspective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512445434">Condor, 2000</xref>: 187).</p>
<p>Lesley’s adoption of a cosmopolitan framework <italic>at this moment</italic> is interesting in and of itself but also because, in presenting herself as above any narrow-minded beliefs, she forces those she is interacting with to carefully formulate their own claims. However, as the next section demonstrates, individuals are more than able to shift between discourses, and this may involve them adopting contradictory positions as they struggle to make sense of particular issues.</p>
<sec id="section11-1749975512445434">
<title>‘We never liked the French, did we?’</title>
<p>It is worth contrasting Lesley’s position in the above exchange with the one she adopts in the following extract, which is uttered in the context of a wider debate about Europe:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Lesley:</speaker>
<p>I think it goes back to the, sort of … of like attracting like doesn’t it? There’s more, there’s more in common with America. I mean, we never liked the French did we?</p>
<p>(<italic>general laughter</italic>)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>Well, some people do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lesley:</speaker>
<p>Well (<italic>unclear</italic>) I do like them, I do like the French but I think they’re jolly odd. Y’know, when you, when you consider how, I mean, they’re on the doorstep but really, y’know, very little in common considering, y’know, America is what, five hours away, y’know, you can go to America and, y’know, sort of, y’know, absorb all, y’know, their lifestyle no problem. But you go to France and it’s a different world altogether.</p>
</speech>
<p>This extract shows the same individual drawing on a national discourse, utilizing a number of micro-linguistic features, such as deixis and metonymy, that transform nations into concrete, unified entities, articulated in terms of traits (‘they’re jolly odd’) and practices (‘their lifestyle’). Furthermore, what Lesley is trying to make sense of here is the (perceived) contrast between the physical distance and the ‘cultural’ distance that separates Britain from the US and France, respectively. Drawing on a national framework enables her to resolve this particular conundrum, in the process employing a whole raft of realist language that constructs powerful symbolic boundaries between national in and out-groups.</p>
<p>The extent to which Lesley struggles to articulate her position, evidenced by the number of false starts and hesitations, is also of interest. This type of repair work, no doubt in response to John’s comment and the general laughter, is again aimed at deflecting any possible accusations of prejudice, thereby tempering the effect of her initial comment about ‘the French’.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the first extract indicates that individuals are able (and willing) to draw on a cosmopolitan discourse as part of their everyday lives, we need to go beyond simply noting this. There should be a greater focus on context and the rhetorical strategies that people adopt as they engage in social interactions. In the first case, the more ‘enlightened perspective’ that Lesley adopts is not only socially desirable but also does not cost anything in terms of managing her stake. When she is dealing with an issue that matters to her own sense of self, her category group’s relations with different ‘others’, it is an embedded and accessible national framework that is used to comprehend and evaluate others.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The cosmopolitan has become the subject of renewed scholarly interest as attempts are made to assess (the potential for) new forms of experience and sociability that move beyond local or national contexts. Much of this work has been provocative and highly influential, encouraging us to re-think how we deploy a range of familiar sociological concepts, including society, community, citizenship and culture. However, the concept is currently being made to do so much analytical work that it is sometimes hard to assess its utility. It is also undermined by rather shaky theoretical foundations. For instance, the argument that we are now entering a new era of cosmopolitan relations trades in sweeping generalizations that ignore the complexity of the historical record and underplay the ongoing importance of existing solidarities, whether national, ethnic, religious etc.</p>
<p>In the main part of this paper, I have followed those who advance a more actor or practice-based approach, but have tried to open up a number of important (and somewhat overlooked) debates around how cosmopolitanism is defined and operationalized. In the first place, it has been argued that there is a need to unpack the commonplace definitions of cosmopolitanism, which trade in rather abstract notions of openness, awareness and cultural engagement. Instead, more specific attention needs to be paid to the following: identifying who exactly these engagements involve and exclude (and the type of resources and constraints that they operate with and/or under), where they emerge, what form they take, and how they are understood and articulated by both participants and observers. In the latter case, it has been argued that a framework is required for assessing the commensurability and consequences of these engagements, given that the number of practices labelled as cosmopolitan take in everything from buying a ‘foreign’ meal to supporting political demonstrations where participants may risk injury or even death. I have also drawn a distinction between instrumental/normative and reflexive/banal forms of cosmopolitanism. This might seem rather obvious, but talking about cosmopolitan Europe is not the same thing as talking about cosmopolitanism in the context of a debate over what it means to be an American. They involve different processes of imagination and identification, are shaped by particular historical and social trajectories and build bridges with (<italic>and exclude</italic>) notable ‘others’. Therefore, a research strategy is required that is able to account for and explore the different (and often contradictory) subject positions that people articulate, take up and are assigned. Similarly, in terms of data analysis, it has been argued that because research subjects often look to manage their (self) presentation, it may be necessary to focus on the dilemmatic aspects of their explanations for what they do and believe. Adopting a language of paradox, ambivalence and tentativeness can again be used to more effectively highlight and theorize those moments or periods when (potentially meaningful) social differences are rejected or ignored as individuals negotiate the complexities of their everyday lives.</p>
