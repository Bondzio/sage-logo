<abstract>
<p>With an ever-expanding stream of solid waste, and limited possibilities for disposal, communities increasingly have to make difficult decisions about where to store these by-products of daily living. The authors use survey data from seven counties in Florida that have recently dealt with solid waste location decisions to assess the extent to which citizen attitudes reflect a NIMBY perspective to these facilities. Contrary to what the NIMBY phenomena predicts, respondents who lived closer to existing or proposed facilities were not more likely to perceive them as dangerous as those living further away. In addition, the respondents were able to list problems and benefits to support their perceptions of danger posed by these facilities. These findings suggest that citizens do not always respond to environmental risks by gut reaction or without information as is sometimes suggested in the NIMBY literature.</p>

<p>In general, NIMBY (short for not-in-my-backyard) refers to the paradox that occurs when citizens call for more public facilities, but then fail to support the construction of such facilities when they are located near their home. NIMBY and its variants seem to be everywhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013916511435354">1</xref></sup> The NIMBY phenomena has been noted in locating nuclear waste facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511435354">Easterling &amp; Kunreuther, 1995</xref>), prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916511435354">Martin &amp; Myers, 2005</xref>), and a number of other public facilities such as low-income housing and drug treatment facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511435354">Pendall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511435354">Piat, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916511435354">Takahashi &amp; Dear, 1997</xref>). There are a variety of reasons why individuals oppose the location of public facilities in their communities, including health concerns, decline in property values, and decline in quality of life due to traffic, noise, and other site-imposed externalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511435354">Schively, 2007</xref>). Although the acronym “NIMBY” generally portrays citizens in a negative light as narrowly self-interested or as an annoyance to public decision makers, there are also positive constructs of NIMBYists as embracing the ideals of democratic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511435354">McAvoy, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Solid waste disposal may not sound like an electrifying subject, but it has generated a lot of citizen attention, concern, and activism in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511435354">Jarrett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511435354">Luton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916511435354">York, 2008</xref>). With an ever-expanding stream of solid waste, and limited possibilities for disposal, communities increasingly have to make difficult decisions about where to store these by-products of daily living. It seems that whenever a community reaches the point where a new solid waste facility is required, it usually erupts in tension between residents, local government, and the private sector. Previous studies have found that siting issues have been steeped in a milieu of distrust for local government decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511435354">Elliott &amp; McClure, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511435354">Hamer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511435354">Kasperson, Golding, &amp; Tuler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511435354">Luton, 1996</xref>). Previous studies have also suggested that citizens are very concerned about the pollution of the land, air, and water. Thus, although solid waste facilities (referred to as landfills throughout the remainder of the article) may not be first on the minds of citizens, solid waste disposal issues are certainly related to pollution of land, air, and water.</p>
<p>Much of the literature on community waste facilities focuses on toxic and/or hazardous waste facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511435354">Inhaber, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511435354">McAvoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511435354">Rabe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916511435354">Saha &amp; Mohai, 2005</xref>). Due to the often-perceived dread risk affiliated with these types of facilities, much of this research has focused on the NIMBY problems associated with citing a hazardous waste facility. Because every community must deal with the issue of solid waste and its disposal, it is important to understand the nature of public opinion with respect to landfills. In Florida, where the empirical portion of this research was conducted, rapidly expanding populations and a sensitive water table have contributed to a mounting solid waste problem. As such, there has been a growing need for new landfills at the same time that opening new landfills has encountered some of the same problems as opening a hazardous waste facility.</p>
<p>In this study, we survey citizens across seven Florida counties that are facing or have faced their own solid waste siting issues. To assess the extent to which these residents can be characterized as NIMBYists, we asked them about their interest in the environment, their levels of trust in government, how close they lived to landfill facilities, the types of problems and benefits they believed were affiliated with landfills, and their perceptions of risks posed by these sites.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013916511435354">
<title>Explaining Perceptions of Danger From Landfills</title>
<p>The general literature on problems of locating solid and hazardous waste facilities provides evidence that perceived risks and benefits and legitimacy of and trust in the political bodies, agencies, and industries involved in the location and operation of the facility are crucial factors in the formation of public opinion about these facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511435354">Boholm &amp; Lofstedt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511435354">Flynn, Burns, Mertz, &amp; Slovic, 1992</xref>). Many studies of controversial locational decisions portray citizens as irrational, selfish, and/or lacking knowledge about the issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511435354">Frey, Oberholzer-Gee, &amp; Eichenberger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511435354">Hunter &amp; Leyden, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511435354">Kraft &amp; Clary, 1991</xref>). In fact, constructs such as NOPE (not on this planet ever) or NIABY (not in anyone’s backyard) suggest that citizens’ attitudes are not based on careful reflection but gut reaction. However, other research suggests that while citizens may not have a grasp of technically complex scientific knowledge, they do have normative knowledge that should be factored into locational decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511435354">McAvoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511435354">Rabe, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the environmental risk assessment process, it is unlikely that many individuals (or even scientists themselves) will be fully aware of all of the components of assessing the risk of a particular environmental policy, condition, or facility. As a result, there is inherently a component of trust involved in developing environmental facilities. Individuals who may potentially be affected by environmental risks will (more or less) have to rely on the information and recommendations provided by governmental and nongovernmental experts. If the public does not trust these experts, they may be more likely to be concerned about environmental quality. Public beliefs about environmental quality are important because they will ultimately affect the extent to which the public will take action to support public policies designed to improve the quality of the environment.</p>
<p>A consistent theme that resonates throughout the discussion of environmental risk assessment is complexity. Any assessment of risk must address extremely complex issues that relate to the examination of the causes of environmental problems and the techniques or approaches that could effectively mitigate these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511435354">Gillroy &amp; Shapiro, 1986</xref>). Contemporary approaches to risk assessment emphasize the importance of assessing not only the formal scientific risks of a facility-siting issue but also the socially perceived risks of those likely to be affected by a facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511435354">Kasperson et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Risk analysis uses a range of principles to evaluate the types of risks associated with different environmental hazards such as ecological risk and human health risk. The principles that are emphasized in any particular risk analysis depend on the type of risk at issue. Environmental risk includes the relationship between a hazard source, exposure pathways, exposed populations or environments, and the health or environmental consequences of that exposure. In this analysis, we consider individual’s assessment of personal health risk associated with landfills. Thus, we ask our respondents to assess the dangers landfills pose to their household.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013916511435354">2</xref></sup> We decided to use the term “danger” (instead of risk) in our question because previous research indicates that individuals have difficulty making probabilistic risk assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511435354">Kahneman, Slovic, &amp; Tversky, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511435354">Krimsky &amp; Golding, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916511435354">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors That Influence the Perception of Danger</title>
<sec id="section3-0013916511435354">
<title>NIMBY</title>
<p>The literature on environmental attitudes suggests that NIMBY-type attitudes are pervasive when deciding where to locate public facilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511435354">Kraft and Cleary (1991)</xref> attribute the increase in the NIMBY phenomenon to the emergence of a broader environmental ethic, its exceptional fear of dread and unknown risks, increased availability of public information, and a decline of confidence in the ability of government and industry to make informed, prudent, and equitable decisions about risky technologies.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511435354">Kraft and Cleary (1991)</xref>, NIMBY refers to “intense, sometimes emotional, and often adamant local opposition to location proposals that residents believe will result in adverse impacts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511435354">Kraft &amp; Cleary 1991</xref>, p. 300). This definition implies that the NIMBY phenomenon is related to proximity to the site. If researchers’ perceptions of the NIMBY phenomenon are correct, then we should expect that people living closer to landfills should feel more negatively about landfills.</p>
<p>To assess the extent to which negative beliefs about landfills are related to one’s personal situation, we develop a subjective measure of how close a citizen lives to an existing or proposed facility and whether this affects their beliefs and attitudes about the risks posed by these facilities. As previous research has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511435354">Kadvany, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511435354">Lober &amp; Green, 1994</xref>), the exposure pathway is an important factor in assessing risks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511435354">Lober and Green (1994)</xref> argue that people’s support or opposition to solid waste disposal facilities is related to the distance from which they live to that site. Using exit polls, they asked each respondent whether they would be opposed to living within 1, 5, and 20 miles of a solid waste facility. They found that the closer the waste facility was located to a respondent’s residence, the more likely the respondent was to oppose that site. Thus, their research design was hypothetical in nature. Instead, our study deals with communities that currently are facing solid waste siting issues. Instead of prompting our respondents to think about distance and opposition, we simply ask our respondents about their perceptions of distance.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of exposure pathways on assessments of risk, we ask our respondents to tell us how close or far they live to their solid waste disposal site. We refer to this response as the subjective assessment because it is based on the respondent’s perception of distance from the hazard source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013916511435354">3</xref></sup> If the NIMBY hypothesis is correct, we should expect that individuals who perceive that they live close to a landfill believe that the landfill poses more danger to them. Conversely, individuals who perceive that they live further away from landfills should believe that landfills pose less of a risk to them.</p>
<p>We also include a measure of whether our respondent owns the home in which they live. This variable provides another test of the NIMBY phenomenon. If individuals are purely self-interested and motivated by gut reaction to facilities being located near them, home owners should be more likely to express concerns about the dangers posed by landfills. Individuals who own homes are likely to be more emotionally invested in the communities in which they live. As such, government decisions about the location of solid waste facilities may be more important to home owners who are more tied to their location.</p>

<sec id="section4-0013916511435354">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>Trust in government has recently become a topic of considerable concern to social scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511435354">Braithwaite &amp; Levi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511435354">Carnevale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511435354">Kasperson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916511435354">Kramer &amp; Tyler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916511435354">La Porta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511435354">Nye, Zelikow, &amp; King, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511435354">Putnam, 2000</xref>). The most obvious reason for this concern seems to be the apparent decline of trust in government institutions of all kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511435354">Dalton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511435354">Jasanoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511435354">Marris &amp; Langford, 1996</xref>). This decline in trust has considerable implications for the development of governmental policy, including solid waste. If there is a lack of trust in government, one would assume there is likely to be skepticism about government proposals and greater public uncertainty regarding information communicated from government to the public.</p>
<p>When the public does not fully understand the complex issues related to risk assessment, they need to turn to experts for information about risks. The concept of trust plays several key roles in assessing public opinion about solid waste siting issues. A lack of trust in government officials contributes to difficulties in siting new facilities and in managing environmental crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511435354">Boholm &amp; Lofstedt, 1999</xref>). More specifically, it is trust in local governments that is crucial for understanding solid waste issues as these decisions have direct affects on the local level. The importance of trust in environmental risk assessment suggests clearly that any understanding of citizen perceptions of risk must include a module that assesses trust. For this reason, we include a measure of public trust in local government officials in our model of beliefs about danger posed by landfills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013916511435354">4</xref></sup> If the literature on trust is correct, we should expect that citizens who express higher levels of trust in local government officials should also perceive less danger from landfills. When a local government has proposed a particular site for a landfill, they do so because they have studied the issue and believe they have identified an appropriate location for the facility. Thus, individuals who express higher levels of confidence in local government officials should also be more likely to have confidence in their decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013916511435354">
<title>Interest in the Environment</title>
<p>To assess the level of interest our respondents had in environmental affairs, we asked them about their level of interest in environmental issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013916511435354">5</xref></sup> Previous research has indicated that interest in environmental issues plays an important role in the development of environmental attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511435354">Johnson &amp; Scicchitano, 2009</xref>). Individuals who are interested in environmental issues are more likely to be aware of the environmental issues facing their communities. We hypothesize that individuals who express a general interest in environmental issues will be more likely to believe that landfills pose a threat to their personal health.</p>
<p>We also asked our respondents an open-ended question about what they felt were the major environmental issues in their area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013916511435354">6</xref></sup> Across all counties, 39.5% mentioned water pollution, 11.6% mentioned air pollution, 7.1% mentioned landfills and/or solid waste facilities, 6.4% mentioned toxic and/or hazardous wastes, and 44% mentioned a large variety of other environmental issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013916511435354">7</xref></sup> In our model, we include a dichotomous variable for those individuals who mentioned landfills or solid waste facilities as a major environmental issue in their area. We expect that individuals who mention landfills as a major environmental issue will be more likely to believe that landfills pose a danger to them.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the NIMBY literature often characterizes citizen reactions to location decisions in a negative light. This study often suggests that citizen attitudes about public facilities are not based on a careful evaluation of information but a visceral response to a public imposition. To test whether citizen perceptions of danger were based on information, we asked our respondents open-ended questions about what they believed were some of the problems and/or benefits created by landfills. If general NIMBY characterizations are true, we should not find that perceptions of danger are related to levels or type of information. Although a significant percentage of our respondents could not recall (54%) a single benefit of having landfills in their community, there was also a significant percentage that mentioned at least one and as many as nine benefits from having a landfill in their community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0013916511435354">8</xref></sup> However, only 35.7% percent of our sample could not come up with any problems from having landfills in their community. As such, our respondents were generally more able to identify problems with landfills than benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0013916511435354">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, while researchers have often categorized people’s environmental concerns as being NIMBY in nature, many of the problems that respondents identified seem to represent either legitimate concerns (water and land contamination, personal health issues) or tangible benefits (ease of waste disposal, job creation). Finally, very few respondents seemed concerned about what some might describe as “selfish” or NIMBY-based motives such as lower property values or increased traffic.</p>
<p>In our model, we utilize both the number of problems and number of benefits mentioned by individuals as predictors of their beliefs about the danger posed by landfills. If people are basing their risk assessment on the information they have about landfills, individuals who can identify more problems with landfills should be more likely to believe that landfills are dangerous while individuals who can identify more benefits from landfills should be less likely to believe that landfills are dangerous.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The data for this study were collected from a random-digit dialing (RDD) sample of individuals aged 18 or older who live in seven counties in the state of Florida and who have telephones. The survey instrument was extensively pretested prior to survey implementation. The survey was conducted from the offices of the Florida Survey Research Center (FSRC) at the University of Florida. The FSRC carefully recruits and trains interviewers and monitors all aspects of survey implementation to insure the data are of high quality. The FSRC makes every effort to increase response rate by making multiple calls, calling at different times of the evening, and calling on weekdays and weekends. In addition, the FSRC schedules callbacks to complete interviews and recall individuals who have previously refused to complete a survey. The final data set include responses from 1,004 adults living in seven counties in the state of Florida.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0013916511435354">10</xref></sup> Descriptive statistics for each of our variables are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916511435354">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The seven counties included in our sample were selected based on whether there was a current siting controversy regarding a solid waste disposal site or transfer station in those counties. We also sampled individuals in two counties where there was no current controversy regarding a solid waste disposal facility within the previous 2 years. Thus, the counties in our sample were selected intentionally for having dealt with solid waste siting issues. To gather this information, we performed an extensive search of local newspaper articles and television broadcasts in the state. In addition, we sought the input of professionals working in the solid waste field from the public, private, and academic sectors (for a brief discussion of the solid waste issues in each of the counties, please see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0013916511435354">appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>Our dependent variable is a measure of whether our respondents perceive landfills as dangerous to them or their household.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013916511435354">2</xref></sup> Because our dependent variable is dichotomous, we use logistic regression to analyze our data.</p>

<p>The results of our logistic regression are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916511435354">Table 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0013916511435354">11</xref></sup> As we can see from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916511435354">Table 2</xref>, evidence that perceptions about risk from landfills are shaped by NIMBY-like attitudes is limited. People who perceive that they live close to a landfill are not significantly more likely to believe that landfills are dangerous than individuals who live neither close nor far from a landfill. It does not appear that individuals who think that landfills are “in their backyard” are any more worried than those who do not live close. Nevertheless, it is true that people who perceive that they live further away from a landfill are significantly less likely to believe that landfills are dangerous. Because logistic regression coefficients are not as easily interpreted as a linear regression coefficient, we report odds ratios in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916511435354">Table 2</xref>. The odds that individuals who perceive that they live either “far away” or “very far away” think that landfills are dangerous are .671 the odds of individuals who believe they live neither close nor far from their landfill.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511435354">Kraft and Cleary (1991)</xref> suggest that NIMBY attitudes are also related to the nature of the costs and benefits of public facilities. Essentially, the costs (such as effects on human health, environmental quality, and property values) are felt more directly by those in close proximity to the facility, whereas the benefits accrue to a more widely dispersed population. Because this is generally true, we should expect that residents in closer proximity to these facilities should be more likely to mention costs than benefits and should be more likely to be able to recall costs than benefits. We found no statistically significant difference in the mean number of problems mentioned between those who lived close to the facility and those who lived further away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0013916511435354">12</xref></sup> Our respondents’ beliefs about the risks posed by landfills seem to be based on the types of problems and benefits landfills pose; both the number of problems and number of benefits mentioned are statistically significantly related to whether individuals perceive landfills as dangerous. Thus, their responses do not seem to be knee-jerk reactions to landfills, but related to their ability to recall the types of problems and benefits landfills produce. For example, a respondent who mentions one type of problem with a landfill is almost 1.3 times more likely to believe that landfills pose a danger than individuals who do not mention any problems. Conversely, a respondent who mentions one benefit associated with landfills has .588 the odds of believing landfills are dangerous than an individual who does not mention any benefits.</p>
<p>For a different assessment of the NIMBY phenomenon, we asked individuals whether they owned their own home. We postulated that individuals who own their homes have more at stake with respect to environmental problems in their community. Therefore, we expected to find that home owners would be more likely to perceive that landfills were dangerous. Nevertheless, we found that home owners were neither more nor less likely to believe that landfills pose a danger. Home owners, in fact, are less likely to believe that landfills pose a danger to their household. Individuals who own their home have .774 the odds of believing that landfills are dangerous than someone who does not own their own home (statistically, however, we cannot be confident that this result is different from no difference).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0013916511435354">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>With respect to trust in government, we found what we expected. That is, individuals who report higher levels of trust in government are less likely to believe that landfills pose a danger to them. Individuals who trust their government have .774 the odds of believing landfills are dangerous than those who do not trust their government. This suggests that public processes that develop trust between governments and citizens may be an effective way to reduce public resistance to a particular landfill locational decision.</p>
<p>Finally, we also found that individuals who express a general interest in environmental issues were 1.7 times more likely to believe that landfills were dangerous than individuals who did not express interest in environmental issues. Interestingly enough, this result does not hold for individuals who report being aware of landfill issues in their community. On the whole, these individuals do not appear to be statistically significantly more or less likely to perceive that landfills are dangerous. Instead, it appears that individuals who express a general environmental ethic, regardless of awareness and information about particular local issues, are more generally likely to believe that landfills pose a danger. As a result, awareness and concern about a local environmental issue does not necessarily lead to negative feelings about that issue. This, too, supports other research that suggest that public information campaigns are a good way to promote greater public knowledge and also greater public trust in governmental actors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Senator David Durenberger once commented that he believed citizen’s views regarding the environment should more often be respected by environmental scientists, public policy analysts, and Congress despite their relatively low levels of information about complex environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511435354">Durenberger, 1991</xref>). He argued this position because he asserted that many scientific models that attempt to assess environmental risks to the population are guesses at best, and comparative studies often reach widely differing conclusions.</p>
<p>Though this research was limited to one environment domain, our findings suggest that individuals’ environmental concerns should not simply be dismissed due to selfish motives or a lack of information. Despite the concern over the problems that NIMBY-like attitudes can provide when trying to locate public facilities with potential negative externalities, like landfills, this research did not find much evidence for their existence. People who live near solid waste facilities or own their own homes did not express more concern about the dangers posed by landfills than did individuals who lived further away or rented their homes. In addition, the attitudes that people expressed were related to the information they had about the benefits or problems associated with landfills. Unlike the typical profile of a NIMBYist who reacts without much consideration, the opinions expressed by the individuals in our sample were related to the information they had about landfills. In addition, these concerns were not only or even often related to so-called “selfish” motives such as property values and traffic, but were very human concerns about personal health and environmental safety.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<p>What follows is a brief summary of the solid waste siting issues in each county in our sample.</p>
<p>The controversy in Volusia County is regarding a landfill that has been operating in Orange City, Florida, where residents have complained of foul smells, dust, and fires for more than 10 years. During the summer and early fall of 2001, Orange City officials were heavily lobbying state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) officials to deny GEL Corporation a renewal on their permit to continue operating the landfill. In addition, controversy surrounded the tests performed by the state DEP and city officials that demonstrated toxins leaking into the soil within 60 to 300 feet of the landfill. This was a prominent story in several city newspapers (including the Daytona Beach News-Journal and the Orlando Sentinel) as well as television broadcasts.</p>
<p>In Walton County, a timber company wanted to build a 160 acre construction and debris (C&amp;D) landfill on 730 acres of land. What complicated their efforts was an old landfill that had already contaminated a portion of the community’s water supply, Sandy Creek. The county’s public works director claims that the contamination occurred from household waste and that the C&amp;D facility will contain no such waste. Dozens of residents in this sparsely populated area have appeared at county commission meetings to express their concern about the facility. To save this land from becoming a C&amp;D facility, some have argued that the area has value as a Native American archeological site.</p>
<p>Beginning in the early 1990s, the Leon County commissioners began looking for a new landfill site. The decision to build a landfill was so embroiled in citizen opposition and controversy that by 1995 commissioners gave up on siting a new landfill and decided to settle for siting a transfer station. In 1998, the county commissioners initially approved a 40 acre site without holding a public hearing. By April of 2000, citizens had formed the “Gum Road Association” and had hired an attorney to stop the siting of the transfer station. Various legal battles have ensued since 2000, and as of the fall of 2001, when this survey was first implemented, Leon County still had not sited their transfer station.</p>
<p>The issue of trash disposal in Collier County, Florida, has dominated all political questions since January of 2001. The main problem facing Collier County (located in southeastern Florida) was rapid population growth (65.3% since 1990). The county’s infrastructure simply could not keep up with its size and its landfill was quickly approaching capacity. County commissioners had considered hauling trash away, incinerating the trash, or expanding the landfill. In addition, the existing landfill has problems with odor and community protest. Because of problems with the existing landfill, there is a lack of support in parts of the community for building a new landfill or expanding the existing landfill.</p>
<p>The issue of trash disposal in Osceola County centers on a battle between Waste Management Inc. (WMI) and Omni Waste Inc. (OWI) over how to handle the waste stream in that county. Omni Waste Inc. wants to build a new 195-acre landfill in Osceola County to process that county’s trash, whereas Waste Management Inc. wants to haul the trash away to an existing out-of-county landfill. The WMI solution is a more expensive option, but one that its citizens seem to prefer over locating a new landfill within the county.</p>
<p>Neither Alachua nor Okeechobee Counties were confronting a solid waste siting issue when our survey was in the field or in the 2 years prior to our survey being in the field. Nevertheless, the Okeechobee landfill is one of the largest in the state and accepts solid waste streams from many other locations. Given the size and prominence of this landfill in the state, it has been relatively free of controversy.</p>

<p>We included a variety of statistical controls in this model that have sometimes been found to be statistically significant predictors of attitudes in other research. These controls include gender, race, party identification, and education. In none of our specifications were any of these variables statistically significant predictors of the dependent variable. In addition, the results we report are robust to these different model specifications. Although the coefficients change slightly, the variables that are statistically significant in the reported model remain statistically significant (and in the same direction) in the other specifications. The two control variables that were consistently and significantly related to the dependent variable are age and income. Older individuals and individuals with higher incomes are significantly less likely to believe that landfills pose a danger to them and their household. Including these two variables changed the results of our other variables slightly in that the effect of home ownership and trust on the dependent variable <italic>is</italic> statistically significant when age is dropped from the analysis. The direction of the effect as currently reported remains the same. This is not surprising as age and home ownership and age and trust are strongly and positively correlated with one another.</p>

<p>In another version of the model that is not reported here, we tested an interaction effect between proximity to a landfill and number of benefits/problems mentioned. These interaction effects were not statistically significantly different from having no effect on the dependent variable. In addition, a simple difference of means test was also not statistically significantly different from 0.</p>
