<abstract>
<p>A male with atrial fibrillation for 30 years underwent embolectomy in his right leg at age 78 years. Postoperatively, he received enoxaparin 60 mg/twice a day (bid), and on day 5, phenprocoumon was started. The patient’s son, a general practitioner, changed phenprocoumon to dabigatran 110 mg/bid on day 8. Pain in his left calf induced readmission after 5 days. International normalized ratio was 2.5 and <sc>d</sc>-dimer was 20 μg/mL. Dabigatran was stopped and dalteparin 5000 International Units/bid and 40 μg alprostadil infusions were started. After 8 hours, he became comatose due to basilar artery occlusion and eventually died. This tragic case raises the issue of postoperative use of dabigatran, a recently introduced thrombin inhibitor.</p>

<body>
<p>Dabigatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration advisory-committee to prevent strokes in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) based on the results obtained from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy trial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443314">1</xref>
</sup> However, it is uncertain whether outside the clinical trials, dabigatran is indeed as safe as vitamin K antagonists.</p>
<p>A 78-year-old Caucasian male with AF, history of an embolic stroke, and hypertension, not anticoagulated, had embolic occlusions of the right and left femoral superficial arteries. After right-sided embolectomy, enoxaparin 60 mg/bid as well as, on postoperative day (PD) 5, phenprocoumon 9 mg and, on the PD 6, 6 mg/d were given, and he was discharged with digoxin 0.1 mg/d, enalapril 20 mg/d, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg/d, enoxaparin 60 mg/bid, and phenprocoumon 3 mg/d for the following days. The international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.18 and the enoxaparin was recommended until the INR was &gt;2.0. On the PD 8, the patient’s son, a general practitioner, changed phenprocoumon to dabigatran 110 mg/bid. The patient took the first dosage of dabigatran 12 hours after he had stopped enoxaparin injections and 24 hours after he had taken phenprocoumon. On the PD 13, he was rehospitalized due to pain in his left calf.</p>
<p>At clinical examination, he was alert, measuring 175 cm and weighting 85 kg. Blood pressure was 145/80 mm Hg. The left foot was pale, only the femoral artery pulses were palpable. Blood tests showed leucocytes 11.3 per nL, hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, C-reactive protein 2.8 mg/dL (normal &lt;0.6), γ-glutamyltransferase 126 U/L (normal &lt;54), glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase 35 U/L (normal &lt;34), prothrombin time 33 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time 33 seconds, thrombin time 41 seconds, fibrinogen 359 mg/dL, antithrombin 87%, INR 2.5, and <sc>d</sc>-dimer 20 μg/mL (normal &lt;0.5). Renal function tests, platelets, albumin, and electrolytes were normal. Dabigatran was stopped and dalteparin 5000 IE/bid and a 40-μg alprostadil infusions were started. After 8 hours, he was found comatose with generalized myocloni, muscular hypotonia, reduced Achilles-tendon reflexes, and stretch automatisms. Brain stem reflexes were intact. Cerebral computed-tomography suggested a basilar artery occlusion that was confirmed by angiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412443314">Figure 1</xref>). Partial mechanical recanalization was achieved by the application of the BonNet system (Phenox, Bochum, Germany), but a steady perfusion was not achieved, even after local application of 5 mg alteplase. He died after 20 hours without regaining consciousness. No autopsy was carried out.</p>

<p>The deterioration of blood flow in the left leg occurred under double antithrombotic therapy. He had taken 10 tablets of 110 mg dabigatran during 5 days and, with a plasma half-life of 12 to 17 hours, we assume that thrombin inhibition was effective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443314">2</xref>
</sup> The INR value of 2.5 either indicated still anticoagulation from phenproucumon, although stopped 6 days before, or was a confusing phenomenon observed in dabigatran-treated patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443314">3</xref>
</sup> Basilar artery occlusion occurred after dalteparin and alprostadil were added.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412443314">4</xref>
</sup> It remains uncertain whether the occlusions were atherosclerotic or cardioembolic. Since neither surgery nor angiography disclosed atherosclerosis, embolism seems likely. </p>
<p>Postoperative use of dabigatran was studied after orthopedic surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412443314">5</xref>
</sup> However, in patients with AF, no data about postoperative use of dabigatran are available. Major surgery within the previous month was an exclusion criterion in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443314">1</xref>
</sup> Vascular surgery induces a prothrombotic state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412443314">6</xref>
</sup> The elevated <sc>d</sc>-dimer indicated coagulation system activation. Possibly, dabigatran even promoted ischemia, which is indicated by the Prevention of Embolic and Thrombotic events study, where urinary excretion of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 was approximately 20% higher after 12 weeks of dabigatran treatment compared with warfarin in patients who did not receive acetylsalicylic acid.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412443314">2</xref>
</sup> This increase in thromboxane excretion suggests a platelet-activating effect of dabigatran in the absence of concomitant acetylsalicylic acid. Our patient never took acetylsalicylic acid.</p>
<p>The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study registry compared the outcome in 619 patients with acute basilar occlusion according to treatments such as antithrombotic mediaction only, primary systemic intravenous thrombolysis with subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis, or only intra-arterial therapy (thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, stenting, or combination). The results did not support superiority of intra-arterial therapy over intravenous thrombolysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412443314">7</xref>
</sup> We preferred intra-arterial therapy since our patient was already anticoagulated and facilities were available.</p>
<p>Reports about dabigatran-associated bleedings, especially in elderly patients raise doubts about safety and efficacy of dabigatran.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412443314">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412443314">9</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy study results were analyzed only on a intention-to-treat principle. The rates of discontinuation differed between the treatment groups: 20.7%, 21.2%, and 16.6% at 2 years for 110 mg dabigatran, 150 mg dabigatran, and warfarin, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412443314">1</xref>
</sup> Patients were under active treatment with dabigatran during a shorter time than on warfarin which might explain the lower bleeding and stroke rates.</p>
<p>We conclude that a combination of dabigatran and dalteparin may be insufficient to prevent thromboembolic events after vascular surgery. It should be assessed whether dabigatran affects INR or prolongs the effect of vitamin K antagonists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412443314">3</xref>
</sup> The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy study results should be analyzed on a per-protocol principle. Meanwhile, vitamin K antagonists with their well-known pharmacologic characteristics and their easily measurable effect should be preferred for stroke prevention in AF.</p>
