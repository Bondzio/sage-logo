<p><italic>Changing Roles and Contexts</italic> is divided into two broad parts. The first part (Context) consists of four chapters with a total of 17 contributions. Each of the four chapters consists of a number of smaller sub-chapters relating to the heading of the chapter. The structure is repeated in the second part (Roles) which consists of five chapters with a total of seven contributions indicating that only one of the chapters consists of more than one contribution. Further, the book starts with the editors giving a solid overview of the structure and content of the text and they also provide a good conclusion. In total, 35 different people including the editors have contributed to the book. It also has an index and extensive references at the end of each chapter. As usual, Facet has published a book with an attractive layout.</p>
<p>One could fear that so many authors would give a text that points in too many different directions. However, the book is very well edited and all the different examples, case studies and similar illustrative content through introductions and summaries fit very well together forming a coherent whole. Even the chapters containing several sub-chapters by different authors manage to keep the thread.</p>
<p>An approach which looks at both context and roles is good and it contributes to a comprehensible and thought-provoking text that should interest professionals outside the health sector. The part concerned with context has chapters on the general background including an overview of the situation for health librarians in Europe. Another chapter is concerned with changes in information generation and use. It is not surprising that a chapter is devoted to technology and finally a chapter is concerned with governance, consumers and evidence practices. Of course, the context for information practice in the health sector consists of and is influenced by other factors and driving forces. However, this is a sound and well-argued selection of serious and pertinent problems the editors have selected for analyses. The different authors put forward very strong arguments for the necessity to work with a reflective position in relation to the driving forces in the environment and use it to carve out new service models and roles that clearly should add value to the services. It is also a strength of the book that the section about context goes beyond the borders of the United Kingdom and has a fine and illuminating chapter on the European health information scene. Indirectly, too, the text transcends the health information sector and the analysis of the context could easily be inspirational for other sectors in the information field.</p>
<p>The second part of the book is concerned with roles. This part starts with a conceptually developed analysis of skills, competencies, competences and knowledge. The text also contains a discussion of the standards needed to perform a given job. Some of the case studies in the later chapters in the second part of the book have rather interesting information about a wide range of roles information professionals can take up and cover. The emergence of these roles is a consequence of changes in the context covered in the first part of the book. In this context the chapters cover broad roles like the librarian as information provider and educator. The librarian as an analyser and manager of information is the title of another chapter. There is also an interesting chapter on the librarian as a decision maker. All these chapters are illustrated with small case studies and the theoretical discourse and these support each other very well. There is a chapter on evidence-based practice which must be mentioned because evidence-based practice is rather developed in the whole field of health care and health care information and its focus on trustworthy quality information appears to be extremely central for the library profession. There is no doubt that librarians and information professionals have opportunities to carve new and significant roles in this area.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is highly recommended and it also could be very inspirational for information professionals situated outside the health information field. The editors have done a good job securing an effective mix of theoretical discourse, case studies and illuminative sub-chapters. The book is simply a pleasure to read.</p>
