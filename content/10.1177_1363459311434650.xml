<abstract>
<p>Following the United States’ lead, the emergence of neoliberal welfare policy across the western world has resulted in employment programmes for single parents, who are predominantly single mothers. While some governments claim that employment will improve single parents’ incomes and well-being, researchers dispute that single parents can unproblematically move into the workforce, with net positive effects. While researchers have quantified the socio-economic effect of these programmes, in particular on participant health, no study has yet synthesized participants’ experiences of welfare-to-work. Here, I present a meta-synthesis of eight qualitative health-related studies of single parents’ (and exclusively single mothers’) welfare-to-work transition. I report that single mothers faced a combination of health and economic issues which made their transition from welfare to work difficult, including degrees of poor physical and mental health. For participants in the United States, these health issues were often compounded by a loss of health benefits on moving into low-wage employment. In countries where a return to employment was required before children reached school age, a lack of affordable and appropriate child care, especially for children with health problems, exacerbated these difficulties. As a result of scarce resources, single mothers in receipt of welfare benefits often relied on food banks or went without food. A return to the workforce did not alleviate this problem as additional child care and reduced government subsidies depleted the funds available for food. I conclude that welfare-to-work policies are underpinned by the neoliberal assumption that the market more efficiently distributes resources than the State. However, for the women in the studies examined here, labour market participation often depleted access to essential resources. Interventions to address the ‘problem’ of welfare dependency must recognize the complex interplay between work incentives and disincentives and the care-work of single mothers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article presents a meta-synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311434650">Noblit and Hare, 1988</xref>) of qualitative research dealing with the health of single parents engaged in welfare-to-work schemes. The analysis focuses on published studies dealing with the health of single-parents in liberal welfare regimes, specifically, Canada, New Zealand and the United States.</p>
<p>Liberal welfare regimes are as those in which ‘means-tested assistance, modest universal transfers, or modest social-insurance plans predominate. Benefits mainly cater to a clientele of low-income, usually working class, state dependents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311434650">Esping-Anderson, 1990</xref>: 26). Within liberal welfare regimes, during the latter years of the 20th century, the ‘problem’ of ‘single parents’ took on a growing importance in welfare policy debates. While the concept of ‘single parent’ is historically contingent, one can find a common pattern among liberal welfare regimes which increasingly defines single parents as being ‘better off’ if engaged in paid employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311434650">Bashevkin, 2002</xref>). This focus on market participation is referred to as a neoliberal turn in contemporary social policy. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311434650">Larner (2000</xref>: 6), ‘the most common conceptualization of neo-liberalism is as a policy framework – marked by a shift from Keynesian welfarism towards a political agenda favouring the relatively unfettered operation of markets’. As such, ‘neoliberalism amounts to a form of market fundamentalism. The market is seen as morally and practically superior to government’ as it delivers both ‘fairness and economic justice. The market gives all people the opportunity to rise or fall on the basis of talent and hard work. Material inequality thus simply reflects a natural inequality amongst humankind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311434650">Heywood, 2003</xref>: 55–56).</p>
<p>Requiring single parents to take up paid employment has been justified by political officials and conservative researchers along multiple lines. First, welfare-to-work was cast as a way to transfer responsibility on to single parents themselves. This was framed as an ideological necessity in order to reduce welfare dependence, and provide an opportunity for single parents to take control of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459311434650">Murray, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459311434650">1996b</xref>). Second, welfare-to-work programmes were marketed as an effective means of reducing welfare expenditure and breaking the cycle of intergenerational welfare receipt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363459311434650">Reference Group on Welfare Reform, 2000</xref>). Lastly, it was claimed that single parents making the transition from welfare to work would experience greater incomes, self-esteem and social inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311434650">Levitas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459311434650">Peck and Theodore, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, the Australian government, as a recent adopter of welfare-to-work measures for single parents, claimed that people making the mandatory transition from welfare to work would experience ‘higher incomes’, ‘better participation in mainstream economic life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311434650">Costello, 2005</xref>: 3) and improvements to ‘wellbeing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311434650">Commonwealth of Australia, 2005</xref>: 132), a claim which is disputed by empirical studies of the literature, including several meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311434650">Ashworth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311434650">Bitler and Hoynes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311434650">Clark-Kauffman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311434650">Greenberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311434650">Huston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311434650">Kaestner and Tarlov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311434650">Kaplan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311434650">Kissane and Krebs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311434650">Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459311434650">Morris, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459311434650">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363459311434650">Zaslow, et al., 2002</xref>). However, no study has yet synthesized participants’ experiences of welfare to work, particularly in relation to health. My aim here is to examine the veracity of such claims, in particular those made about single parents’ well-being. I do so by examining qualitative research findings within the literature.</p>
<p>I begin by setting out the broad contours of the neoliberal shaping of political programmes relating to single parents in the countries studied. I then discuss the methodologies employed, including how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn’s (2004)</xref> model for studying the relationships between welfare regimes, access to social resources and health (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459311434650">Figure 1</xref>) was employed. In his model of class/welfare regimes, Coburn links the rise of neoliberalism with reductions in the welfare state and the inflated role of the market in distributing social benefits. Coburn’s model provides a critique of the accepted relationship between income inequality and health, where most attention is focused on income distribution. Instead, Coburn provides a class-based approach that takes into consideration the political economy of social inequalities and the processes through which theses inequalities have an effect on health, primarily through differential access to social resources and the depletion of social cohesion. To Coburn, welfare state reductions and the increasing marketization of social life are socio-political determinants of both personal social assets (such as work type, education, health care, etc.) and individual health and well-being:<disp-quote>
<p>In this model, income inequality is itself the consequence of fundamental changes to class structure which have produced not only income inequality but also numerous other forms of health-relevant social inequalities. Welfare measures in turn reflect basic social, political and economic institutions tied to the degree to which societies take care of their citizens or leave the fate of citizens up to the market. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn, 2004</xref>: 43)</p>

</fig>
<p>In this analysis, I seek to explore the health-related experiences of citizens whose fate is not merely ‘left up to the market’, but who are mandated to rely on the market in lieu of the State’s provision of a safety net. As such, Coburn’s model provides a means of linking the behavioural and social determinants of single parents’ health to broader political economies which go beyond evaluations of income inequality. I, like Coburn, argue that the experience of welfare-to-work goes beyond socioeconomic status to include access to social assets and an individual’s position within the neoliberal structure. Drawing on published studies of single parents’ welfare-to-work experiences, in this article I seek to demonstrate these processes.</p>

<title>Welfare-to-work policy</title>
<p>When welfare policy shifted towards increasing scrutiny of, and placing obligation upon, single parents, many of those previously exempt from work tests, due to their care giving responsibilities, found themselves at the heart of the new ideological battleground, in a battle some claim may have long since been lost to the pervasive neoliberal mindset (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311434650">Hartman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459311434650">Morgen and Maskovsky, 2003</xref>). Work tests are tests of preparedness to take paid work which have always been fundamental to eligibility to primary benefits. Such ‘tests’ include active job searching and training to improve employability. Work tests are fundamental to the operation of welfare-to-work across all countries.</p>
<p>Single parents in the United States, for example, have been required, under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), to demonstrate their deservingness of welfare and, in the absence of this, undertake work activities. Some Canadian provinces have required mandatory work activity since 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311434650">Little, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1363459311434650">Shragge, 1997</xref>) and New Zealand first introduced work tests for single parents in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459311434650">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Requirements differ by province, with some (such as Alberta) requiring parents to undertake work requirements when their youngest child is six months of age.

<p>More recent adopters of this neoliberal welfare doctrine include the United Kingdom, which introduced a voluntary programme for single parents in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311434650">Dwyer, 2004</xref>) and Australia, which lowered the child’s age at which parents have to seek employment from 16 to six years in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311434650">Commonwealth of Australia, 2005</xref>). Prior to the introduction of ‘welfare-to-work’, work tests did not typically apply to women with dependent children. However, failing to demonstrate a preparedness to work can result in benefit sanctions or being rendered ineligible to receive benefits. My focus here, however, is the effect of such programmes on the experiences of single parents as they relate to health.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The purpose of qualitative meta-synthesis is to develop grand theory from micro or mid-range theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1363459311434650">Schreiber et al., 1997</xref>) by drawing on the interpretations of the original researchers and the primary data reported in these publications. It differs from other forms of research consolidation including: secondary analysis, whereby researchers have access to the primary data; critical literature reviews which aim to compile the findings of published research; and methodological triangulation where multiple methods are used in a single study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1363459311434650">Schreiber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363459311434650">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The process of qualitative meta-synthesis involves strict scientific procedures regarding: the choice of studies; resolving contradictory findings; reducing reviewer bias; summarizing, interrogating, interpreting and synthesizing findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363459311434650">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>). This study drew on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311434650">Noblit and Hare (1988)</xref>, who outline a comprehensive process for synthesizing qualitative studies. Three meta-ethnographic studies of vulnerable women or families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311434650">Attree, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311434650">Beck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459311434650">Meadows-Oliver, 2003</xref>) which followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311434650">Noblit and Hare’s (1988)</xref> method, were used to guide further the analytical process and the presentation of the results.</p>
<sec id="section4-1363459311434650">
<title>Epistemological framework</title>
<p>While the merits of qualitative meta-synthesis have been discussed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311434650">Barnett-Page and Thomas, 2009</xref>), the results must be interpreted with caution. Unlike statistical meta-analysis where original data are re-analysed, qualitative meta-synthesis draws solely on the published results. As such, the full complement of data available to the original researchers is not available to the qualitative meta-analyst. While I was an author of one of the included studies, to enable replication, only the data provided in the published manuscript were included in this analysis.</p>
<p>In the meta-synthesis discussed below, I provide a partial and selective account of the published findings derived from the key themes evident in the data, which mirrored the conceptual framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn (2004)</xref>. As such, the results presented here follow Coburn’s delineation of neoliberalism’s influence of health. Onto this model, I scaffold the welfare policy experiences of participants and the impact it has on their health. Readers should be aware of this perspective and remain open to other readings of the data that might make use of different theoretical frameworks. Certainly, I do not claim that this synthesis and analysis of the published data has resulted in a ‘better truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363459311434650">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>). Rather, I aim to cast the original researchers’ interpretations of their data within a common language by using the logic of neoliberalism. I am very aware that focusing on a particular reading of the texts might obscure other possible readings; however, I contend that my focus on the health-related consequences of welfare-to-work enables important implications to be drawn regarding the impact of neoliberalism on the determinants of single parents’ health and well-being.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Five bibliographic databases were searched for English language articles published between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2008. Although welfare-to-work programmes began in the mid-1990s, the search was restricted to articles published post-2000 in order to access data collected after the introduction of welfare reform. For each database, a standard list of search terms was used which included keywords, subject headings and in-text words under three domains, namely ‘single parenthood’, ‘welfare receipt’ and ‘qualitative studies’. This process resulted in 62 articles being analysed for the meta-synthesis, of which eight were specific to ‘health’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1363459311434650">Figure 2</xref>). Full details of the search methodology can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311434650">Cook (in press)</xref>.</p>

<p>While the inclusion criteria allowed for articles relevant to single parents, reflecting the gender-neutral nature of welfare-to-work policies, only studies pertaining to single mothers, who are the vast majority of welfare-to-work programme participants, were identified.

<p>A thematic synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1363459311434650">Thomas and Harden, 2008</xref>) of the 62 articles identified various themes including the health of single mothers and their children. Here, I focus specifically on this ‘health’ theme, in order to reduce the volume of data to a manageable size. The results of other themes are detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311434650">Cook, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>The health of single mothers and their children was discussed in detail in eight of the 62 articles, in three countries where welfare-to-work legislation had been introduced in the mid-1990s. The eight articles included two articles from the same research project conducted in New Zealand which were sufficiently different to warrant their separate inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>), one study from Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>) and five from the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311434650">Hildebrandt and Kelber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363459311434650">Reschke and Walker, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The eight ‘health’ studies explored the general health and well-being of single mothers and their children, including the sub-themes of food, health insurance and health care, and the reciprocal relationships between poor health and unemployment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459311434650">Table 2</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>From these data, I aimed to describe how the health-related experiences of single mothers engaged in welfare-to-work were embedded within the larger socio-cultural phenomenon of neoliberalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459311434650">Noblit and Hare (1988</xref>: 75) describe this type of qualitative synthesis as a ‘line of argument’ translation, where an holistic scheme is used to integrate the studies and where inferential analysis ‘may serve to reveal what is hidden in individual studies’. Following this method, the findings of individual studies outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459311434650">Table 2</xref> were first compared and contrasted. These concepts were then placed into an interpretive order, which drew on a model of the neoliberal determinants of health, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of a defined conceptual framework here aided in clearly explicating the boundaries of the analysis and focusing attention on the relationships between women’s reliance on the market as a social safety net and their health and well-being. Locating the findings of this analysis within Coburn’s model of neoliberalism as a determinant of health, provided a way to move beyond the individual ‘themes’ presented in the articles to examine the hidden relationships between the political, social and behavioural determinants. The results then describe how these relationships were experienced by the targets of neoliberal policy, in this case, single mother welfare-to-work participants.</p>
<p>While the eight articles included other topics such as domestic violence, women’s commitment to work and mothering, education and interactions with case workers, these topics were peripheral to the core ‘health’ theme and were therefore not analysed. The presentation of results follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn’s (2004)</xref> model, beginning with a description of the health and well-being of participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459311434650">Figure 1</xref>, section D), before moving on to a description of single parents’ social resources (section C), and the influence of the welfare system (section B). The role of neoliberalism (section A) is then explored in the conclusion.</p>

<title>Health and well-being</title>
<p>While some single mothers reported good health, other endured multiple health issues, which for some included chronic and serious health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311434650">Hildebrandt and Kelber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>). Single mothers spoke of their experiences of depression and stress, which were common, and seen by participants as largely being a result of their circumstances, including welfare-to-work requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311434650">Hildebrandt and Kelber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>At the moment I go up and down with my mental health and if I’m pushed too far, if I have too much pressure on me, I can quite easily get depression again. I don’t think I can cope with everyday working at the moment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>: 110)</p>
<p>I suffer a lot of depression. I close myself up in the room and start crying. When I see myself without money, without anything, that my kids are asking for this and that, I get nervous. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 107)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to their own health, single mothers spoke about the chronic and periodic health problems of their children including; asthma, epilepsy, bronchial infections, influenza and a range of psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>). Negative influences of welfare reform on child health were also discussed in terms of poor housing, malnourishment, lack of primary health care and poor child care options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin (2004</xref>: 103) reported, ‘some mothers mentioned that their children’s immune systems were weak and their health was poor as a result of malnourishment and substandard housing (especially dampness and cold in winter)’.</p>
<p>While it is beyond the scope of this article to present details of the health status of individuals or populations, the analysis revealed that while health status existed as a spectrum, single mothers engaged in welfare-to-work faced a greater than usual number of mental and physical health issues within their family. While the prevalence of such disorders is important, what is more relevant, I believe, is the experience of poor health within this particular socio-political context. As participants described, poor health was not only an outcome of their welfare-to-work experience, it was also an obstacle to making a successful transition from welfare to work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1363459311434650">
<title>Health benefits</title>
<p>In the United States where only those in the greatest need were provided with state-funded health care, many single mothers spoke of how a move off welfare may end their health insurance coverage, given that the jobs offered rarely included such cover (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In countries such as New Zealand, where the private sector also does not provide health care, government welfare reforms in the 1980s and 1990s reduced state-funded subsidies for doctor or hospital visits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>). Participants thus incurred increasing costs as a result of seeking health care and ‘often delay taking their children to the doctors, waiting to see how serious the illness would become and if it’s worth the expense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>: 830).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1363459311434650">
<title>Child care</title>
<p>In the United States and Canada, where a return to work is required before children reach school age, welfare reform has created the need for single mothers to seek alternate, and often market-based, care for their children. While the State provides subsidies for this care, these benefits do not meet the actual costs incurred by parents, or the practicalities of arranging care when job schedules are erratic in nature or, as often occurred, were outside a 9 to 5 weekday schedule. So while child care subsidies were common across these studies, they were often either not provided to participants when required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>), did not meet the actual costs of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>), especially for children with health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>) or dictated that participants used low-cost care of relatively poor quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>When market-based care was not available or not preferred, women sought care from others, usually relatives and friends, including older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363459311434650">Reschke and Walker, 2006</xref>). The consequences of these informal child care arrangements were often additional stress and difficulty for single mothers, particularly if they felt that some carers were inappropriate, or if they had to repay favours to obtain assistance.</p>
<p>The lack of affordable and available child care also influenced children’s health and well-being. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist and colleagues (2003</xref>: 35) reported:<disp-quote>
<p>in the childcare domain, though some children without subsidies were able to spend time with a caring and competent grandmother, others were left in the care of adults who were, in their mother’s views, verbally abusive, struggling with drug addictions or mental illness, or even downright neglectful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, single mothers were left in the untenable situation of having to rely on poor child care providers, as they were not able to negotiate a better situation for themselves and their children. Even mothers who were able to access professional child care providers questioned the quality of the care due to the inconsistencies within, or absence of, child care regulations in different states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, for low-income families, at the bottom of the income scale, child care difficulties may play a role in the perpetuation of inequalities in child mental health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311434650">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). While this meta-synthesis of health-related studies provides only a partial picture of the difficulties surrounding the child care arrangements of low-income single parent families, further research is needed to examine the impact of the availability and accessibility of appropriate child care, or lack thereof, on parental and child well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1363459311434650">
<title>Nutrition</title>
<p>Nutrition was a third resource identified as being inextricably linked to a single mothers’ move from welfare to work and their experiences of health and well-being. Recipient parents in Canada and the United States received either a food allowance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>) or food stamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>) to cover their nutritional expenses. These allowances have been reported as being inadequate by both academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311434650">Borjas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363459311434650">Riches, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363459311434650">Tarasuk, 2003</xref>) and participants. For example, food stamps did not provide enough money to cover the family’s entire grocery bill and food allowances were often used to cover other essential items, as utility allowances and other benefits were also inadequate: ‘What they send us in food stamps is not enough for the whole month. It’s only enough for 15 days of food. After the 15 days what do we do?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 60). To cover the shortfall, mothers often went without food to ensure enough for their children or they turned to food banks run by charitable agencies:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m the type of person that can go two days without eating. I just focus on my kids, that they eat. I always give them something, even if it’s eggs and rice or something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 59)</p>
<p>I rely on them [the Food Bank] religiously. I know it’s a bad thing but at the same time you know. I don’t have a choice. ’Cause if we don’t then we starve for that month you know, because I don’t get enough on my cheque. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>: 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As single mothers returned to work, their access to food stamps or allowances also diminished. However, in the studies analysed here, the net income of single mothers rarely increased as a result of a move from welfare to work. Rather, single mothers often experienced additional costs, such as for child care, and reduced subsidies, which further stretched their budgets and depleted money available for food.</p>
<p>A return to work, therefore, did not alleviate the food insecurity of single parent families, mirroring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311434650">Borjas’ (2004)</xref> analysis of US population data. Here, Borjas found that a 10 per cent reduction in welfare caseload resulted in a 5 per cent increase in food insufficient households, concluding that tightening welfare eligibility rules can worsen food security.</p>

<title>Social cohesion and trust</title>
<p>In order to survive, single mothers relied on two broad sources of support, namely, public and non-public sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>). To approach either source, single mothers’ dependencies were predicated on minimum levels of social cohesion and trust, which allowed them to acquire needed items from government agencies and social networks comprised of family members, friends and charitable agencies. However, women sometimes found themselves in social and physical environments that did not foster community participation, cohesion or trust. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit and colleagues (2001</xref>: 73) describe the urban ghettos in which most of their American participants resided, and as one participant described, ‘we were like hostages in our own homes, because if you go out in the street you might get shot. In fact, one of our guys, one of my son’s playmates, his mother got shot on a drive-by.’</p>
<p>In these dangerous environments, women found the transition from welfare to work very difficult, as the comments of three other participants from this multi-state study made clear:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m scared to work around here … People walking around the street I don’t like. I ain’t trying to have no money in my pockets, so none of these people around here [have something] to snatch. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 73)</p>
<p>[I wouldn’t take an early job] because if it was, like, very early. I wouldn’t take it because it’s very risky being out on the street alone, waiting for the buses. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 74)</p>
<p>I must work because I need the money, but I would rather not work. The difficult thing for me is that the oldest boy has to take him [the toddler] to daycare and pick him up. He’s 14 and it’s dangerous to walk back and forth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>: 74)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These single mothers placed their trust in others to make their lives manageable, through the provision of goods or services, but the environment they operated in was anything but supportive and in fact, downright dangerous.</p>
<p>When accessing public support, single mothers often found themselves treated with suspicion and contempt by caseworkers whom they believed suspected them of defrauding the system by exaggerating their health issues to avoid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>), quitting jobs without just cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>) or by hiding income in order to maximize their benefit payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>). In order to reduce the opportunities for welfare beneficiaries to defraud the welfare system, caseworkers demanded an enormous amount of information from their clients. As one participant in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook and colleague’s (2001</xref>: 22–23) study remarked,<disp-quote>
<p>You have to have some privacy in your life. You have to have a little bit of something. They make you take down your bank statements – the last one you had to thirty or fifteen days before so they know how much money you had in your account. They want to know everything. They want to know where your spouse moved. Why did he move out? What colour underwear was he wearing?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The strategy single mothers then employed to fend off what they considered the overly prying and unresponsive gaze of the welfare system was to divulge as little information as possible, as this information could often be used against them at a later time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>). As participants noted,<disp-quote>
<p>Personally I say as little as possible, as little as possible, because it just comes back and bites you. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>: 834)</p>
<p>I will just apply for whatever I need and if they ask a question I will respond but if they don’t then I won’t even bother commenting. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>: 113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In many instances single mothers spoke of how they thought their caseworkers were withholding information or deliberately preventing them from accessing supplemental benefits or programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311434650">Baker and Tippin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist and colleagues (2003</xref>: 9) remarked on the prevalence of such reports, claiming that ‘while it is entirely possible that client error was involved, the stories were so similar across our different neighbourhoods we believe caseworkers were also part of the problem’. This adds to the recent work by David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311434650">Baker (2010</xref>: 25) who examined ‘systemic failures contributing to undischarged assistance payments and concession benefits’.</p>
<p>Studies of welfare discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311434650">Levitas, 1998</xref>) have suggested that programmes are increasingly focusing upon the morals of the underclass, rather than the redistribution of citizenship entitlements. By focusing on the unacceptable behaviours of the poor, mistrust and suspicion between clients and caseworkers are heightened, which means that not only are there disparities of actual capital, but symbolic capital as well.</p>

<title>The role of the welfare system</title>
<p>All eight studies noted the poverty of single mothers reliant on welfare benefits, and many reflected on the role the welfare system itself played in perpetuating this. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311434650">Baker (2002</xref>: 835) noted, ‘in liberal welfare states such as New Zealand, reliance on social benefits tends to prolong poverty for lone mothers and their children’. Also, and consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311434650">Lower-Basch and Greenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1363459311434650">Zedlewski and Chaudry, 2008</xref>), the types of jobs available to single mothers were typically not those which would lift them above the poverty line. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield and colleagues (2000</xref>: 47) note that:<disp-quote>
<p>in this area, fast food employers usually offer minimum wage to new employees and factory jobs offer around six dollars per hour[, one participant] pointed out that it would take at least ten dollars per hour to make ends meet in her household.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In parallel to discussions on reduced government welfare expenditure, some studies noted the increasing role of the market in distributing social benefits. In the most explicit cases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook and colleagues (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield and colleagues (2000)</xref> described how business interests, rather than the interests of single mother participants, were served by the introduction of welfare-to-work policies. In these cases, in the United States and Canada respectively, welfare-to-work programme participants’ wages were subsidized, thereby reducing the employment costs for business. For the women in these programmes, the experience of subsidized work was often not empowering or capital building, as promised in policy rhetoric. For example, participants in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield and colleagues (2000</xref>: 47) claimed that ‘their “employer” often asked them to perform more dangerous and rigorous work than the regular employees, who were covered by worker’s compensation’. Subsidized jobs and ‘mandatory job-hunting also had the effect of lowering wages for low-skill jobs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311434650">Cook et al., 2001</xref>: 24). Such an ‘employers’ market’ further reduced the impetus for businesses to provide employment benefits such as sick leave, holidays leave and health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459311434650">Porterfield et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>While these two studies provided the most forthright discussion of market forces, the lack of employment benefits, particularly health benefits, was a primary concern within all of the publications. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311434650">Clampet-Lundquist and colleagues (2003)</xref>, in an examination of the role of both the market and the State in the distribution of essential resources, including health benefits, nutrition and child care social benefits, described a two-fold ‘problem’, namely, the withdrawal of the State as a provider/subsidizer of such goods and services, and the failure of the market to provide low-wage workers with employment benefits or remuneration adequate to purchase these.</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>In addition to the epistemological considerations outlined in the methods section, there are several limitations to this meta-synthesis. The analysis drew on studies which both directly and indirectly examined the health of single parents engaged in welfare-to-work. As such, in some cases, the evidence was not ‘fit for purpose’ in that some studies did not focus extensively on health and well-being. This made it difficult to conduct an in-depth analysis as important determinants of single mother-headed family health were not discussed in detail. The ethnographic nature of the studies examined here focused on the determinants of health and how health was experienced by participants. The small amount of health-related welfare-to-work research made this analysis problematic and as a consequence, only relatively few key articles were available to interpret.</p>
<p>While ‘undemocratically’ focusing on the most relevant cases is encouraged in qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459311434650">Morse, 2003</xref>), in this meta-synthesis it may have reduced the scope of its potential findings. As such, I remind readers that these results are a partial and filtered account of the lives of low-income single parents engaged in welfare to work. They are based on (1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria, (2) the interpretations of the original researchers, (3) my subsequent analysis and interpretations and (4) the application of Coburn’s theoretical framework. For example, the impact of domestic violence experienced by participants and their children went unexplored, as did other welfare-state issues unrelated to the ‘problem’ of neoliberalism presented by Coburn.</p>
<p>While these data do not allow for an identification or quantification of causal relationships, they do illustrate important aspects of the daily experiences of single mothers engaged in welfare-to-work. These experience can be used to identify areas of contested knowledge where research is required, for example; in relation to welfare transfers, employment conditions and population well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363459311434650">Raphael and Bryant, 2004</xref>) and how various forms of market and state governance, such as the four welfare state archetypes outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311434650">Considine (2001)</xref>, alter these relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1363459311434650" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This meta-synthesis suggests that low-income single mothers’ experiences of work type, health care, child care and nutrition are consistent with the socio-political determinants of health described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311434650">Coburn (2004)</xref>. However, the meta-data presented here also suggest the addition of two important pathways on Coburn’s model. First, as is already recognized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311434650">Danziger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363459311434650">Schuring et al., 2007</xref>), poor health feeds directly into reduced employment and economic wealth. Second, poor health and well-being may lead to increasing welfare demand and expenditure, as a larger percentage of the population cannot participate in the free market, thereby requiring increasing state intervention. These feedback mechanisms provide a critique of the current neoliberal approach to welfare reform.</p>
<p>While proponents of neoliberalism claim that the market is the most effective means of redistributing social benefits to citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459311434650">C Murray, 2008</xref>), the experiences of the women in the studies analysed here present a different reality. A move to employment was often difficult, as it was accompanied by additional economic, health, nutritional and emotional costs which were not compensated by an increase in material well-being. These findings contribute to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311434650">Chung and Muntaner’s (2006)</xref> analysis of public medical coverage and income inequality. They concluded that ‘income inequality itself is not a cause of ill-health in populations, but is a result of something else in society, for example the welfare or health policies which directly impact population health status’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311434650">Chung and Muntaner, 2006</xref>: 838). The findings reported here also mirror calls by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311434650">Bryson and colleagues (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311434650">Johner (2007)</xref> who highlight the need for neoliberal social policy to be examined as a public health issue.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume from this work that, as others have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311434650">Danziger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459311434650">Polit et al., 2001</xref>), eventually only the sickest/most disadvantaged will be left on welfare rolls. This situation then poses a problem which goes to the heart of welfare-to-work policies; how do we treat the most vulnerable members of society? The neoliberal welfare policies analysed here problematize single motherhood and welfare dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459311434650">KB Murray, 2008</xref>) and legislate behavioural interventions to promote single parents’ labour market attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311434650">Levitas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363459311434650">Schram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1363459311434650">Teghtsoonian, 2009</xref>). However, as the results of this study demonstrate, the low-wage market does not effectively increase the social resources available to single mothers, as neoliberal proponents would suggest.</p>
<p>The complex balance between market and state provision, appropriate work incentives, disincentives and the recognition of care-work in policy interventions, makes an effective and equitable welfare policy difficult to achieve, particularly for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311434650">Kershaw, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459311434650">Pearce, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1363459311434650">Smith, 2007</xref>). At present however, those underprivileged with diminished resources – poor health status, chronically sick children, inadequate or inappropriate support networks – who become the target of neoliberal policies, are least able to respond positively to their predicament. However, if neoliberal and market solutions dominate welfare policy discourse, the health and well-being of low-income single mothers and their children cannot improve, and is likely to worsen. Rather than looking only to the market to solve the ‘problem’ of single mothers’ welfare dependence, governments should carefully examine the work incentives and disincentives embedded within welfare-to-work policy and integrate a web of supportive health care, child care and social services to assist single mothers better in their transition. Only by addressing the multiple economic, structural and institutional barriers can governments support single parents to move from poverty to prosperity, rather than merely from welfare to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1363459311434650">Williams, 1997</xref>).</p>
