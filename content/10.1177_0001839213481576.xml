<p>Donald Palmer has developed a provocative argument about the inevitability of organizational wrongdoing. Here are two examples: “I came to the conclusion that even the most ethical, socially responsible, and law-abiding people are at significant risk of becoming entangled in wrongdoing when placed in an organizational context” (p. 23), and “The position of the line separating right from wrong is a political product, a reflection of the balance of power among competing interests rather than a representation of moral imperative. . . . [That line] is eminently disputable and perhaps inherently suspect” (p. 264). What we have here is a critical, inclusive, sociological analysis that takes the perspective of embedded wrongdoers.</p>
<p>The normalcy of wrongdoing makes more sense theoretically as we move away from the dominant organizational perspectives of rational choice theory and organizational culture, both of which treat wrongdoing as abnormal, and move toward an alternative perspective that gives more prominence to ethical decision theory, administrative systems, situational social influence, the power structure, accidental wrongdoing, and the social control of organizational wrongdoing. As we move across these eight perspectives (two dominant, one bridge, five gradations of an alternative), there is a systematic shift in four assumptions. “[T]he dominant approach rests on the assumption that wrongdoers deliberate mindfully and rationally, in social isolation, make discrete decisions, and develop positive inclinations to engage in wrongdoing before embarking on a wrongful course of action.” As we move from rational choice to the social control agent perspective, organizational wrongdoers are now assumed to stray from rightdoing “in a mindless and boundedly rational way, subject to the influence of their immediate social context, slipping into wrongdoing in a crescive way, without ever developing a positive inclination to do so” (p. 268).</p>
<p>This ambitious and meaningful aggregation of perspectives—Palmer calls them ”complementary” (p. 3)—is held together by the four assumptions just discussed, as well as by a definition and fundamental concepts. Palmer’s definition of wrongdoing is noteworthy because it is more restrictive than Diane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839213481576">Vaughan’s (1999)</xref> better-known formulation. Palmer defines wrongdoing as “any behavior that organizational participants perpetrate in the course of fulfilling their organizational roles (e.g., as directors, managers, and/or employees) that the state judges to be wrongful” (p. 35). An act is considered wrongful “if the state makes a concerted effort to designate the act a violation of the criminal or civil codes and/or imposes on the perpetrator some form of punishment” (p. 35). What animates Palmer’s definition is that the line separating right from wrong moves from time to time. There is uncertainty. And the more the uncertainty about the location of the line, the greater the likelihood that it will be crossed inadvertently and that people will become more susceptible to influences associated with administrative structures, situation, power, accidents, and regulators looking for wrongdoers. Palmer’s definition (p. 212) is narrower than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839213481576">Vaughan’s (1999)</xref> treatment of wrongdoing as any behavior “‘that deviates from both formal design goals and normative standards or expectations.’” Palmer argues that the explosion of the <italic>Challenger</italic> space shuttle meets her definition of organizational deviance but not his.</p>
<p>The fundamental individual- and group-level concepts that hold these eight approaches together are expectancies, information processing, and context. Expectancies are framed in a manner close to rational choice theory, namely, wrongdoing is influenced by relations between effort and performance (Can I successfully complete the task?) and performance and outcome (If I complete the task, will I get the promised rewards?). Aside from expectancies, Palmer also applies basic ideas about information processing. Deficits in information processing produce wrongdoing in at least two ways: people lack the information needed and/or people lack the capacity to process the available information. Finally, context is articulated with a recurring focus on three things: complexity (multiple options with multiple consequences), uncertainty (Can you predict the consequences of options?), and information impactedness (the inaccessibility of information).</p>
<p>Although there are occasional problems in the book, such as awkward headers (e.g., “An informal power greased slippery slope,” p. 195), unrelenting use of first-person singular (e.g., “Now that I have presented the definition that I employ in this book, I need to define the type of wrongdoing on which I focus primarily,” p. 36), and vague cross-referencing (e.g., “I have already described how Carrier Finance executives . . .,” no page indicated), these problems pale against the important issues that are stirred up. For example, if we add the concept of “normal wrongdoing” to the vocabulary of “normal accidents,” “normal science,” or “normal crime,” then the question becomes, What have we gained? Is this “normal” run amok? In the beginning, there was action or what might be called “undifferentiated normal.” Then there was action that was differentiated into normal and abnormal and, finally re-envisioned as normal abnormality. Does this mean that we are back where we started? Do we create distinctions that we then stumble over and dutifully remove, claiming that we’ve made a breakthrough? In a way, yes. The “yes” is warranted because context and boundary conditions are now given more prominence, discontinuous categories (normal/abnormal) are now treated as continuous with acts of categorization viewed as more arbitrary, and the forcefulness of organizations and organizing is newly reaffirmed.</p>
<p>We see this forcefulness when Palmer reprises his insightful analysis of the mortgage meltdown using normal accident theory, a theory that he describes as a “major breakthrough in our understanding of unintended and sometimes catastrophic events at the organizational and field level” (p. 235). Unavoidably complex and tightly coupled systems can enlarge small wrongs into larger, longer wrongdoing. But more mundane features of organizing can have similar effects. For example, administrative systems provide guidelines for action, reduce the need for mindful, rational analyses, introduce more determination by situational context, and heighten the susceptibility to unobtrusive controls, such as occupational and professional roles, communication channels, technology, and schemas and scripts. As organizing is brought more to the forefront in an analysis of wrongdoing, the determinants shift away from deliberate, intentional inclinations and toward social context, bounded rationality, and temporal development. This picture of organizing is old news, but its centrality to our understanding of wrongdoing is new. The same organizational structures and processes that produce rightdoing can produce wrongdoing, just as the same organizational processes that lead people to seek reliability channel them toward unreliable performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839213481576">Busby, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Palmer’s argument is also important because it restores context to analyses of organizational wrongdoing and preempts context-free laboratory demonstrations. Context-free “ethical decisions” and “dilemmas” go through the motions of wrongdoing but without being embedded in cross-pressures, temporal unfolding, uncertainty, contradictory regulations, and shifting definitions of what is ethical and what is not. When decisions become choices within streaming events, they become less discrete and distinguishable and closer to episodes of sensemaking. They do not stand out with vivid labels such as “this is an ethical juncture.” Instead, they are incremental commitments, often visible in hindsight, that furnish the grounds for subsequent interpretations. Therein lies the normalizing that produces normal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Ethical decision making is a temporal process. Discrete decision making in laboratories fails to capture this. Palmer elaborates this trajectory into wrongdoing by focusing on options and simultaneous activities. First, people become involved in wrongdoing through a stream of linked decisions, the linking coming from initial decisions creating or closing off options, which also shapes the evaluation of these options. Second, people are engaged in multiple, parallel streams of decisions such that decisions and consequences in one stream shape decisions in other streams. For example, I personally did not think of my work on high reliability systems as meaningful in the context of wrongdoing, yet it seemed to fit with the chapter on “accidental wrongdoing.” I mention this experience only because others with other perspectives are likely to have a similar experience. Palmer anticipated my own obvious question: How do accidents constitute wrongdoing? The answer is detailed. People who have an accident may have to pay restitution (e.g., KLM airlines in the Tenerife air disaster). Wrongdoing can facilitate accidents (e.g., falsified documents increase the supply of mortgage defaults). Accidents facilitate wrongdoing (e.g., the mortgage meltdown is exploited by fraudulent firms offering mortgage modifications that put borrowers in even worse shape). Accidents lead to detection of unrelated wrongdoing (e.g., during the mortgage meltdown, clients of Bernard Madoff try to liquidate their holdings but Madoff can’t meet liquidation requests). Accidents lead to broader definitions of wrongdoing, which increases the possibility of wrongdoing in the future (e.g., the behavior of fund managers looks suspicious in hindsight, but at the time it was within the bounds of accepted practice).</p>
<p>If it were my call, I’d start reading this book with the case of Dr. Ronald McIver, a pain physician (p. 250). Social control agents charge him with pushing the drug OxyContin, while he contends that he has more ambitious goals for pain management (on a scale of 1–10, on which 10 is unbearable, most physicians strive for 5, whereas McIver strives for 2). It’s all here in this incident, as it is in others such as Blackwater Security, doping in bicycle racing, Enron, the mortgage meltdown, and quiz show fraud. These examples take on considerable depth because Palmer analyzes them in respectful detail, detail that includes both the theories being applied and the particulars of the examples themselves.</p>
<p>
<italic>Normal Wrongdoing</italic> could easily be a basic text for organizational studies courses of any kind. Why? Basic positions are presented and compared. Ethics are not compartmentalized. Applications are not oversimplified. Readers understand more clearly why organizational participants may develop a cynical outlook. If social control agents create wrongdoing, then the line separating right from wrong is debatable, not one’s own responsibility, and can draw one into wrongdoing and into being labeled a wrongdoer.</p>
<p>Perhaps most unnerving is the compilation of “remedies” near the end of the book. As with many progressions called “normal,” recommendations on how to change normal wrongdoing sound limp and boil down to admonitions to be aware of limits to ethical decision making, reduce those limits, blunt their effects, and do all of this in an unhurried manner. If wrongdoing is to be managed by this kind of “gut check,” then we’re all in trouble. But Palmer also helped me become more attuned to social control agents, to the necessity of working close to the line between wrong- and rightdoing, to line drawing itself, to line drawers, to the presence of more uncertainty than I imagined, and to less agency than I presumed.</p>
