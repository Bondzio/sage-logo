<abstract>
<p>The effect of lanthanum (La) salt on surface treatment of poly-p-phenylenebenzobisoxazole (PBO) fiber on flexural and tribological properties of PBO fibers reinforced polyimide (PI) composites was investigated. Experimental results revealed that flexural strength and modulus were largely improved by La salt treatment. The La salt treated composite had lower friction coefficient and specific wear rate than that of untreated one under the same testing condition. The principle of improvement in interfacial adhesion between PBO fiber and PI matrix after La salt treatment was discussed. The surface characteristics of PBO fibers were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the content of polar groups on the surface of PBO fiber treated by La salt increased compared with the untreated fiber. The increase in the amount of polar groups strengthened the interfacial adhesion between PBO fibers and PI matrix, and accordingly enhanced the flexural and tribological properties.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311429883" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fiber-reinforced polymers are attractive because they are able to provide a beneficial balance between the traditional properties of a polymer (such as low part weight and ease of processability) and selective properties of metals (such as high strength, modulus, and toughness).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311429883">1</xref></sup> The low cost, ease of fabricating of complex parts, and isotropic nature are the attractive features leading to the selection of short fiber reinforced composites for large-scale production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311429883">2</xref></sup> Among polymer matrix resins, aromatic polyimide, being widely applicable engineering plastics, exhibits numerous excellent properties such as high mechanical strength, high wear resistance, good thermal stability, high stability under vacuum, good anti-radiation as well as solvent resistance and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429883">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311429883"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311429883"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311429883"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311429883">7</xref></sup> With excellent mechanical property, high flame resistance, high thermal stability, and good resistance to creep, chemicals, and abrasion, etc, PBO fibers are widely used as reinforcement for advanced composites in aeronautical and aerospace applications, protective garments, personnel ballistic armors and many military applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429883">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311429883"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311429883">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>By reinforcing PI with PBO fibers, it might be feasible to develop high performance PBO/PI composite applicable under extreme conditions. The performance of fiber-reinforced polymer composite depends not only on the properties of each component, but also on their interfacial adhesion. The strength of the fiber–matrix interface controls the micromechanics of failure of fiber-reinforced polymer composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311429883">11</xref></sup> During the course of absorbing load, the damage of a composite material originates easily at the interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311429883">12</xref></sup> However, PBO fiber often exhibits poor adhesion to polymers because of the relatively smooth and chemically inactive surface of PBO fiber which prevents efficient chemical and physical bonding in the composite interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311429883">13</xref></sup> Therefore, surface modification of PBO fiber is of great importance to open the broad field of composites for the application of PBO fiber. Effective load transfer from matrix to fiber is essential to reach a high yield of the excellent mechanical and tribological properties of the composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311429883">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much research has been conducted to enhance the adhesion between PBO fiber and polymer. The majority of such efforts were concentrated on increasing fiber–matrix adhesion via the use of surface treatments on PBO fiber. Wu et al. showed that the surface free energy of PBO fiber was significantly increased by acid treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311429883">15</xref></sup> Tamargo-Martinez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311429883">16</xref></sup> investigated the effects of an oxygen plasma treatment on the interfacial shear stress of the PBO fiber-epoxy systems. They found that the quality of the interface or adhesion was improved after the surface treatment. Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311429883">17</xref></sup> employed the methods of argon plasma and argon plasma combined with coupling agents to modify PBO fiber surface. The results showed that the IFSS increased remarkably.</p>
<p>So far, the investigations on tribological properties of PBO fiber-reinforced composites have been still relatively insufficient. In order to enhance the understanding of PBO fiber-reinforced composites and expand its application range, it is very necessary to carry out the research on tribological properties of PBO fiber-reinforced composite materials. In this study, the La salt surface modification was applied in PBO fibers to improve the interfacial adhesion between fibers and matrix, and its effect on flexural and tribological properties of PBO/PI composites was investigated.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311429883"><title>PBO fiber modification</title>
<p>In order to remove the coating on the fiber surfaces, which decreased the surface energy of PBO fibers, PBO fibers were pre-treated by Soxhlet extraction with acetone and ethanol for 12 h in sequence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311429883">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311429883">19</xref></sup> then dried in a vacuum oven at 120°C for 5 h.</p>
<p>The La salt surface modifier consisted of ethanol, LaCl<sub>3</sub>, ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid, ammonium chloride and hydrogen nitrate. The values of La salt concentration were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 wt%, respectively. Then equivalent PBO fibers were immersed in the La salt surface modifier at 20°C for 1 h, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120°C for 5 h, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311429883"><title>Preparation procedure</title>
<p>Composite plates were shaped by the press molding method. PBO fibers (15 vol.%) and PI (85 vol.%) were churned together in a mixer (model type ZSH-0.01 made by Shanghai Kairi Machinery Manufacture Co., Ltd.) uniformly. The rotational speed of churning was 159 rpm. The particle size of PI powder was 0.03 mm. First, the mixture of PBO fibers and PI was introduced into a mold, heated to 350°C at 11 MPa for 115 min to achieve full compression sintering. Then, the material was cooled to room temperature to get the composite. In order to decrease the residual stress produced in the molding process, the composite was kept at a heat treatment temperature of 170°C for 2 h, and was gradually cooled with the cooling rate of 1°C/min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311429883"><title>Testing procedure</title>
<p>The PBO/PI composite plates were cut into rectangular section specimens in accordance with the Chinese standard GB/T9341-2000. The three-point bending tests were carried out on a computer controlled Universal Testing Machine (Made in China) at 20°C. Tests were carried at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. All the values were averages of at least five measurements.</p>
<p>Friction and wear tests were performed on a reciprocating ball-on-block UMT-2MT tribometer (Center for Tribology Inc., California, USA) at 20°C with a relative humidity of 45–55% under dry sliding condition. The main part of the apparatus is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311429883">Figure 2</xref>. Test blocks (30 mm × 20 mm × 6 mm) were made of the above-mentioned PBO/PI composites. A GCr15 steel ball of hardness HRC 58-61 with a diameter of 3 mm was used as the counterpart. Before each test, the surface roughness Ra of counterpart, polished by a fine grade SiC emery paper and cleaned ultrasonically with acetone-dipped cotton, was about 0.1 µm. The tests were conducted at the reciprocating sliding frequency 1 and 4 Hz with a constant load of 6 N. The stroke length was 5 mm. Each test lasted for 120 min. The friction coefficient was recorded automatically and evaluated with the average value of those in the last 30 min. The cross-section of the wear scars was measured by a surface profilometer (Model 2206, Harbin Measuring &amp; Cutting Tool Group Co. Ltd, China). The wear volume of the specimen was calculated by the equation <italic>V</italic> = <italic>Sl</italic>, where <italic>V</italic> is the wear volume (mm<sup>3</sup>), <italic>S</italic> is the area of cross-section (mm<sup>2</sup>), and <italic>l</italic> is the stroke length (m). The specific wear rate of composite was calculated by the equation <italic>K</italic> = <italic>V</italic>/<italic>LF</italic>, where <italic>L</italic> is the total sliding distance (m), and <italic>F</italic> is the applied load (N). The worn surfaces of PBO/PI composites were investigated with scanning electron microscope (SEM).

<p>The surface chemical compositions of PBO fiber before and after treatment were investigated by a PHI-5702 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). During the XPS analysis, a 250 -W Al Ka line (hv = 148,616 eV) was used, the pass energy was 29.350 eV and the binding energy of C1s (284.6 eV) was used as internal standard.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0021998311429883"><title>Flexural properties</title>
<p>Flexural fracturing process of PBO/PI composite was complicated. It depended on fiber content, fiber direction, preparation process, interfacial bond strength, etc. In the series of parallel tests, only the surface characteristics of fibers were modified, on condition that other process conditions remained unchanged. The compressive stress was mainly borne by PI matrix, while the tensile stress was transferred from PI matrix to PBO fibers through interfacial adhesion. When the tensile stress of PBO fibers was more than the interfacial bonding force, the interfacial debonding began to occur, and PBO fibers began to be pulled out. When the interfacial adhesion was improved to exceed the matrix strength, the interfacial debonding gradually decreased and the matrix damage gradually increased.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429883">Figure 3</xref> represents the effect of flexural strength and flexural modulus of La salt treated PBO/PI composites as a function of La salt concentration. The result indicated that the flexural strength and flexural modulus increased with the increase of La salt concentration when La salt concentration was less than 0.6 wt%. The maximum values of flexural strength and modulus were obtained at 0.6 wt% La salt concentration, reaching the value of 182.6 MPa and 6.182 GPa,enhancing about 20.69% and 9.79%, respectively compared with the untreated (La salt wt% = 0).

<p>The La atom carries large effective nuclear charge, thus making itself able to attract surrounding electrons of other atoms. The mechanism of La salt modification includes the following two aspects:
<list id="list1-0021998311429883" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Some La atoms can be adsorbed to PBO fiber surface by reacting with the polar groups on PBO fiber surface, while other La atoms can form active centers in the fiber surface defects. Due to the large coordination number of La element, the La atom continues to react with reactive functional groups (such as carboxyl (−COOH) and amino (−NH2) groups) in the La salt surface modifier. As a result, the concentration of reactive functional groups on fiber surface is increased through a method similar to chemical grafting. So, the compatibility between PBO fibers and PI matrix is improved. The schematic diagram of concentration increase of reactive functional groups on fiber surface is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429883">Figure 4</xref>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>La atoms are capable of coordination reaction with the end group of PBO molecule. As the multiple coordination of La element, La atoms, which do not completely make coordination chemical reactions, can continue to react with functional groups of polymers (such as sulfonic groups (−SO<sub>2</sub>−) and carbonyl groups (C = O) on PI). The schematic diagram of the improvement of interfacial adhesion is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429883">Figure 5</xref>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig4-0021998311429883" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The schematic diagram of concentration increase of reactive functional groups on PBO fiber surface.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429883-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig5-0021998311429883" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The schematic diagram of the improvement of interfacial adhesion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429883-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Since the electronic energy of La atom in 4f electronic shell is equivalent to that in 6 s electronic shell, the electron is liable to move between these two electronic shells. Thus, coordinating bondings between La atoms and PBO fibers, as well as coordinating bondings between La atoms and PI matrix, have some flexibility. The flexible interfacial structure between PBO fibers and PI matrix consumes much energy before the damage of PBO/PI composite, and stops the further development of the interfacial crack. Therefore, La salt surface treatment can strengthen the interfacial flexibility between PBO fibers and PI matrix. In other words, the interfacial adhesion of the composite is improved through La salt surface treatment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429883">Figure 6</xref> shows typical SEM images of the fractured surface generated by three-point bending tests. The bend of specimens induced tensile stresses that promoted de-bonding between fibers and the matrix. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429883">Figure 6</xref>(a) shows that the surface of PBO fibers was smooth. A few cavities appeared in PI matrix after easy pull-out of fibers. This meant that the interfacial adhesion between PBO fibers and PI matrix was quite poor. The interfacial adhesion was improved considerably in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429883">Figure 6</xref>(b). It could be seen that the gaps between PBO fibers and PI matrix were very small. The bonding strength between fibers and matrix was enhanced. With the increase of La salt concentration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429883">Figure 6</xref>(c), the PBO fibers could be found to generate deformation which was caused by the load transferred from PI matrix. There almost were no gaps between PBO fibers and PI matrix. The interfacial adhesion between the PBO fibers and PI matrix became much stronger. This meant the load was effectively transmitted from the PI matrix to PBO fibers due to the powerful interfacial adhesion, and PBO fibers could successfully carry the load. However, with continuing increase in La salt concentration, the gaps between PBO fibers and matrix PI matrix increased, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429883">Figure 6</xref>(d).
<fig id="fig6-0021998311429883" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The SEM images of the fractured surfaces treated by different La salt concentrations: (a) 0% La salt concentration, (b) 0.4% La salt concentration, (c) 0.6% La salt concentration, (d) 0.8% La salt concentration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429883-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Principles of optimal La salt concentration can be explained by the schematic diagram of interface structure of La salt treated PBO/PI composites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311429883">Figure 7</xref>. When La salt concentration is low, the interpenetrating web formed by La and PI is thin, which do not make significant effect on the role of strengthening. Though PI matrix can permeate the web easily, there is no effective adhesion in the interface of PBO/PI because of scarce La monomolecular layer in surface of PBO fibers, which results in small quantity of effective chemical bonds. When La salt concentration is high, the interpenetrating web is thick, which prevent PI matrix from permeating. The precipitated La salt crystals are introduced into the interface layer as impurities, which form internal defects and affect the flexural properties of the PBO/PI composite. When La salt concentration is appropriate, the thickness of interpenetrating web is moderate, which not only make significant effect on the role of strengthening, but also let PI matrix permeate the mixed layer. La monomolecular layer cover the surface of PBO fibers completely, improving the interfacial adhesion between PBO fibers and the PI matrix effectively.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311429883">Figure 8</xref> shows friction coefficient of the PBO/PI composites treated by different La salt concentrations under the load of 6 N and reciprocating sliding frequency of 1 and 4 Hz, respectively. Friction coefficient of the PBO/PI composites treated by different La salt concentrations decreased with increasing sliding frequency. The increase of reciprocating sliding frequency caused the friction-induced thermal effect, which might enhance the activity of molecular chain of PI. Thus, the molecular chain of PI could arrange along the direction of shear force easily, which would decrease the friction. At the same sliding frequency, the 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO/PI composite had the lowest friction coefficient.

Specific wear rate of the PBO/PI composites treated by different La salt concentrations increased with increasing sliding frequency. There was not obvious difference in wear rate at low sliding frequency. On the one hand, the low sliding frequency was not liable to result in the fatigue wear of PBO/PI composite. On the other hand, when the temperature was low, the friction surface rarely demonstrated softening and plastic flow, and the PI matrix strength did not decrease significantly. Therefore, the interfacial strength of PBO/PI composite had little effect on the specific wear rate at low sliding frequency. At high sliding frequency, the 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO/PI composite had the lowest specific wear rate. This indicated that the 0.6 wt% La salt treatment could improve wear-resistance of PBO/PI composite effectively.

The worn surface of 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO/PI composite was smooth, and the PI matrix combined the PBO fibers well, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311429883">Figure 10</xref>(c). This indicated that there was a strong interfacial adhesion between PBO fibers and PI matrix after 0.6 wt% La salt surface treatment, which could prevent the fibers detaching from the matrix and reduce the wear of composite. However, the wear of PBO/PI composite was aggravated with continuing increase in La salt concentration, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311429883">Figure 10</xref>(d).

<p>The surface oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios obtained from XPS on the surface of untreated and 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO fibers are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429883">Table 2</xref>. The untreated fiber displayed the value of O/C ratio 18.26% and 0.6 wt% La salt treated fiber showed the value of O/C ratio 45.47%. This might result from 0.6 wt% La salt treatment introducing the polar groups onto the surface of PBO fiber. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311429883">Figure 11</xref> represents XPS spectra of the C 1s region of untreated and 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO fibers. On the C 1s spectra of 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO fibers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311429883">Figure 11</xref>(b), the acromion of carboxyl groups, which was at the binging energy of 289.2 eV, was much higher and more obvious than that of untreated PBO fibers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311429883">Figure 11</xref>(a), meaning a large increase in the amount of carboxyl groups after 0.6 wt% La salt treatment.

<p>From the XPS results, it could be inferred that 0.6 wt% La salt treatment increased the amount of carboxyl groups on PBO fiber surface, which was the most decisive contribution to improve the adhesion between PBO fibers and PI matrix. Accordingly, the flexural and tribological properties of PBO/PI composite were improved.</p>

<p>In this study, the effect of La salt treatment on flexural and tribological properties of PI composite reinforced by PBO fibers was investigated. The results indicated that the O/C ratio of 0.6 wt% La salt treated PBO fiber was larger than that of untreated, accordingly the interfacial adhesion between PBO fibers and PI matrix was significantly improved. The parameter of the La salt concentration in modifier played a very important role in improving flexural properties of PBO/PI composite. The optimal concentration of La salt was fixed at 0.6 wt%. The strong interfacial bonding of the composite also made PBO fibers difficult to be detached from the PI matrix and improved the wear-resistance of PBO/PI composite effectively.</p>
