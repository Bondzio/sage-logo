<abstract>
<p>This study examined peer crowds in the Singapore context. A total of 598 Secondary 1 and 2 adolescents were asked to identify the crowds they perceived to exist in their schools and to describe these crowds’ characteristics. The adolescents had no difficulty identifying crowds, generating a total of 1,534 crowds. Among the crowds identified, seven major crowds (nerd, gangster, athlete, joker, computer geek, ordinary, loner) emerged, some perceived as more similar to each other and others as almost direct opposites of one another. These crowds showed both similarities with and differences from typical American crowds. Results also suggest that crowds in the Singapore context reflect more of adolescents’ increased cognitive abilities than challenges arising from negotiating a larger peer world.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of peer crowds in the American adolescent’s social world is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X10388220">Brown, 2004</xref>). Indeed, crowds, which are reputation-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X10388220">Brown, 1990</xref>) and formed more in terms of dispositions rather than actual patterns of behavior and/or interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X10388220">Brown, 2004</xref>), are regarded as ubiquitous, at least in White American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X10388220">Prinstein &amp; La Greca, 2002</xref>). Crowds facilitate identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0044118X10388220">Brown &amp; Lohr, 1987</xref>) and provide an important roadmap for negotiating the enlarged peer world accompanying the transition from (smaller) elementary to (larger) secondary (middle or junior high) schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X10388220">Brown, Mory, &amp; Kinney, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Extensive research on American peer crowds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X10388220">Brown, Eicher, &amp; Petrie, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X10388220">La Greca, Prinstein, &amp; Fetter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X10388220">Urberg, 1992</xref>) has revealed the multiplicity of crowds in the American school setting. However, although there are variations in the crowds present in a specific school setting, some crowds do consistently appear across time and space; these include the <italic>popular</italic> crowd (comprising high-status adolescents who lead social activities), the <italic>jock</italic> crowd (comprising athletically oriented adolescents), the <italic>brain</italic> crowd (comprising intellectually oriented adolescents), the <italic>nerd</italic> crowd (comprising adolescents who have little or no social skills) and the <italic>delinquent</italic> or <italic>druggie</italic> crowd (comprising adolescents known for illicit drug use and/or other delinquent activities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X10388220">Brown &amp; Mounts, 1989</xref>). In addition, in multiethnic schools, there are also ethnic-based crowds, such as the <italic>rapper</italic> or <italic>Black</italic> crowd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X10388220">Brown &amp; Mounts, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of how adolescents identify and characterize crowds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone and Brown (1998</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X10388220">Brown, Lohr, &amp; Trujillo, 1990</xref>) list six attributes that adolescents use. Across various settings, crowds are identified and characterized in terms of (a) academic attitudes, (b) participation in school extracurricular activities, (c) school hangouts, (d) dress and grooming styles, (e) sociability, and (f) typical weekend activities. Amalgamating across these attributes, <italic>populars</italic> are typified as enjoying and trying hard in academic pursuits, participating actively in extracurricular activities, stylish in dress and grooming, cliquish in terms of sociability, and attending social parties on weekends. However, <italic>brains</italic> are seen as enjoying and trying hard in academic pursuits, moderately involved in extracurricular participation, neat and clean in dress and grooming, not relating to others outside their group, and not having weekend activities.</p>
<p>Although much research has been done on crowds in American settings, less is known about peer crowds in other cultures. Some research has been done in the United Kingdom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X10388220">Clarke, Hall, Jefferson, &amp; Roberts, 1976</xref>) and, more recently, in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X10388220">Verkooijen, de Vries, &amp; Nielsen, 2007</xref>) and the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X10388220">Delsing, ter Bogt, Engels, &amp; Meeus, 2007</xref>). As far as we know, however, there has been no research on crowds in non-Western cultures and particularly in an Asian culture like Singapore. Beyond extending research to a different cultural context, Singapore provides an interesting context for the study of peer crowds because of its similarities with and differences from the United States. Like the United States, Singapore is a multiethnic society, with the majority ethnic group in Singapore being the Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X10388220">Leow, 2001</xref>). This makes Singapore a point of useful contrast against other typically studied Chinese societies (e.g., China, Hong Kong, Taiwan) where homogeneity rather than heterogeneity is more the norm. The ethnic heterogeneity in Singapore also allows for the possibility of ethnic-based crowds.</p>
<p>However, Singapore is a far more structured society than American society. All schools, for instance, require students to wear school uniforms and have strict rules regarding hairstyles, which raises questions of how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone and Brown’s (1998)</xref> attribute of dress and grooming styles applies. Moreover, students in Singapore are allocated to form (or home) classes, where they remain for the entire school year. These form classes typically contain students of similar abilities and they mostly remain in specific locales throughout the school day, although teachers move from classroom to classroom at different times to teach their academic subjects. Such a setup points toward peer interactions that are primarily with a relatively homogeneous set of peers and could therefore potentially obviate the existence of crowds. Furthermore, the purpose of crowds serving as a roadmap for negotiating the enlarged peer environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X10388220">Brown et al., 1994</xref>) may also not apply in the Singapore context because school sizes in Singapore—whether primary or secondary school—typically do not vary much.</p>
<p>The present study was therefore conducted with a focus on whether peer crowds are perceived to exist in the Singapore context and, if so, how members of each crowd are identified and characterized.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0044118X10388220">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited a total of 598 participants (315 male, 282 female, 1 without indication) from two Singapore coeducational schools. Of these, 46% were from Secondary 1 (equivalent to Grade 7; average age 13) and 54% were from Secondary 2 (equivalent to Grade 8; average age 14). These participants came from two academic (or ability) streams, with 64% from a “more able” stream and 36% from a “less able” stream.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0044118X10388220">1</xref></sup> As schools could choose whether to participate or not, our two participating schools were necessarily not randomly selected, and our sample is unlikely to be representative of all Secondary 1 and 2 students. However, the ethnic composition of our sample approximated the Singapore population, with 74% Chinese (population figure is 78%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X10388220">Leow, 2001</xref>), 10% Malay (14%), 13% Indian (8%), and 3% categorized as Others (1%).</p>
<p>The majority of the participants came from two-parent families (88%), with a small number from single-parent families (9%). We assessed the socioeconomic status of our sample with two indicators—father’s education and monthly family income. Among the fathers of our participants, 32% had primary education or less, 24% had secondary education, and 44% had postsecondary education or above. Approximately 61% of the participants reported a monthly family income of at least S$2,000, which compares rather favorably with the median income of around S$2,200 in the Singapore population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X10388220">Leow, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The measures used in our study were compiled into a questionnaire and administered in school settings. We collected the data from both schools toward the end of the school year to ensure that there was sufficient time for participants to acclimatize to the school environment and, in particular, to have a reasonably stable sense of the crowds in their schools. This was especially important for the Secondary 1 participants, who would typically be entering a new (secondary) school setting. In Singapore, the Ministry of Education and school principals act <italic>in loco parentis</italic>. Thus, permission was sought and obtained only from these two authorities (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X10388220">Sim &amp; Koh, 2003</xref>). However, in the actual conduct of the study, the voluntary nature of participation was emphasized.</p>

<sec id="section4-0044118X10388220">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>For the purpose of identifying perceived crowds, we followed Stone and Brown’s approach (1998) and asked participants to think of the various groups in their schools, defining a <italic>group</italic> as “students who act the same way or do the same things, whether they hang out around each other or not.” We first asked participants to give their own labels for each group they identified and provide a one-sentence description of the main feature/characteristic of that group. We then asked participants to describe features of each group along the six attributes listed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone and Brown (1998</xref>). To further elaborate each attribute, we included detailed prompts (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone &amp; Brown, 1998</xref>): for <italic>academic attitudes</italic>, we asked about (a) group members’ participation in class and how they felt about (b) school work, (c) examinations, and (d) learning in general; for <italic>participation in school cocurricular activities</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0044118X10388220">2</xref></sup> we asked about (a) how group members felt about such participation, (b) the type of activities they participated in, and (c) how active they were in these activities; for <italic>hangouts at school</italic>, we asked about (a) the group’s hangout areas in school and what they did at those hangouts as well as (b) the group’s hangout areas after school and what they did there; for <italic>dress and grooming styles</italic>, we asked about (a) how group members wore their school uniforms (as all had to wear uniforms), (b) their hairstyles, and (c) how they dressed when they went out; for <italic>sociability</italic>, we asked about (a) the manner in which group members related to students outside their group and (b) the languages that they used; and for <italic>typical weekend activities</italic>, we asked about (a) where the group usually went and (b) what they usually did there.</p>

<title>Identification of Crowds</title>
<p>The answer to our question of whether crowds exist in the Singapore context was an unequivocal yes. Participants had no difficulty identifying and describing the crowds they perceived to exist in their school; in all, participants generated 1,534 crowd identifications. Each participant identified an average of four crowds, with half the participants (52%) actually identifying five crowds.</p>
<p>To get a glimpse of some of the mechanisms that may underlie crowd identification, we examined how the number of crowds identified varied across the variables of gender, secondary level (as a proxy for development), and academic stream (as a proxy for sociocognitive ability). A 2 (Gender: female vs. male) × 2 (Level: Secondary 1 vs. Secondary 2) × 2 (Stream: more able vs. less able) between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, with number of crowd identifications as the outcome of interest.</p>
<p>Results from the ANOVA revealed a three-way interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 410) = 9.93, <italic>MSE</italic> = 2.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This effect subsumed two 2-way interactions (gender by level and stream by level), as well as all three main effects. Follow-up analyses done to deconstruct the three-way interaction revealed that for boys, there was a stream effect, <italic>F</italic>(1, 218) = 11.17, <italic>MSE</italic> = 3.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. More able boys (<italic>M</italic> = 3.77; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.62) identified more crowds than their less able counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 2.92; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.09). For girls, an interaction between level and stream emerged, <italic>F</italic>(1, 192) = 40.06, <italic>MSE</italic> = 1.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Follow-up simple effect tests showed that more able Secondary 1 girls (<italic>M</italic> = 4.38; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17) identified more crowds than their less able counterparts (<italic>M</italic> = 1.91; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.81), <italic>t</italic>(96) = 8.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but no differences between more able (<italic>M</italic> = 4.11; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42) and less able (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.10) Secondary 2 girls. Simple effect tests also showed that less able Secondary 2 girls identified more crowds than their Secondary 1 counterparts but no level differences among the more able girls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0044118X10388220">
<title>Typology of Crowds</title>
<p>To organize these identifications and minimize problems related to the use of open-ended questions (e.g., different labeling, whereby crowds sharing similar features are given different labels), we transcribed the open-ended responses and recorded them into thematic units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X10388220">Krippendorf, 1980</xref>), paying close attention to retaining participants’ original and varied responses. These thematic units, together with the labels participants gave to their crowds and one-sentence descriptions of the main feature/characteristic of each crowd, were used to identify specific crowds.</p>
<p>From all the crowds identified, seven major crowds emerged. The two most prominent crowds were the <italic>nerd</italic> crowd and the <italic>gangster</italic> crowd, both these crowds emerging in about one third (32%) of the identifications. Other labels used for the nerd crowd included “brainies,” “intellectuals,” and “hardworking,” whereas the gangster crowd subsumed labels such as <italic>ah lians</italic> (a colloquial term for gangster-like girls), <italic>ah bengs</italic> (a colloquial term for gangster-like boys), “smokers,” and “bullies.” The next two other crowds emerged in around one tenth of the identifications. The <italic>athlete</italic> crowd (13%) subsumed labels such as “sporty people,” “soccer players,” and “basketball players,” whereas the <italic>joker</italic> crowd (10%) subsumed labels such as “lamers.” These crowds were followed by three other less prominent crowds: the <italic>computer geek</italic> crowd (5% of identifications), which included “dota players,” “gamers,” and “maplers”; the <italic>ordinary</italic> crowd (5% of identifications), which included “average”; and the <italic>loner</italic> crowd (3% of identifications), which included “quiets.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0044118X10388220">Table 1</xref> presents the different characteristics of the seven crowds as described by our participants. Not surprisingly, <italic>nerds</italic> stood out from the other crowds for their positive academic attitudes. They were described as regarding learning as enjoyable and important, schoolwork as necessary and important, and the passing of examinations as very important. They were also described as active in class participation as well as in cocurricular activities, with these activities seen as being deemed important. In school, their main hangout area was perceived to be the library, which was also seen as a hangout area after school (besides the home). Hanging out at the library or staying at home was described as their typical weekend activities. In terms of dress and grooming styles, they were described as neat and proper both in school and on weekends. In terms of sociability, they were perceived as friendly and conversing in English when relating to others.</p>

<p>The <italic>gangsters</italic> provided a rather stark contrast to the nerds. In terms of school attitudes, gangsters were described as regarding learning, schoolwork, and the passing of examinations as a waste of time. Not surprisingly, they were described as not participating in class. They were also described as seeing participation in cocurricular activities as a waste of time and, not surprisingly, were seen as not at all active in their participation in such activities (even though schools often require students to participate in at least one cocurricular activity). This lack of compliance with school requirements was also reflected in how their dressing and grooming were described, messy in how they wore their school uniforms and often coloring their hair (even though this was against school rules). Gangsters were perceived to have a distinct school hangout area—the school toilet—and relating to others in a distinct manner, being harsh in how they related to others and using dialect when relating to them. Their perceived hangout areas after school included arcades and shopping malls as well as void decks (open areas on the ground level of public apartments), whereas their weekend activities were seen as comprising hanging out at arcades and shopping malls.</p>
<p>The defining attribute of the <italic>athletes</italic> was their perceived active participation in sports cocurricular activities and the high regard they were seen to have for such participation. Not surprisingly, their perceived hangout areas during and after school as well as for weekend activities were sports related. On other attributes, athletes were perceived as representing some sort of intermediate crowd between the nerds and the gangsters. Like the nerds, athletes were perceived as friendly and using English when relating to others. However, a tinge of perceived noncompliance also surfaced, with a small minority (but more so than any other crowd except the gangster crowd) being described as having colored hair. With regard to academic attitudes, athletes spanned a range of responses; whereas the majority were described as regarding learning, schoolwork, and the passing of examinations as at least “quite important,” a substantial number were also described as regarding learning and schoolwork as a waste of time.</p>
<p>The <italic>jokers</italic> were probably best defined by their description as “funny,” although this was not the only way they were seen to relate to others. They were perceived as preferring to hang out at the school canteen, although the ordinary crowd was also perceived to hang out there. Schoolwise, they were described as having a mixture of attitudes. On one hand, they were described as active in class participation. On the other hand, they were perceived as having varied attitudes toward learning and a substantial number were described as regarding learning, schoolwork, and passing of examinations as a waste of time.</p>
<p>The key feature of the <italic>loners</italic> was their perceived “quiet” manner of relating to others. Not surprisingly, they were described as not participating in class. However, unlike the gangsters who were also described as not participating in class, the loners were seen as having more positive academic attitudes. They were perceived as regarding the passing of examinations as very important and regarding schoolwork and learning as at least quite important. Beyond academic attitudes, perceptions of the loners tended to share many other similarities with those for the nerds. Participation in cocurricular activities, for instance, was described as important, although level of participation was perceived to range from very active to not at all active. Loners were also perceived to hang out at the library in school and in the library or at home after school, whereas hanging out at the library or staying at home was also described as comprising their typical weekend activities. Like the nerds, loners were perceived as dressing neatly and properly, both in school and on weekends.</p>
<p>As with the athletes, the defining feature of the <italic>computer geeks</italic> had to do with their interests. Thus, their perceived hangout area in school was easily defined—the computer laboratory or classroom. Likewise, local area network (LAN) shops—where computer games are easily accessible—were perceived clearly to be their hangout areas after school and where their typical weekend activities took place. Computer geeks were seen as friendly but as possessing less positive school attitudes, with the majority being described as seeing schoolwork and learning, as well as participation in cocurricular activities, as a waste of time.</p>
<p>The <italic>ordinaries</italic> shared many descriptions with the other crowds. Like the nerds and jokers, they were described as active in class participation. Like the nerds, athletes, and loners, they were seen as regarding participation in cocurricular activities as important. They were perceived as hanging out at the school canteen, as with the jokers. They were described as neat and proper in how they wore their school uniforms, as with the nerds and loners. Like the nerds, athletes, and computer geeks, they were perceived to be friendly. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the ordinaries was that many were perceived as tending to use a mixture of English and their mother tongue for communication with others, although a substantial number were perceived as using only English.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the phenomenon of peer crowds in the Singapore context, focusing on how members of these crowds are identified and characterized. Results provide clear evidence that peer crowds do exist in the Singapore context, at least in the minds of our adolescent participants. In all, seven major crowds—nerd, gangster, athlete, computer geek, joker, ordinary, and loner—were identified through one or more of the attributes of academic attitudes, participation in school extracurricular activities, school hangouts, dress and grooming styles, sociability, and typical weekend activities.</p>
<p>The identification of these different crowds indicates that, as in the United States and other Western countries, there are also multiple peer cultures in Singapore schools, each with distinctive features. Similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone and Brown (1998</xref>), there are crowds that share many similarities with each other (e.g., the nerd and loner crowds) and there are crowds that are almost direct opposites of each other (e.g., the nerd and gangster crowds). Similarly, some crowds (e.g., the nerd crowd) are more adult oriented or “mainstream or conventional” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X10388220">Delsing et al., 2007</xref>, p. 477), with desirable inclinations (e.g., subscribing to the value of education), whereas other crowds (e.g., the gangster crowd) are more antiestablishment, with deviant inclinations (e.g., coloring their hair in defiance of school regulations). In between are crowds (athletes, computer geeks, jokers, and ordinaries) that do not appear overly antiestablishment or adult oriented.</p>
<p>Comparing the specific crowds identified in our study with typical American crowds, there are similarities and differences. Our nerd, gangster, athlete, and loner crowds parallel the brain, delinquent, jock, and nerd crowds typically found in American schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X10388220">Brown &amp; Mounts, 1989</xref>), although different labels are used probably because of colloquial preferences. It is interesting to note, however, that the nerd label is used in both cultures but applies differently in each culture. Although it is used to describe socially inept adolescents in American culture, our Singapore adolescents used the label to categorize peers seen as academically oriented as opposed to lacking in interaction skills. There is thus less of a negative connotation attached to the nerd label in Singapore, which is likely a reflection of the value of academic achievement in Singapore and the prevailing academic ethos in Singapore schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X10388220">Sim, 2003</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X10388220">Paneque (2004)</xref> has noted, Singapore adolescents’ “primary responsibility is to study and do well so they can be productive citizens in the future” (p. 203).</p>
<p>Two noteworthy differences are apparent between the crowds identified in our study and typical American crowds. First, although the jock crowd is typically the most prominent in American schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X10388220">Stone &amp; Brown, 1998</xref>), our athlete crowd only emerged a distant third in identifications (behind the nerd and gangster crowds). This difference once again points to macrosystem and chronosystem differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X10388220">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>) between the United States and Singapore. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X10388220">Sim (2003)</xref>, Singapore has long been noted for its emphasis on academic achievement and only in recent years has there been an increased emphasis on sports. Given the Confucian ethic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X10388220">Liu, Wang, &amp; Parkins, 2005</xref>) in Singapore society—where hierarchies of authority (parent over child) and values of filial piety are pervasive—it is not surprising that Singapore adolescents tend to see academic pursuits, rather than athletic ones, as representing their “duty to family and society” that “prevails in their daily lives and their goals and dreams for the future” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X10388220">Paneque, 2004</xref>, p. 203).</p>
<p>Second, the consistently identified popular crowd in American schools did not emerge in our study. One possible explanation here is that the culture of partying and other social activities most associated with the popular crowd are not prominent—or at least not yet prominent—among Singapore adolescents. It is also possible that this lack of a popular crowd is specific to our nonrandom sample, although this seems less likely as many other American-like crowds did emerge. From a different perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X10388220">Milner (2004)</xref> raises the possibility that ethnically heterogeneous (or pluralistic) schools—which most Singapore schools are—are less likely to see the popular crowd. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X10388220">Milner (2004)</xref> notes that in the United States, the popular crowd in particular may be on the decline as schools become more pluralistic both in terms of ethnicity and lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were also no ethnic-based crowds identified in our study. This is likely due to the efforts put in by the Singapore authorities to enhance interethnic harmony, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X10388220">Ho and Chia (2006</xref>, p. 128) describe as Singapore’s “founding principle.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X10388220">Ho and Chia (2006)</xref> further document that 66% of the youth in their national sample reported having close friends of a different race, a 15% point increase from a similar study conducted earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X10388220">Ho &amp; Yip, 2003</xref>). It is not implausible that such interethnic integration directly contributes to a lack of ethnic-based crowds.</p>
<p>The ease with which our adolescents identified the crowds in their schools, despite the lack of transiting from an obviously smaller primary to an obviously larger secondary school, points toward crowd identification as less of a mechanism for negotiating a larger peer world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X10388220">Brown et al., 1994</xref>) and more of an indication of the increasingly sophisticated cognitive abilities of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X10388220">Keating, 2004</xref>). This possibility is further evidenced by results showing that more able boys and more able Secondary 1 girls identified more crowds than their respective counterparts. In the same vein, more crowds were identified by less able Secondary 2 girls than their Secondary 1 counterparts.</p>
<p>Several caveats and limitations should be noted about our present study. First, we acknowledge that this crowd identification study is not original. However, as far as we know, this is the first study seeking to identify the crowds that may be present in the Asian, let alone Singapore, context. Second, our open-ended survey approach is not the most sophisticated or sensitive for identifying crowds or members of crowds. Recent studies on crowds have used established measures (e.g., the Peer Crowd Identification Questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X10388220">Ter Bogt, 2001</xref>), although it should be noted that these were developed and established for specific cultures and are unlikely to apply to a context like Singapore. Third, although some of our crowds parallel those found in the United States, we make no claim that these crowds are therefore universally present. Indeed, they may arise from the similar ways in which school systems in Singapore and the United States are structured. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X10388220">Milner (2004)</xref> notes, some societies—unlike Singapore and the United States—have schools that do not have extracurricular activities or where sports and other athletic endeavors are outside the school system. It remains to be seen how, or even whether, a crowd such as the athletic or jock crowd would present itself in such societies.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, this study has found the presence of crowds among our Singapore adolescents. Seven crowds were identified, with some perceived as more similar to each other and others perceived as almost direct opposites of one another. Our sample is probably not representative, so our conclusions need to be tempered accordingly. However, we hope that our study has contributed to a better understanding of adolescent peer relationships in Singapore as well as surfaced some useful points of agreement and points of contrast in understanding crowds in the Singapore context vis-à-vis those in the United States.</p>

<p>In Singapore, academic (or ability) streaming occurs at the end of primary or Grade 6 through a national-level examination, with scores obtained in this examination being used to place students in different academic streams to begin secondary education.</p>
