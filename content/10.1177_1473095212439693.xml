<abstract>
<p>The language of relational geography now permeates the field and literature of planning, with phrases such as ‘fuzzy boundaries’ and ‘flows and networks’ being commonly used to express the complexity of socio-economic and governance relations. However, recent research suggests the so-called ‘relational turn’ is not only far from complete, but is unable to account for the bounded reality of urban processes.</p>
<p>Following from these debates, this article seeks to redirect the study of urban change away from relational and absolute interpretations of space in favour of a more robust consideration and critical reflection on the social production of city-regions. Towards this objective, the author introduces an approach situated within Lefebvre’s <italic>The Production of Space</italic> to examine strategies of metropolitan regionalism in the Capital District, New York (United States). Interpreting the city-region as a social product reflecting the co-constitutive relationship of conceived, perceived and lived space spatial elements, the paper argues that the silences of lived space within metropolitan regionalism are indicative of a post-political condition where hegemonic vision, discourse and ideology deny a robust urban democracy. It is this ability to engage with the dynamism of social change and the relationships between spaces which makes Lefebvre’s spatial theory immensely valuable for the study of emerging and shifting structures of governance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article is concerned with the politics and spatiality of metropolitan governance. In recent years, a great deal of attention has been placed on the resurgence of metropolitan and city-regional areas as key territorial forms of governance collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095212439693">Etherington and Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095212439693">Neuman and Hull, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095212439693">Rodriguez-Pose, 2008</xref>). Situated within the literature on the new regionalism, during the late 1990s and early 2000s these urban areas were commonly framed as localised points of socio-economic activity critical for global economic competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095212439693">Scott, 2001</xref>). Subsequent readings turned to the social construction of these arrangements, including an interest in examining the influence of localised politics upon the nature of specific instances of city-regionalism.</p>
<p>Traversing much of this recent work is a relational interpretation of space and a concomitant engagement with the conceptual tropes of ‘flows and networks’ and ‘fuzziness’. In contrast to Euclidian interpretations which see space as a physical surface or container, relational perspectives are focused on the diversity of socio-economic webs and relations that traverse urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212439693">Healey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212439693">Massey, 2005</xref>). However, recent research suggests that planning practice and political mobilisation more generally have steadfastly retained their Euclidian or absolute conceptions of space, often tied to traditional institutional frameworks such as political and jurisdictional boundaries. Davoudi notes widespread difficulty ‘translating post-structuralism. . .into the realm of contemporary planning practices’ as well as an ‘enduring positivism’ which seems to contradict the transition towards relational geographic perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212439693">2009</xref>: 242). The implication for planning, it is argued, is an unfortunate and growing disconnect between theory and practice. Following these debates, it is a critical moment to rethink and re-engage with the conceptual foundations of spatial politics with regard to planning. However, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095212439693">Jones (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212439693">Morgan (2007)</xref>, the paper argues that we must avoid a view of space which is framed by a dichotomy of absolute and relational concepts and freshly consider the nature of urban change in complex urban areas.</p>
<p>Towards this objective, the article examines recent metropolitan strategies in the Capital District, New York (USA) through an approach framed by Lefebvre’s <italic>The Production of Space</italic>. Interpreting the city-region as the product of the interrelationship between conceived, lived and perceived spaces, the research advances the study of metropolitan regionalism by situating representations of the metropolitan elite – planners, politicians, economic developers and other stakeholders – as part of an ongoing process of social and cultural change. Moreover, engagement with Lefebvre’s spatial theory provides a means through which to expand the study of metropolitan regionalism away from the city-region as ‘object’ and towards a critical reflection on the politics and constraints of metropolitan regionalism.</p>
<p>In the next section the article provides a brief background on Lefebvre’s conceptualisation of space and recent debates related to ‘thinking relationally’ in planning and other related disciplines. This is followed by presentation of a method for understanding urban change in city-regions based on <italic>The Production of Space</italic>. The method is subsequently mobilised to examine the Capital District case study. The paper concludes with a brief summary of findings, reflecting on the unique insights offered through Lefebvre’s approach and outlining some key challenges towards the emergence of a ‘proper’ metropolitan politics.</p>

<title>Lefebvre’s <italic>The Production of Space</italic> and the turn to social constructivism in city-region analysis</title>
<p>In <italic>The Production of Space</italic>, Henri Lefebvre offered a comprehensive theory through which to understand relations between space and social change. The book is recognised as Lefebvre’s definitive work on cities and space, a research theme which marked the later stage of the philosopher’s career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>). Penned in France in the early 1970s, the writing was criticised by thinkers such as Manuel Castells and generally overlooked in Lefebvre’s homeland, but was taken up with enthusiasm by urban theorist David Harvey and later Ed Soja, who interpreted and introduced Lefebvre’s ideas on space from this and other texts to an Anglo-American audience.</p>
<p>The translation of <italic>The Production of Space</italic> from French into English in 1991 spawned another wave of academic engagement with Lefebvre’s spatial theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095212439693">Brenner 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212439693">Fyfe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095212439693">McCann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095212439693">Soja, 1996</xref>). These Anglo-American interpretations formed part of a wider paradigmatic shift in human geography, planning and urban studies towards a post-structuralist understanding which saw space, including areas such as city-regions, as socially constructed and relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212439693">Marston, 2000</xref>). Recent engagement with <italic>The Production of Space</italic> reflects the continued relevance and appeal of Lefebvre’s theories across an array of disciplines (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095212439693">Allen and Crookes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212439693">Butler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212439693">Carp, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212439693">Healey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212439693">Leary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095212439693">Rogerson and Rice, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1473095212439693">Vallance et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212439693">Wells, 2007</xref>). The overriding connection between many of these recent works is an interest in approaching the analysis of cities from the perspective of Lefebvre’s triple dialectic. In this paper, the author extends existing planning scholarship by showing how Lefebvre’s triadic approach (applied here to analyse a real-life instance of metropolitan regionalism) can help escape the constraints of dualistic interpretations of space and steer research towards more nuanced examinations of urban change.</p>
<p>For Lefebvre, any effort to understand space must come to terms with the idea that space and time are ‘integral aspects of social practice’ and as social products they can only be understood in specific societal contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">Schmid, 2008</xref>: 29). In this sense, space is not something which exists in itself – such as a platform or an empty vessel into which society is poured – but is instead dynamic, produced through social action and interaction over time. In much contemporary research and writing on city-regions (and urban studies more generally) this notion of social constructivism is taken as ‘given’ and has led to a great deal of interest in the quality of place and the politics of spatial change. For planning, the result has been a definitive shift away from the rational-scientific model to a post-modern engagement with territory and territorial change.</p>
<p>Specifically for the study of city-regions, this transition is demonstrated in the belief that metropolitan spaces do not exist ‘out there’ to be found, but rather are formed by the motives and actions of specific actors and ongoing social events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212439693">Healey, 2009</xref>). Attention to the social construction of city-regions has contributed to an explosion of contextual research narrating the politics of urban change across metropolitan areas including, for example, their political construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">Harrison, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212439693">Healey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212439693">Krueger and Savage, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095212439693">McCann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095212439693">McGuirk, 2007</xref>), governance arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212439693">Brenner, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095212439693">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212439693">Salet and Thornley, 2007</xref>), democratic qualities and implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095212439693">Kübler and Schwab, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212439693">Purcell, 2007</xref>), and their potential to serve as effective spaces for spatial planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212439693">Haughton et al., 2010</xref>). For research targeting metropolitan governance, reading urban space as a social construct has enabled rich investigations and understandings of the complex webs of connectivity which challenge traditional notions of territory and scale. Much of this work seeks to counter earlier interpretations of the city-region as a privileged space in the global economic system and emphasises the situated processes by which these ‘territorial forms are constructed politically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095212439693">Jonas and Ward, 2007</xref>: 170), produced and ‘rendered visible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">Harrison, 2010</xref>: 18). Contrasting arguments for a ‘jurisdictional fix’ with one which advocates a ‘co-produced. . .place-specific development content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212439693">Healey, 2009</xref>: 841), these readings present city-regional space as dynamic sites of contestation that are ‘recast by a constitutive, localized politics of distribution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095212439693">McGuirk, 2007</xref>: 185). This social constructivist interpretation is also evident in Lefebvre’s discussion of social space, a product to be consumed as well as a means of production where ‘networks and flows of raw materials and energy fashion space and are determined by it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 87). In the next section, the paper turns to the relationship between relational geography and metropolitan regionalism. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the shift to relational thinking, but rather, a concise outline of the current debate in the field of planning.</p>

<title>Absolute and relational interpretations of metropolitan space</title>
<p>The city-region is a particularly useful concept through which to explore notions of space, territory, and the social construction of scale and scalar strategies. There is now an extensive literature in the fields of planning, human geography and political science, which narrates over 40 years of governance interest in the challenges facing spatially complex urban areas. In Western Europe and North America, a series of distinct waves of planning practice are commonly identified including the old regionalism (1960s–1970s); Thatcher and Reagan-inspired neoliberalism and laissez-faire approaches of the 1980s; the new regionalism (1990s); and the new city-regionalism (post 2000s). While there is insufficient space in this article to provide detailed summaries of these episodes, it is noteworthy that in the post-war era ‘metropolitan’ or ‘city-region’ concepts have resurfaced time and again as key sites of governance collaboration, often pitched as the scalar fix for critical societal and environmental challenges. This reification of particular scales of administration and regulation has been criticised, however, for an inability to account for the forces which produce particular spatial arrangements including, most notably, historical context and the dimension of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212439693">Davoudi and Strange, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, much contemporary city-regional analysis reflects a relational perspective on space which sees urban areas as consisting of a complex set of overlapping networks. In this view, any particular physical area has, moving through, around and over it, all manner of relations, each with its own distinct space–time dynamics. While there is a long history of relational philosophy, this way of seeing space was only appreciably adopted by planning theory in the 1990s as a means to develop a more robust engagement with the dynamic processes and flows across space – commonly described as a shift away from Euclidian geometric thinking towards ‘thinking space relationally’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095212439693">Jones, 2009</xref> for a recent and thoughtful review of this transition). Alongside the recognition that spaces and scales such as city-regions cannot be taken for granted, this transition implies a need for analytical approaches which stress historically situated, contextual understanding.</p>
<p>In planning research, this has led to a surge of interest in non-traditional governance arrangements often characterised as the soft spaces and fuzzy boundaries of planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095212439693">Allmendinger and Haughton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212439693">Haughton et al., 2010</xref>). For these investigations, relational thinking helps to explain those societal features, including collaborative arrangements, which transcend formal jurisdictional boundaries. However, recent research and literature suggests that the relational turn is far from complete and traditional notions of territory remain ever-crucial to planning practice. For example, looking at city-regions in England, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">Harrison (2010)</xref> noted the resilience of traditional, state-supported notions of territory which have constrained the development of relationally networked spaces. Similarly, in an account of spatial planning efforts across the UK and Ireland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212439693">Davoudi (2009)</xref> found that absolute conceptions of space prevail and that notions of relational geography have only marginally influenced the content of plans. In an Australian context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212439693">Searle and Bunker (2010)</xref> claimed that while there has been a recent shift towards relationally informed metropolitan plans, the more traditional ‘blueprint’ model has proven resilient as stakeholders continue to look to their empowered state governments for ‘planning frameworks and infrastructure that offer the prospect of greater certainty in an increasingly unpredictable world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212439693">2010</xref>: 177). These findings support Morgan’s claim of the continuing relevance of territorial politics – often the spaces constrained by the structures of representative democracy – and the notion that political mobilisation is framed by a simultaneity of porous and bounded interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212439693">Morgan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For some, the resilience of positivist notions of space signals a critical failure of relational thinking to engage with and account for processes which constrain, structure and connect space and severely limits its effectiveness as an approach to understanding urban change. Davoudi argues that the ‘enduring legacy of positivism’ exposes a widespread professional deficiency reflected in the inability of planners to adequately think in relational terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212439693">2009</xref>: 214). Harrison describes New Labour experiments with sub-regional governance in England during the 2000s as a ‘compromised city-regionalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">2010</xref>: 25). In Harrison’s Northern Way example, newly enabled structures of city-regional governance were unable to overcome pre-existing administrative and political boundaries.</p>
<p>This research reminds us that the general framework of political action, set within political and administrative boundaries – including that of the nation-state and local jurisdictions – has been (perhaps) surprisingly resilient to the effects of decentralising spatial patterns and global economic restructuring processes. However, while this is a decisive and worthwhile finding, this line of reasoning also tends to force the spatial debate into a tense dichotomy between relational processes and absolute political claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095212439693">Jones, 2009</xref>). Consequently, the project of understanding urban social change can be overwhelmed by an argument of how to interpret spatial practice (e.g. whether particular planning activities and outcomes reflect positivist or post-structural tendencies). What is needed is direct engagement with spatial change and space production – including an examination of how spatial forms emerge on the ground through lived experience, together with the concepts, values and practices which either support their resilience or break them apart. With these debates as a point of departure, the aim of the remainder of this article is to present a frame through which to analyse metropolitan governance which escapes the constraints of relational/absolute debates. To this end, the paper engages with the theories of Lefebvre, in particular his conceptual triad outlined in <italic>The Production of Space</italic>.</p>

<title>An approach to understanding urban social change in city-regions based on Henri Lefebvre’s <italic>The Production of Space</italic></title>
<p>At the heart of <italic>The Production of Space</italic>, and of continuing interest to urban researchers, Lefebvre presents a conceptual triad which expresses the interaction between spatial practices, representations of space and spaces of representation. The triad can be seen as a mechanism through which Lefebvre traces the production of space, exposing and decoding both visible and invisible processes and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212439693">Leary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>). Each of the triad elements is introduced below.</p>
<list id="list1-1473095212439693" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The concept of <italic>Representations of space</italic> reflects space that is conceptualised, defined or <italic>conceived</italic>. This notion refers to the rationally abstracted space of ‘scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 38) where ideology, power and knowledge dominate. This is the space of order, of verbal descriptions, language and the written word. Representations of space serve as ‘an organizing schema or a frame of reference for communication, which permits a (spatial) orientation and thus co-determines activity at the same time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">Schmid, 2008</xref>: 37). In this way, they are abstractions and signify concrete power.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lefebvre’s <italic>Spaces of representation</italic> engages with spaces that are directly <italic>lived</italic>. While formed by human experiences, spaces of representation refer to memories and feelings. This space is symbolic, subjective, ‘qualitative, fluid and dynamic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>) and ‘expresses and evokes social norms, values and experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">Schmid, 2008</xref>: 37). Further, lived space can be linked to the ‘clandestine or underground’ and represents ‘a terrain of struggle where alternative imaginations of space are possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212439693">Simonsen, 2005</xref>: 7).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Spatial practices</italic> refer to people’s perceptions of the world experienced through their daily reality. This <italic>perceived</italic> space encompasses that which is observable and sensory; that ‘which can be directly seen, heard, smelled, touched and tasted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095212439693">Degen, 2008</xref>: 19). In this way, spatial practices denote materiality and include the ‘routes and networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 37) which make up daily life. Yet, this space not only includes the built environment, but also the processes by which materiality is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212439693">Leary, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Critically, the three spaces are not separate realities but rather ‘features of a single – and ever-changing – reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212439693">Lehtovuori, 2010</xref>: 55) which is ‘fluid and alive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>: 108). As such, engagement with the triad will undoubtedly identify blurry and unstable distinctions and relationships. However, these elements or moments are the ‘ensemble of relations and networks that make social action possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095212439693">Butler, 2005</xref>: 11). For example, the triad conceptualises urban spaces simultaneously as ‘a physical entity requiring resources for its maintenance and development, a space that is institutionally represented and a place that is socially interactive and historically situated, imagined by a range of actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212439693">Leary, 2009</xref>: 196).</p>
<p>For Schmid, the key to Lefebvre’s theory is his particular approach to dialectic thinking, informed by several decades of engagement with the writings of Hegel, Marx and Nietzsche. Following these influential German thinkers, Lefebvre’s dialectic brings together three interconnected moments: here we have spatial practices (social action), representations of space (social thought and language) and spaces of representation (desire, creativity). However, Schmid argues that unlike the Hegelian and Marxian dialectics which imagine ‘two terms in contradiction with each other that are sublated through a third’, in Lefebvre’s ‘three-dimensional figure’ each moment refers to the other two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">2008</xref>: 33). As such, the concepts remain distinct, yet none is privileged over the other. This particular triadic relationship where each moment assumes equal importance is perhaps the foremost distinction of Lefebvre’s dialectic analysis.</p>
<p>Conceptualising space in this way can be particularly useful for planning research, as it frames the object of analysis as the active process of production. The implication for the study of metropolitan governance is that the object of analysis is not the city-region itself but rather the processes of social reproduction which render ‘city-regions visible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">Harrison, 2010</xref>: 5). In the following empirical section, the article explores the interactions and relationships between Lefebvre’s three forms of space in the contested and dynamic metropolitan setting.</p>

<title>Using Lefebvre’s triad: The case of tech valley and the Capital District, New York</title>
<p>The paper now presents and interprets a case example of cross-jurisdictional and cross-sector collaboration from the Capital District, New York which has been axiomatic the new city-regionalism. The starting point for this research was a series of informal discussions with regional planners in the Capital District. This dialogue fed into a research design framed by the author’s interest in the ongoing transformations in urban and regional planning, spatial de-concentration and the nature of place. Empirical data for this article was gathered in 2008 and 2009 through qualitative interviews (n = 34), popular accounts of regional change (i.e. newspaper articles and editorials) and a review of relevant planning reports, strategies and policy documents related to metropolitan regionalism in the case area. Interviewees included politicians, planners and economic developers, business leaders and voluntary / not-for-profit organisations active in the metropolitan regionalist network. These groups and individuals were identified through a combination of snowball, reputational and purposeful sampling techniques. Additional actors were then added to fill particular contextual gaps (e.g. voluntary groups, conservation advocates and affordable housing representatives). During interviews, participants were asked to reflect upon the spatial and cultural meanings of the Capital District, discuss the nature of their involvement in metropolitan collaboration, and to narrate particular events, processes and outcomes related to regional development and change.</p>
<p>It is recognised that the majority of interviews conducted and the predominance of data presented in this paper reflects the opinions and activities of those who would be considered ‘experts’ involved with the abstraction of metropolitan space. While specific effort was made to uncover alternative accounts and dissenting viewpoints, where these voices were identified, they generally struggled to find outlets for discussion; encountering a political framework that was largely unresponsive. As the case study will narrate, this condition of the ‘post-political’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212439693">Allmendinger and Haughton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212439693">Swyngedouw, 2011</xref>) is characteristic of metropolitan regionalism in the Capital District and reflects the desire and capacity of metropolitan stakeholders and experts to constrain political debate. Moreover, it is the ability of Lefebvre’s spatial theory to recognise this dynamism that renders it immensely valuable as a means to understand urban change.</p>

<p>Former staff member, Center for Economic Growth, Capital District, New York.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above quote is indicative of the drive to metropolitan governance in US metropolitan regions where collaboration across jurisdictions has been employed as a strategy towards the betterment of economic conditions. The quote is situated in an ongoing, business-led programme of region-building in the Capital District, New York (USA) (population approx. 1 million) which, over the past two decades, sought no less than wholesale economic restructuring and strengthened global economic competition.</p>
<p>The Capital District is commonly recognised as the four-county area of Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer and Saratoga located about 2½ hours north of New York City. Historically, government and politics have played a critical role in the region’s identity. In addition to being home to the New York State Capital, many of the region’s urban areas are steeped in democratic machine-style politics and history typified by individuals such as Mayor Erastus Corning, who ran the city of Albany from 1942 to 1983. In the post-war era, this combination of state government and durable local politics translated into a relatively high proportion of employment in public sector jobs which, in turn, contributed to a safeguarding of the metropolitan economy – particularly from the major economic swings and decline associated with many other north-eastern US cities. However, recent economic development efforts have been framed by a desire to shift away from the comforts of government jobs in order to energise entrepreneurialism and increase investment in high technology research and manufacturing sectors, endeavours enmeshed with the production of the <italic>Capital District</italic> as a coherent entity.</p>
<p>Early, interest in Capital District regionalism and the building of its regional institutional structures was a distinctly public sector effort, linked to the US government’s urban policies of the 1960s. During this time, federal funds and investments were commonly leveraged towards inducing metropolitan-scaled actions to alleviate urban poverty and manage the growing imbalance between cities and suburbs. Creating a quasi-formal tier of regional planning and oversight for a four-county area, the Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC), the Capital District Regional Planning Commission (CDRPC) and the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) were established in the 1960s to administer and oversee federal programme requirements and conduct regional planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095212439693">CDRPC, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>However, without significant authority or capacity to coordinate infrastructure and development, these agencies only marginally influenced the overall spatial pattern of the metropolitan area. Nonetheless, this institutional infrastructure contributed to widespread recognition of the region as coterminous with the four-county area. For many, these institutions generated specific understandings of the spatiality of metropolitan governance in the Capital District – in other words, they formed an answer to the question ‘what is the city-region?’. In part, this conception – this distinct representation of space – has limited the ability of planners to engage with relational concepts. For example, planners interviewed for this project recognised the four-county area as an inadequate representation of the layers of socio-economic activity occurring across the metropolitan area. Yet, there has been little interest in expanding or modifying regional planning arrangements which had held firm since the 1960s as political and financial reality dictated a pragmatic approach to the business of regionalism. Speaking about the spatial reach of one of the regional planning bodies, the organisation’s executive director noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not reaching out [to other counties] because that would make it that much more difficult to think regionally. Because there are significant differences that exist. . . .Because I do believe it further dilutes our ability to think regionally (Executive director, regional planning body, Capital District, New York).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, the case demonstrates consistency with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212439693">Davoudi (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212439693">Harrison (2010)</xref> and others who have noted the remarkable resilience of absolute conceptions in planning practice and content across a range of cases. Echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212439693">Searle and Bunker’s (2010)</xref> review of metropolitan planning in Australia, it seems that in the Capital District, pragmatism and the desire for certainty in an uncertain world have at least partly constrained the transition to governance arrangements, which might account for the complexity of interaction in city-regions.</p>
<p>However, while this framework provided planners with a pragmatic arrangement through which to engage with regional development issues, when asked to reflect on their own understandings of the Capital District, interviewees commonly called upon specific experiences, memories and emotions to produce identities which either transcended or had little resemblance to the four-county conception. For many, this identity was articulated by reference to daily practices and routines, the patterns and interactions that connected them to places and people in the region. At times, this was evident in reference to particular natural boundaries:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s this tendency for people not to cross rivers, and I would say Schenectady has been the most provincial in that way (Board member, Schenectady Metroplex).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, a board member with a sub-regional development body evoked the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers not only as physical constraints to movement, but also as symbols of a wider condition of fragmentation. Other interviewees referred to landmarks such as the State Capital building or ‘the egg’ performance centre or imaginaries of spatial landscapes, conjuring up a particular ‘sense of place’. Boudreau describes these mental maps as ‘collectively shared internal worlds of thoughts and beliefs that structure everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095212439693">2007</xref>: 2596). Interviewees often used spatial imaginaries to describe the diverse, yet interconnected, physical attributes of the region. For example, as a business stakeholder explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s something that makes this place hang together. . .you’ve got to look at our natural resources, our topography, our geography, our communication systems, our transportation networks and there’s something that kind of, sort of hangs together as a region here (Former executive director, Center for Economic Growth, Capital District, New York).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another stakeholder spoke of a ‘recreational and cultural region’ stretching approximately 90 miles in all directions from the city of Albany; crossing municipal, county and state borders into the state of Massachusetts as a way to capture the ‘experience’ of the Capital District. Extracts such as these, derived from memories and widely shared experiences of the local area (e.g. visiting the Berkshires, hiking in the Adirondacks), demonstrate the ability to articulate spatial concepts without reference to administrative or jurisdictional boundaries.</p>
<p>In addition to these spatial imaginaries, metropolitan stakeholders commonly made normative judgements to describe the regional identity. One such example, which has been particularly vital for regional policy, has been the unflattering depiction of the local community as lacking ambition and entrepreneurial spirit. Interviewees often spoke of a defeatist attitude and lower aspirations amongst the local population. These characteristics were not typically attributed to specific individuals, but rather to a culture of parochialism associated with the area’s political history and a perceived overreliance on public sector employment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These are the people who are like ‘oh yeah, go ask the mayor for a job’. . . the only objective in life is to get a state job because that means you can take it easy. You don’t have to work very hard, salary is OK, you can have a decent life, security (Former executive director, regional economic development body, Capital District, New York).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For economic developers, the perceived lack of entrepreneurial spirit was a cultural flaw and hindrance to regional growth. Further, while the characteristic generalised about the nature of people, it remained intimately tied to the Capital District as a place – in particular the area’s early industrial history as self-contained urban centres (e.g. Schenectady, Troy, Albany, Cohoes), fragmented local government structures and culture of machine-style politics. Some interviewees argued that this particular history embedded parochialism and fragmentation into the institutions and culture of the region and defined the nature of inter-municipal cooperation. As such, the economic future of the area required a culture shift away from parochialism and towards entrepreneurialism and more collaborative, flexible governance arrangements. Here, there are some striking resemblances to Lefebvre’s ‘urbanist’, who, in taking on the role of healer, ‘imagines himself caring for a sick society. . .He perceives spatial diseases’ and provides a cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 2003</xref>: 157). In this sense, the representation of the Capital District as flawed and deficient fetishises the metropolitan space as an object and seeks to deny concrete lived experience in favour of the abstract conceptions of economic growth.</p>
<p>Reflecting on these discourses of regionalism, a wide range of spatial thinking becomes evident. Clearly, the planning conceptions of the 1960s still hold sway in the pragmatic activities of metropolitan regionalism. Nonetheless, when seeking to describe the Capital District, interviewees rarely referred to this four-county geography. Rather, these actors called upon particular patterns and interactions between places and people, sites and landmarks, and spatial imaginaries – all framed by their unique perceptions of the world. Particularly crucial has been the unfavourable depiction of the Capital District as parochial and lacking entrepreneurial spirit. In the next section, the paper examines how these spatial practices and dynamic, fluid concepts of ‘the region’, affected political action and the emergence of the tech valley metropolitan initiative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1473095212439693">
<title>Challenging cultural identities and spatial meanings</title>
<p>In the Capital District, metropolitan actors commonly engaged with these ‘cultural expressions of place qualities and spatial meanings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212439693">Healey, 2007</xref>: 204) in order to (re)conceptualise space and bring about regional change. These ‘urbanists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 2003</xref>) framed their economic programme not only as one of economic revitalisation, but also, more fundamentally, as a project of social change. Beginning in the early 1980s, the business community sought to restart the region’s sluggish economy and reverse the trend of migration and decline which pervaded much of the north-east and mid-west sections of the United States. At the forefront of the effort was the Center for Economic Growth (CEG), a regionally based consortium of chambers of commerce and economic stakeholders, and their invention of the tech valley moniker. While tech valley eventually became a formalised 18-county economic development consortium, it was also a euphemism for a particular brand of pro-growth policy ideas, including an expansion of collaboration across the region and promotion of an entrepreneurial agenda based in high technology research and manufacturing.</p>
<p>For many of those involved, tech valley was primarily concerned with the perceived culture of defeatism and expressing an alternative idea of what the region could become. Language from Silicon Valley and suggestions that the Capital District was a centre of technological entrepreneurialism were intended to counter perceptions of the city of Albany (and the region) as a ‘sleepy city’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095212439693">Pérez-Peña, 2002</xref>). Over several decades metropolitan stakeholders have worked to transform regional culture and alter the way individuals give meaning to and interpret space in the Capital District. To return to Lefebvre’s framework, as a representation of space, the notion of tech valley offered a new reference point and a new set of values and norms for society in the region. In this sense, tech valley not only served as a marketing ploy to court global capital, it was a statement to the citizens of the Capital District that they were now part of a vibrant culture of entrepreneurialism, growth and technology.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, CEG had become an influential part of the regional economic development community and with the support of the well-placed and powerful Senator Joseph Bruno, had influenced major state funding for the region’s key transportation resources (the Albany International Airport, rebuilt in 1996, and the Albany-Rensselaer train station, completed in 2002). Interviewees noted that these gateway projects were essential components of the regional rebranding programme and were an important step in realising the vision of the Capital District as globally connected and relevant in the field of high technology. These material elements of the built environment altered the experiences of those travelling to and from the area. The facilities celebrated movement and travel and were explicit attempts to ‘move Albany out of the Dark Ages’ (business representative quoted in Carr Smyth, 1996) and fight the perception of the region as insular and stuck in the past.</p>
<p>Beyond the infrastructure projects, metropolitan actors also tapped into an interest in the private sector and state government to support and fund high tech industry in New York state. Much of this investment centred on research and development facilities at the University of Albany’s western campus on Fuller Road including: construction of the Center for Environmental Sciences and Technology Management (CESTM), establishment of the Center of Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CEN), the attraction of International Sematch (a consortium of high technology businesses including AMD, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Texas Instruments, among others), and an associated $403 million cooperative research and development centre at the CEN site. These investments in the high tech industry – new structures with sleek, modern designs – served as material demonstrations of high tech investment in the Capital District and complimented the tech valley vision for the region. As an interviewee from the not-for-profit sector noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>You just look at the built environment on the corner of Fuller Road. . .and you see a billion dollar campus which only a limited number of years ago wasn’t even there. . .there’s just all sorts of terribly exciting things happening (Representative, Tech Valley Civic Forum).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine that this is precisely the response that CEG and other economic developers were actively seeking to produce through material change in the urban environment. In this way, the sites of tech valley now vied for attention alongside rivers, highways, ‘the egg’ and other regional landmarks in the spatial practices of the Capital District citizenry. Indeed, these accomplishments boosted confidence amongst the economic development community and conjured up visions of the Capital District as a legitimate site for major global investment. This conviction translated into success in 2006 when the Luther Forest Technology Park in suburban Saratoga County was selected as the location for a new $4 billion AMD microprocessor plant. The project, touted by then-Governor George Pataki as the ‘largest industrial investment ever made in New York’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212439693">Lyne, 2006</xref>), was backed by a range of political and economic interests across the region and supported by a significant tax subsidy package offered by New York State.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1473095212439693">
<title>Conceived space and the post-political metropolitan region</title>
<p>While the Luther Forest project became the headline attraction in a long-term, regional programme of economic change it is important to note that this and other economic projects occurred without a formal mechanism of regional collaboration or any serious structures for metropolitan planning. In this way, the case study highlights the ways in which these informal metropolitan governance arrangements can support and deliver neoliberal policies; a process which, in this instance, benefited from the ability of key actors to constrain political debate. For example, one executive-level regional planner interviewed for the project who commented on the project’s potentially short lifespan in a newspaper story claimed that he was quickly reprimanded by political interests and threatened with dismissal. Responding to the perception of similar pressures, the most influential land conservation group in the county did not take a position on the project for fear of upsetting key funding sources.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Was there a stance on that? No, we just couldn’t do it. We wouldn’t have gotten another grant. Ever! From anybody! (Executive director, regional open space conservation organisation, Capital District, New York).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Often, interviewees who were not directly associated with tech valley expressed a sense of acceptance and inevitability to the Luther Forest project. In an area of the country with a waning industrial base and a lagging economy, the tech valley conception and wider growth agenda denied serious debate about spatial priorities and alternatives.</p>
<p>Development of Luther Forest was also likely eased by the absence of a mechanism through which to hold regional debates about spatial development patterns as well as the limited capacity afforded the regional planning bodies to influence development decisions in New York State. For example, both relevant regional planning documents, CDTC’s New Visions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095212439693">CDTC, 2007</xref>) and CDRPC’s Fiscal Impact Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095212439693">CDRPC, 2007</xref>) argued for city-centred development based around smart growth principles. However, without dedicated engagement by the regional bodies or a forum for regional debate, these issues were conspicuously absent from discussions related to the project, which further decentralised development away from the Capital District’s traditional urban cores.</p>
<p>Together, these illustrations highlight the constrained environment within which those interested in critical debate were situated. Here, ‘non-aligned’ or ‘outsider’ groups (e.g. voluntary bodies, affordable housing advocates) seeking to advance alternative socio-economic policies had limited success challenging growth priorities or building long-standing coalitions. Moreover, rather than critiquing the overall growth agenda, these organisations typically connected their initiatives directly to the tech valley programme. For example, the nonprofit executive roundtable, a consortium of not-for-profit organisations in the Capital District, sought to position the sector as a critical stakeholder in the regional growth agenda. Under the auspices of the Tech Valley Civic Forum (TVCF) the group held workshops with business and political leaders, spelling out the value and potential contribution of the not-for-profit sector. In a series of follow-up reports, the group set out a strategy through which to expand the benefit of high tech growth in the region. The programme was designed as a partnership with tech valley interests framed by the goal of ‘engaging business, government, nonprofit, community and education leaders in identifying opportunities connecting high tech growth to community well being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1473095212439693">TVCF, 2009</xref>: ii).</p>
<p>Similarly, ARISE, an affiliation of religious groups supporting regional empowerment in the Capital District, developed an ‘equity agenda for tech valley’. Bringing their urban-focused, social justice programmes into communication with the technology initiatives, the group saw tech valley as an opportunity to reduce regional inequality and strengthen learning opportunities for the region’s disadvantaged youth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our question was. . .wouldn’t it be swell to get kids from the inner city in some kind of programme that actually got them exposure to these high tech facilities? (Capital District project leader, ARISE).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Citing the lack of a metropolitan structure through which to hold discussions about the spread of wealth and economic opportunity, the interviewee noted that ARISE eventually turned away from the regional concept towards the negotiation of community benefit agreements associated with major development projects.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It [community benefit agreements] is our new vehicle for advancing the same basic agenda which is, how can we make sure people in the neighbourhoods get a piece of the action (Capital District project leader, ARISE).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, advocating on behalf of disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the local development review process was prioritised over engagement with the fuzziness of metropolitan regionalism.</p>
<p>These examples provide insights into the depoliticised nature of metropolitan growth in the Capital District. Lacking a framework for civic engagement, the decision to renew the area’s economy through the tech valley approach was not seriously debated. Rather, as indicated here, voices which sought to engage with regional concepts were resigned to either collaboration through informal tech valley partnership initiatives or the critique of individual development projects, where discussion was restricted to site planning and local benefit issues (e.g. traffic, noise, etc.). This lack of proper political dialogue is indicative of what Mouffe, Swyngedouw and others have described as a condition of the ‘post political’. In this view, the elimination of real alternatives, alongside the ‘consensual politics’, are telltale signs of a declining democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212439693">Mouffe, 2005</xref>: 29). For metropolitan regionalism, the vacuum of political space is filled by ‘consensual techno-managerial policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212439693">Swyngedouw, 2011</xref>: 11). The consensus approach – in the Capital District reflected in wide support for the tech valley agenda – masks critical planning and development issues related to social justice, equity and urban decentralisation. What is more, the pursuit of economic development holds such a powerful hegemonic position that alternative spatial readings and possibilities are rendered unimaginable.</p>

<sec id="section9-1473095212439693">
<title>Further analysis: Co-produced space and the value of Lefebvre’s triple dialectic</title>
<p>The Capital District narrative follows a disjointed and fragmented pathway from the ‘old regionalist’ efforts of CDTC, CDRPC and CDTA in the 1960s to the emergence of a new city-regionalism represented by tech valley and the ongoing economic restructuring programme. While this account is only part of the regional story, the example demonstrates the great value of Lefebvre’s spatial triad for conducting urban research and understanding spatial change. As a methodological approach, the triad directs research away from ‘oppositions, contrasts or antagonisms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 39) and questions of universality such as ‘what is the city-region?’ to a more contextualised understanding where various relevant and valuable interpretations of city-regional space can be identified.</p>
<p>For planning theory, this approach decentres contemporary debates about space – such as that between absolute and relational thinking – and provides a robust frame through which to examine processes of change. For example, the case study narrative noted how some regional planners were uncomfortable or unwilling to reconstruct formal conceptions of the Capital District away from the four-county area and did not overtly act upon relational ideas. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212439693">Davoudi (2009)</xref> argued previously, they have clung to absolute notions of space. For the most part, this reflected a conscious pragmatic decision to represent a specific bounded constituency. However, while these structures proved to be durable, they represented only one type of spatial conception (one that has had little actual significance in major planning and economic development agenda). Rather, Lefebvre’s triad revealed alternative notions about space and motivations for action, based in particular spatial imaginaries, which challenged not only these traditional geographies, but also long-standing preconceptions and associations related to the Capital District as a cultural idea (e.g. parochialism). Through tech valley, business interests put forward a new interpretation of the region and approach to regional development, positioning the economic development approach as a cure for the Capital District’s ‘spatial disease’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 2003</xref>: 157). This has, in turn, produced physical changes – now experienced and perceived by society.</p>
<p>For these groups, approval and construction of Luther Forest seems to have fulfilled the region’s tech valley ambitions. What is crucial to point out here is that these physical developments were positioned within a changed understanding of space. Individuals involved with the project noted that it would not have been possible without the physical developments elsewhere in the region (such as CESTM at Fuller Road). This of course represents processes of lesson-learning and resource agglomeration. However, the material features of investment became visible components of the Capital District’s built environment – part of the daily experience or spatial practice in Lefebvre’s language – and supported the notion of a high tech regional economy as a reality. These components of the built environment became places people inhabit; places where they work, travel and experience life. Over time, this materiality has altered spatial patterns and (for some) contributed to new cultural understandings of the Capital District and new conceptions (e.g. planning strategies, land use regulations, etc.) are emerging across the area reflective of the notion of tech valley.</p>
<p>However, for much of society, these efforts have had little impact or relevance. For example, individuals and families struggling with poverty or those concerned with affordable housing and social justice had little noticeable engagement with tech valley. Moreover, the absence of lived space suggests that metropolitan abstractions such as tech valley have constrained opportunities to counter the neoliberal hegemony. In the Capital District, the notion of economic development is so strongly ingrained in the culture of regional planning that counter-arguments, where they emerge at all, are easily dismissed. Moreover, even those potentially subaltern voices, such as ARISE, found little interest in conflict or a desire to express alternative models of development. However, if, as Swyngedouw argues, ‘proper urban politics fosters dissent, creates disagreement and triggers the debating of and experimentation with more egalitarian and inclusive urban futures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212439693">2011</xref>: 15), there can be little solace found in the consensual metropolitan politics of the Capital District. Rather than serving as a site for democratic debate, the metropolitan space has been overwhelmed by a singular neoliberal focus – represented by the conception of tech valley. Here, it is useful to consider Lefebvre’s examination of the nature of this passivity:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ideologically, technically, and politically, the quantitative [conceived] has become rule, norm, and value. . .the qualitative [lived] is worn down. Anything that cannot be quantified is eliminated. The generalized terrorism of the quantifiable accentuates the efficiency of repressive space, amplifies it without fear of reproach, all the more so because of its self-justifying nature (ideo-logic), its apparent scientificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">2003</xref>: 185).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the Capital District, characterising the region as sick and ‘in need of a planning remedy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095212439693">Gunder, 2005</xref>: 184), the urban elite crush the lived and organise a repressive space devoid of political content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>). Moreover, this process is continually reinforced by particular institutional structures, including those for planning, which limit critical deliberation and constrain (if not wholly deny) lived space and a politics of opposition.</p>
<p>Of course, in the future, these developments might contribute to the emergence of an alternative cultural expression and an oppositional force in support of a new paradigm of spatial development priorities. It is worth noting that this research was conducted before the extent of the current recession – the so-called ‘credit crunch’ – was known and prior to the global Occupy counter-movement. As such, it is possible that the groundwork for opposition to hegemonic spatial conceptions in the Capital District (and elsewhere) is emerging. However, how these might find a way to engage and challenge the agents of metropolitan regionalism remains problematic.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper argues that Lefebvre’s theory of space, applied here to the study of city-regions, helps to shift perspective away from debilitating interpretations of urban strategies as constrained by relational or absolute understanding and yields a conceptualisation of metropolitan space as a social process in which each moment of the triad co-constitutes and creates social space. For example, in the Capital District, there is an emerging built form which represents the ideals and values of tech valley. Yet, physical materiality (the perceived realm of spatial practice) has no meaning without the feelings and emotions invested or the conceptions and thoughts which represent them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">Schmid, 2008</xref>). In the case study, this materiality is represented and directed by the thoughts and conceptions of economic developers, regional policy-makers, politicians who articulate their vision as the cure for particular regional deficiencies – an abstraction which is then projected onto lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 2003</xref>). In time, these processes, including transformations to the physical built environment, have become an important part of the way space is now conceived in the Capital District as the language of tech valley has slowly seeped into policy and regulation across the region.</p>
<p>However, if space is a social product, it is an unfinished product that is continuously perceived, conceived and lived. Moreover, as Schmid notes, ‘none of these dimensions can be posited as the absolute origin [and]. . .none is privileged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">2008</xref>: 43). As such, Lefebvre’s triad does not portend to explain a linear process, but rather ‘enables the discovery or recognition of a meaning’ amongst a horizon of possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212439693">2008</xref>: 34). Within this horizon, it is the examination of relationships between spaces which helps explicate processes of social change. For example, the ways in which conceived ‘abstractions’ constrain lived space has been of critical importance to the nature of metropolitan regionalism in the Capital District. Here, lived space is indeed ‘elusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212439693">Merrifield, 2006</xref>: 110), appropriated and dominated by the conceptions of the metropolitan elite. It is the ability to recognise this dynamism which makes Lefebvre’s spatial theory so valuable for the study of emerging structures and activities of urban governance. Moreover, framing the analytical study of metropolitan regionalism within Lefebvre’s triad opens a window to the arena of social change and concepts easily overlooked when constrained by the absolute-relational dyad – it is a spatial theory that shows us the critical silences of society. In the Capital District, the power of regional economic development was to render the expression of counter-narratives unreasonable and impossible. Rarely did subaltern citizens or marginalised voices question or challenge dominant discourses of growth, and when they did, they were silenced by the consensual politics of tech valley. The lack of a ‘proper urban politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212439693">Swyngedouw, 2011</xref>: 14) denies the expression of lived space and has important implications for civic society. For Lefebvre, it is the ‘passivity of those involved, their silence, their reticent prudence’ which indicates the absence of urban democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">Lefebvre, 2003</xref>: 137). Indeed, the entire democratic project falters as ‘the privileged issues of contention are pre-shaped by unquestioned cultural imperatives’ and where only views that align with the dominant hegemonic vision are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095212439693">Gunder, 2005</xref>: 175). In seeking an alternative, what is needed, argues Lefebvre, is a ‘politicalization of urban issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212439693">2003</xref>: 148), where democratic processes support rather than deny a vibrant politics of contestation, a process and condition absent in the metropolitan regionalism of the Capital District.</p>
