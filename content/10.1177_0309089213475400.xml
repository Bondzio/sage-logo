<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the diverse units present within Num. 1.1–10.10 are more elaborately arranged than has been widely assumed. By utilizing a synchronic approach that pays special attention to repetition and other structural markers, Num. 1.1–10.10 is shown to consist of two parallel panels of three units each: 1.1–6.27 (1.1–2.24; 3.1–1.49; 5.1–6.27) and 7.1–10.10 (7.1–89; 8.1–26; 9.1–10.10). A resultant laity-clergy-laity pattern in each panel reinforces the centrality of Yahweh's tabernacle presence in Israel's midst, as mediated through the priests, for the campaign ahead.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Numbers 1.1–10.10 narrates the organization of Israel's camp in preparation for the wilderness march that begins in 10.11–13.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213475400">1</xref></sup> Ironically, this narrative about organization has long been held to be profoundly lacking in organization. Numbers as a whole has been called ‘the junkroom of the priestly code’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213475400">2</xref></sup> and no part of the book is more suited to this description than Numbers 1–10. Indeed, H. Seebass laments that Numbers 1–10 needs rescuing from its reputation as an ‘unbalanced’ and ‘boring part of Numbers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213475400">3</xref></sup> The difficulty scholars face in discerning organizational coherence can be quickly seen in the variety of analyses of the text's surface structure. Of commentators identifying 1.1–10.10 or 1.1–10.36 as a unit, the number of subunits proposed on the next highest level might be two (Dozeman; Ashley), three (de Vaulx; Davies), four (Seebass), six (Wenham, Milgrom), seven (Olson), eight (Sakenfeld), nine (Gray; Fretheim), ten (Bullinger), fourteen (Snaith), or fifteen (Kellermann).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213475400">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>This substantial divergence of opinion may be traced in part to the apparent disconnected relationships among the subunits. In regard to genre alone, we find narrative, census return, genealogy, priestly legislation, liturgical poetry, duty roster, ritual celebration and tribal list—to name only a few. M. Noth represents much current opinion in his estimate that chs. 5–9 are composed of many late additions ‘having no connection with one another and in whose sequence no factual arrangement can be discerned’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213475400">5</xref></sup> This kind of negative appraisal is almost certainly behind one feature of Numbers 1–10 for which there is virtually no disagreement: the arrangement of its highest-level subunits (whether two or fifteen or somewhere in between) into a simple linear structure. Bellinger's outline, for example, lists a succession of ten linearly arranged units:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213475400">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>At the same time, more positive assessments of the literary nature of Numbers have begun to emerge, arguing, for example, that the book's ‘editors were masters of sophisticated literary skills’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213475400">7</xref></sup> J. Milgrom has demonstrated the frequent use of repetition in forming elaborate, symmetrical patterns in the book. According to Milgrom, ‘The main structural device, to judge by its attestation in nearly every chapter of Numbers, is chiasm and introversion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213475400">8</xref></sup> He cites the arrangement of units into parallel panels as a second major structural pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213475400">9</xref></sup> N. Lunn has recently argued that chiastic and parallel panel structures are pervasive throughout Numbers 1–4.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213475400">10</xref></sup> With these and other similar studies in mind,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213475400">11</xref></sup> it would be unsurprising to find the arrangement of Numbers 1–10 more elaborate than a simple linear sequence.</p>
<p>Seebass's desire to improve the reputation of Numbers 1–10 is admirable. However, his literary-historical approach (in which he seeks to reconstruct an earlier priestly stratum, Pg) renders achieving this desire unlikely for readers outside a small group of trained specialists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213475400">12</xref></sup> While such diachronic work has an important contribution to make, evidence of sophisticated literary artistry detected by synchronic approaches to the text suggests the latter hold greater promise for an impact beyond the academy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213475400">13</xref></sup> In particular, the present article will utilize the structural analysis of symmetrical patterns advocated by S. Bar-Efrat, J.T. Walsh, J.P. Fokkelman and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213475400">14</xref></sup> This approach pays special attention to patterns of repetition and other verbal markers used to organize literary units. I will argue that the macro-structure of Num. 1.1–10.10 is indeed more intricate than often assumed. Specifically, the text is arranged in two parallel panels, 1.1–6.27 and 7.1–10.10, each consisting of three major units (i.e. ABC…A′B′C′).</p>
<p>A somewhat similar proposal is found in the basic two-panel structure (AB…A′B′) of R. Knierim and G. Coats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213475400">15</xref></sup> In their view, although Num. 1.1–10.10 can be subsumed under the idea of ‘the organization of the sanctuary camp’, a major division occurs between 1.1–4.49 and 5.1–10.10 based on the fact that the clear focus on the camp's organization in 1.1–4.49 is absent in 5.1–10.10. They point as well to the diversity and lack of organizational logic among the subunits of 5.1–10.10. In most cases these are supplemental to various texts in Exodus-Numbers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213475400">16</xref></sup> and thus appear to be later accretions added over an extended period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213475400">17</xref></sup> Yet despite this rather pessimistic view of the literary character of these chapters, Knierim and Coats suggest a general movement from the outer camp to the inner camp first evident in 1.1–4.49 was later followed during the growth process of 5.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213475400">18</xref></sup> The result is that 1.1–4.49 and 5.1–10.10 are parallel panels, each consisting of a first unit focused on the concerns of the outer camp and a second unit focused on the concerns of the inner camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213475400">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>The shift in focus between the outer and inner camp highlighted in this scheme is clearly important. Numbers 1.1–2.34 presents Israel's lay tribes in the outer camp as they are arranged as a cordon around the tabernacle and its Levite personnel. Numbers 3.1–4.49 then focuses on the Levites located near the camp's center. Numbers 5.1–6.27 consists of community legislation, and thus returns to a concern with the outer camp. However, the units in 7.1–10.10 are not uniformly concerned with the inner camp. Indeed, Knierim and Coats themselves recognize the subunit on the Second Passover (9.1–14) deals with purity of the <italic>outer</italic> camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213475400">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another problem with this outline is the identification of 5.1 as the beginning of a second, highest-level unit within 1.1–10.10. The divine speech formula in 5.1 (‘Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying…’) is an especially weak marker of a new major unit. As observed by Knierim and Coats, the formula often functions to begin a subunit, but more frequently it introduces speech <italic>within</italic> a subunit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213475400">21</xref></sup> It should not be considered a clear marker of a major unit within 1.1–10.10. In fact, Num. 5.1–4 shares sufficient commonality with 1.1–4.49 to warn against seeing such a significant disjuncture at 5.1. For example, an important pattern in 1.1–4.49 is (1) the divine speech formula addressed to Moses, (2) Yahweh's command to Moses, (3) narration of obedience to this command, and (4) a concluding compliance formula stating everything has been done as commanded. This pattern is absent in chs. 5–7, with the exception of its continuation into 5.1–4.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213475400">22</xref></sup> Likewise, the dominant concern for the ‘camp’ in chs. 1–4, where ‘camp’ (‭הנחמ‬) occurs fourteen times, is extended into 5.1–4, where the noun occurs four additional times. This explicit concern for the camp is largely absent in the remainder of 5.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213475400">23</xref></sup> Both these extensions of features of chs. 1–4 into 5.1–4, then, suggest caution regarding seeing 5.1 as the beginning of a second major unit within Numbers 1–10.</p>
<p>It is true that 1.1–4.49 forms a coherent unit. Numbers 1.1–2.34 and 3.1–4.49 address the censuses and mobilization of personnel (lay and cultic, respectively) for the sanctuary camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213475400">24</xref></sup> Knierim and Coats likewise correctly group together the community legislation in Num. 5.1–6.27. However, the lack of a significant introductory marker at 5.1 and the strong ties between 5.1–4 and 1.1–4.49 suggest 1.1–4.49 and 5.1–6.27 are best read together as a single unit (1.1–6.27) on the highest level of 1.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213475400">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>This analysis finds support in evidence pointing to 7.1 as the beginning of a new highest-level unit. The book of Numbers opens in 1.1 with a description of the temporal setting: the first day of the second month of the second year after the exodus. This setting in the second month is not changed until 7.1, where the reader encounters a second chronological notation. Here, the temporal setting shifts to the first day of the first month, or exactly one month earlier than announced in 1.1. The reader of 7.1 is thus taken back in time to the momentous events that occurred one month earlier when the tabernacle was set up and inaugurated (cf. Exod. 40; Lev. 8–9). The appearance of a second chronological notice, in addition to this jarring chronological disjunction directing attention back to the tabernacle inauguration, are strong indications that 7.1 marks the beginning of a new major unit. Indeed, as Olson argues, the setting in the first month continues on from 7.1 until the chronological note of 10.11, where the reader is returned to a second month setting (the twentieth day).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213475400">26</xref></sup> The result is the following two-fold division:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Another signal that 7.1 begins a new major unit is the placement of the priestly benediction in 6.22–27. This supplies a fitting poetic conclusion to the whole of 1.1–6.27.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213475400">27</xref></sup> Lastly, the strength of the division at 7.1 can be seen in the suggestion by H. Koorevaar that 7.1 functions as the beginning of a new highest-level unit within the book which continues through 26.65.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213475400">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conclusion that 1.1–6.27 and 7.1–10.10 form two highest-level units within 1.1–10.10 is preliminary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213475400">29</xref></sup> It is a sufficient starting point, however, for the remaining task of describing how they are arranged in parallel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213475400">30</xref></sup> The proposed structure is as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0309089213475400" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>1.1–2.34 Lay tribes organized around the tabernacle</p></list-item>

<p>I will survey the content and shape of the units in each pair before presenting the evidence for a parallel relationship.</p>

<title>a. Numbers 1.1–2.34 (A)</title>
<p>Numbers 1.1–2.34 is a coherent unit focused on the arrangement of Israel's lay tribes in war camp formation around the tabernacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213475400">31</xref></sup> The first subunit (1.1–54) narrates the census of military personnel from the twelve tribes. Here, chieftains from each tribe are named in order to assist Moses and Aaron with the census (1.1–19). A detailed list of census results then follows for each of the twelve tribes (1.20–54).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213475400">32</xref></sup> The second subunit (2.1–34) echoes ch. 1 in its use of another listing of the twelve tribes, together with the chieftains and census results of each tribe. Here, however, the tribes are organized into four military divisions. They are arranged in regard to both their encampment and marching order, with the tabernacle and its Levite personnel at the center (v. 17). Overall, as Knierim and Coats observe, the census in 1.1–54 does not stand alone but exists only as ‘the direct pre-stage’ of the organization of the tribes around the tabernacle in 2.1–34.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213475400">33</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0309089213475400">
<title>b. Numbers 7.1–89 (A′)</title>
<p>Numbers 7.1–88 describes the tribal chieftains bringing gifts to the tabernacle for its inauguration. The unit divides into three parts: vv. 1–9, 10–88, and 89. After the tabernacle is set up and consecrated (v. 1; cf. Exod. 40), the chieftains collectively present an offering of oxen-drawn carts to the tabernacle for use by the Levites (vv. 2–9). This is followed by a tribal listing in which the twelve chieftains, individually and on successive days, present additional offerings for the altar (vv. 10–88). Finally, Moses is described entering the tabernacle to hear Yahweh speak (v. 89). This brief note is often viewed as a later, disconnected fragment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213475400">34</xref></sup> Regardless of origin, however, Noth is surely correct to interpret it as a positive divine response to the people's generous offerings in vv. 1–88.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213475400">35</xref></sup> This response can be seen as a climactic conclusion to the inaugural festivities of the tabernacle in that it represents the fulfillment of Yahweh's promise that the tabernacle would be a place where Yahweh would meet with Moses and speak his commands (Exod. 25.22; 29.42).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213475400">36</xref></sup> The beginning of a new unit in 8.1 is indicated by the redundancy of the final clause of 7.89, ‘He [Yahweh] spoke with him [Moses]’, being followed directly by the divine speech formula, ‘Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying…’ The focus also shifts from the lay tribes in ch. 7 to the priests and Levites in ch. 8.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0309089213475400">
<title>c. Numbers 1.1–2.34 (A) and 7.1–89 (A′) in Relationship</title>
<p>The listings of the twelve tribes in chs. 1–2 (vv. 5–15, 20–43; 2.3–31) and ch. 7 (vv. 12–83) are the only such listings in 1.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213475400">37</xref></sup> Those in 1.20–43 and 7.12–83 are especially prominent in that they are by far the two longest lists in Num. 1.1–10.10. In both cases, mention of each of the twelve tribes is accompanied by the repetition of identical (and in many ways unnecessary) information that easily becomes monotonous to the modern reader. The order of the tribal names is different in each of the three lists in 1.5–15, 20–43 and 2.3–31.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213475400">38</xref></sup> However, the order in 2.3–31 is precisely the same as in 7.12–83. This order is called the ‘official list’ by Douglas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213475400">39</xref></sup> as it begins with Judah and places the tribes in four blocks of three for encamping around the tabernacle and setting out on the march (cf. 10.13–28). By repeating this official list, Numbers 7 literarily picks up where ch. 2 leaves off. The tribes presenting the offerings in ch. 7 are portrayed as those who have obediently arranged themselves according to the instructions for the tabernacle-centered camp in ch. 2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213475400">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the tribal listings in 1.20–43 and 2.3–31 both include counts of the available warriors from each tribe, the tribal listing in 7.12–83 includes a count of the items offered by each tribe. All three conclude with a combined total of the counts given, with 1.44–46 and 2.32 recording the total number of warriors available from all the tribes and 7.84–88 recording the total number of items offered from all the tribes. Finally, in 1.5–15, 2.3–31 and 7.12–83 the tribes are mentioned together with the names of their respective chieftains. The names of these chieftains are identical in each list and appear nowhere else in 1.1–10.10. If these similarities were not enough to invite comparison between the two units, the narrator makes the comparison explicit at the beginning of ch. 7: ‘These were the chieftains of the tribes; these were the ones who supervised the census’ (v. 2).</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that ch. 7 begins by describing the lay tribes moving toward the tabernacle with valuable gifts. As Dozeman notes, ch. 7 as a whole ‘highlights the tabernacle's central role among the tribes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213475400">41</xref></sup> The tabernacle's centrality is similarly stressed in 1.1–2.34 as it is placed at the geographic center of the tribal divisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213475400">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>I conclude Num. 1.1–2.34 and 7.1–89 are parallel units as evidenced especially in their common listings of the twelve tribes and accompanying tribal chieftains. Indeed, the narrator draws explicit attention to this parallel by stating the otherwise transparent fact that the chieftains in ch. 7 are the same chieftains from chs. 1–2. Simply put, while chs. 1–2 show the chieftains mobilizing the twelve tribes for war, ch. 7 shows these same chieftains mobilizing the tribes for worship.</p>

<title>a. Numbers 3.1–4.46 (B)</title>
<p>Numbers 3.1–4.46 consists of two major subunits: the genealogy of Aaron the priest (3.1–4) and the mobilization of the Levites for service at the tabernacle (3.5–4.49).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213475400">43</xref></sup> I will address the latter subunit first. Here, Yahweh instructs the Levites to be given as servants for the priests in doing the work of the tabernacle (3.5–13). He then explains that the Levites' service is in substitution for the firstborn sons of the lay tribes whom Yahweh claimed for himself by saving them from the plague on the firstborn in Egypt (3.11–13). This is followed by censuses of all male Levites (3.14–39) and the lay firstborn sons (3.40–51) to make the calculations needed for the substitution. With the Levites as a whole thus chosen as tabernacle servants, a second Levite census is then taken (4.1–49). It mobilizes Levites of appropriate age to do the work of transporting the tabernacle and is the goal of the entire larger unit of 3.1–4.49.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089213475400">44</xref></sup> Numbers 3.5–4.49 thus unfolds chiastically:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089213475400">45</xref></sup></p>

<p>Aaron's genealogy in 3.1–4 introduces the reader to the very priests to whom the Levites will be given to serve in 3.5–4.49. The introduction is not strictly necessary, however, as Aaron and his sons are already well known from the narratives of Exodus and Leviticus. The insertion of Moses' name alongside Aaron's name in 3.1 (‘This is the lineage of Aaron and Moses…’) suggests an effort to connect the priests in a special way to the authority of Moses. According to Milgrom, ‘this genealogical notice is a clear attempt to separate the Aaronide line from the rest of the Levites’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089213475400">46</xref></sup> This effort, in addition to placement of the focus on the priests in vv. 1–4 prior to the focus on the Levites in 3.5–4.49, function to reinforce the priests' authority over the Levites. This authority structure is an important part of the camp's organization in 3.5–4.49 and is made explicit as early as 3.6, where Moses is told to bring the Levites ‘before Aaron the priest so they may serve him’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089213475400">47</xref></sup> Thus, although the Levites will be the dominant focus of 3.1–4.49, the initial spotlight on the priests in 3.1–4 reminds readers that the Levites serve only in (subordinate) relationship to the priests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089213475400">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>b. Numbers 8.1–26 (B′)</title>
<p>Numbers 8.1–26 consists of three subunits marked by the introductory speech formula, ‘Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying…’: (1) Aaron's lighting of the tabernacle lampstand (vv. 1–4), (2) the cleansing and induction of the Levites (vv. 5–22), and (3) instruction on the age of Levitical workers (vv. 23–26). Numbers 9.1 also begins with the introductory speech formula, but the addition of chronological and geographical indicators suggests it marks the beginning of a new unit within 1.1–10.10. In addition, the focus shifts away from the priests and Levites in 8.1–26 to the larger community in 9.1–10.10.</p>
<p>Numbers 8.1–4 is a report that largely reiterates previously given instruction for the tabernacle lampstand (cf. Exod. 27.20–21; 30.7–8; Lev. 24.1–4). The lampstand was constructed in Exod. 37.17–24, but its lamps had yet to be set up and lit. Numbers 8.1–4 describes the completion of this task by placing special emphasis on Aaron's faithful execution of Yahweh's instruction to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089213475400">49</xref></sup> The rationale behind the subunit's present location is not clear.

<title>c. Numbers 3.1–4.49 (B) and 8.1–26 (B′) in Relationship</title>
<p>The connection between 3.5–4.49 and 8.5–56 is quite strong. There are numerous instances of verbatim, or near verbatim, repetition in 8.5–26 from 3.5–4.49, many of which are listed below:</p>
<table-wrap id="table4-0309089213475400" position="float">

</table-wrap>
<p>The shared language between these texts is the basis for a shared conceptual focus on the Levites and their tabernacle service. Specifically, Num. 8.5–22 describes the ritual cleansing necessary before the Levites can assume the service outlined in detail in 3.5–4.49. The link between the two subunits is unmistakable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089213475400">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Turning to 3.1–4 and 8.1–4, it is obvious that both focus solely on the priests. This becomes more significant when it is recognized that an exclusive focus on the priests is found only in these two sub-units within Num. 1.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089213475400">51</xref></sup> Additionally, both texts narrate priests performing ritual service in conjunction with the inauguration of the tabernacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089213475400">52</xref></sup> As Milgrom suggests, the lighting of the lampstand is best understood as contingent upon the inauguration of the tabernacle in ch. 7: ‘Only when God began to speak to Moses from the Holy of Holies, after the consecration of the Tabernacle, did Moses receive the final instructions concerning the operation of the menorah’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089213475400">53</xref></sup> The illicit ritual activity of Nadab and Abihu noted in 3.1–4 was likewise part of the inaugural festivities of the tabernacle initially narrated in Leviticus 8–10.</p>
<p>The Numbers account of Nadab and Abihu describes them being killed ‘when they offered strange fire before Yahweh’ (‭ינפל‬ ‭הרז‬ ‭שא‬ ‭םברקהב‬ ‭הוהי‬, v. 4). This description is abbreviated from the full version in Lev. 10.1: ‘They offered before Yahweh strange fire <italic>which he had not commanded them’</italic> (‭םתא‬ ‭הוצ‬ ‭אל‬ ‭רשא‬ ‭ארז‬ ‭שא‬ ‭הוהי‬ ‭ינפל‬ ‭וברקיו‬). The additional clause, ‘which he had not commanded them’, although not included in Numbers 3, is especially prominent in Leviticus and the attentive reader of Numbers would likely call it to mind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0309089213475400">54</xref></sup> But even without the connection to Leviticus, the contrast is clear between the illicit priestly action ‘not commanded’ in 3.1–4 and Aaron's lighting the lampstand in 8.1–4 in full compliance to the divine command: ‘Aaron did so… <italic>just as Yahweh commanded</italic> Moses' (‭הוהי‬ ‭הוצ‬ ‭רשאכ‬…‭השמ־תא‬ ‭ןרהא‬ ‭ןכ‬ ‭שעיו‬).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0309089213475400">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, as noted, the reason for the placement of 8.1–4 is difficult to discern. In light of the observed parallels, however, it is probable that 8.1–4 is placed before the induction of the Levites in 8.5–26 for similar reasons as 3.1–4 is placed before 3.5–4.49. We have seen the location of 3.1–4 gives prominence to the priests, at least in part, to reinforce the hierarchy of the priests over the Levites before an extended focus is given to the Levites (3.5–4.49). The setting up of the lampstand in 8.1–4 likewise functions to reinforce this authority structure. It reminds the reader that the Levites, who will be the focus of 8.5–26, carry out their work only in subordination to the priests. This hierarchy is further evident in ch. 8 in that the Levites are not sanctified for service as the priests are (Exod. 29.7, 21; Lev. 8.12), but merely cleansed in a manner akin to ordinary laypersons (Num. 8.6–7, 15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0309089213475400">56</xref></sup> An important result of this lack of sanctification of the Levites is that they are unfit to enter the holy place. The implication for the placement of 8.1–4 is that this text's view of priestly service inside the holy place functions in sharp contrast to the less privileged service to which the Levites are being inducted in 8.5–22.</p>
<p>I suggest, then, that 3.1–4 and 8.1–4 are linked together by (1) their exclusive focus on Israel's priests placed prior to a lengthier focus on the Levites, (2) their narration of priests performing ritual connected to the inauguration of the tabernacle, (3) their contrasting portrayals of obedient and disobedient priestly ritual behavior, and (4) their function to reinforce the authority of the priests over the Levites.</p>
<p>Numbers 3.5–4.49 and 8.5–26, we have seen, are linked by (1) their focus on the Levites' service at the tabernacle and their cleansing for that service, respectively, (2) their description of the Levites as substitutes for Israel's firstborn, and (3) many additional parallels in language and content.</p>
<p>In comparing the two larger units of 3.1–4.49 and 8.1–26, it is worth observing that in both cases one short subunit focused on the priests (3.1–4 and 8.1–4) is followed by a much lengthier treatment of the Levites in two subunits (3.5–51; 4.1–49 and 8.5–22, 23–26). On the whole, the fact that both 3.1–4.49 and 8.1–26 focus on the service of the Levites, along with the many additional commonalities we have observed, provide substantial reason for seeing the units as a corresponding pair.</p>

<title>4. Numbers 5.1–6.27 (C) and 9.1–10.1 (C)</title>
<sec id="sec11-0309089213475400">
<title>a. Numbers 5.1–6.27 (C)</title>
<p>Numbers 5.1–6.27 consists of the following five clearly demarcated subunits: (1) the expulsion of impure persons from the camp (5.1–4), (2) the repaying of debts in the absence of a kinsman (5.5–10), (3) the test for women suspected of adultery (5.11–31), (4) the Nazirite (6.1–21), and (5) the priestly blessing (6.22–27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0309089213475400">57</xref></sup> The first four begin with the divine speech formula addressed to Moses, followed by the message commission formula used by Yahweh in instructing Moses to ‘command (‭וצ‬)/speak to (‭לא‬ ‭ראד‬) the sons of Israel‘. The fifth subunit begins in precisely the same way, only Yahweh instructs Moses to ‘speak to (‭לא‬ ‭ראד‬) Aaron and his sons’. Aaron and his sons are in turn told to pronounce a blessing upon ‘the sons of Israel’.</p>
<p>The relationship of each of these units to one another and the larger context has long perplexed interpreters. In Noth's estimation, ‘several ordinances of very varied scope and very varied contents have been juxtaposed, with no recognizably close relationships, as far as subject-matter is concerned, either with each other or with what precedes and follows’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0309089213475400">58</xref></sup> On the other hand, many see a unifying rubric in the maintenance of camp purity. After the expulsion of impure persons (5.1–4), according to Dozeman, the next three units deal with ‘three types of relationship within the camp with the power to defile’: general person to person (5.5–10), adulterous (5.11–31) and the Nazirite (6.1–21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0309089213475400">59</xref></sup> As Budd observes, ‘It seems entirely appropriate that the issue [of purity] should be raised here after the detailed discussion of the camp's organization in Num. 1–4. Clearly the point must be established before the march begins.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0309089213475400">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others suggest the role played by priests is a more prominent unifying thread.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0309089213475400">61</xref></sup> However, while priests are clearly significant to the unit, the opening subunit of 5.1–4 only implies the presence of a priest. It is the ‘sons of Israel’ who expel the impure persons (5.4). Whatever the case, the dominant focus of 5.1–6.27, as observed by Knierim and Coats, is the outer camp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0309089213475400">62</xref></sup> The concern of the first four units is for the larger community of Israelite laypersons,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0309089213475400">63</xref></sup> and how its affairs relate to Yahweh's presence in the tabernacle. The concluding priestly blessing appropriately draws together the two threads of the priests and laypersons by highlighting the priests' role in mediating Yahweh's blessing to the whole community.</p>
<p>Most significant for the present argument is that the five units in chs. 5–6 form a larger unit of legislation aimed at managing the community's relationship with Yahweh.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Both the announcement of the temporal and geographical setting in 9.1, and the formal similarity to introductions of major sections in the book (1.1 and 10.11), are strong indications that 9.1 introduces a new unit within 1.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0309089213475400">64</xref></sup> If so, this section likely extends from 9.1 to 10.10<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0309089213475400">65</xref></sup> and thus consists of the following three units: the second Passover ruling (9.1–14), the guidance of the cloud (9.15–23) and the sounding of the trumpets (10.1–10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0309089213475400">66</xref></sup> Although addressing three substantially different topics, these units are joined together, according to Milgrom, to ‘tell of final preparation before the departure from Sinai…’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0309089213475400">67</xref></sup> The second Passover ruling (9.1–14) prepares for departure inasmuch as Israel's departure from Sinai is seen as analogous to its departure from Egypt. The departure texts in both Exodus and Numbers, therefore, are preceded by Passover legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0309089213475400">68</xref></sup> The placement of the following unit on the guidance of Yahweh's cloud (9.15–23) reinforces this ‘replay’ of the exodus. Whereas the guidance of the cloud followed the account of the first Passover (Exod. 13.21–22), so the guidance of the cloud follows the present unit on the second Passover (9.1–14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0309089213475400">69</xref></sup> Olson observes the significance of this sequence in Numbers as preparatory for the march:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Just as the cloud marks a new chapter in Israel's life in the exodus, so too the appearance of the cloud motif after the second Passover in Numbers 9 marks a new and pivotal transition in the life of Israel. The march toward the promised land of Canaan after the reorganization of the holy camp is about to begin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0309089213475400">70</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Finally, the instruction on the trumpets (10.1–10) offers an additional form of guidance. The trumpets will be used both to assemble the community and to prepare the camp to ‘set out’ on the campaign (‭עסנ‬, vv. 2, 5, 6). The threefold use of ‭עסנ‬ looks forward to the departure in 10.11–12 where the Israelites ‘set out…on their journeys’ (‭םהיעםמ‬…‭ועםיו‬).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0309089213475400">71</xref></sup> In this way, the three units of 9.1–10.10 are bound together by a common focus on the departure.</p>
<p>Further coherence may be seen in looking more closely at 9.15–23. As a narrative set between two primarily legal subunits (9.1–14 and 10.1–10),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0309089213475400">72</xref></sup> 9.15–23 appears especially disjunctive. Unlike 5.1–6.27, we do not have a uniform succession of legal units in 9.1–10.10. Nonetheless, I suggest the primary concern of 9.15–23 nicely dovetails with the two texts surrounding it. The narrative places special emphasis on the variation in the schedule of the cloud's movement and Israel's meticulous following of that varied movement. Because the formal narration of departure from Sinai is not given until 10.11–13,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0309089213475400">73</xref></sup> this description of Israel's meticulous obedience in 9.15–23 should be read as an idealistic summary of the coming march.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0309089213475400">74</xref></sup> To understand the function of this summary in its present location, it is important to observe that the description of the movement of Yahweh's cloud (v. 17) is frequently replaced using the language of ‘Yahweh's order’ (‭הוהי‬ ‭יפ‬, lit., ‘mouth of Yahweh’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0309089213475400">75</xref></sup> For example, ‘according to the order of Yahweh they remained camped and according to the order of Yahweh they set out’ (v. 20). As Lee observes, ‘The writer reinforces the concept of Yahweh's guidance by adjoining to it the required obedience on the part of Israel’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0309089213475400">76</xref></sup> In 9.23, Israel's following is ‘according to the order of Yahweh <italic>through Moses’</italic> (‭השמ־דיכ‬ ‭הוהי‬ ‭יפ־לע‬). This exact phrase is used in 4.45 and 49 in reference to Yahweh's verbal instructions spoken to Moses for the Levitical census. The effect of using this language in ch. 9 is that the portrait of Israel following Yahweh's cloud becomes a metaphor for Israel following the entirety of Yahweh's spoken instructions. This suggests a rhetorical function for 9.15–23 that is overtly didactic. The ideal portrait of Israel meticulously following Yahweh's cloud serves to instruct readers not on following a cloud, but rather Yahweh's verbal commands spoken through Moses (cf. 7.89). Such a vision of obedience on the campaign stands in striking contrast to the multiple crises of disobedience that occur almost as soon as the campaign begins (11.1–17.13). How does this relate to the coherence of 9.1–10.10? Because the units on the Passover (9.1–14) and trumpets (10.1–10) present legislation spoken by Yahweh to Moses for the community,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0309089213475400">77</xref></sup> all three units share a concern to instruct the community in ongoing adherence to the divine word. More specifically, it is possible to suggest that 9.1–14 and 10.1–10, both of which begin with the divine speech formula to Moses, be read as prime examples of the kind of verbal commands to which 9.15–23 urges obedience.</p>
<p>Another shared concern of the units in 9.1–10.10 can be seen in a focus on Israel following Yahweh's timing:</p>

<p>The Passover law deals with cases in which participation at the required time (14th of the first month) is deemed impossible. The law on the trumpets addresses their use for signaling the time the community must assemble. And the narrative of Israel following the cloud emphasizes the multiple periods of time the cloud might remain settled over the tabernacle before moving:</p>

<p>For our purposes, it is most important that 9.1–14, 15–23, and 10.1–10 function as part of the larger unit, 9.1–10.10. Although the three subunits are diverse, at minimum they are bound together by their particular focus on the campaign departure and their aim to provide instruction (mostly legislative in nature) for the entire community. When this is recognized, the similarity to the collection of community laws in 5.1–6.27 becomes clear.</p>

<title>c. Numbers 5.1–6.27 (C) and 9.1–10.10 (C′) in Relationship</title>
<p>The message commission formula (‘Command/speak to the sons of Israel…’) used to introduce the subunits in chs. 5–6 (5.2; 5.6; 5.12; 6.2; cf. 6.23) appears midway through 9.1–14 to introduce the second Passover ruling (9.10). Because this formula appears within Numbers 1–10 only in chs. 5–6 and here near the beginning of 9.1–10.10, the reader is given the impression 9.1–10.10 is reintroducing the topic of community legislation last seen in chs. 5–6. Indeed, the concept of impurity, so significant to chs. 5–6, is also reintroduced in this first subunit of 9.1–10.10. The ruling on the second Passover in 9.1–14, just like the expulsion of impure persons in 5.1–4, begins its larger unit with a law addressing the obstacle of ritual impurity (9.6, 7, 10). In 5.1–4, the rationale behind the need to remove impure persons (‭אמט‬ vv. 2, 3) is explicitly stated to lie in Yahweh's presence at the tabernacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0309089213475400">82</xref></sup> Similarly, the obstacle to Passover observance in 9.1–14 is the inability of impure persons (‭אמט‬) to make offerings before Yahweh's presence at the tabernacle. In both places, contact with a corpse is cited as a reason for the impurity prompting the legislation (5.2; 9.7, 10; cf. 6.6). Finally, the terminology of impurity (‭אמט‬) is found only in 5.1–6.27 and 9.1–10.10 within Numbers 1–10.</p>
<p>In a parallel structure, the last unit is usually in the position of prominence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0309089213475400">83</xref></sup> It is here that authors place material they most want to highlight. This literary feature may be important when considering the shift to narrative in 9.15–23. The narrative certainly appears out of place when comparing 9.1–10.10 and 5.1–6.27 as parallel units of legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0309089213475400">84</xref></sup> However, it may be that this genre shift at the center of 9.1–10.10, the last unit within 1.1–10.10, functions to place a special emphasis on the subunit's picture of Israel's meticulous obedience.</p>
<p>Certainly, an important theme within 1.1–10.10 is Israel's full compliance with Yahweh's commands. In stark contrast to the rebellions of chs. 11–25, this opening section offers not a single narrative of disobedience. Rather, it is punctuated by reports of Israel doing everything ‘just as Yahweh commanded’ (‭הוהי‬ ‭הוצ‬ ‭רשאב‬, 1.19, 54; 2.33, 34; 3.16, 42, 51; 4.37, 41, 45, 49 [x2], 5.4; 8.3, 20, 22; 9.5). The ideal vision in 9.15–23 of Israel's obedience in the wilderness continues this theme of compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0309089213475400">85</xref></sup> What is more, however, this vision brings the theme to its climactic summary within the campaign preparation of 1.1–10.10 in that it draws attention to the need for closely following Yahweh's commands, not just at Sinai, but during the campaign ahead.</p>
<p>The endings of both 5.1–6.27 and 9.1–10.10 likewise invite comparison. Both the priestly blessing (6.22–27) and the rules for trumpets (10.1–10) conclude their respective larger units with commands for the sons of Aaron. Priests are to give the blessing (6.23) and sound the trumpets (10.8).</p>
<p>The rules for the trumpets are concluded in 10.9–10, where the reader's horizon is lifted from the imminent departure and placed on the destination of the land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0309089213475400">86</xref></sup> Once in the land, the trumpets are to be used during both war (v. 9) and worship (v. 10). When going to war, the trumpets function as a kind of petition for Yahweh to act in Israel's favor. The stated purpose for their use is that Israel might ‘be remembered (‭רכז‬) before Yahweh [its] God, and delivered from [its] enemies’. In v. 10, the trumpets are to be used during worship feasts as a ‘reminder’ (‭ןורכז‬) for Yahweh to act with favor toward his people (cf. Exod. 2.24; Lev. 23.24). Milgrom notes the trumpets function as ‘instruments of prayer’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0309089213475400">87</xref></sup> Similarly, the priestly blessing is essentially a prayer for Yahweh to act on Israel's behalf. That the blessing is not viewed as somehow magically efficacious is made clear both through the threefold repetition of Yahweh as subject, and by Yahweh's emphatic use of the first person pronoun to conclude the unit: ‘I <italic>myself</italic> will bless them' (‭םכרבא‬ ‭ינאו‬, 6.27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0309089213475400">88</xref></sup> The blessing, then, is merely a means for the priests to petition for Yahweh's favor. Yahweh's own decision to bless has the final say. The fact that such petitions appear only in these two cases argues for hearing the priestly petition through the trumpets (10.9–10) as a clear echo of the priestly petition through the blessing (6.22–27).</p>
<p>Knierim and Coats find the priestly blessing's original setting in ‘the conclusion and culmination of communal worship…’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0309089213475400">89</xref></sup> It is often identified as the blessing Aaron speaks at the conclusion of the tabernacle inauguration service in Lev. 9.22.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0309089213475400">90</xref></sup> Indeed, receiving Yahweh's blessing was in many ways the goal of all Israel's public worship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0309089213475400">91</xref></sup> It is appropriate, then, that just as the priestly blessing in 6.22–27 brings 5.1–6.27 to a conclusion with an accent on public worship, the use of trumpets at the feasts in 10.10 does the same for 9.1–10.10. In both cases, the goal of that worship is Yahweh's benevolent action on behalf of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0309089213475400">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, the priestly blessing and the rules for the trumpets not only conclude their respective larger units, 5.1–6.27 and 9.1–10.10, but also their respective major units (panels), 1.1–6.27 and 7.1–10.10. As a result, both panels end on a note of hope for Yahweh's favor. In each case, this hope is tangibly enacted through priestly ritual. And, inasmuch as 1.1–10.10 is preparation for the campaign to follow, this hope succinctly captures the forward-looking tenor of the entire section. Finally, it is worth noting that while the first panel closes appropriately with a blessing in which the name of Yahweh is central, the second panel closes with the concluding formula ‘I am Yahweh your God’ (10.10).</p>
<p>Returning to Num. 5.1–6.27 and 9.1–10.10, I conclude that these units form a matched pair as evidenced primarily in their focus on community legislation. In fact, law appears only in these two sections within Num. 1.1–10.10.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0309089213475400">93</xref></sup> More specific ties between the two units are found in their use of the message commission formula, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel’, their concern for impurity in the camp and their closing instruction to petition for Yahweh's favor using priestly ritual.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the primary addressees of the six major units (aside from Moses), each panel exhibits a movement from laity, to tabernacle personnel, and back to laity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0309089213475400">94</xref></sup> The priestly blessing (6.22–27) is somewhat anomalous in this regard as it is addressed to Aaron and his sons, yet I have analyzed it to be part of the community legislation in 5.1–6.27. However, the fact that the priests are instructed exclusively to speak the blessing ‘to the sons of Israel’ permits the conclusion that the addressees are also very much the laity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0309089213475400">95</xref></sup> It is possible to account for this two-fold focus by viewing the blessing not only as a conclusion to the first panel but also as a pivot unit for all of 1.1–10.10. The dual address of the lay tribes and priests nicely sits at the center of the two panels alternating between lay and priestly addressees. The central position of the blessing seems to make the point that Yahweh's blessing is the goal not only of Israel's public worship (see above), but also of the entire organization of the camp in Numbers 1–10. In light of the centrality of the tabernacle and its personnel in Numbers 1–10, and the insistence on priestly authority (made prominent in the middle unit of each panel), it is quite appropriate that this pivotal unit presents Yahweh's blessing being mediated to the community by the priests.</p>
<p>This laity-clergy-laity structure at the panel level resembles the aim of the opening unit (1.1–2.46) to arrange the lay tribes around the center of the tabernacle and its personnel (Levites). Indeed, as noted by G. Ogden, the symmetrical structure of ch. 2 mimics the symmetrical arrangement of the camp it describes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0309089213475400">96</xref></sup> When we set aside the introductory summary of Yahweh's instructions (vv. 1–2) and the concluding summary of Israel's compliance (vv. 32–34), the following pattern is evident:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Bellinger correctly observes that ‘Numbers 1–2 illustrate well the theme of [Num. 1–10]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0309089213475400">97</xref></sup> This geographical organization of the war camp, reinforced by the text's literary organization, anticipates the focus of Numbers 1–10 as a whole on organizing the camp for the campaign. ‘The fundamental concern’ of that organizing, according to B. Childs, ‘lies in characterizing the nature of a holy estate, which is set apart absolutely from all profane and unholy elements, and thus provides the proper dwelling within Israel for the presence of God’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0309089213475400">98</xref></sup> Just as ch. 2 envisions Israel's lay tribes centered around the holiness of Yahweh's presence at the tabernacle and its accompanying personnel, so Numbers 1–10 orders the entire camp in relation to Yahweh's holiness at the tabernacle and its primary custodians, the priests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0309089213475400">99</xref></sup> As Israel moves forward from Sinai, maintaining this cultic presence of Yahweh at the camp's center is considered fundamental to the hope voiced at the conclusion to both panels that Yahweh continues to act on the community's behalf. I suggest it is not an accident that, like the literary and geographical vision of the camp in ch. 2, each panel of 1.1–10.10 is arranged with two units focused on Israel's laity surrounding a central unit focused on the tabernacle and its personnel.</p>

Out of 46 commentaries surveyed by D. Olson from 1865 to 1984, 37 identify 1.1–10.10 as the first unit on the highest level of the book; see D. Olson, <italic>The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New: The Framework of the Book of Numbers and the Pentateuch</italic> (BJS, 71; Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985), p. 32.

<list-item><p>Chs. 1–2: the numbering of the tribes, their placement and the order of the march during the journey</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Ch. 4: focus on the tabernacle—revising the roles of the Kohatites in subordination to the sons of Aaron when transporting the tabernacle X Chs. 5–6: regulations requiring priestly monitoring, which include the Sotah ritual and the initiation of the Nazirite. These chapters culminate in the priestly blessing.</p></list-item>

<p>Unfortunately, Leveen does not offer justification for her unit boundaries. There are strong reasons, for example, for seeing chs. 3 and 4 as a single unit. Also, the emphasis on the tabernacle observed in C and C' is quite broad and could be claimed for chs. 1–2 or ch. 8.</p></fn>

Aaron's joint effort with Moses in taking the census (1.17, 44) is his only intervening active characterization. That the high priest executes the ritual as commanded in 8.1–4 comes as something of a relief to the reader, as this is the first narration of ritual duty since the disaster was narrated in Lev 10. Read in this way, the link between Aaron's obedience in Num. 8.1–4 and Nadab and Abihu's disobedience in 3.1–4 is strengthened. Aaron's obedience in 8.1–4 functions both in contrast to the earlier Leviticus account of Nadab and Abihu as well as to the summary of that account in Num. 3.1–4.</p></fn>

Indeed, Num. 9.1–5 describes the celebration of Passover in the second year and thus meets her criteria of narrative as marking out ‘temporal and spatial structure’ <italic>(In the Wilderness</italic>, p. 103). Yet 9.6–14 draws attention to exceptional situations that require an additional ruling. This part of the unit appears to meet her criterion for law as needing to be kept indefinitely. For Douglas, commands that are given within a larger context of narrative can be identified in that they ‘are instructions for tasks to be carried out at once, not to be confused with ordinances to be observed for ever’. Num. 9.10, however, is clear in its application being both for the people and their ‘posterity’ (9.10). This suggests, according to her own definition, that the unit is best categorized as law. According to M. McEntire, whether 9.1–14 is dominantly law or narrative is not a settled question <italic>(Struggling with God: An Introduction to the Pentateuch</italic> [Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 2008], p. 165). Nonetheless, the bulk of the unit is clearly taken up by the exceptional case ruling (so Knierim and Coats, <italic>Numbers</italic>, p. 119).

Thus, while Moses is to make the trumpets (v. 2) and the priests are to sound them (v. 8), it is the people (‘the whole community’ [v. 3], ‘the heads of Israel's troops’ [v. 4], ‘the camp’ [vv. 5, 6]) who are commanded to mobilize when the trumpets are sounded.</p></fn>

Wenham also sees a reference to Israel's feasts based on the subunit's placement after the Passover instruction <italic>(Numbers</italic>, p. 101). If so, the three units in 9.1–10.10 share a more specific concern with the feasts (cf. 10.10 and the discussion below).</p></fn>

Exod. 12.14, 17 where it is ‭םלוע‬ ‭תקת‬; and ‭םלוע‬ ‭תקת‬ in Num. 10.8]). While the Passover statute points backward to Yahweh's initial defeat of Israel's Egyptian enemy, the statute for the trumpets points forward to the defeat of Israel's enemies in the Promised Land (v. 9).</p></fn>

In his study, he does not find ‘the classical symmetry of balance and proportion. Rather the priestly writer seems to be at pains, not only to vary when he repeats, but also to confuse and interlock symmetries, and to disturb balance. The resulting effect is of order underlying chaos, of structure underlying disappearing and broken pattern’ <italic>(Narrative Style</italic>, p. 185).</p></fn>
