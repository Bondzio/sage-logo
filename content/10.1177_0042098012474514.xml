<abstract>
<p>Drawing upon qualitative interviews with women students, this article explores the meaning of ‘class’ and ‘studenthood’ at a ‘new’ university in a large post-industrial town in the north of England. Classed experiences were evident in the way interviewees interpreted the locale predominantly in terms of its ‘working-classness’ and the social problems associated with deindustrialisation. Findings support the accepted notion of a distinct student identity and perceived divides between students and local people based on spatiality, locality, class and student habitus, which also intersected with gender to produce ‘locally specific’ experiences of space and safety within this setting. However, the article confounds the middle-class student and working-class local dichotomy by exploring accounts from a varied sample of women in terms of age, class, ethnicity and domestic background, which reveal alternative university experiences and shifting class relations as a result of deindustrialisation.</p>

<title>Introduction: Students versus Locals in a Post-industrial Setting</title>
<p>This article explores the way in which a town in the north-east of England was encountered and understood by a group of women university students studying at a post-1992 HEI located in the town. The article is based on research which explored fear of crime, gender and the student identity, and evidences powerful subjective readings of place relating to class and deindustrialisation. In both physical and cultural terms, participants’ accounts highlight how the town was predominantly defined as ‘working-class’, with the salience of class evident in the perceived dualism and antagonism between local communities and the student population. Further, the class identity of the town was often interpreted via the consequences of post-industrialisation evident in references to crime, poverty, deprivation and the underclass. The following discussion thus acknowledges and emphasises the significance of locality and the constitution of place identity in producing and reproducing social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012474514">Shields, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>). The town where the research was carried out will be referred to using the pseudonym Northtown throughout the following discussion.</p>
<p>The article offers an original perspective from which to consider economic transformations, social inequality and class relations, as well as offering fresh impetus into the relationship between student populations and local communities. Exploring relations between university students at a post-1992 institution with a wider entry gate and a less ‘traditional’ student identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton, 1999</xref>) departs from viewing the dynamics of student/local relations purely in terms of middle-class students versus working-class local people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474514">Holt and Griffin, 2005</xref>). Findings evidence alternative class dynamics linked to the positioning of a more heterogeneous student group constituting (mostly lower) middle-class and working-class students, which also incorporates variation in age, ethnicity and local identity within a town with a deeply entrenched working-class identity and high levels of deprivation. Thus, although there is evidence of conventional dichotomies between students and local people based on class, the analysis presented here also reveals how a more diverse student population engaged with some of the most socially disadvantaged sections of the working class. In so doing, it emphasises the complexities and transformations of class in late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474514">Bauman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012474514">Beck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012474514">Savage, 2000</xref>) and its continuing salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012474514">Reay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012474514">Shildrick <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, accounts from local, working-class students also offer fresh insights into shifting class relations and varied university experiences, which counter the dominant representation of student-hood as young, mobile and middle-class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>).</p>

<title>Student Identity and Studentification</title>
<p>As a result of widening participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012474514">Dearing, 1997</xref>), student numbers in the UK have grown significantly since the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012474514">Munro <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). And whilst many of the ‘elite’ universities continue to lack diversity in terms of socioeconomic background and ethnicity, remaining characteristically White and middle-class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012474514">Reay <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>), across the sector student populations have become more diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012474514">Leathwood and O’Connell, 2003</xref>). For instance, student numbers at Northtown rose by approximately 55 per cent between 1998 and 2007 with many entrants originating from social classes 4-7 and low participation neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474514">HESA, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012474514">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012474514">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474514">2008</xref>). Formerly smaller and ‘post-92’ higher education institutions have expanded considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012474514">Glasson, 2003</xref>) and now occupy a more visible presence in the towns where they are situated and are key players in regional economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012474514">Cross and Pickering, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Students have been recognised as a distinct and ‘exclusive’ population in terms of lifestyle, routine and habitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474514">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012474514">Sage <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), often residing in concentrated pockets of university towns and cities and dominating particular residential areas; leading to what has been termed ‘studentification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012474514">Munro <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474514">Hubbard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012474514">Sage <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Local residents are often hostile to high concentrations of student residences with studentification largely viewed as a negative phenomenon linked to the devaluation of housing stock, physical and social disorder and community decline, which may exacerbate tensions between ‘town and gown’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474514">Hubbard, 2008</xref>). It is difficult to determine the extent to which studentification has occurred within Northtown. Certainly student numbers have increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012474514">HESA, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012474514">2008</xref>); however, analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012474514">Munro <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> suggests that students represent a small proportion of the general population of Northtown and its adjoining conurbations, defined as a primary urban area (PUA), with no evidence of intense studentification. This may be explained by the high proportion of local students at Northtown, originating from both the PUA itself and also those who commute from other parts of the north-east region. Thus, there is no sense that students have taken over specific areas and become segregated from the local population. Anecdotally, however, from the late 1990s onwards, students have become a visible presence within physical and leisure spaces around the campus and the town centre of Northtown. And in a compact town centre where students do not colonise large areas, smaller-scale instances of spatial exclusion may occur. In terms of accommodation, non-local students reside in three local authority wards located close to the university campus, which at ward level are some of the poorest and most deprived areas in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012474514">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton (1999)</xref> argues that, as a result of widening participation, the typical or ‘traditional’ student identity defined in terms of class, age and migration to university only now exists at ‘old’ universities. This type of student identity is distinct and unitary, setting students apart from other social groups. Chatterton argues that ‘non-traditional’ students are less distinct because they occupy multiple roles and identities other than student and are less likely to move away to study. However, a visible student identity is likely to occur at both old and new institutions where groups of younger, non-local students identify as students and lead a more typical student lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012474514">Platt, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012474514">Munro <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref> refer to different ‘types’ of student cities and one of the aims of the following discussion is to show, whilst also considering the diversity of this student population, how a ‘distinct’ student identity is played out in a different ‘type’ of university town defined primarily via its classed past and post-industrial present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, the ‘distinct’, albeit diverse nature of the student identity may lead to students’ status as a vulnerable group in relation to crime. Concern about such vulnerability is evident within media reports and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042098012474514">Travis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012474514">Shaftoe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012474514">Curtis, 2003</xref>), with research findings indicating that student populations may be (more) vulnerable to ‘public’ forms of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012474514">Kershaw <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012474514">Barberet <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), relating to lifestyle, material circumstances and the possible targeting of students. The fact that this research was carried out with women also has implications for these findings, given the significance of gender to fear, perceptions of safety and access to public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012474514">Painter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098012474514">Valentine, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012474514">Koskela, 1999</xref>). Gendered experiences of space and what could be termed gendered fears were varied within the data and were not necessarily attributable to student and non-local identities, but were explicitly gendered in terms of fears about physical and sexual violence and experiences of sexual harassment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012474514">Wattis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In this way, the data further emphasise the complexities and ambiguities of exploring fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098012474514">Sparks, 1992</xref>) and how it links to gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012474514">Koskela, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Class, ‘Post-class’ and Place</title>
<p>Clearly, class is not what it once was. Social and economic transformations have altered the way in which class is lived and realised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012474514">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012474514">Bauman, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012474514">2001</xref>). However, there is now a large body of work which stresses the cultural as well as economic nature of classed identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012474514">Savage <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474514">Lawler, 2005</xref>). The power of class to define, demarcate and ‘other’ appears endemic to lived experience and the way we value ourselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098012474514">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012474514">Reay, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012474514">2006</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012474514">Lawler (2005)</xref> observes, the working classes are now condemned via distinction in terms of their inferior knowledge and taste rather than merely through poverty. Further, the psychic and affective dimensions of class at the level of the individual have been identified as an alternative form of class consciousness, significant in the contemporary production and reproduction of classed selves and classed others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012474514">Reay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012474514">Reay <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if the cultural and psychic approaches to class counter post-modern claims that class is no longer relevant, large-area indicators of poverty, inequality and social mobility in the UK show that structural inequities remain salient despite the conditions of transformed modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098012474514">OECD, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012474514">Dorling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012474514">Harkness <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Amidst claims about the ‘end of class’, neo-liberal economic policy has rendered paid work increasingly unstable and uncertain, reconfiguring the working class via the marginalisation of certain sections of the former industrial class from post-industrial labour markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012474514">MacDonald <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>) and leading to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012474514">Wacquant (2008</xref>, p. 240) terms ‘advanced marginality’. Thus, class distinctions are drawn between the most marginalised who represent the starkest embodiment of the classed other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>) as the <italic>underclass</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012474514">Murray, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Processes of deindustrialisation and class realignment are inextricably linked to places and regions whose identities are shaped by their industrial past and more recent economic transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098012474514">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). As Nayak notes, former working-class cultures do not dissipate in the face deindustrialisation, but retain elements of their working-class heritage, which are refashioned as part of the post-industrial present as a “cultural text upon which the previous inscriptions of past cultures continue to be etched into the present” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>, p. 828). The fate of towns in the north of England as a result of economic restructuring is mixed. Note the transformation of Leeds from a manufacturing centre into a northern hub for financial services, awash with designer shops, boutique hotels and smart restaurants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012474514">Learning and Skills Council, 2006</xref>). Other places have not managed to regenerate so effectively. The setting for this research is a large town in the north of England. Once an industrial heartland, more recently the town has suffered as a result of deindustrialisation and economic decline with high rates of unemployment and claimant counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012474514">ONS, 2010</xref>). Indicators highlight the town as having some of the highest levels of poverty in the country, with individual wards demonstrating particularly acute problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012474514">2</xref></sup> Social problems are evident in the wards in the central area of the town where the university is situated and the majority of students live. The town centre area has a ‘place identity’ inherently linked to high rates of social exclusion, high crime and physical and social disorder, demonstrating high crime rates recorded at ward level, and problems with disorder and incivilities. These research findings reflect how working-class culture and its transformation as a result of economic decline were highly visible features of place in Northtown. These aspects of place dominate the overall image of the town highlighting a powerful but unitary representation of place, which Shields argues<disp-quote>
<p>result from stereotyping, which oversimplifies groups of places within a region, or from prejudices towards places or their inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012474514">Shields, 1991</xref>, p. 60).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This may be because historically, heavy industry and working-class culture have dominated this locality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098012474514">Warren, 1974</xref>) and arguably represent a greater segment of the town’s cultural life than was the case even for other northern towns and cities with a strong industrial and working-class heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012474514">Darnell and Evans, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>After discussing methods and sample, the article will go on to explore how respondents engaged with Northtown primarily via its industrial heritage and the consequences of deindustrialisation in terms of deprivation and crime. The article will then consider how class, locality and the student identity construct an imagined separation between students and local people—both socially and spatially—resulting in the depiction of local people as threatening Other and the source of fears relating to crime, incivilities and disorder. How this intersects with gender to produce ‘locally specific’ gendered fears is also considered. The final part of the paper focuses on local women’s experiences, which highlights alternative experiences of both class and studenthood.</p>

<title>Methods and Sample</title>
<p>Forty-two women were interviewed for this project. The sample is diverse, reflecting the student population in this research setting: women were aged between 18 and 46; six of the sample identified themselves as Asian; six identified as lesbian; five of the women were international students from EU countries and twenty-five of the women were not ‘local’ to the area. Establishing what constitutes ‘being local’ is problematic; this study defined participants’ local identity as those who came from the town itself and those living in towns which were part of the same urban conurbation. However, several of the women commuted from out of the area but from within the north-east region. Most of the women interviewed were undergraduates on full-time courses or recent graduates at the time of interview. However, one woman was studying part-time, three women were postgraduates and two were former students who had stayed on in the town and now had jobs. The sample consisted of women from both middle-class (17 women) and working-class backgrounds (25 women) with class position established according to family background, whilst acknowledging the complexities of determining women’s class position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012474514">Abbott and Sapsford, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Biographical research in particular has recognised the impact of the researcher’s own biography and experience on all stages of the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042098012474514">Temple, 1996</xref>). However, it is clear that across social science research, autobiography/ethnography will shape the formulation of research, data gathering and analysis, and how findings are represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098012474514">Stanley, 1993</xref>). Thus, the researcher’s own experience of the town’s association with class, deindustrialisation, crime and disorder, as well as an awareness of attitudes towards students in the town had shaped an interest in themes around safety, space and well-being linked to gender and the student identity. The research used in-depth, qualitative interviews to explore fear of crime and crime experiences, and how these connected to locality and identity.</p>

<title>A University in a Post-industrial Setting</title>
<p>The university in Northtown has contributed to improving town centre public spaces via the redevelopment and expansion of the town centre campus, which has involved the regeneration of spaces surrounding the campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012474514">Charles <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Historically, the university has worked in partnership with local heavy industries to tailor courses to the demands of the local job market. More recently, it has pledged its support to the local economy with a variety of initiatives aimed at supporting and growing digital and ‘new media’ industries, as well as developing a ‘cultural quarter’ and assisting SMEs and graduate business start-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012474514">Cross and Pickering, 2008</xref>). It has a strong record on widening participation, recruiting local students from a region characterised by deprivation and low rates of entry into higher education, with an emphasis on engagement with local communities, schools and FE colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012474514">Charles <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, many of those interviewed felt there was a lack of acceptance of the university and students. This may derive from the image of students as a social group set apart from the rest of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012474514">1984</xref>) and the general negation of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012474514">Platt, 2001</xref>). It may also relate to anti-intellectualism and low educational attainment associated with working-class culture and ‘being working class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098012474514">Willis, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012474514">Lea and Young, 1984</xref>). As one Asian mature student put it<disp-quote>
<p>I mean I don’t know whether the town accepts itself as a, or lends itself to being a university town (Farrah, 34, non-local but lived in Northtown for 18 years).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As with many university towns, there has been a growth in the night-time leisure industry aimed at the student market. Commercial expansion in this sector has come about due to a realisation amongst national pub chains that student populations have increased and now represent a significant consumer group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>). However, some women commented that despite extensive commercial leisure and consumption opportunities, the town did not demonstrate an ‘authentic’ acceptance and accommodation of students<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not the worst, well I don’t know if it’s the worst place really. But I mean somewhere like Queens would be brilliant to come to university. They’ve really got their whole own community up near their university. Like you’ve got a bit like The Golden Mile in Belfast–Shaftesbury Square, and the top part of that is just dead studenty. There’s no problem going to the bottom half like, but the top has just got like cafés that stay open late; it’s got little studenty clubs and cafés and stuff, second-hand bookshops and stuff. I mean that would be very nice (Olivia, 26, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was an acknowledgement that, besides lots of pubs and clubs, the town lacked the authentic and varied cultural provision. Clearly, Northtown is a less ‘typical’ university town aesthetically and culturally. Nevertheless, the data indicate that younger students (mostly non-local, but not exclusively), despite their recognition of the area’s problems, still appeared to enjoy their university experience. Generally, the university campus was viewed as providing students with a positive setting for learning and social activities. Unsurprisingly, students perceived the university campus to be a safe and comfortable space which often contrasted with more negative views of others parts of the town centre.</p>
<p>The university is situated in close proximity to the town centre and the campus is encircled by terraced housing, a main road leading out of the town centre and the edge of the town’s main shopping area. The physical layout of the campus means there is no sense of ‘enclosure’; the university is in no way ‘set apart’ from the rest of the town—a characteristic of many other campuses in the UK. As a result, non-university individuals and university staff and students interact regularly both on campus and in the surrounding area of the town in a concentrated area of physical space.</p>

<title>Observing Class and Deindustrialisation</title>
<p>Respondents’ attitudes towards the town and specifically the town centre highlight how the area was predominantly interpreted via its industrial economy—both past and present—where ‘place culture’ was understood strongly in terms of ‘working-classness’ and the effects of industrial decline on local communities. This was observed in relation to physical space—the industrial landmarks which constitute distinctive features of the town’s topography as well as in many references to working-class culture<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve learnt that in Northtown I mean it is, it’s still industrial so-to-speak and there is a huge working-class community and you have to relate to that, that kind of community and you have to speak their language more or less <bold>(</bold>Sinead, 26, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Links were made between the town’s established working-class culture and how this had been reshaped by deindustrialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098012474514">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>). Thus, many accounts referred to the consequences of economic decline in the town such as poverty, unemployment, deprivation and crime<disp-quote>
<p>Aye because if you walk up Main Road everything costs a fortune and nobody has any money and then you go up the town and see all the wee people in their tracksuits running about the shops nicking everything. But it’s no really their fault because there’s high unemployment, so I would say that’s why there is high crime and I think it’s a consequence of everything shutting down, all the heavy industry, there’s nothing else come to replace it (Heather, 28, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many women referred to physical and social disorder and incivilities; often not direct experiences of criminal victimisation, but negative encounters with rude and aggressive local people. They also talked about seeing beggars, prostitutes and drug addicts in public space. Some women referred to families, the inadequate care of children and the existence of lone mothers within the town. As Marianne, a French woman put it: “I was very shocked by the family in Northtown”. The concept of the underclass and its existence is highly contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012474514">MacDonald <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>); it is used to label certain social groups as amoral, dependent on benefits and criminal, without acknowledging the impact of structural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012474514">Bagguley and Mann, 1992</xref>). Some participants had picked up on the signs of deprivation within their immediate surroundings and interpreted them via underclass discourses. Although there was some understanding that the town’s problems had come about as a result of deindustrialisation, local residents in central Northtown were nevertheless viewed as a poor, marginalised group, potentially criminal, lacking in aspiration and disinterested in education, which are key features of underclass theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012474514">Murray, 1990</xref>). Taken together, working-class and ‘post-class’ features constituted the overall image of the town for many interviewees.</p>

<title>Class, Studenthood, Space and Fear</title>
<p>Research findings reveal a diverse range of experiences, which counter the middle-class student set against the working-class local dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474514">Holt and Griffin, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, accounts also question the privileging of the young, mobile, middle-class student mode of studenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">2009b</xref>) and reveal the diversity of some student populations. However, there was a core group of younger, non-local students (mostly from upper-working-class and lower-middle-class backgrounds) who did fit a more traditional model of studenthood, contradicting the idea that this can only exist at older, élite institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton, 1999</xref>). Most of this group viewed themselves as distinct from the local community alongside whom they lived in the centre of the town. The demarcation of difference was shaped by the lifestyle and habitus of students, local identity and class. Students are viewed as separate in general due to differing employment and leisure patterns, and temporal and spatial routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>) and it is inevitable that not being long-term residents sets students apart. Local and ‘being local’ can be understood in terms of the way in which common identity and culture derive from shared geographical locations where “frequently strong distinctions are drawn between local and the non-local” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042098012474514">Urry, 1995</xref>, p. 73) and in this setting may compound divides between students and local people<disp-quote>
<p>’Cos I hear a lot of comments about, they call them the locals don’t they? And so yeah, there’s obviously some perception that they’re a very different group of people (Anita, 24, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are also class dynamics at work here. As Holdsworth (2009, p. 228) observes: “References to ‘student’ are often shorthand for white, middle-class and mobile”. As Rachel, 21, commented<disp-quote>
<p>I definitely do think that they think we’ve probably got rich parents who are giving us money … They think that we’re probably middle-class people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some women also articulated this in relation to style, taste and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1997</xref>). Comments were made that the town was a ‘low-class’ place, inhabited by ‘rough’, ‘scruffy’ people and ‘scallies’ whose appearance was defined in terms of tracksuits and big gold jewellery (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009b</xref>). It was also felt that locals were more likely to go to ‘tackier’ and more downmarket pubs and clubs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474514">Holt and Griffin, 2005</xref>). Localism and ‘working-classness’ were also associated with a lack of diversity and narrow-mindedness, which was linked to hostility towards students. Often this translated into ‘the local’ being viewed as threatening, resulting in feelings of visibility, vulnerability and fear amongst students<disp-quote>
<p>Fresher’s week is a nightmare. There was three knife attacks on Main Road for money and all sorts. And it’s just quite frightening ’cos they can spot, it’s like they seem to spot students. You get this fear that they know who you are. They know you’re a student, they’re going to jump on you. It’s not as bad now … well I’ve been here like four years. It’s not as bad as, as first year (Elena, 21, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several women referred to feeling visible, not belonging and standing out within the locale, which was attributed to the visibility of the student identity. This may relate to the way specific elements of student culture, lifestyle and identity are produced and reproduced within the academic and social spaces which students inhabit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012474514">Sage <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), resulting in the construction of a visible embodied student identity not definable in any straightforward sense. As one woman put it: “It’s hard to put a description on it, but it’s there”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474514">Moran and Skeggs (2004)</xref> explore visibility and the comfortable occupation of public space using notions of the ‘local’ and the ‘cosmopolitan’ to determine how different locales shape spatial experiences. The ‘local’ is defined by a lack of cultural diversity where ‘difference’ stands out and is rendered visible; the ‘cosmopolitan’, on the other hand, is linked to plurality, belonging and acceptance. The visibility of the ‘local’ is then linked to fear as “this is the idea of homogeneity as danger and insecurity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474514">Moran and Skeggs, 2004</xref>, p. 111). Interestingly, these women students were much more likely to attach a sense of visibility to their identity as students rather than to feminine subjectivity/ies, which are often cast as out of place in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012474514">Stanko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, anti-student visibility and vulnerability appeared to interact with a ‘fear of place’ derived from actual encounters with physical and social disorder, incivilities and victimisation. For instance, the visibility of begging, drug use and street prostitution was often mentioned. Furthermore, a mixture of crime ‘discourses’ such as the vicarious victimisation of others, crime ‘stories’, ‘myths’ and local folklore served to establish the town’s high crime status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012474514">Smith, 1986</xref>). Fears also related to students being specifically targeted for victimisation by local people; in particular, respondents feared mugging and burglary. In terms of actual victimisation, eight students living in the town centre had been burgled. In addition, one woman had had her door broken down by the father of local children; another recalled how a gang of local youths had attempted to get into the house and had smashed the window. Several women had had cars stolen or broken into.</p>

<title>The Problem of Space (or Lack of It)</title>
<p>In this setting, contested space between local people and students may be heightened because of the compact nature of physical space. Students in Northtown do not have their own specific ‘area’ or ‘studentland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012474514">Hubbard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012474514">Sage <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), but they occupy small pockets of space contained within impoverished neighbourhoods surrounding the town centre. Thus, daily routines involve regular interaction with local residents in limited physical space<disp-quote>
<p>It seems to be that the main area of the working-class area or whatever area you want to call it is congregated densely around the city centre so it’s very difficult to get away from it, especially with the university being so close and cheaper accommodation. But I suppose that comes with anything, I find, but you can certainly get out; what I experience in Manchester is that you can easily get away from it, you know you can go to an area where you know the shopping centres in the town centre they’re not, they’re full of mixtures of people, but you walk through the shopping centre here and it’s like what I said earlier, people forget their manners, but you’ll get a mixture of that in Manchester (Alison, 21, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The perception that students and local people represent distinct and separate social groups, coupled with the view that local people are hostile towards students, is a product of socio-spatial relations within the town. It is likely that students in this particular setting may experience exclusion via discourses of fear and safety, as well as notions of ‘being out of place’ in certain spaces. Further, locals may be excluded via the visible presence of students and the growth of student-orientated leisure venues within the town (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012474514">Chatterton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>). In this way, ‘spatial exclusion’ is a two-way process, experienced by both social groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012474514">Skeggs (1999)</xref> observes that claims made on space are always based upon identity, where different identities in different contexts provide individuals with the ability to ‘access’ particular spaces ‘legitimately’ based on the possession of ‘social capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012474514">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). Within this setting, local people living in the centre of Northtown can be viewed as possessing ‘alternative’ cultural capital due to their local identity—thus granting them access to social space in the town. Students, on the other hand, possess more ‘conventional’ forms of capital; however, lacking alternative capital may render access to space problematic in terms of fear, safety and belonging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">Holdsworth (2009b</xref>, p. 228) argues that, even where student identities are not wholly distinct and exclusive, to construct them in this way is part of the process by which social groups constitute themselves in urban space in terms of “differentiation and collectivism”.</p>

<title>Intersections with Gender</title>
<p>Clearly, one’s positioning as an outsider in a post-industrial, urban setting will impact differently on men and women. However, I would argue that it does not represent a gendered experience in the same way as sexual harassment, fear of sexual violence and self-surveillance in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012474514">Stanko, 1997</xref>). These are essentially gendered phenomena in that they are experienced by women and the perpetrators are men. Place-based social disorder may be a concern for both male and female students and, given the public nature of such experiences, male students may be more at risk from aggressive working-class young men in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatterton and Hollands, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>). It is evident that certain places intensify gendered fears and research findings evidence how ‘locally produced’ fears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012474514">Stanko, 1997</xref>) shaped gendered fears and practices. As Alison, 21, commented: “It’s not like other places where you can walk down the street at night on your own”. Further, when non-local women discussed experiences of sexual harassment and fear of sexual violence, the threat was viewed in terms of being from local men outside the student community.</p>
<p>General criminal threat is frequently constructed in media, political and academic discourses as originating from the unknown Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098012474514">Jefferson and Hollway, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012474514">Jewkes, 2004</xref>). Similarly with gendered fear, media discourses, parental fears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098012474514">Valentine, 1992</xref>), crime prevention advice which focuses on public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012474514">Stanko, 1997</xref>) and ‘myths’ regarding the perpetrators of sexual violence<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012474514">3</xref></sup> encourage women to fear the unknown stranger in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012474514">Stanko, 1997</xref>). These findings echo fear of the stranger both in students’ construction of the criminal as ‘local other’ and in how several women students viewed gendered threat as originating from local men. Findings highlight how women’s fears are mediated by locality and the student identity, which both amplifies but also suppresses the impact of gendered identity on crime experiences and fear of crime.</p>

<title>Moving beyond Taken-for-granted Dichotomies of Class and Studenthood</title>
<p>Accounts from local women in particular reveal the varied backgrounds and biographies of many students in Higher Education, which has implications for how we view studenthood and the university experience. The sample of local women was diverse in terms of age, ethnicity and domestic circumstances. In addition, some women disclosed chaotic and difficult family backgrounds, involving homelessness, being in care and domestic violence from fathers and current partners. One woman discussed attempting suicide. Many women were carers for children, but one woman was caring for her disabled elderly mother. Several of these women were also single parents. This diversity valorises the experiences of students who do not fit the conventional image of the student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>), revealing less straightforward routes to university and experiences of studenthood.</p>
<p>Some views expressed were consistent with those of non-local students. For instance, the focus on crime and locality was strong across all sections of the sample. Local working-class women also disassociated with sections of the local community they viewed as ‘dodgy’, poorer, rougher, etc. This resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak’s (2006)</xref> work, where ‘respectable’ working-class young men made distinctions between themselves and the undeserving, socially and economically marginalised sections of the working-class. Indeed, as Skeggs observes, deindustrialisation “has led to a reordered working class, which informs distinctions <italic>within</italic> the working-class” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1997</xref>, p.76; emphasis added) and which confuses conventional class distinctions. This type of distinction was commonplace in local women’s accounts<disp-quote>
<p>I mean Northtown people and Northtown town centre seem oh dead rough don’t they? The Kappa [sportswear brand] people, as everyone calls them. No I don’t like, I don’t actually know that many people who are local to Northtown, as in the town centre (Elaine, 21, local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interviews with local women show how studenthood is cross-cut by other aspects of identity to produce varied university experiences. Some younger local students appeared to embrace student life wholeheartedly, living in student houses, making lots of friends and adopting a student social life. Older women with caring responsibilities did not socialise and adopt the student lifestyles due to age and domestic commitments. However, some older women with children discussed forming supportive friendship groups with women in similar circumstances, highlighting alternative and meaningful university experiences which do not revolve around being young and away from home (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">2009b</xref>). The alternative benefits of coming to university are powerfully evoked in the following quote from single parent Daniella, 23<disp-quote>
<p>I get out. I get out, I get away from the kids. Not that they’re horrible or anything but just meeting new people as well, instead of just being in that environment in [large council estate] where I just hate nearly everybody anyway … Yeah you get out, make new friends see the real life rather than just sitting on your arse on the dole.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Daniella’s comments highlight a highly classed experience of studenthood as a means of escape from domestic life and the caring role in a multiply deprived neighbourhood. Indeed, other women’s experiences relating to gender violence, the caring role and lone parenthood emphasise how class, gender and studenthood intersect to produce a distinct experience for working-class students (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012474514">Leathwood and O’Connell, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some younger women did not participate in student life beyond their studies. This was generally because they had established groups of friends and did not feel the need. However, this was also shaped by ethnicity. One young Asian woman did not socialise with other students in the conventional sense because she could not go out at night unless accompanied by a male family member. Local women who participated in student life did tend to separate student life from other local friends. One woman commented that friends had stereotypical views of students: “they have this impression you’re going to get gothics and stuff” (Elaine, 22). Indeed, several women discussed the misconception of students as ‘goths’ or indie types, when in fact many now follow more mainstream cultural forms, which involve mass drinking in commercial bars and night-time leisure venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012474514">Chatteron and Hollands, 2003</xref>). Some women did discuss antipathy towards some of the more typical younger, middle-class students. Heather was an interesting example of disassociation from other students. She was a 27-year-old working-class student who was not local and was originally from the central belt in Scotland—an area which had suffered a similar fate in terms of deindustrialisation to the north-east of England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012474514">Hughes, 1992</xref>). Most of her student friends were local women and one of her closest friends was a young local woman she worked with as a breakfast waitress in a hotel. In the following quote, her frustration with younger, non-local students in terms of age and more typical student culture is evident, but there is a class element here<disp-quote>
<p>They’re no good socially, go out with them at the weekend and all they do is stare at boys and dinne talk, they’ve no personality. I think it’s their age. But saying that, the wee girl from work that I work with in the hotel is only 17 and we went to the pictures last night. She’s fine and like all the students I know that are at Uni are from [local area] … that’s who I go drinking with, people like that, like [names local housing estate]. Folk like me actually that are quite poor [laughs] and mature students aye (Heather 27, non-local).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These comments represent the opposite of the working-class ‘disidentification’ which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs (1997)</xref> refers to. Heather distances herself from younger middle-class students and identifies with local working-class women from similar backgrounds in a much more positive way.</p>
<p>For working-class students, entering the unfamiliar habitus of higher education may provoke emotional conflicts such as “disquiet, ambivalence, insecurity and uncertainty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012474514">Reay <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, p. 1105). Writing on this theme has focused on students’ experiences at élite universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012474514">Reay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012474514">Reay <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). However, several accounts from these findings show that even at ‘modern’ universities, academic and student discourse and habitus can be alien worlds for working-class students. The following comments from Daniella show that emotional conflicts and compromises can be experienced by students in less élitist Higher Education settings<disp-quote>
<p>The first six months into the course I said something to [boyfriend] and he went “ooh university talk”. I went “I’ll have to learn to switch off” … I know I really have got to.

<p>Daniella may not experience “the shock of the élite” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012474514">Reay <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>, p. 1107) at Northtown University but nevertheless for this single parent on benefits embedded in the sub-cultures of the large housing estate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012474514">MacDonald <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), there is a marked difference in the two worlds she encounters and she clearly feels compromised as she moves between the spaces of home and university. Again, this counters the notion that the dynamics and relations of studenthood operate purely in terms of middle-/working-class dichotomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012474514">Holt and Griffin, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To an extent, the themes discussed here reflect general issues encountered by non-local students living and studying in university towns across the UK. The distinct nature of the student identity, alongside negative stereotypes about students and their positioning as an outsider community, means that they may inevitably encounter hostility from local communities, live in economically disadvantaged areas with high crime rates and may be vulnerable to victimisation and fear of crime. Thus, such experiences are not necessarily a locally specific problem and reflect a common student experience. However, as has been noted by writers across cultural geography and the criminology of crime and place, the distinct features of place and localised experience are crucial to the dynamics of social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042098012474514">Smith, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012474514">Shields, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012474514">Sparks <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098012474514">Taylor <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). For most of the research participants (non-local and local) who took part in the study, the town was understood in terms of its industrial heritage, its ‘working-classness’ and deindustrialisation. Respondents used underclass discourses to refer to local communities living in the town centre, with frequent references to problems with crime, poverty and disorder within the town. Taken together, these features produce a compelling and all-encompassing image of the town. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak (2006)</xref> observes, the former identity of such locales does not simply disappear in the face of economic and cultural transformation; rather, their place-identity is shaped by the industrial past as well as the post-industrial present.</p>
<p>This reading of place shaped the negotiation of space and safety for non-local students in this setting. For instance, students talked about standing out as students with some respondents connecting this to fear and vulnerability in public space. This may relate to a lack of cultural diversity, which has been linked to heightened visibility in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012474514">Moran and Skeggs, 2004</xref>), as well as perceived hostility from local people and the construction of locals and students as distinct and divergent communities. Although ‘town versus gown’ may be a general problem, it is likely to be more pronounced in a setting such as this due to a strong sense of classed and local identity. The shoring-up of difference in this way has been identified as a necessary mechanism for the establishment of identity and the organisation of social relations in urban space—even if identity/ies are not necessarily so fixed and dichotomised in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009b</xref>). In this setting, local people represent a distinct group from students, and are constructed as problematic amidst connections to crime and other social problems. To an extent, this relates to the differing class positions of middle-class students and the local White working-class community who live alongside them. Social groups constructed as different in terms of class and ethnicity (class in this context) become the objects of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012474514">Merry, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012474514">Sibley, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">Holdsworth (2009b)</xref> argues that often hostility from local people towards students is vicarious and assumed rather than direct. These findings support this view; however, they also highlight direct experiences of disorder and incivility which shape fears and reinforce the ‘Othering’ of local people and which intersect with gender in ‘locally produced’ experiences of crime, fear and space. Further, the article identifies the role of physical space as a ‘mediator’ of social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012474514">Shields, 1991</xref>); it is argued that the experiences of class and deindustrialisation described here are more pronounced because of limited physical space which students share with local communities.</p>
<p>Yet, given the diversity of the student population in terms of class, age, ethnicity and local identity in this context, it is inaccurate to speak of students and local people in dualistic terms—especially as a large proportion of students at the university were local to the town. Indeed, the discussion highlights how working-class local students also participated in processes of disidentification with local communities perceived as ‘rough’, ‘dodgy’, undeserving, etc., reflecting shifts in working-class categorisation and identification as a result of deindustrialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012474514">Skeggs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012474514">Nayak, 2006</xref>). Local women’s accounts also reflect alternative experiences of higher education and studenthood which subvert the privileging of the young, middle-class, mobile student as the dominant representation of the university experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012474514">Holdsworth, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012474514">2009b</xref>). In this way, this setting provides a useful backdrop from which to explore the myriad of student experiences, which destabilise conventional class-based notions of ‘town versus gown’, as well as shifting class relationships both amongst students and between students and local communities.</p>
