<sec id="sec1-1462474512473083"><title>Tom Daems, <italic>Making Sense of Penal Change</italic>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2008; 299 pp. (including index): 9780199559787</title>
<p>Commenting recently on his role as Sigmund Freud in the movie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474512473083"><italic>A Dangerous Method</italic> (2011)</xref>, Viggo Mortensen refers to the manner in which personality drove the theoretical differences between the film’s two main protagonists, Freud and Jung. Freud, a Viennese Jew, took issue with the more mystical direction in which Jung, the Swiss son of a Protestant pastor, sought to take the emerging psychoanalytic discipline. The same observation regarding personality-driven theory could in all likelihood be made about contemporary criminologists, yet this is not something which has been the subject of any detailed study – until now. Tom Daems’ book, <italic>Making Sense of Penal Change</italic>, aims to address the situation where there are ‘hardly, if any, book-length treatments of the life-courses of the brightest minds in criminology’s intellectual history’ (p. 231). His detailed review of the work of penal theorists David Garland, John Pratt, Hans Boutellier and Loïc Wacquant is unique in its ‘author-oriented’ or ‘vertical’ approach to the subject of penal change or, more specifically, the collection of changes in the quantity and quality of punishment sometimes referred to as the ‘new punitiveness’. The essential difference between this approach and the more conventional ‘horizontal’ study of the phenomenon in the literature, concerns the close attention to the individual’s development as an author as well as the arguments themselves. The technique, therefore, is ‘as much about the author as the story that he brings’ (p. 12).</p>
<p>Daems’ book deals first with the rationale for this new methodology and his choice of authors before proceeding in Chapters 2–5 to elaborate the arguments made by the respective authors over their life course. Each of these chapters contains a discussion of the <italic>oeuvre</italic> of the authors before concluding with a section on their role as a public intellectual. Garland appears to come off best from this assessment having persuaded Daems of the usefulness of a multidimensional sociology of punishment (namely, his reliance on a number of authors and theoretical perspectives in <italic>The Culture of Control</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474512473083">Garland, 2001</xref>)), in providing a coherent framework for understanding the complex field of penality. For Daems, ‘taking the inherent complexity of punishment and penal change as its point of departure may… be the most fruitful starting point for a proper understanding of punishment and penal change’ (p. 250), not least because it is true to the empirical object. In his view, all three of the remaining authors do violence to the object of study through the use of various ‘extra scientific’ means of persuasion. Wacquant, for example, turns his gaze from other, less appalling developments than the mass incarceration of black people in certain US states, in order to persuade the reader of the evils of the neo-liberal <italic>doxa</italic>. The book finishes with a chapter on ‘persuasive’ criminology in which Daems makes a plea for an ‘anti-political’ discipline, steering a course between the Scylla of an apolitical or ‘tame’ criminology and the Charybdis of political activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512473083">Burawoy (2005)</xref> gets a dishonourable mention here).</p>
<p>Overall, this book is worth reading by all criminologists for the important questions it raises about the way we approach our work. To what degree can we claim to be intellectually honest in our work, especially when revising or abandoning a position we previously espoused? Are we guilty of choosing ‘not to know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474512473083">Fishman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474512473083">Smith, 1974</xref>) when advancing a theoretical argument? More fundamentally, to what degree does theory itself act as a constraining force in terms of reaching a satisfactory understanding of penality? Those readers interested in the ‘punitive turn’ literature should also find the book useful in terms of the fresh insights it brings to this area. Through detailed analysis of the work of these authors, Daems cleverly points up many of the main difficulties with the punitive thesis broadly conceived; namely, the high level of abstraction at which these arguments have been developed, the lack of empirical detail and the lack of clear cut social scientific criteria. The latter point concerning measurement is particularly important as a means of determining what is ‘in’ from what is ‘out’ (p. 113) when discussing punitiveness. As others have begun to observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474512473083">Hamilton, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474512473083">Kutateladze, 2009</xref>), much more analytic attention should be directed to the definition and operationalization of the concept itself, particularly with a view to a credible comparative criminology.</p></sec>
