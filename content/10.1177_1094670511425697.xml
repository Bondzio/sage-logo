<abstract>
<p>Service-dominant (S-D) logic can function as a strategic business logic that portrays creating superior value in conjunction <italic>with</italic>—rather than <italic>for</italic>—customers as a source of competitive advantage for organizations. From this perspective, strategy is about making choices in terms of how to best <italic>facilitate and enhance value cocreation</italic> for mutual and long-term betterment. While the literature has pointed out the managerial merits of cocreating value, less is known about the organizational capabilities necessary to execute S-D logic in practice. This article devises an <italic>S-D orientation</italic>, specified as a portfolio of six strategic capabilities, namely individuated, relational, ethical, empowered, developmental, and concerted interaction capability. In combination, these six strategic capabilities constitute a cocreation capability. The authors develop the conceptual model of S-D orientation through (a) an in-depth literature review and (b) input from 21 expert academics. Conceptualizing S-D orientation provides a foundation for bridging S-D logic and strategy research with a more general framework, and for guiding much-needed empirical research that will inform managers. From a managerial point of view, S-D orientation provides a holistic approach to align the organization with its value network partners. The article also sets out an agenda for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Service-dominant (S-D) logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1094670511425697">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">2008b</xref>) describes service as the core purpose of exchange and provides a theoretical understanding of how firms, customers, and other market actors cocreate value through their service interactions with each other. A central implication of S-D logic is that the notion of superior <italic>value cocreation</italic> replaces the more prevalent one of superior <italic>value provision</italic> as the cornerstone of business strategy. Therefore, from an S-D logic perspective, the capabilities that <italic>facilitate</italic> and <italic>enhance</italic> value cocreation processes are strategic capabilities central to an organization’s competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Although the managerial merits of different notions of value cocreation have been discussed in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670511425697">Day and Moorman 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670511425697">Madhavaram and Hunt 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670511425697">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1094670511425697">Porter and Kramer 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670511425697">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1094670511425697">Ramaswamy and Gouillart 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670511425697">Ramírez 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1094670511425697">Womack and Jones 2005b)</xref>, less research attention has been paid to the actual portfolio of capabilities required to enact S-D logic. Consequently, managers only have limited guidance in the literature for implementing S-D practices. The purpose of this article is to devise a conceptual framework, which we call S-D orientation, to bridge S-D logic and S-D practice.</p>
<p>An S-D orientation represents a set of strategic capabilities that enable an organization to cocreate value in service exchanges with what the S-D logic literature calls “value network partners,” such as customers, intermediaries, suppliers, or employees. While we consider our conceptualization to be relevant with respect to these different value network partners, in this article we concentrate on a firm’s interactions with business customers (B2B) and private customers (B2C), hereafter referred to simply as customers. Our focus on customers echoes their importance for a firm’s success from a strategy perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670511425697">Priem 2007</xref>) and their value contribution role from an S-D logic perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>We interpret an S-D orientation as a cocreation capability, resulting from a firm’s individuated, relational, ethical, empowered, developmental, and concerted interaction capabilities. Our conceptual model is informed by (a) an in-depth review of S-D logic research and underlying literature streams and (b) S-D logic evaluations solicited from expert academics. Because we specify S-D orientation as a higher order concept, we also consider the independent and combinatory nature of the construct’s components and the implications for future modeling and measurement. Our research responds to the call for conceptualizing a cocreation capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670511425697">Madhavaram and Hunt 2008</xref>) and contributes toward the development of middle range level theory in the context of S-D logic that can facilitate subsequent empirical investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670511425697">Brodie, Saren, and Pels 2011b)</xref>.</p>
<p>We discuss the theoretical foundation of S-D logic first, and demonstrate the connection between S-D logic and service-based business strategy. Then, we conceptualize an S-D orientation, discuss the concept’s research implications, and suggest future research directions.</p>

<title>Fundamentals of S-D Logic</title>
<p>S-D logic is a thinking framework at a pretheoretic stage that conceptualizes business exchanges from a service-based perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1094670511425697">Vargo 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1094670511425697">Winklhofer, Palmer, and Brodie 2007</xref>). To date, 10 foundational S-D logic premises (FPs) have been established in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>) with further premises evolving (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1094670511425697">Williams and Aitken 2011</xref>). These premises form the building blocks of an emerging school of thought or research paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670511425697">Brodie, Saren, and Pels 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The first premise is that market actors interact and collaborate for the capabilities of the other party that renders service, thereby making a distinction between goods and services redundant (FP1). The actual service can be rendered either directly through a firm’s relieving activities or indirectly through enabling service platforms (FP3) such as goods or Internet websites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670511425697">Gummesson 1993</xref>). According to these premises, a firm’s goods are valuable and relevant resources to the degree that they can be used as inputs to lever the customer’s own value creation processes and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670511425697">Grönroos 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670511425697">Normann and Ramírez 1993</xref>). Ultimately, service defines all economies (FP5) but this view might be masked by service intermediaries such as goods, money, or institutions (FP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>Service-based logic further highlights that value is not what is inherent in or added to a product, but what customers get out of a product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670511425697">Grönroos 2006b)</xref>. Accordingly, value cannot be distributed or delivered by firms (FP7). Rather, firms facilitate the actualization and determination of value that network partners derive from their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>); this is also referred to as value-in-context (FP10). Value cocreation requires all network partners to interact with, and integrate, resources (FP9) to achieve mutual betterment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670511425697">Grönroos 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1094670511425697">Vargo, Maglio, and Akaka 2008</xref>). As S-D logic has been characterized as an open and evolving process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1094670511425697">Williams and Aitken (2011)</xref> propose a new premise for consideration in this context that highlights the importance of personal and societal <italic>values</italic> in determining desired value and value cocreation priorities (FP11). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch (2008b</xref>) further indicate that creating value in concert <italic>with—</italic>rather than <italic>for</italic>—customers within a relational context (FP8), indicates the operant and cocreative nature of network partners (FP6) as active resources in value creation processes. Finally, a firm’s own and accessible operant resources (e.g., employee competencies, network service capabilities), rather than operand resources (e.g., goods, materials), play a central role for competitive success (FP4). As organizations specialize in exchanging service, superior operant resources such as strategic capabilities become important levers for actualizing value-in-context with network partners. These operant resources can be a source of competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670511425697">Madhavaram and Hunt 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>).</p>

<title>Strategic Considerations</title>
<p>The notion of cocreating value refers to assisting customers in co-constructing and engaging in superior experiences. Each value network partner brings their own unique resource access and accommodation into that process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008a</xref>). As we illustrate below, this conceptualization has critical implications for the role of the firm and subsequent interactions with customers as central value network partners.</p>
<p>When customers are viewed as an integral part of value creation, the role of the firm becomes that of a facilitator, supporter, and co-constructor of value rather than a supplier of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670511425697">Firat and Dholakia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670511425697">Grönroos 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1094670511425697">Michel, Vargo, and Lusch 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1094670511425697">Normann 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670511425697">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1094670511425697">Ramírez 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>). In turn, the strategic focus of the firm shifts toward understanding how it can better assist individual customers to get more out of its direct service activities and/or service platforms so that their daily routines, processes, and experiences are improved in a meaningful way (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1094670511425697">Payne, Storbacka, and Frow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670511425697">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004</xref>). Communication is therefore dialogical between value network partners, which enriches the process of learning together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670511425697">Ballantyne and Varey 2006</xref>). Overall, firms prioritize valuable interaction experiences and outcomes of reciprocal resource integration efforts, rather than focusing on products per se, thereby forming the basis for successful future strategies.</p>
<p>The strategy literature, in particular the resource-based view (RBV) stream, has been pointing toward the value potential of resources and customer value creation processes as a main driver of organizational performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670511425697">Bowman and Ambrosini 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1094670511425697">Mol and Wijnberg 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1094670511425697">Priem 2007</xref>). From an S-D logic perspective, strategy is about making choices about how best to facilitate and enhance <italic>value cocreation</italic> with network partners such as customers for mutual and long-term betterment. That is, optimizing interdependent resource integration processes to capitalize on superior value propositions and value potential realizations. This collaborative and interconnected nature of value creation highlights the need for a more network-oriented strategic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670511425697">Gummesson 2006</xref>), seeking benefits for all value network partners, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670511425697">Gummesson (2008a)</xref> calls “balanced centricity.”</p>

<sec id="section5-1094670511425697">
<title>Conceptual Foundations of an S-D Orientation</title>
<p>To become actionable, S-D logic requires specific strategic behaviors that are enabled by underlying capabilities. Strategic behaviors have been examined through the concept of a firm’s orientation, while the literature provides different views regarding the notion of “orientation.” In line with previous suggestions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670511425697">Day 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670511425697">Foley and Fahy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670511425697">Kandemir, Yaprak, and Cavusgil 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1094670511425697">Ramani and Kumar 2008</xref>), the position taken in this article is that a firm’s strategic orientation refers to a capability or skill portfolio that enables, and manifests in, organizational behaviors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670511425697">Kandemir, Yaprak, and Cavusgil (2006</xref>, p. 325) “[…] conceptualized [what they call] alliance orientation as a firm’s skill portfolio of superior capabilities that help it scan its environment for partnering opportunities, coordinate its alliance strategies, and learn from its alliance experiences.” Such a capabilities perspective offers the opportunity to direct managerial attention to the development of actual skills that foster service-driving behaviors and support the development of prescriptive approaches to business strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670511425697">Foley and Fahy 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670511425697">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the conceptual relationships between S-D logic and S-D orientation proposed in this article. S-D logic provides service-driven premises that are reflected in S-D thinking. In contrast, S-D orientation directs firms’ attention to strategic capabilities that are service-driving and manifested in organizational actions. We now turn to identifying these strategic capabilities that correspond to the premises of S-D logic, and the associated strategic themes specified in the following.</p>

<title>Strategic Themes Associated With S-D Logic</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch (2004</xref>, p. 11) emphasize that “[i]nteractivity, integration, customization, and coproduction are the hallmarks of a service-centered view and its inherent focus on the customer and the relationship.” S-D logic “points almost directly to normative notions of investment in people (operant resources), long-term relationships, quality service flows, and only somewhat less directly toward notions of symmetric relations, transparency, ethical approaches to exchange, and sustainability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1094670511425697">Lusch and Vargo 2006b</xref>, p. 283). Others have highlighted an S-D logic focus on “communicative interaction, reciprocal servicing, resource sharing, solution orientation, and the co-creation of value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670511425697">Ballantyne and Aitken 2007</xref>, p. 368). Overall, S-D logic accentuates “a commitment to collaborative processes with customers, partners, and employees” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670511425697">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007</xref>, p. 5).</p>
<p>Based on these illustrative characteristics of S-D logic and an in-depth literature review, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670511425697">Table 1</xref> presents the six resulting S-D themes with normative strategic relevance. The table also relates the identified themes to respective S-D logic premises, strategic implications, and potential customer consequences. The six strategic themes reflect the understanding that meaningful interaction and reciprocal resource integration with customers as value network partners requires: (a) value-in-context focus—understanding value as a contextual and phenomenological outcome determined by the individual customer; (b) relation focus—understanding customers as social relationship partners, not isolated targets, with whom collaborative relations are favorable; (c) values<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1094670511425697">1</xref>
</sup> focus—understanding customer interaction and resource integration to benefit from ethical considerations for the long-term, joint betterment; (d) coproduction focus—understanding customers as effect-capable resources able to contribute to service processes for enhanced outcomes; (e) operant resource focus—understanding customers’ accessible operant resources as the basis for effective resource integration and value realization; and (f) process flow focus—understanding service as interlinked processes of resource integration within and among value networks of which customers are a part. Each theme is strategically relevant in that it deals with the conditions for meaningful and mutually beneficial resource integration; from value propositions to value actualizations in reference to the premises of S-D logic.</p>

<title>Conceptualization of an S-D Orientation</title>
<p>In conceptualizing service as a value cocreating process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>), interaction becomes the defining aspect of resource integration efforts and subsequent value-driving experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1094670511425697">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004</xref>). That is, value is jointly realized in interaction experiences through a relational process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670511425697">Berthon and John 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670511425697">Gummesson 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1094670511425697">Kowalkowski 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1094670511425697">Schembri 2006</xref>). The importance of interaction requires “that all co-creative management processes be enabled and supported by interaction-centric capabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1094670511425697">Ramaswamy 2009</xref>, p. 37).</p>
<p>The strategically relevant themes linked to the premises of S-D logic, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1094670511425697">Figure 2</xref>, help us understand the type of interaction capabilities that facilitate and enhance value cocreation with customers. Our analysis of the literature in association with two rounds of review by academic experts in S-D logic<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1094670511425697">2</xref>
</sup> led to the identification of the following interaction capabilities: (a) individuated interaction capability—understanding individual customers’ service processes, contexts, and desired outcomes; (b) relational interaction capability—enhancing the connection of social and emotional links with customers in service processes; (c) ethical interaction capability—supporting fair and nonopportunistic customer service processes; (d) empowered interaction capability—enabling customers to shape the nature and content of service processes; (e) developmental interaction capability—assisting customers’ own knowledge and competence development in service processes; and (f) concerted interaction capability—facilitating coordinated and integrated service processes that include customers. The six capabilities are discussed and justified in greater detail below.</p>

<p>“In S-D logic, service is defined as the application of specialized competences (operant resources—knowledge and skills), through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another entity or the entity itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008c</xref>, p. 26). An S-D orientation, in turn, specifies capabilities<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1094670511425697">3</xref>
</sup> that organizations may prioritize to achieve a competitive advantage through superior service and mutual betterment. Based on the preceding analysis, we define an S-D orientation as a portfolio of organizational capabilities that facilitate and enhance the reciprocal integration of resources through individuated, relational, ethical, developmental, empowered, and concerted interaction. Essentially, an S-D orientation represents a set of operant resources that help customers and other value network partners achieve greater value-in-context through the resulting interaction and resource integration processes. We interpret S-D orientation as a higher-order cocreation capability, constituted by the following six lower-order interaction capabilities.<list list-type="simple">

In order to better support and assist customers with their own value fulfillment, firms need to understand what it is that customers want to get out of these processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670511425697">Grönroos (2008</xref>, p. 307), in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1094670511425697">Sheth, Sisodia, and Sharma (2000)</xref>, adds that a thorough understanding of customers’ everyday practices “has to be the starting-point for developing a customer-centric offering based on a service logic.” The more that firms are aware of their customers’ resource integration goals, preferences, requirements, desired experiences, usage situations, and experience environments, the better value propositions and outcomes can be cocreated. As value is a subjectively perceived phenomenon and individually determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670511425697">Holbrook 2006</xref>), it is considered phenomenological and context-dependent in S-D logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>). Accordingly, customers must be examined at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670511425697">Hoekstra, Leeflang, and Wittink 1999</xref>) in addition to the aggregate level.

</list>According to S-D logic, exchange is by its very nature relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2004</xref>). However, the quality and intensity of the relationship will vary depending on the interpersonal connections and efforts between the value network partners. Treating customers as commodities, or forcing customers into a relationship that they do not want, or may not even perceive to exist is inconsistent with S-D logic. Taking an S-D logic perspective, the traditional notion of firm-controlled customer relationship management (CRM), moves toward a more service-driven notion of dealing with value creation partners. The relationship must be seen and approached from the customer’s point of view, and the firm’s role lies in facilitating an environment conducive to social interaction at the customer’s desired frequency and intensity.</p>

<p>The concept of <italic>customers</italic> involves human beings, even if it is organizations that are dealing with each other. Human beings are social interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1094670511425697">Varey 2008</xref>) whose emotions contribute to the perceived value of an interaction. Hence, firms with an S-D orientation will support the social and emotional links between interacting partners as these shape the cocreated experience. In turn, “[…] aspects of interpersonal communication must be taken into consideration in researching exchange processes from an interaction/network perspective […as] relational issues cannot be separated from communicational occurrences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1094670511425697">Olkkonen, Tikkanen, and Alajoutsijärvi 2000</xref>, pp. 404-405). In particular, two-way communication and meaningful dialogue are key manifestations of social encounters and relational interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670511425697">Ballantyne and Varey 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1094670511425697">Varey 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1094670511425697">Varey (2002</xref>, p. 54) states: “Communicating people are relating people.” S-D logic literature has consistently pointed toward dialogue as a desired marketing practice replacing the traditional one-way communication approach to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1094670511425697">Lusch, Vargo, and Malter 2006</xref>). Making customers feel at ease during dealings and building rapport further contributes to relational interaction at an emotional level. Thus, S-D-oriented firms learn how to relate to their customers as service partners, facilitate conversation, and support a comfortable psychosocial context for the ongoing improvement of the cocreation of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1094670511425697">Schneider and Bowen 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering this relational context, customers will have higher and lower degrees of engagement with the firm; that is, differing psychological states and motivational levels for cognitive, emotional, and behavioral efforts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670511425697">Brodie et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670511425697">Hollebeek 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1094670511425697">van Doorn et al. 2010</xref>). Taking a customer engagement value (CEV) perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1094670511425697">Kumar et al. 2010</xref>), some customers are accordingly more valuable to the firm than others due to transactional (e.g., purchase frequency or average quantity) and nontransactional (e.g., word of mouth or knowledge sharing) engagement behaviors. However, independent of the nature and intensity of engagement, social and emotional links remain relevant in customers’ value creation processes as long as interactions—irrespective of the mode and worth of a customer—take place. Hence, although the allocation of resources in proportion to the CEV can be strategically meaningful, it should not purely determine or negatively influence the interpersonal connections and settings that provide meaning to customers. Service-driven firms enhance an interaction behavior that consistently fosters well-functioning relationships in view of the structural embeddedness and interdependence of value network members. As firms are actors, or even nodes, in networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670511425697">Gummesson 2006</xref>), relationships and their potential psychosocial proximity help structure and facilitate the operation of resource integration networks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670511425697">Table 3</xref> provides (a) a selection of associated S-D logic literature suggesting a relational interaction capability; (b) illustrative organizational behaviors; and (c) examples of firms with this capability.<list list-type="simple">

The importance of trust as a cornerstone for partner-like, long-term, and knowledge-sharing interactions has frequently been highlighted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670511425697">Geyskens, Steenkamp, and Kumar 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670511425697">Gounaris 2005</xref>). Ethical interaction is seen as a relevant contributor to trust-based partnerships as customers are not intentionally misled, manipulated, or exploited. The risks and costs associated with unfairness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1094670511425697">Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1094670511425697">Samaha, Palmatier, and Dant 2011</xref>) promote responsible practices, particularly in an environment where there is increasing interdependence of value network partners. The more interlinked interaction takes place in a competitive environment, the more relevant ethical standards become in counteracting opportunistic behavior. Notwithstanding volunteered acts that support long-term relationships, conducting unethical business practices has become more difficult in many national markets. With often high government interest in socially responsible behavior, service providers are increasingly under pressure to comply with ethical codes of conducts. At the same time, it is getting easier for market actors to detect unfair or opportunistic interactions. The ubiquitous availability of information creates more transparency in markets from which customers, and the society as a whole, benefit. In this context, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670511425697">Table 4</xref> provides (a) a selection of associated S-D logic literature suggesting an ethical interaction capability; (b) illustrative organizational behaviors; and (c) examples of firms with this capability.<list list-type="simple">

</list-item>
</list>Viewing customers as operant resources has further implications for marketing practice because, this way, customers are conceptualized as effect-driving within a service system, rather than as passive recipients of an output at the end of a linear value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1094670511425697">Vargo and Lusch 2008b</xref>). Customers command and/or possess a certain degree of knowledge and skills for an effective and efficient integration of resources as well as contribution to the service process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670511425697">Grönroos 2008</xref>). Indeed, customers have more to offer than just financial resources. They have, for example, ideas, competencies, and labor, enabling them to act on other resources and provide benefits to the cocreation partner. From a strategy perspective, the key is to unlock these resources by finding ways to engage and activate customers in light of reciprocal benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670511425697">Normann and Ramírez 1993</xref>). Coproduction becomes an attractive option if firms can capitalize on customer-provided resources (such as their ideas and efforts) to strengthen their competitive position. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670511425697">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien (2007</xref>, p. 8) point out, such coproduction opportunities should be “consistent with customer’s desired level of involvement.”</p>

<p>Coproduction is related to notions of customer integration and participation in the actual construction and/or delivery of the core offering, as well as organizational work processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670511425697">Auh et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670511425697">Dabholkar 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670511425697">Fang 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1094670511425697">Lengnick-Hall 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670511425697">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007)</xref>. Accordingly, firms implementing an S-D orientation strive to empower customers by letting them have a say about the content and nature of the exchange. Levels of voluntary participation might span, for instance, from soliciting customer opinions and suggestions, to giving them control over the interaction process, to letting them shape the final outcome. The idea is that through coproduction (which is optional in S-D logic), the mutual service provision and service innovation is improved (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1094670511425697">Ordanini and Parasuraman 2011</xref>), and the superordinate concept of cocreating value (which is not optional in S-D logic) is enhanced. Through customer input before or during the finalization of the core offering, firms can provide improved platforms for customers’ own value actualizations and better meet preferences or requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670511425697">Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006</xref>). Equally important is customer feedback during or after the interactions so firms can learn from prior engagements and redeploy knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670511425697">Ballantyne and Varey 2006</xref>), as well as internalize new competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670511425697">Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006</xref>). In this sense, the empowered interaction capability relates to outside-in processes fostering a collaboration competence, which “will aid a firm in absorbing new information and knowledge from partners or improve its absorptive competence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1094670511425697">Lusch, Vargo, and O’Brien 2007</xref>, p. 9), thus better adapting to its environment.</p>

Solutions have been characterized as interactive processes whereby customers are involved in designing or modifying integrated offerings to better fit their context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1094670511425697">Tuli, Kohli, and Bharadwaj 2007</xref>). An empowered interaction capability accommodates exactly this customer input-driven configuration of value propositions and resource bundles that characterize solutions and open service processes. Meanwhile, customers’ increasing desire for individualism and control generates increasing demand for the co-construction of own experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670511425697">Firat and Dholakia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1094670511425697">Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004</xref>).

Knowledge and competencies enable firms to make value propositions and play a significant role in customers’ value fulfillment. The same logic can be applied to customers. Their knowledge and skill portfolio determines the effectiveness and efficiency of resource integration and value actualization. That is, with higher operant resource density (e.g., more accumulated knowledge) and the ability to make use thereof, customers have increased potential to achieve desired outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670511425697">Bell and Eisingerich 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1094670511425697">Möller 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1094670511425697">Norman and Ramírez (1993)</xref> highlight the supportive role that firms play and note that these enhance value creation “[…] when they make not only their offerings more intelligent but their customers (and suppliers) more intelligent as well” (p. 69). Hence, S-D firms share their own expertise and knowledge resources for the enhancement of their cocreation partners’ skills. While empowered interaction capability is about being able to absorb and adapt to input from outside, developmental interaction capability is about being open to sharing expertise and knowledge inside-out with external partners.</p>

Also, firms need to be capable of designing and synchronizing service platforms, such as goods or webpages, in a way that customers can interact with and integrate resources with a minimal effort. In doing so, firms better fit into and align with customers’ value creating activities. The importance of such concerted interaction increases, for example, with (a) a greater number of value network partners or service platforms involved; and (b) a higher interaction intensity among these entities—because there is a higher risk of service process failure.</p>

<title>Discussion and Future Research</title>
<p>When superior value cocreation becomes the cornerstone of strategy, organizations need a constellation of strategic capabilities that foster service-driving interactions. A strategic orientation can be understood as a firm’s capability portfolio (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670511425697">Kandemir, Yaprak, and Cavusgil 2006</xref>) that, when nurtured effectively, enables an organization to outperform its rivals in cocreating value. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670511425697">Day and Moorman (2010</xref>, p. 233) state “No firm can consistently drive superior value without investing in and managing the capabilities to do so.” Specifically with reference to S-D logic, researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1094670511425697">Vargo 2011</xref>) have recently questioned the strategic importance of value cocreation capabilities shaping market configurations and have called for respective investigations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670511425697">Brodie, Saren, and Pels (2011b</xref>) further emphasize the need for research to advance middle range theory in the context of S-D logic as a valuable bridge between the broader and abstract S-D premises and empirical evidence of S-D manifestations.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the current article specifies the nature of an S-D orientation comprising six strategic capabilities. Adopting an exploratory perspective, this article advances the transition from S-D logic to S-D practices and thereby contributes to the development of middle range theory. Conceptualizing S-D orientation provides a foundation for (a) bridging S-D logic and strategy research with S-D logic as a more general framework (toward positive level theory); and (b) guiding much-needed empirical research that will inform managers (toward normative level theory). At this point, our research suggests that managers who adopt S-D logic as their thinking framework, and seek to enact such a strategic business logic throughout an organization, should consider mastering the following capabilities: (a) understanding individual customers’ resource integration processes, contexts, and desires; (b) communicating with and relating to customers through social interaction processes; (c) engaging with customers in fair and nonopportunistic interactions; (d) empowering customers to influence the service processes and/or outcomes; (e) helping customers develop their own operant resources; and (f) coordinating and integrating service flows toward customers. In combination, these capabilities provide the basis for competing on service.</p>
<p>Researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670511425697">Madhavaram and Hunt 2008</xref>) have suggested that the marketing discipline would benefit from the development of a cocreation capability. Such a capability advances, for example, market-oriented thinking (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1094670511425697">Kohli and Jaworski 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1094670511425697">Narver and Slater 1990</xref>) by seeing customers as cocreators of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1094670511425697">Madhavaram and Hunt 2008</xref>) and, thereby, capitalizing on as well as augmenting their critical role as operant resources. For instance, individual customers contribute to value actualization and determination and can even serve as potential sources of resource innovation from the firm’s perspective. Through the sharing of information and dialogical interaction customers can also learn from firms and improve their own resource deployments. A cocreation perspective accordingly prioritizes boundary-spanning collaboration among individual value network members (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670511425697">Hunt and Lambe 2000</xref>), emphasizes the importance of capability-enabled outside-in processes with value actualization as a central element (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670511425697">Day and Moorman 2010</xref>), and makes the betterment of the value network a central goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670511425697">Gummesson 2006</xref>). With this in mind, interpreting the S-D orientation as a cocreation capability is (a) entirely consistent with S-D logic and the underlying nature, purpose, and process of value creation; and (b) represents a comprehensive strategic approach to meaningful interaction and resource integration.</p>
<p>From a managerial point of view, S-D orientation provides a holistic avenue to align the organization with value network partners. However, as the six capabilities may not share the same antecedents and consequences, it will be challenging to optimize them simultaneously. For example, a doctor may place importance on understanding an individual patient’s medical condition and life context (individuated interaction), facilitating emotional support and psychological comfort (relational interaction), as well as spending a considerable amount of time on clarifying potential risks associated with certain treatments (ethical interaction). The doctor may also solicit patient suggestions and feedback regarding preferred treatment options (empowered interaction). Finally, the doctor may discuss the treatment plan in detail, explain how the patient can best assist the healing process, and share additional health information resources (developmental interaction). In cocreating such a process, however, work flow predictions and time management become more difficult for the doctor, potentially leading to longer waiting times for other patients and subsequent service flow interferences (diminishing concerted interaction for other patients). Firms may, therefore, choose to prioritize investments in a few capabilities, while achieving minimum capability levels for the others. Accordingly, firms need to configure their organizational setup so that effective and efficient resource integration is enabled while strategically considering potential trade-offs.</p>
<p>Turning to the potential measurement of an S-D orientation, in line with the decision criteria by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670511425697">Jarvis, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff (2003)</xref>, our higher-order S-D orientation model lends itself to a formative measurement specification. The six independent and combinatory S-D capabilities are causal as opposed to effect indicators. As such, each capability contributes to, and is capable of, changing the magnitude of the higher order S-D construct independently. Further, each of the six S-D capabilities addresses unique content that cannot be substituted or compensated by others. The deletion of one capability would alter the domain of the S-D concept. Also, the six capabilities are not likely to share the same antecedents and consequences within a nomological network. Finally, the six capabilities do not necessarily correlate; for example, if some capabilities are emphasized due to investment priorities, others will not necessarily benefit.</p>
<p>Empirical research is now needed to validate the proposed capabilities, their cross-context relevance, and their relationships in a measurement model, as well as to understand the S-D orientation construct’s nomological network. Beyond demonstrating in this article that S-D orientation applies to B2B and B2C customer contexts, we believe that an S-D orientation is applicable to other value network partners. Service-driven principles, capabilities, and actions are meaningful for any organization facilitating and enhancing value cocreation. Further research is required to confirm this view and investigate the implications of an S-D orientation from a network perspective. The S-D orientation model and subsequent value perceptions could be examined simultaneously from multiple stakeholder perspectives.</p>
<p>Other research directions include the potential implementation challenges and contingencies related to an S-D orientation. The strategic change literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670511425697">Cameron and Quinn 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670511425697">Ginsberg 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1094670511425697">Kraatz and Zajac 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1094670511425697">Rajagopalan and Spreitzer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1094670511425697">Zajac, Kraatz, and Bresser 2000</xref>) is a useful starting point for researchers in terms of identifying organizational conditions that facilitate or hinder the execution of an S-D orientation. Unlearning old behaviors or routines and adopting new interaction approaches take time; meanwhile, investments and incentives are necessary to cultivate underlying competencies, motivations, and systems, in order to overcome change barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1094670511425697">Mezias, Grinyer, and Guth 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding which service-driven cultural values and leadership styles are needed to support a value cocreation approach is also important (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670511425697">Chakravorti 2011</xref>). This is because social systems shape the execution of value cocreation with network partners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670511425697">Giddens 1984</xref>). Value cocreation occurs within social environments, is formed by social forces, and reproduced in social structures of the value network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670511425697">Edvardsson, Tronvoll, and Gruber 2011</xref>). Researchers could study the importance of the position of managers and the role of leadership in clearly communicating the organization’s value cocreation purpose, defining clear value cocreation roles and interaction styles, and establishing moral guidelines for value cocreation. Both employees and customers will influence, and be influenced, during the service processes by these social and structural factors.</p>
<p>Further research is required into the role of different technologies and media that facilitate the implementation of an S-D orientation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670511425697">Hennig-Thurau et al. 2010</xref>). Technology seems to take a prominent role in facilitating cocreative service design and resource configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1094670511425697">Rust and Espinoza 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1094670511425697">Rust and Thompson 2006</xref>). For instance, the interactive web platform offered by the automobile manufacturer Audi enables customers to simulate, configure, and track their desired automobile online. Customers derive value from aspects including reducing purchase uncertainties by being able to experiment with different automobile configurations; being more closely connected to their automobile brand; obtaining updated and interactive product information; high process transparency and not being exposed to potential sales tactics of salespeople; and integrated online and off-line experiences with the brand. Similarly, Audi derives value through learning which automobile features individual customers prefer while identifying any preference patterns exhibited; having multiple interactions with customers that offer the opportunity for engagement; and retranslating former customer interactions into innovative value propositions for repatronage. Considering this example, an interesting research question relates to which technology and media types (e.g., web and mobile technology, self-serving technology, social media) are particularly conducive to facilitating an S-D orientation with regard to specific contexts.</p>
<p>An S-D orientation offers firms scope to achieve competitive advantage through enhanced value cocreation with network partners such as customers. In this article, we propose six distinct capabilities that constitute an S-D orientation and offer guidance to the concept’s subsequent operationalization and empirical investigation.</p>
<sec id="section9-1094670511425697">
<title>Executive Summary</title>
<p>Service-dominant (S-D) logic, interpreted as strategic business logic, portrays creating value in conjunction with—rather than for—customers as a source of competitive advantage for organizations. While the managerial merits of cocreating value have been discussed in the literature, less is known about the organizational capabilities necessary to execute S-D logic in practice. Focusing on business customers (B2B) and private customers (B2C), the authors identify six strategic capabilities that enable the translation of S-D logic into S-D practices. These six strategic capabilities constitute what the authors call an <italic>S-D orientation</italic> and are derived from an in-depth review of the S-D logic and associated literature and input from 21 academics who have published on S-D logic or related topics.</p>
<p>The proposed portfolio of capabilities facilitating and enhancing interaction and resource integration experiences include (a) individuated interaction capability—understanding individual customers’ service contexts, service processes, and expected service outcomes; (b) relational interaction capability—enhancing the connection of social and emotional links with customers in service processes; (c) ethical interaction capability—supporting fair and nonopportunistic customer service processes; (d) empowered interaction capability—enabling customers to shape the nature and content of service processes; (e) developmental interaction capability—assisting customers’ own knowledge and competence development in service processes; and (f) concerted interaction capability—facilitating coordinated and integrated service processes that include customers.</p>
<p>Examples of these capabilities developed by firms include (a) for individuated interaction—Amazon’s analysis of search and purchase patterns on its website in order to better understand a website visitor’s individual interests; (b) for relational interaction—Old Spice’s YouTube channel which facilitates dialogue with the brand and among viewers; (c) for ethical interaction—Thales’ ethics and corporate responsibility strategy which mandates supplier agreements and employee training for good interaction practices with customers; (d) for empowered interaction—Endress+Hauser’s product configurator which enables business customers to shape products in accordance with their business needs; (e) for developmental interaction—Epson’s YouTube channel and website “Tips For You” which provide printing knowledge and training for users of Epson printers; and (f) for concerted interaction—Coplaning S.à r.l.’s linking of internal sales, installation, and service center with more than 15 external partner organizations to offer orchestrated and comprehensive service.</p>
<p>Organizations need to configure their S-D orientation and organizational setup so that effective and efficient resource integration is enabled. The authors emphasize that it may be difficult for managers to optimize the six capabilities all at once, given that the capabilities are likely to have different organizational antecedents. Therefore, managers should consider prioritizing investments in a few capabilities, while achieving a minimum capability level for the others. Which capabilities deserve to be prioritized under which circumstances requires future research to clarify this important managerial issue. More research is also needed to better understand the organizational antecedents and outcomes of the S-D orientation capabilities so that managers know what is required from them and their organization to implement an S-D orientation and to better understand potential benefits.</p>

<p>Here values refer to ethical values in terms of things believed “worth doing” or the “right” things to do as these are desired or preferred standards, thereby providing an organization with guidelines for behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670511425697">Hunt, Wood, and Chonko 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670511425697">Jansen and Glinow 1985</xref>)</p>

<p>In Round 1, which took place in 2008, the definition, scope, and content of the theoretical model were discussed in personal interviews with 10 S-D logic/service academic experts originating from the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. These experts were mainly selected on the basis that they had participated in a special issue on S-D logic in Marketing Theory (2006, Volume 6, Issue 3). The interview guide included prompting experts to identify potentially missing content or components relevant for an S-D orientation. These interviews resulted in definition and label changes for some of the S-D orientation components as well as the inclusion of a new dimension: ethical interaction.</p>
