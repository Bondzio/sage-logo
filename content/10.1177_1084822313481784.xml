<p>More than ever before you see Americans carrying water bottles with them everywhere they go. This sight is so common that one would think this was the symbol of being an American; a good housekeeping seal for health. Being indoctrinated to believe the necessity of drinking eight glasses of water per day, however, was recently challenged in a study that found eight glasses per day is not the gold standard. Other studies have produced mixed results, so in essences, the amount of water intake per day is more of a recommendation that is not rooted in evidence-based research.</p>
<p>In spite of this edict, water (in the form of other liquids or liquids found in foods) is a vital nutrient necessary to sustain life. Water is the single most dominant fluid, which makes up approximately 60% of body weight. It is a required daily food substance that replaces the large amount lost as a result of body functions, such as skin evaporation (i.e., perspiration), breathing, urination, and stooling. When adequate intake does not balance fluid loss, an individual becomes dehydrated. Situations that accentuate fluid loss include warmer climates, high altitudes, strenuous exercise, and aging. In other words water requirement is dependent on a person’s health, activity level, and residence (geographical location). So before abandoning your water bottle, consider the benefits of water consumption.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822313481784">
<title>Health Benefits of Water</title>
<p>Water is the substance every body system depends on. While the quantity of water consumption is not standardized across the board for all individuals, one must know his or her body’s requirement for this vital fluid. Water helps to keep tissues such as the skin, eyes, mouth, and nose mucosa moist, keeps joints lubricated, helps to prevent constipation, helps to regulate body temperature especially during strenuous physical activity, serves as a medium to carry oxygen and nutrients to cells in the body, helps to break down minerals and other nutrient substances making them more accessible to cells and helping the kidneys and liver dispose of toxic waste products.</p>

<sec id="section2-1084822313481784">
<title>Daily Water Intake Recommendation</title>
<p>According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822313481784">1</xref></sup> males should consume approximately three liters or 13 glasses and women 2.2 liters or approximately 9 glasses of water or total fluids/per day. If one consumes the traditional “eight glasses” per day, this equates to 1.9 liters, which falls slightly less than the recommendation of the IOM. Keeping in mind daily fluid intake should be based on individual needs, in essences the general rule of thumb is, if one is rarely thirsty and produces 1.6 liters of light yellow or colorless urine (translates to six trips to the bathroom per day) one is consuming an adequate amount of fluid. However, during pregnancy women should consume slightly more fluid (about 10 glasses per day) and this need increases during breastfeeding to about 13 glasses per day.</p>
<p>What is important to remember is, the suggested intake includes fluid intake from all food sources, meaning all beverages consumed such as milk and juices. Also, caffeinated beverages such as teas, coffee and soft drinks contribute to meeting daily fluid requirement. In fact, alcoholic beverages like beer and wine also contribute to total daily fluid intake. But alcoholic and caffeinated beverages should be consumed sparingly due to the health consequences associated with high volume intake. Beyond the tap, one can also obtain fluid intake from some foods. For example, watermelon and tomatoes are 90% water by weight. On average, individuals obtain 20% of their total daily fluid intake from consuming foods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1084822313481784">
<title>When Should Fluid Intake Be Adjusted?</title>
<p>There are certain situations and or conditions when one should adjust their daily fluid intake; exercise is one of those situations, especially if one engages in strenuous exercise, which leads to sweating. Just how much fluid one should drink to replace fluid loss due to physical activity depends on duration. For short bouts of exercise one should consume an extra 12 to 20 ounces for fluid replacement. If one exercises for longer periods of time (i.e., longer than an hour), consideration of a fluid with electrolytes may be necessary to replace sodium lost through perspiration. Electrolyte drinks during long duration exercise activities (i.e., marathons) can also prevent the occurrence of hyponatremia. Another important point about fluid lost and exercise is that intake should continue after exercising.</p>
<p>Warmer weather resulting in perspiration dictates additional fluid intake. A time of year frequently not associated with fluid loss is winter; but when home heater is turned on and the heat is increased, skin moisture loss increases. Living in higher altitudes of 8,200 feet or greater also leads to greater moisture loss through increased breathing and more frequent urination.</p>
<p>When illness strikes resulting in diarrhea and vomiting, one loses greater amounts of fluid that will need to be replaced. In some instances, the fluid loss requires fluid and electrolyte replacement. Other conditions requiring increase in fluids are urinary track stones and bladder infections. On the other hand, congestive heart failure is a condition that requires fluid restriction to avoid fluid retention.</p>

<title>Is Tap Water Safe to Drink?</title>
<p>Frequently one hears that tap water isn’t very safe to drink because of contaminants present in water that most would find unthinkable to drink by most. Is this paranoia about tap water founded? By law (the Safe Drinking Water Act) the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822313481784">2</xref></sup> sets enforceable health standards, which require local water municipal systems to utilize certified laboratories to test drinking water for the presences of more than 90 substances and organisms including copper, uranium, and lead. Contaminants are tested while contained at public treatment plants. As water leaves the treatment plants en route to residential areas, it can become contaminated due to unforeseen accidents. In these situations, the water company must inform their consumers of the possibility that toxic contaminants are in the drinking water, within 24 hr. Older homes may also be a source of water contamination from lead, which can be leached into the drinking water while the water is stored in the home’s plumbing system. It is possible that the lead levels found in water sitting in old lead-lined plumbing is higher than the EPA’s cutoff of 15 parts per billion.</p>
<p>Water can become contaminated in many ways, and to know the kind and amount of contaminants present in drinking water, individuals should obtain the annual report known as the consumer confidence report (CCR). This report, available every July 1st, reveals where the water comes from and the type of contaminants and levels found in drinking water. This report also identifies the substances that have exceeded the federally mandated maximum contaminant levels (MCL).</p>
<p>Examples of contaminants found in water include microorganisms and parasites from human and animal fecal material. Chemicals from industrial waste or from crop spraying have also been identified in drinking water. Substances such as mercury and lead can enter the water supply from underground natural deposits or from improper disposal.</p>
<p>Pesticides and herbicides enter the water supply as runoff from the land. Those who live in the Midwestern states with high agricultural production of corn may find an herbicide, atrazine, in their drinking water. This weed killer is not only used for agricultural crops particularly corn but is also used to control the overgrowth of weeds on golf courses, residential lawns, and highways. This contaminant has been found in higher concentrations (so-called spikes in levels) during the spring and summer when farmers apply this herbicide to their crops. This is disturbing because atrazine is linked to reproductive abnormalities and immune system problems. In fact, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC; part of the Land and Wildlife Program) report indicated 39% of public drinking water supplies located in the Midwest and the south had at least one elevated level of atrazine, which exceeded the EPA’s tolerable limit of three parts per billion.</p>
<p>Substances not tested for by local water suppliers because they are not on the EPA’s list of contaminants include medications and or their by-products. Among the medications first identified in drinking water were antiseizure drugs and some of the residue of insect repellent ingredients. Four years after this initial discovery, tests of water suppliers revealed dozens of pharmaceuticals in drinking water including antibiotics, aspirin, blood pressure drugs, and antidepressants. It appears an increasing number of medications find their way to our drinking water supply.</p>
<p>There are more than 80,000 chemicals registered in the United States, with approximately 2,000 new ones approved to be used in foods, drugs, and household supplies, so the potential for greater numbers of contaminants found in water is inevitable. Even if the drugs identified were in low concentrations in water, the concern is the potential toxic effect from consuming this tonic of multiple drugs and other contaminants over a long period of time. What should be noted is that the EPA does not require testing for these substances, so they will not show up in the CCR annual report even if they are present in the drinking water.</p>

<title>Drinking Water Not Held to the Same Scrutiny</title>
<p>Private home wells are not held to the same EPA standard as public drinking water supplies. This means unless residents consuming well water hire experts to test their drinking water they are not aware of the contaminants present. For example 10% of wells in New Hampshire exceeded the EPA limit for arsenic. Other states with high levels of this poison in well water include Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Michigan, Maine, and Colorado.</p>
<p>Bottled water is another source that is not held to the same EPA testing standard. According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO), a nonpartisan government agency, bottled water undergoes less scrutiny than tap water. The GAO report found the regulation of bottled water, which is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is less stringent than water regulation under the auspices of the EPA. In fact, bottled water companies are not required to report as much information as municipalities. Bottled water companies are not required to use certified laboratories to test their water nor are they required to report test results to the FDA.</p>
<p>While the bottom line is bottled water isn’t better than tap water, bottled water has become a social norm. Beginning from a standpoint that tap water was not safe to drink, bottled water became more of a social movement. Its portability, measurement, and practicality make it an American icon even if it is more expensive than gasoline per gallon!!!!!</p>
