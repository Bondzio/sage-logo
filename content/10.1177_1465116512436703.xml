<abstract>
<p>The theory of issue evolution predicts that the dimensional space of party competition is simple. We contrast this prediction with the expectation that a complicated multi-party system, such as the one in France, produces a more complicated dimensional structure. To test this claim, we examine the longitudinal structure of the policy preferences that underlie public opinion in France. Using surveys of preferences as a basic data source, we are able to extract two latent dimensions that almost fully explain the reported preferences. Both dimensions are defined by the left–right structure of the French party system. Whereas one is the traditional socioeconomic domain, the other comprises a wide array of new cultural issues. The orthogonal solution, however, does not produce the expected socioeconomic and cultural dimensions. Thus we impose our prior belief in the socioeconomic and cultural content and rotate the two dimensions independently to maximize fit with the two prior dimensions. We show that the same two-dimensional structure is also present in cross-sectional data, and can be used to position parties in the two-dimensional space. Moreover, we find that the two dimensions are closely connected, despite their completely different content. The explanation, which arises from the theory of issue evolution, is that the meaning of left–right is dynamic as well as elastic and incorporates new issues as they arise.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1465116512436703" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>What is the dimensional structure of political issues? This question is often posed –it is a common theme of this special issue – and we pose it for France. More precisely, we ask: what are the dimensions of conflict, how do they relate to each other, and how do the dynamics of their evolution account for their changing relation over time? As our title suggests, we investigate the evolution of policy attitudes in France. Thus, throughout the article our emphasis is dynamic. Our aim is to understand issue introduction and issue incorporation over time. Thus the questions we intend to answer are: ‘How do policy attitudes evolve over time?’ and ‘How does that evolution affect the dimensional structure of attitudes?’</p>
<p>In the social sciences, dimensionality is treated as a micro and cross-sectional phenomenon, disregarding the dynamics, which are typically of a macro and longitudinal nature. We illuminate how issue dynamics influence dimensions. Thus, the dimensions of our focus are longitudinal. We ask how policy attitudes co-evolve over time thus forming dimensions. The explanation we deliver is based on the theory of issue evolution and allows us to link dynamics to dimensional outcomes.</p>
<p>We discuss the dimensionality of politics, and specifically the dimensionality of public opinion. Is it left vs. right, left–right plus something else, or perhaps even a dimension for each policy arena? The debate is centered on the context of a very old, stable, two-party system, namely that of the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1465116512436703">1</xref></sup> Clearly, the number of parties has some potential to affect the number of dimensions that organize politics. Thus, the United States is an ideal type of simplicity and stability.</p>
<p>Although France is the opposite, it is also an ideal type. It has numerous political parties – 12 competed in the most recent presidential election and 16 did so in the election in 2002. Its largest political party, the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP), although having roots in earlier Gaullist parties, is not yet 20 years old. And France’s previously largest party, the Communists, has all but disappeared. With two-round majoritarian elections and a constantly changing constellation of political parties, France offers the opportunity to study high-dimensional politics. It is a political system that comprises only little of the stability and none of the simplicity of the US case. It is thus well suited to augment what we know about the dimensionality of political discourse and choice in two-party systems.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that, despite the numerous parties, the French two-round majoritarian election system combined with a presidential system shows tendencies towards bipolarity. Without proportional representation and a parliamentary government, the French electoral system encourages the construction of majorities with the help of party coalitions before the second round of elections. In this regard it looks similar to, rather than different from, a two-party system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1465116512436703">Duverger, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to ascertain how many dimensions of policy conflict are required to make sense of the high-dimensional French party system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1465116512436703">Grunberg and Schweisguth (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512436703">Chiche et al. (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512436703">Tiberj (2008)</xref> have shown that elections in France can be understood with two dimensions: the traditional left–right socioeconomic dimension and a dimension featuring a newer set of cultural issues. On these matters, France mirrors other European democracies such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, or the Netherlands, which display similar two-dimensional politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1465116512436703">Kriesi et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We approach the question of dimensionality from a public opinion point of view, examining continuous time-series of public policy preferences, that is, what the French electorate says on the issues of the day. We will exploit a database of aggregate responses to preference questions and then analyze it to see how many dimensions are required to bring order to the observed structure of attitudes. When we come to ask how the dimensions are related, we will turn to the theory of issue evolution for an explanation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1465116512436703"><title>The theory of issue evolution</title>
<p>The theory of issue evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512436703">Carmines and Stimson, 1989</xref>) was devised to explain the dynamics of one issue, namely race, in one nation, the United States. But its authors knew from the beginning that it could be transferred to any other issue – or issue dimension – in any other nation that featured political parties and competitive elections. Its logic is not restricted to the study of race per se. And none of its assumptions requires the specific conditions of the US political system.</p>
<p>The theory of issue evolution has grown from its limited roots over the years. It has been applied wherever democratic elections exist, but most prominently in Latin America, the United Kingdom, and (particularly) Western Europe (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116512436703">De Vries and Hobolt, 2012</xref>). Its usage goes beyond political science to related disciplines such as sociology and mass communications, and even biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1465116512436703">Gould, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1465116512436703">2007</xref>), from which it originally emerged. Moreover, the scope of the issue extension is remarkable. It has been applied to income inequality, abortion, women, gay rights, and ‘culture wars’ in the US and to issues such as immigration, cultural issues, integration, and many others in the European context.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1465116512436703"><title>The essence of issue evolution</title>
<p>The essential characteristics of the issue evolution theory are, firstly, that the dimensionality of issue contestation is variable over time and not fixed. Secondly, it postulates that dimensionality evolves through two mechanisms: (1) the initial choice of a party or candidate to politicize a controversy previously not present in partisan politics, and then (2), once the issue is at play, a dynamic process that eventually aligns issue positions with parties in the mass electorate. This reinforces the initial alignment and hardens it to the point that the initial choice is no longer open to modification. Once the electorate expects a party to take up a certain position, and sorts itself out in consistence with that position, it is no longer possible for the party to choose not to be associated with it.</p>
<p>The choice in (1) is reaching for partisan electoral advantage. If a party expects to lose (in a two-party system) or expects not to be part of the governing coalition (in a parliamentary democracy), then it will consider it advantageous to give up the electoral status quo, which is the issue basis for its current electoral disadvantage (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1465116512436703">de Vries and Hobolt, 2012</xref>). Adding new issues is always risky because a new controversy – one fiery enough to make an electoral difference – is capable of subtracting more voters than it adds. That will usually be true if parties and candidates are rational actors. In this case, they will already have exploited all the issues likely to add more voters than they subtract. Thus, what is left are the explosive issues which are potentially dangerous. Why would any party or candidate ever gain by taking up a dangerous issue? A party that expects to lose in the long run with the current issue alignment will occasionally take such an opportunity. Thus, a high-risk strategy can be attractive to a party when the low-risk alternative is dismal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1465116512436703">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ‘evolution’ in issue evolution is the story of how a choice made at one time and in one place becomes a dynamic process that plays out over a very long period. A very long period here refers not to years but to decades. Dis-equilibration, the choice to complicate politics by introducing a new issue consideration, creates an instability in which large numbers of politicians and voters are initially out of line with the new constellation and come under pressure to resolve the inconsistency. That plays itself out – relatively quickly in the case of elected politicians, and more slowly for the mass electorate – as the changes of association between party and issue gradually weed out inconsistent issue views and replace them with consistent ones. Inconsistent positions are unstable from an evolutionary standpoint, because they impose disadvantages on the politicians and citizens who hold them. Thus over the long run, as actors reshape their views and their party loyalties, we expect inconsistent patterns to give way to consistent ones more often than the reverse. This pattern is reinforced by generational replacement. Inconsistency is largely the province of those who have become part of the political arena before the new issue entered politics. In contrast, generations following the critical moment are likely to form views that are consistent with the party and issue constellation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1465116512436703">3</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1465116512436703"><title>Issue evolution and dimensionality</title>
<p>What then does this theory have to say about the number of dimensions that structure the issue discourse in France? The story is that there will always be one formative dimension, for which left vs. right is nearly universal. However, the theory predicts that there will also be extraneous dimensions caused by new issue considerations. But the number will depend upon the sequence of the evolution. Right after the introduction of an orthogonal issue domain, there will be two full dimensions in politics. But, as that issue evolves, it will become more and more aligned with the first dimension of politics, so that the number of <italic>independent</italic> dimensions will be one plus whatever residue remains of the new issue that has not yet been aligned with the main dimension. Since new issues may be introduced while previously ‘new’ ones are not yet fully aligned, we cannot say how large the number of dimensions will be. What we can say, however, is that we always expect to find more than one dimension. And, since the dynamics of issue evolution produce correlated dimensions, in every case except immediately after the injection of a new issue we expect the observed dimensions to be correlated.</p>
<p>Note that the prediction says nothing about social structure or cleavages and does not depend on the type or the number of parties. It just says that electoral competition will usually produce one-plus dimensions of contestation. However, we can say something about the content of the first dimension – it is dynamic and elastic. Just because it is generally described as the left–right dimension does not mean that its content is fixed. Issue evolution predicts that the main dimension of politics (whatever it is called) will always be in the process of absorbing new controversies. These new controversies appear to be about left and right, but actually they were not like that before the start of the alignment process.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1465116512436703"><title>Estimating the dimensions of opinion</title>
<p>To observe the structure of French public opinion, we need first to acquire data on the subject. Next, we need to find some way to observe the underlying structure present in the data. In the following two sections, we will deal with both of those issues, first the descriptive task of observing the specifics of public opinion and then finding a tool that gets below the surface to observe the latent attitudes that lie beneath them.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1465116512436703"><title>Data</title>
<p>Our questions are ‘What does the French electorate want from the government?’ and, more crucially, ‘How has that changed over time?’ Thus, we have sought data on preferences themselves, i.e. statements that support or oppose particular policy proposals. Our unit of analysis is time, specifically the year. Hence, the data observed are the result of asking a particular survey question one or more times in a particular year.</p>
<p>Because we cannot know the distorting effects that arise from tying questions to a name (‘How do you feel about President Sarkozy’s proposal to … ’), or to a party, or to the approval or disapproval of outcomes of government policy, much of the survey research record is ruled out at the start. Also, we focus on domestic political issues, excluding concerns about foreign policy or the part-domestic and part-international issue of Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is a quite difficult topic, particularly in conjunction with other sets of preferences. Studies sometimes show that attitudes toward Europe are strongly associated with general preferences for openness and multiculturalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512436703">Chiche et al., 2000</xref>), whereas others argue that it depends on the issues associated with Europe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1465116512436703">Brouard and Tiberj (2006)</xref> have demonstrated that, in matters of nationalistic threats (loss of national identity, immigration), Europe goes with cultural preferences but, in terms of welfare state policies or redistribution policies, Europe is considered to be part of the traditional economic left vs. right dimension. In any case, the decision to include or exclude the topic ‘Europe’ has very modest effects on our estimates. Because attitudes towards Europe are associated with both economic left–right and cultural issue domains, there is little that is independent.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the study of change requires identical questions that are posed at more than one point in time. Thus, we end up with all the questions that have been asked about domestic policy preferences in more than one year for the period of our study, 1973–2008.</p>
<p>Although all such data are in some sense public, obtaining them can be a considerable challenge. There is no single source that contains the output of the whole survey enterprise of France, and that is particularly true for commercial surveys. Finding ‘<italic>sondages</italic>’ published before the advent of electronic journalism and web publication is a particularly vexing problem. We have undoubtedly failed to find all existing materials and thus make the limited claim that we have used everything we could find.</p>
<p>We have collected almost 1000 items of aggregate survey reports. These reports include information on French citizens’ responses to a particular question at a particular time. The data set contains nearly 200 question series, where a series is the same question asked multiple times. The content of the questions ranges from familiar controversies about the proper role of government in the domestic economy to environmental concerns, gay rights, the death penalty, immigration, globalization, and so on.</p>
<p>Each item is summarized with a single indicator, which is used to construct a ratio of all ‘left’ responses to the total of all ‘left’ and ‘right’ responses. Since most items concern the standard positions of the major political parties, it is quite easy to differentiate left from right. For issues on the periphery of the party system, such as globalization, left and right positions are harder to distinguish. However, our judgment of what is left and what is right does not affect the results because our estimation technology would observe a bad coding decision as a negative sign where a positive one was expected and automatically correct it.</p>
<p>We consider a preference question as a survey probe that asks respondents to choose between different alternative public policies. An example is the question posed by TNS Sofres:<disp-quote>
<p>‘In order to cope with economic difficulties, do you think it is necessary to trust business corporations and give them more freedom, or that it is necessary, on the contrary, that the state controls and regulates more closely?’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the respondent has to choose along what appears to be the standard left–right dimension. We supplement these true preference items with what we call quasi-preferences. For example, respondents are often asked to respond to a word or phrase, which has implications for their preferences. One such item is:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Thinking of the economy, tell me if each of these words evokes for you something positive or negative? Competition.’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Our prior belief is that these varied and multifaceted survey probes have a common and fairly simple structure. How can we then discover the dimensional structure of these data?</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1465116512436703"><title>Estimation technique</title>
<p>How does one get under the surface of expressed policy attitudes to observe the more general dimension of preferences? Our starting point is the notion that general attitudes lead respondents to apply principles – or, more loosely, ‘considerations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1465116512436703">Zaller, 1992</xref>) – when answering specific queries. Thus, the problem is to infer from the observed specifics to the general. Because our data are aggregates – the expressed views of national samples at various times and on various questions – the challenge is to generate the latent dimensions of the considerations that produced them.</p>
<p>This is, in general, a principal components sort of problem because we try to estimate explanatory reference axes from data in which the responses are meaningful only in reference to the particular words of the question that generated them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1465116512436703">4</xref></sup> We wish to get beneath the words to estimate the attitudes that generated the survey response. Thus we start with the assumption that the number of dimensions of attitudes is smaller than the number of observed questions. However, how many dimensions are required for a satisfactory summary of the data is an empirical question.</p>
<p>Because the data required for principal components do not exist, we need to resort to another strategy. What we do have are survey questions repeated a few times over the long period we intend to investigate. In the language of survey research, this is a missing data problem. But it is missing data with a vengeance because far more potential data values are <italic>not</italic> observed than are observed. That is, in most years in which a survey organization could have posed a particular question, it chose not to do so.</p>
<p>The data structure we have – dictated by the survey research record – is characterized by pieces of time-series data: the same questions have been posed a few times at irregular intervals. Since most observations are missing both at the beginning and at the end of our period of study, there is no realistic possibility of imputing values for these missing observations.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we apply the dyad ratios algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1465116512436703">Stimson, 1991</xref>), which is explicitly analogous to principal components. It solves the same problems and employs similar logic, but it is specifically designed for the sort of irregular data we have, in contrast to the regular structure of variables by principal components. However, the intellectual challenges are the same. We need to explore how many dimensions are required to represent expressed opinions. We need to observe how individual measures are or are not associated with the underlying dimensions – to infer the meaning of the latter. And we need to generate estimates of the latent dimensions to exploit in our analyses.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1465116512436703"><title>Multidimensional attitudes for a multi-party system?</title>
<p>We wish to derive a picture of the dimensional structure of policy preferences. To be true to what we know, this picture needs to capture the idea that there is more than one set of issues at play and thus more than one dimension to political conflict in France. French attitudes have long been structured around a tension between the state and the market, between socialism, social democracy, and the welfare state in contest with the free market and capitalism, as means of allocating values. Clearly, there are also numerous important issues that have nothing to do with state vs. market. Notably, these are conflicts about immigration, the death penalty, homosexuality, religion – particularly Islam – and the like.</p>
<p>Also, and equally important, our picture of dimensionality needs to capture the idea that the different dimensions are far from being independent of each other. This is particularly true when the role of political parties is introduced into the analysis. Politicization of values and preferences can strongly depend on the way candidates and parties emphasize some issues on their agenda, omit others (such as national identity for Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 or social fracture for Jacques Chirac in 1995), and the way they frame them. On these matters, immigration became an electoral issue only in the 1980s, whereas it could have been electorally even more profitable in the 1970s, a period in which ethnic prejudices were even more acute among the French public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1465116512436703">Roux, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The common recourse in the study of dimensionality is to impose the assumption of orthogonal dimensions, which eases the interpretation because we understand orthogonality. This does not work in our article because there is much evidence that the socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of policy conflict are closely linked in France. Just as there is a left and a right (‘gauche’ and ‘droite’) in the conflict over the role of the state in the economy, the same ‘gauche’ and ‘droite’ parties are quite strongly associated with positions on cultural issues. If one thinks of cultural issues as a dimension from ‘open’ and tolerant on one end and ‘closed’ and intolerant on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1465116512436703">Tiberj, 2008</xref>), ‘open’ is clearly associated with the economic left and ‘closed’ is the domain of the right. The extreme right Front National defines the closed position in its program. Although not quite as clean or as long established as in the case of economic issues, there is nonetheless a clear left and right in the cultural domain. And, if both dimensions are defined in part by left and right, then they cannot be orthogonal.</p>
<p>To state the matter formally, our prior is that we will find more than one dimension structuring our observed policy conflict, but that the dimensions that emerge from the analysis will be correlated. To fit that prior, we employ a procedure that will discover as many dimensions as exist in the data but will allow for the interpretation that those dimensions are not orthogonal but correlated.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1465116512436703"><title>A strategy for estimation</title>
<p>We wish to achieve two ends: first, to produce measures of the dimensions of opinion in order to study their evolution, their effects on elections, and so forth; and, second, to understand what the dimensions mean and how they are related. We can accomplish the first aim by statistical means and statistical criteria. The second aim will require that we bring some prior knowledge to bear.</p>
<p>To produce longitudinal measures, we will simply extract as many dimensions as are required for a satisfactory explanation of variance. This will give us a typically unsatisfactory principal components solution in which almost everything is highly related to the first dimension and the second dimension is a kind of out-of-phase residual that has no clear theoretical interpretation. Then we will exploit our knowledge of French politics and our knowledge of the face content of survey items to impose a clearer meaning on the dimensions.</p>
<p>We will proceed as follows. First, we will use our knowledge of the face content of the survey items to group them into two categories, socioeconomic and cultural. Although this is easily done, its main disadvantage is that it will depend upon our assumption about two dimensions in the first place. Then we will estimate solutions – which turn out to be cleanly one-dimensional – for each domain. Then we will use those results to select criterion variables for each domain. These variables will combine face validity and evidence that they form clean statistical clusters. Lastly, we will independently rotate our final solution so that the obtained dimensions maximize the fit with the criterion variables. This is a novel step in this analysis because we use prior theory rather than wholly statistical criteria to interpret a solution.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1465116512436703"><title>A low-tech solution</title>
<p>Our first effort is to separate our survey items into two sets, socioeconomic and cultural, by their face content. Then we solve for the underlying dimensions of each, which turn out in both cases to be one-dimensional, as expected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1465116512436703">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec11-1465116512436703"><title>Socioeconomic issues</title>
<p>We begin with topics that tap the standard and long-standing issue that separates left and right in France. These are controversies about nationalization and privatization, socialism versus capitalism, government versus market, the provision of social services, the rights of labor unions, and so forth.</p>
<p>Compared with the Anglo-Saxon democracies, the survey record for these issues is not rich in content. Relatively few issues were enduring enough to be measured in multiple years. And, when controversies are recurrent, French survey data are often a frustrating array of different questions and styles of questions rather than standardized and continuous collections of questions. In essence, we have about 350 different questions divided into 76 series. Because the series are on average quite short, it is a challenge to estimate the latent underlying dimension.</p>
<p>Our attempt to do so is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512436703">Table 1</xref>, where we array the loadings of 11 selected items (out of the 76). Because the whole list is too lengthy and items with few cases provide no meaningful information about loadings, we have listed only those that meet two criteria: they need, first, to be available for five or more years and, secondly, to have significant positive loadings on the estimated dimension.

<p>What can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1465116512436703">Table 1</xref> is largely what we would have expected. The French left and right disagree about whether the government or the market should be in control, whether capitalism and profit are desirable or undesirable, and whether regulation aids or hinders the economy. From these somewhat skimpy materials, we have nonetheless been able to estimate the underlying dimension of conflict over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1465116512436703">Figure 1</xref> presents the estimated series accompanied by two standard error boundaries indicating approximate 95 percent confidence intervals of the annual estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1465116512436703">6</xref></sup> The figure graphs the derived dimension in a metric based on the original items, where each is scored as the percentage of left over the percentage of left plus right. The picture of the drift of public opinion that it portrays is that of a mainly centrist opinion that underwent one cycle from relatively left to relatively right and back again in the years of Pompidou, Giscard d’Estaing, and Mitterrand and has remained slightly left of the center since then in the years of Chirac and Sarkozy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1465116512436703">7</xref></sup>

<p>The French public seems to follow the same thermostatic logic as the Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1465116512436703">Wlezien, 1995</xref>) and the British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512436703">Bartle et al., 2011</xref>), demanding more leftist policies when the right is in power and asking for less when the government is left-wing. The thermostatic logic follows the rhythm dictated by the political coloration of the Prime Minister (where in the US the speed is more connected to the party occupying the White House). This is particularly true during the three ‘cohabitation’ periods (Chirac under the Mitterrand term between 1986 and 1988, Balladur during the second Mitterrand term between 1993 and 1995, and Jospin during the first Chirac term between 1997 and 2002). Since the re-election of Jacques Chirac in 2002, the French public has regularly asked for more leftist policies.</p>
<p>Just as the conception of left and right pre-dates all of its modern content, many newer issues have crept onto the French political agenda, arriving after a party system was established primarily on the left–right axis. We turn to those issues now.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1465116512436703"><title>Cultural issues</title>
<p>The issue agenda of French politics, like those of other Western democracies, has grown in the last few decades by including new sets of issues. These sets of issues, like the socioeconomic issues, help define left and right in French politics. However, they differ in that they are not a mere extension of socioeconomic issues, but something different. We call them cultural, because they are often rooted in conflicts over old and new values, or old and new lifestyles. Among this set, there are issues such as ecology, globalization, homosexuality, racial and religious discrimination, the death penalty, and immigration. All these issue domains are clearly separable. Whether they are in fact separate or form a coherent cluster of common content is an empirical issue to which we turn now.</p>
<p>Using as input all these issues – that is, everything except standard left–right socioeconomic issues – we estimate a second dimension of public opinion in France in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1465116512436703">Table 2</xref>. For the period 1973–2008, we have 494 readings on these diverse issue domains from which to estimate the latent dimension of 36 years. Again selecting items by the number of years and the strength of positive loadings, we display 23 of our 32 separate series in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1465116512436703">Table 2</xref>. The message we take from the table is that these diverse issue domains all tap a common dimension of opinion, left–right in a cultural sense. The highest-loading items include issues such as immigration, homosexuality, anti-Semitism, globalization, and traditional values.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>With about 58 percent of all variance explained, the evidence for a unidimensional interpretation of the cultural sphere is quite strong. Although one can think of many reasons why, for example, homosexuality raises different issues than globalization – obviously they have nothing in common – there is a cluster of common attitudes toward France and French culture that ties all the issues together. Our results support the French literature on these matters. For 1988, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1465116512436703">Grunberg and Schweisguth (1990)</xref> found a strong inter-item correlation between sexual bigotry and opinions regarding immigration, the death penalty, and other law and order policies. The same authors confirmed this finding for 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512436703">Grunberg and Schweisguth, 1997</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1465116512436703">Chiche et al. (2000)</xref> found similar results based on the 1997 CEVIPOF electoral survey. All these opinions seem to converge to a modern version of the authoritarian personality of Adorno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1465116512436703">Adorno et al., 1950</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1465116512436703"><title>Left vs. right and left vs. right?</title>
<p>So, what is this second dimension? It seems to pose a contrast between freedom of various sorts and traditional values. The freedom end of the dimension advocates tolerance of homosexuality and of immigrants, which are two examples of breaking from traditional roles and views. And it embraces such diverse issues as the protection of the environment and opposing an extended role for the police in society. The other pole is easier to characterize. It is a fondness for things as they used to be, where tradition dictated social behavior and the forces of order were always ready to step in when needed. In a benign view, it is reverence for things as they were. In a less benign interpretation, it is authoritarian nationalism, as most obviously manifested in support for the party of Le Pen in 2002 and, more recently, the added appeal of Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007.</p>
<p>In the terms of party politics, there is clearly a left and a right dimension to cultural issues. The parties of the left have advocated tolerance of diversity of all kinds and have been comfortable with changing social norms when the right was not. So here we are using the language of left and right even though these issues are quite different from our understanding of left vs. right as a matter of socialism vs. capitalism, of economic equality, support for labor unions, and so forth. So these issue dimensions, whatever their statistical properties might be, are <italic>not</italic> orthogonal from a theoretical point of view. There is a meaningful left and right in both dimensions. This is not an accident. A party system that is primarily defined by a single axis will put its stamp on whatever new issues come along. However independent these new issues might have been, they will acquire the imprint of the existing axis after they have become part of the political dialogue.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1465116512436703"><title>Some observations about the two dimensions</title>
<p>From the evidence at hand we can reach some preliminary conclusions about the two dimensions. First, they are pretty strongly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .56). Second, this association has been growing stronger over time. If we restrict the comparison to the period beginning in the 1980s, the correlation reaches .68; for 1990 to the present, it amounts to .81. This growing interdependence supports the interpretation that the two dimensions were originally – for the period before we have measures – more or less orthogonal and have become correlated as the cultural issues became tied to the left and right of the party system. This is also supported by the visual impression produced by the figure. In the first half of our period of observation, cultural preferences tend to be less sensitive to the thermostatic logic, whereas in the second (beginning in the 1990s) evolutions of the social and cultural dimensions seem to converge over time.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1465116512436703"><title>A more elegant solution</title>
<p>It is to some degree unsatisfactory to have a dimensional interpretation that is based on the <italic>prior</italic> sorting into categories. The result is too dependent upon the prior decision to think about socioeconomic and cultural issues as being different from each other. We would like to have a dimensional result that does not depend on this choice. To achieve that we will group all of the items together and solve for the dimensional structure, using rotation to align the dimensions with one another.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1465116512436703"><title>Multidimensional estimation</title>
<p>We can just let the estimation algorithm find as many dimensions as possible in the data. That will give us a two-dimensional solution, but not the <italic>correct</italic> two dimensions. The problem is that the estimated second dimension will be orthogonal to the first one (by design). However, we now know that the cultural dimension is <italic>not</italic> orthogonal to the socioeconomic dimension. Therefore, the estimated second dimension will necessarily be something else and, as is typically the case in longitudinal analyses, will probably not be meaningful.</p>
<p>With the two individual analyses at hand, we are in a good position to choose a set of criterion variables for each domain. These will combine face validity, which is a judgment call, and an easy one, with knowledge about the statistical association between indicators gained from the dimensional solution. Then, for interpretation, we will rotate both of the obtained dimensions <italic>independently</italic> to maximize the fit with the criterion variables. This will give us a clean interpretation of the dimensions’ meaning as well as knowledge of their inter-correlation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1465116512436703"><title>A note on the mathematics of rotation</title>
<p>A generic fact of principal components (and, equally, dyad ratios) is that the initial solution is under-identified. One may rotate the reference axes by any number of degrees to obtain an equally good solution. Rotation leaves points fixed in space but changes their relationship to the two axes, increasing one while decreasing the other. The function that accomplishes rotation is the orthonormal transformation. For angle of rotation <italic>θ</italic>, expressed in radians, the orthonormal is the two by two matrix:
<disp-formula id="disp-formul1-1465116512436703"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1465116512436703-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>By using (1), one can try any proposed degree of rotation and observe the loadings on the new axes. We will choose the rotations that maximize fit to the criterion variables.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1465116512436703"><title>The result of rotation</title>
<p>We begin by specifying criterion variables for each dimension (see web appendix). These are chosen for two criteria: (1) face validity with our concepts ‘socioeconomic’ and ‘cultural’ and (2) because they cluster together. Then we estimate an unconstrained two-dimensional solution for the full data matrix.</p>
<p>We graph the derived loadings in the two-dimensional space in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1465116512436703">Figure 3</xref>. Here, one sees immediately why separating the socioeconomic and the cultural dimensions is such a problem. The points that represent socioeconomic and cultural issues are closely interspersed and occupy the same portion of the space. This means that both proposed ‘dimensions’ will therefore load strongly on the first derived dimension. And then, since the variance owing to cultural issues is already largely explained by the first dimension, the residual becomes an uninteresting cluster of unexplained variance that forms a statistically discernible, but theoretically meaningless, second dimension.
<fig id="fig3-1465116512436703" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The two-dimensional dyad ratios solution: Unrotated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1465116512436703-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Note particularly the cluster of points on the right, lying along (and highly correlated with) the X axis. Because these points are a mixture of both socioeconomic and cultural issues, one can anticipate the result of rotating. Any solution that maximizes the fit to one set is going to be very close to the maximum of the other. Thus, just by taking a quick look one can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1465116512436703">Figure 3</xref> the solution that is likely to emerge. The French party system has aligned socioeconomic and cultural debates. Statistical solutions cannot take apart what nature has joined together.</p>
<p>When two dimensions are tightly correlated, as here, one can force the estimation of an independent second dimension. Because the two dimensions are not independent, attempting to force them produces a meaningless result for the second dimension.</p>
<p>Now we relax the enforced independence and ask how the two reference axes would align together if they were allowed to rotate independently to optimize their fit to the two defined sets of criteria. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1465116512436703">Figure 4</xref> shows the result.

<p>The concept of dimension is similar in the longitudinal world to that of the cross-sectional one, but they are not identical. The conclusion of a two-dimensional longitudinal structure to French public opinion thus does not automatically imply the same conclusion in a cross-section. We turn here to recent data from the French election of 2007, specifically Le Baromètre Politique Français (2006–7) conducted by CEVIPOF for the Ministry of the Interior. It contains measures broadly similar to those we have exploited, most of which are already included in our longitudinal analysis. The questions are posed to around 4000 respondents in four waves.</p>
<p>We pose the same question: ‘What is the structure of policy preferences in France?’ To answer that, we exploit the conventional technology of principal components analysis, where conventional assumptions are appropriate for this case. By analyzing 12 available domestic policy preference items, we observe an unsatisfactory result similar to what we have already seen in the longitudinal domain. The socioeconomic and cultural meanings of left–right are so closely tied that the statistically best solution of the two dimensions does not cleanly separate the two. Some of the ‘cultural’ items (for example, the death penalty and immigration) load more heavily on the presumed ‘socioeconomic’ first dimension than in their own proper domain.</p>
<p>So we proceed in the same fashion as before, performing two separate analyses on the two groups of questions. We first group the preference questions by domain (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1465116512436703">Table 3</xref> for the questions) and sort them by their face content. In addition, we estimate the dimensional solution for each group. In each case, a solution with one dimension emerges as a satisfactory representation of the individual items, explaining about 32 percent of the economic items and about 47 percent of the cultural items.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1465116512436703">9</xref></sup> Despite the noise of individual-level data, all the loadings are robust.

<p>Most questions involve a right stimulus and ask for agreement or approval. In two cases where the stimulus is left, the signs of the loadings are appropriately reversed. Although the cross-sectional analysis might have come out differently, it draws the same portrait of a two-dimensional structure of French policy preferences.</p>
<p>With the estimates of the two underlying dimensions at hand, we exploit the Baromètre data to place the 4000 or so individual respondents in a two-dimensional space. Grouping them by their expressed party identifications allows us to estimate the positions of each of the 13 parties that participated in the 2007 presidential election and locate them in the two-dimensional space by simply using the means of the party identifiers on each dimension.</p>
<p>We show that result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1465116512436703">Figure 5</xref>. The figure locates all parties in our two-dimensional space (and highlights the big electoral parties). On the left of the space lie the traditional parties of the left, the Communists (of several stripes), Socialists, and Greens (of which the Parti Socialiste is the only major electoral force). On the right are Sarkozy’s UMP, which defines the rightward space of economic issues, and the Front National of Le Pen, which appropriately defines the rightmost position on the cultural issue set. In between is the Mouvement Démocrate (formerly the UDF) of François Bayrou. The MoDem, equivalent to third-party candidacies in the US, was impressive in early polling, but virtually disappeared as election day approached and voters split off to support one of the two parties that would survive the first round of the two election rounds.
<fig id="fig5-1465116512436703" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Thirteen parties arrayed in two-dimensional issue space. <italic>Note:</italic> Symbol size indicates approximate proportions of identifiers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1465116512436703-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On the cultural dimension, one can see the consensus position advocating openness and tolerance of various kinds, which characterizes most of the major parties. Because it is a consensus position, none of the parties is distinctively to the left of the others. The Front National stands out as distinctively to the right, the home of voters who reject openness and tolerance. Sarkozy’s UMP, defined by the position of its supporters, is only slightly to the right of the center on the cultural dimension, as befitting a party too large and heterogeneous to be as distinctive as the relatively tiny splinter parties. But Sarkozy himself considered the Front National supporters as a pool of possible voters who could provide the edge, and he positioned himself to appeal to their culturally right preferences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1465116512436703">Figure 5</xref> also tells us something very important about the two dimensions of preference: they are not by any means independent. Notice that the upper-right and lower-left quadrants of the figure are nearly empty, whereas the upper-left and the lower-right quadrants define most of the parties, including the two major ones, which have by far the largest numbers of adherents. Entirely independently estimated, the two dimensions of preference are orthogonal neither in principle nor in fact. It is perhaps the most common of all interpretative errors to jump from the supposition that two dimensions <italic>might be</italic> entirely unrelated to the conclusion that they <italic>are</italic>. In France they are not. To be left on socioeconomic issues for most voters means to be left on cultural issues as well, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This tells us a very important story about France. The two dimensions of preferences scheme could have resulted in a four-pole party system opposing the ‘old’ socioeconomic left and right to a ‘new’ cultural left and right, as seems to be the case in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1465116512436703">Houtman et al., 2008</xref>). Our results contradict this assumption. Parties tend to align on a unique line ranging from a socioeconomic and cultural leftist pole to an economically and culturally conservative one.</p>
<p>This can be understood only by taking into account the evolutions of the parties themselves and particularly their responsiveness to the politicization of the cultural dimension. In the past, it might have been true that the mainstream parties such as the socialists and the moderate right competed on the socioeconomic dimension only (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1465116512436703">Martin, 2000</xref>). The emergence of the Front National and its appeal to ethnic prejudices in particular and to cultural issues in general has changed the game. As a result, it can be presumed that traditional parties have been forced to integrate such issues into their platforms. This can be shown by simply looking at the normative logic of the vote between the socialists and the right, particularly in the clear-cut situation of the second round of the presidential elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1465116512436703">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the exception of the 2002 French presidential election, three out of four of the most recent elections resulted in the choice of either a socialist candidate (François Mitterrand in 1988, Lionel Jospin in 1995, and Ségolène Royal in 2007) or a (neo-)Gaullist candidate (Jacques Chirac in 1988 and 1995 and Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007). For all these elections, post-electoral surveys were conducted by CEVIPOF. Based on the three questionnaires, we have constructed a measure of the socioeconomic and cultural preferences of voters that relies on the results of our principal components analysis. The result is a set of three continuous cultural variables and three continuous socioeconomic variables, two for each election. These two variables have been used as independent variables for predicting the choice between the two candidates in the second round.</p>
<p>The results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1465116512436703">Figure 6</xref>) are quite straightforward and summarize our story of the inclusion of the cultural dimension in the logic of voting. In 1988, the cultural dimension was clearly not in voters’ minds when the choice between Mitterrand and Chirac was at stake (except for voters with no particular preferences between traditional leftist or rightist economic policies). What mattered was whether or not they favored redistribution and a strong role of the government in the economy. Immigration, sexual bigotry, and law and order were ignored. This began to change in 1995, when variations appeared in terms of voting probabilities across the cultural divide. Nevertheless, the traditional socioeconomic dimension was still playing the primary role. By 2007, both dimensions were contributing almost equally to the choice between Nicolas Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal. We have created an index for measuring the relative impact of the two dimensions. Our impact index reaches a value of 3.2 in 1988 in favor of the socioeconomic dimension. By 2007, it had dropped to 1.3, showing the almost equal role of cultural conflicts in deciding the vote.

<sec id="sec20-1465116512436703"><title>Concluding reflections</title>
<p>We have told a simple story of French electoral politics – a story of 12 parties competing in an issue space of only two dimensions, with both dimensions being anything but independent. Can it be that simple? The 12 parties could accommodate more complexity. It is theoretically reasonable to imagine 11 dimensions. So how can it be that France’s 12 parties require only two dimensions of controversy, when that same number fits a two-party system in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512436703">Stimson, 2004</xref>) or a two-and-a-half-party system in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1465116512436703">Bartle et al., 2011</xref>)?</p>
<p>An attempt to answer this question would claim that 12 parties do not make a party system. In many regards, France is essentially a system of two parties – the UMP (and its predecessors) and the Parti Socialiste (PS). These two define the axis of competition. They are the only two parties to have governed in the Fifth Republic. And in 2012 we can say with some confidence that the new struggle for the presidency will be fought between them. At each presidential election it is expected that the second round will feature a contest between the UMP and the PS. When that famously did not occur in 2002, the absence of the PS in the second round effectively ended the totally lopsided contest after the first round.</p>
<p>One need not look far for an explanation. The two-round voting system in France features a final contest between two parties. And, more than that, rational voters in the first round will have to anticipate who the second-round contestants will be. Voters who prefer a party other than the two electoral parties in the first round vote must anticipate who will move on to the second round in order to decide whether to cast a vote for one of the eventual winners – and therefore influence who will form a government – or to cast a vote that will send a message but have no influence on the final outcome. Both choices could be a rational act. What is not rational is failing to consider the outcome. And voters of the electoral parties might also send a message by voting to the left or right of their preferred party so long as they are assured that their preferred party will reach the second round. In this manner, the French voting system ends up posing a bipolar choice. And that is consistent with a simple set of preference configurations in the minds of voters, which is what we see.</p>
<p>Those who comment on French politics have often declared the left–right dimension to be one of fading significance, if not wholly obsolete. Partly, this is the result of the often mentioned importance of new sorts of issues, such as immigration, that do not derive from conflicts over socialism and capitalism. Indeed, one of the survey questions that is posed more often asks voters to agree with the interpretation: ‘Today the notions of left and right do not make much sense anymore.’ Asking voters to agree with what sounds like the conclusion of thoughtful analysts, we should not be surprised that one-third or so agree. Probably we could replace ‘left and right’ with almost anything else, perhaps ‘the Earth is round’, and get similar results. So we should not take agreement very seriously.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the hypothesis is disputed. It conflicts with the more general observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1465116512436703">Lipset and Rokkan (1967)</xref> that modern party cleavages are ‘frozen’, reflecting the political controversies of the early 20th century. What we see here is consistent with neither. We find left and right resilient precisely because they are not ‘frozen’. What we see instead is a left–right axis that persists precisely because it is dynamic. New issues come along and do not add new dimensionality to politics in the long run. Instead, the parties of the left and the right take positions on them and redefine them in terms of left and right.</p>
<p>We should recall that ‘left’ and ‘right’ have their origin in disputes between monarchists and republicans. These terms characterized essential differences between political camps in French politics long before the debate over socialism and capitalism, long before the organization of labor, and long before the welfare state. We can see from this example that there is nothing new in alignment dynamics. Alignments of issue controversies have long adapted to novelty and incorporated the novel into the meaning of politics. We simply see the same thing happening now.</p>
<p>The key to understanding dimensional dynamics in France and, so far as we know, in all electoral democracies, is that party systems abhor orthogonal issues. Such issues may exist, ever so briefly, before strategic political actors have figured out how to exploit them to maximum advantage. In the long run, however, party systems will align any new issue with the existing basis of political contestation. This is the issue evolution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1465116512436703">Carmines and Stimson, 1989</xref>), generalized beyond race and beyond the United States. Evolving party systems tend toward an equilibrium state of one dimension – although they never arrive at that state because new issues are introduced faster than old ones can become fully aligned.

Although coming from different directions, both theories were developed simultaneously and benefited from pre-publication conversations.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1465116512436703"><label>3.</label><p>The most careful elaboration of the full theory – richer than the original one – can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1465116512436703">Stimson (2004: 58–76)</xref>, where the abortion issue in the US is the illustrative case.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1465116512436703"><label>4.</label><p>We also need to emphasize that this is a <italic>longitudinal</italic> principal components problem. Although the mathematics of treating time as the unit of analysis is identical to the more customary cross-sectional analysis, the meaning of ‘dimension’ is a little different in the longitudinal domain. Thus, the dimensionality found in a longitudinal analysis is related to, but not identical with, the dimension in the cross-sectional sense. See below for a cross-sectional approach to the problem.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1465116512436703"><label>5.</label><p>The estimated eigenvalues of the dyad ratios algorithm are smaller than those of the principal components, because they are weighted by the proportion of cases present. Thus the eigenvalue &gt;1.0 criterion for judging a common dimension is not appropriate. The scree test and variance explained are comparable to the principal components case. For the economic case, dimension 1 comprises an eigenvalue of 5.51 out of a possible 10.97, or 50.2 percent of all the variance. Dimension 2 is 0.45 out of 10.97, or 4.4 percent. In the cultural case, dimension 1 is 6.53 out of 11.28, or 57.9 percent, while dimension 2 is 0.49 out of 11.28, or 4.4 percent. Both cases obviously show a single-dimension solution.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1465116512436703"><label>6.</label><p>The standard errors are estimated by bootstrapping the estimation algorithm. We resample the original data points, using the reported percentages as means of normal distributions and then taking draws from a normal distribution in lieu of using the reported data. That gives us 1000 different estimates of the latent dimension. The standard deviation of those 1000 estimates for each year becomes our standard error estimate.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1465116512436703"><label>7.</label><p>For a similar conclusion of centrism in French public opinion, based upon a quite different approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1465116512436703">Laver et al. (2006)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-1465116512436703"><label>8.</label><p>The geometry of rotation is related to correlation by: <italic>r</italic> = cos(<italic>θ</italic>). Thus, for <italic>θ</italic> = 11°, <italic>r</italic> = .98. Although the estimated dimensions are not this highly correlated, this result tells us that the pure dimensions, estimated without errors, are nearly identical.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-1465116512436703"><label>9.</label><p>Here we are employing conventional principal components analysis, so the eigenvalue &gt;1.0 criterion becomes appropriate. For the socioeconomic dimension, a second dimension has an eigenvalue of .22. In the cultural case, a second dimension is .05. Clearly these are one-dimensional solutions.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1465116512436703"><label>10.</label><p>On this matter we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1465116512436703">Andersen and Evans (2005)</xref>, who claim that the French party system can be seen as a two-bloc system and no longer as the left vs. the moderate right vs. the extreme right, which was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1465116512436703">Grunberg and Schweisguth (1997)</xref>.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
