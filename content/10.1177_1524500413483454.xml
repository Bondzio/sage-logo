<abstract>
<p>This article reports the development of tools for use by local commissioning teams, based in English Local Authorities (Local Government Councils), to evaluate the value for money of their behavior change investments. The national program was guided by a panel of senior advisers and included consultations with experts in the field, as the basis for the design of the methodology. Evaluation tools were then developed applying evidence provided by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the World Health Organization, Health England (a national group set up to advise on public health policy), and other sources. As data were often incomplete, provision was made to update the tools as further evidence emerges. The tools, which are now available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thensmc.com/resources/vfm">http://www.thensmc.com/resources/vfm</ext-link>, cover: smoking cessation, alcohol harm reduction, obesity reduction, comprising, weight loss, diet and increased activity, breast feeding continuation, and participation in bowel cancer screening. The use of these tools by local teams has proved valuable in demonstrating the relative value for money of local interventions and the importance of further developments of this kind.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public health policy in England is experiencing a Copernican revolution, as responsibilities for commissioning health promotion services are moved from the National Health Service (NHS) to Local Authorities in 2013. This brings with it a change of emphasis from a focus on specific health outcomes and reducing costs to the NHS, to a broader concern for the impact of behavior on well-being and social costs. Furthermore, while the NHS has largely been content to follow centrally determined priorities for investment to support behavior change, Local Authorities are encouraged to set their own local agendas in planning and evaluating investments in this field.</p>
<p>In anticipation of these shifts, the Department of Health (DH) commissioned a program to develop tools to help local teams to evaluate the value for money of interventions to improve health and well-being by encouraging and supporting behavior change. It was led by the National Social Marketing Centre (NSMC) and carried out over 12 months from July 2010 to July 2011 at a cost of £150,000. The work was guided by a panel of experts chaired by Dr. Fiona Adshead (former Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England). The panel was supported by a team from the NSMC, a team from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and an economic adviser. Tools were independently quality assured by Matrix Consulting and prepared for online presentation by Rechord Ltd.</p>
<p>There are many helpful guidelines to good practice in evaluating interventions to support behavior change for better health, including:“Benchmark Criteria and ShowCase Studies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500413483454">NSMC, 2010</xref>), “Guidelines on Behaviour Change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500413483454">NICE, 2007</xref>), “Valuing Health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500413483454">Local Government Improvement and Development, 2009</xref>), “Social Return on Marketing: Communications and Behaviour Change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500413483454">Central Office of Information, 2009a</xref>) and “Payback and Return on Marketing Investment in the Public Sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500413483454">Central Office of Information, 2009b</xref>), and the “Guide to Social Return on Investment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500413483454">New Economics Foundation, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also several studies that show that particular types of intervention are likely to be highly cost effective, these include “Kicking Bad Habits”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500413483454">Kings Fund, 2008</xref>), “Health England Leading Prioritisation” (HELP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500413483454">Matrix Consulting, 2009</xref>), “Assessing Cost Effectiveness (ACE—Prevention)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524500413483454">University of Queensland, Australia, 2010</xref>), “Supporting Investment in Public Health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500413483454">NICE, 2011</xref>), and “Measuring Social Value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500413483454">DH, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These guidelines and studies provided important starting points for the current program. However, while they show different ways of demonstrating value for money and their application, none provide a simple way of answering the question raised by every local study—“how much does meeting a particular behaviour change target contribute to future health, well-being and social cost savings?” in other words “what is it worth?”</p>
<sec id="section2-1524500413483454">
<title>Specifying the Evaluation Tools</title>
<p>The starting point for the program was to review current guidelines with the expert panel. A questionnaire was developed as part of a Delphi process to capture the views of people who commission, provide, or evaluate behavior change interventions. The initial questionnaire was developed with the help of the panel of experts who tested and suggested improvements to the questionnaire. The questions applied a Guttman Scalogram approach to judge the degree of agreement or disagreement to a range of approaches to evaluation suggested by the expert panel. In each case, provision was made for the inclusion of comments, feedback, and references, which respondents were invited to expand upon in further discussion. The process was designed to encourage consensus by feeding back responses to the respondents in face-to-face or telephone interviews. Face-to-face interviews were more satisfactory as they encouraged more flexible thinking however for practical reasons four of the interviews were conducted by telephone. Initial responses were obtained from 38 people and 17 follow-up interviews were conducted. The implications of the survey were then discussed with the expert panel. The analysis of the questionnaire and other background documents can be viewed at the Building Leadership for Health Internet site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500413483454">Lister, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The exercise revealed that while some were aware of the guidelines, in general commissioners and providers did not often apply them, most local interventions were evaluated only in qualitative terms. For this reason, the expert panel decided that there was little to be gained from issuing yet more guidelines, what were needed were low cost, easy to use evaluation tools that apply existing guidelines, as far as possible.</p>
<p>When respondents were asked to consider the most useful measures of value for money their responses reflected a wide range of approaches including: cost-effectiveness, cost utility, and cost consequence as well as the application of social return on investment. For this reason, in designing the tools allowance was made to provide as many of the measures demanded as possible. These included cost per health gain, before and after future savings to the NHS and Local Authority Services, employers and individuals, premature deaths averted, life year gains, reductions in years lived with disability, odds ratio, number needed to treat, benefits to individuals, savings to employers, impacts on government and public sector costs, societal impact in terms of the societal value of health gains, and social return on investment.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to comment on key features required in a methodology for evaluating the value for money of behavior change interventions. The expert panel’s decisions based in part on feedback from the Delphi exercise included:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Costs and benefits to all other stakeholders including clients, employers, government, and the NHS (beyond commissioner and provider costs) should be taken into account to meet the guidance originally issued by the Health Development Agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500413483454">Kelly, McDaid, Ludbrook, &amp; Powell, 2005</xref>), which recommended a pragmatic layered framework approach to evaluating costs and benefits to all stakeholders. Emphasis was placed on the need to identify possible savings to Local Authority services in view of changing responsibilities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Future benefits and cost savings should be estimated over the remaining life of clients. Life expectancy for a healthy person free of behavior issues was assumed to be 81. Additional NHS costs arising from the longer life expectancy were not included, since they are not taken into account in evaluating other treatment options. However, a facility was included to show how this factor could be taken into account if required.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Changes in long-term behavior and hence projected health outcomes and cost savings should be compared with ongoing trends, assuming a continuation of current policy measures but excluding the impact of the specific intervention to be evaluated.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Health gains should be estimated in quality adjusted life years gained (QALYs); premature deaths averted; years of life gained and years lived with disability (weighted for disability) reduced were also regarded as significant indicators. While current QALY estimates reflecting the quality of life as perceived by patients could be inconsistent, QALYs are the measure most commonly used in the NHS. Where data were only available for disability adjusted life years lost (DALYs) tools should translate these into QALYs.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Future health gains must take into account the likelihood that clients who achieve behavior changes are likely to revert to prior behavior—described as rebound rate, drop off rate, and other terms; this program applied the term persistence rate for each year up to 10 years, meaning the percentage continuing their behavior from 1 year to the next. In most cases, the persistence rate over the first year was far lower than in the subsequent 9 years, after 10 years no further change was considered.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Health gain estimates should also take into account the “health recovery rate,” that is, propensity of clients to recover their health, this is likely to vary with the age of the clients, young people recover more of their health sooner than older people.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>As persistence rates and health recovery rates are critical to outcomes but are poorly researched, the tools provide sensitivity analyses to show the impact of varying these estimates. It would also be possible to allow other factors within the tools to be varied, but this would generate a very wide range of outcomes that would make the tools difficult for users to interpret.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It was also noted that the social environment was an important determinant of the extent to which clients were likely to persist with behavior change, thus tools permit users to estimate the impact of things like support groups and steps to encourage school or community action for healthy lifestyles on persistence rates.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The impact of behavior change interventions on the family and friends of the clients targeted can extend the number of people benefiting from a behavior change intervention. Thus, where clear evidence was available, the tools make it possible to adjust for community multiplier effects.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Future cost savings, health gains, and other benefits should be discounted to arrive at current values applying the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500413483454">HM Treasury (2003</xref>) Green Book social time preference rate of 3.5%.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>There was disagreement about how the impact on reducing health inequality should be applied. Some favored giving more weight to impacts on disadvantaged people, using weights derived from the HELP study (Matrix Consulting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500413483454">2009</xref>). Others felt that disadvantage should be noted but dealt with through a different process. This latter approach was adopted but the HELP weights and priority scores are also shown.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Social Return on Investment is estimated as the current value of benefits for all stakeholders divided by the cost to all stakeholders and as the social value of the health gains generated divided by the cost to all stakeholders. It was proposed that for this purpose, the social value of a QALY should be assumed to be £25,000 in 2007/2008 prices. This is close to the nominal threshold used by NICE in appraising the value for money of health interventions of £30,000 per QALY in 2010/2011 prices.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The NICE team working with the program found that currently there are significant differences in the ways in which the costs of interventions are defined. In order to overcome this, they set out guidelines for the definition of capital and revenue costs to commissioners, providers, employers, and clients. Capital costs are spread over the period of intervention. In order to ensure that tools retain their usefulness, prices can be set in any year values from 2007/2008 to 2013/2014, based on estimates of inflation in each field.</p>

<title>Collating Relevant Evidence</title>
<p>The fields identified to test the development of tools were chosen because, they are significant areas of behavior change, relevant to current health policy, in a range of fields, and it was possible to identify key targets for behavior change. These were</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Smoking cessation: 4-week quitters.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Alcohol harm reduction: participation in a counseling or brief advice session.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Obesity reduction, comprising weight control, activity and diet improvement, personal targets for: weight loss, activity sessions, and portions of fruit and vegetables eaten.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Breast feeding continuation: continuation of breast feeding to 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Bowel cancer survey response: response to a Fecal Occult Blood test (FOBt) survey.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In future studies, better targets would be smoking cessation: 4-week quitters verified by carbon monoxide testing, alcohol harm reduction: measures of units consumed, obesity: personal targets for BMI, activity, calorie consumption and balanced nutrition, breast feeding continuation: followed up at 3 months and FOBt: response rates to first and second round surveys. All other behavior changes should be assessed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.</p>
<p>The NICE team found reasonable evidence of potential cost savings to the NHS from behavior changes. This was extended where possible to include savings to Local Authority services, employers, clients, and impacts on government income and expenditures. It was also necessary to consider transfer costs, such as pensions, taxes and benefits, and costs relating to the purchase of alcohol and tobacco. Cost savings arising from reduced demand on local services such as police, fire, social care, and street cleaning were estimated, applying a conservative assumption of long-run marginal cost impact.</p>
<p>Evidence was found indicating the expected health impact of particular interventions in the fields of alcohol harm reduction and bowel cancer in terms of QALYs. However, research evidence of the benefits of behavior change interventions in relation to smoking cessation, obesity, and continuation of breast feeding were inadequate. In these cases, working with a team from the World Health Organization (WHO), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524500413483454">WHO (2009)</xref> <italic>National Burden of Disease Tool</italic> of was used. This applies measures of the burden of disease for each health outcome, measured as DALYs lost, attributable to health-related behavior for each age/sex cohort for low-mortality European region countries in 2004, to current U.K. health outcomes adjusted for England. In the case of obesity-related outcomes, the Burden of Disease tool provides an estimate of the marginal impact of weight loss, low-activity levels, and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Since impacts are estimated in DALYs, equivalent QALY reductions were calculated using conversion rates derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500413483454">Sassi (2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It was also necessary to estimate the current levels and trends in behavior, persistence of behavior change and health recovery rates applicable to smoking, alcohol harm, obesity breast feeding, and response to FOBt surveys. Trend data were important because estimates of health impact based on current behavior underestimate the impact of obesity, which is rising fast, and overestimate the impact of smoking, which is declining. Evidence of persistence and health recovery rates at different ages was found for smoking, and some evidence indicated likely age-related rates for obesity. For breast feeding, patterns of uptake and continuation for mothers of different ages and educational backgrounds were applied. For FOBt, responses estimates were based on the social class and ethnicity of clients.</p>
<p>None of the evidence used in the evaluation tools is ideal; however, it provided a sufficient basis to test the concept; user guides set out references for all evidence used and the basis for all assumptions. The tools make it possible for all estimates to be improved as better data become available or as consensus changes on the most appropriate assumptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524500413483454">
<title>Developing the Tools</title>
<p>The tools were developed as Excel applications using 4 to 6 worksheets which calculate the outcomes for health and for cost-effectiveness based on the evidence and assumptions input to the tool. The Data Input worksheet permits users to enter the cost of the intervention, relevant characteristics of clients, and behavior change targets achieved. Where necessary, the system generates estimates of expected behavior based on client characteristics as a baseline for comparison.</p>
<p>The Results worksheet reports the estimated discounted costs and benefits as costs per QALY, before and after taking into account savings to the NHS and other stakeholders and as Social Return on Investment, plus the other outcome measures. All results are reported as a range based on high and low estimates of persistence and health recovery.</p>
<p>In order to generate the range of results required the Excel system draws on the Impact worksheet, this generates a multiplier based on the discounted impact of behavior change in each year of the remaining life of the client’s life. This uses evidence of the persistence of behavior change for each year following the initial recorded behavior change, together with evidence of the rate at which respondents of different ages recover their health as a result of behavior change. This multiplier is applied to the health and cost impacts of the relevant behavior generated in the National Data and Social work sheets.</p>
<p>The National Data worksheet generates estimates of the theoretical annual health and cost savings impact of behavior change. Where not available from other studies, it does this by reference to estimates of the total health and cost impacts of the behavior in question, for the NHS and for Local Authority Services. The Social worksheet applies the same logic to estimate impacts on clients, employer, and government. The total impact divided by the number of people exhibiting the behavior in question is used to generate an estimate of the long-term impact of the theoretical behavior change for one person for 1 year.</p>
<p>The final worksheet contains Look up Tables for inflation and discount rates that are used by the tool. These and all other estimates within the tables can be adjusted to reflect changes in policy or better evidence and assumptions. For example, the inflation and discount factors can be adjusted if required but equally the estimates of health impacts or costs to the NHS, Local Authorities or other stakeholders can also be adjusted. The relationships between the worksheets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524500413483454">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The tools were discussed with expert groups working in each area, quality assured by an independent team from Matrix Consulting and prepared for online application by the Rechord team. They appear to provide reasonable and consistent results that are commensurate with other studies in these fields.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524500413483454">
<title>Future Developments</title>
<p>The tools, which are available free of charge at the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500413483454">NSMC (2011)</xref> website, are intended to be used alongside qualitative evaluations to provide quantitative measures of value for money. They are now in widespread use by commissioner and providers, some of whom have attended training sessions. They meet an urgent need for usable, low-cost tools to guide the design and evaluation of behavior change interventions.</p>
<p>Beyond the development of practical evaluation tools, the program was intended to provide a demonstration of the extent to which such tools could meet the expectations of users. For this reason, in some regards the tools step beyond the conventional limits of accepted evidence, in order to demonstrate the potential of this approach.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which the current tools could be improved and extended to other areas. One urgent step is to establish consistent measures of the long-term health impact of behaviors based on an analysis of the burden of diseases in QALYs for England, a scoping study for such an analysis was undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500413483454">Green and Miles (2007</xref>), this was an important source for the current tools. This could be matched to the English NHS Programme Budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500413483454">DH, 2012</xref>) to establish consistent measures of potential cost savings to the NHS.</p>
<p>As the focus shifts from the NHS focus solely on health to the wider concern for well-being of Local Authorities, further work is required to develop consistent measures of the impacts of behavior on well-being. While estimates of the impacts of smoking, alcohol misuse, and obesity on public services, government expenditures, and employers can be found, these are often partial and inconsistent. For example, the health and cost impacts of obesity on the NHS are variously estimated, but there is no agreed measure of the distress caused to overweight and obese people.</p>
<p>The terms in which value for money is expressed could be simplified by establishing consensus agreement on the assumptions to be applied, without losing sight of the need to demonstrate impacts on well-being and costs to all stakeholders. At its simplest level, it should be possible to establish an agreed value for achieving specified behavior change targets, for specific client groups. In each field, the development of consistent tools for evaluating value for money could be guided by national expert groups, with consistency and links to local commissioners and providers ensured by Public Health England (which is a body to be established in April 2013 to be an authoritative voice and expert provider for public health).</p>
<p>As current tools utilize the WHO National Burden of Disease Tool, they could be adapted and applied to other countries. This would provide a helpful response to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524500413483454">U.N. General Assembly (2011</xref>) resolution on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases.</p>
<p>The next step in developing such tools should emerge from the current program of work being led by NICE, to assist English Local Authorities in planning and evaluating public health and well-being programs. The work undertaken in developing these initial tools demonstrates the value of the approach but also shows the need to recognize that the factors considered by Local Authorities in evaluating the value for money of behavior change, which include impacts on health, well-being, equity, and long-term costs to society are different to those guiding NHS decision making which have focused narrowly on health outcomes and the cost to the NHS.</p>
