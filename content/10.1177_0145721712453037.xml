<p>You know the numbers. According to the CDC, there are nearly 26 million Americans with diabetes and another 76 million with pre-diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712453037">1</xref></sup> That translates to 1 in every 3 people who currently have or are at risk for diabetes. If recent projections are accurate, and there is no reason to expect otherwise, the number of people with diabetes could be as high as 100 million by 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712453037">2</xref></sup> This represents a 200% increase in the number of people with diabetes over the next three decades. Those numbers are absolutely frightening to me. Our recent AADE workforce analysis confirmed that there will be a high demand for diabetes educators over the next 15 years, but we all know that far too many patients never see a diabetes educator. Those who do have defined but limited reimbursable time allotted for diabetes education. Granted, the health care landscape is changing and we don’t know exactly what it will look like 10 years from now. But the questions remain: Where will patients with and at risk for diabetes receive the knowledge, training, and support they need to successfully self-manage this complex disease? And who will decide what role diabetes educators will play in the new health care delivery model?</p>
<p>At the board level, we believe that it is critical to plan for the diabetes pandemic. One way to do this is to first acknowledge that patients with diabetes receive information and education from a wide variety of health care providers. Because not all health care providers are equipped to provide their patients with the most current diabetes information, it seems reasonable to ensure that the caregivers who regularly interface with diabetes patients have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to best meet the needs of those patients.</p>
<p>In keeping with this vision of the future, the AADE Guidelines identify five levels of diabetes educator: unlicensed health care worker (Level 1), licensed health care provider whose primary role is not diabetes education (Level 2), noncredentialed diabetes educator (Level 3), credentialed diabetes educator (Level 4), and advanced-level diabetes educator/clinical manager (Level 5). Each level has defined roles and responsibilities. Levels 3 through 5 represent the diabetes educator the public associates with the position. These levels of diabetes educators are essential to successful programs because they possess a comprehensive and high-level skill set that enables them to work with patients but also to serve as care managers and as guides to other health care team members.</p>
<p>Please take a moment and go to the Practice Documents section of the AADE website to take a good look at the <italic>Guidelines for the Practice of Diabetes Self-Management Education</italic> and the <italic>Competencies for Diabetes Educators</italic>. These documents are designed to put diabetes educators at the forefront of health care policy and delivery change.</p>
<p>This line of thinking represents a departure from how we have defined ourselves as diabetes educators. Change is not going to be easy and it’s not going to happen overnight. But, moving in this direction is not going to take work away from the diabetes educator. Far from it. There are already more patients with diabetes than we can effectively reach. We believe our goal is to more effectively meet the patient’s needs. Think about it. Does it really take a diabetes educator to teach someone to perform SMBG? Or, is the diabetes educator the best person suited to support the patient who is learning to use attern management to achieve better glucose control? Let’s take control of what we do best and engage others to support the work we do with our patients.</p>
