<abstract>
<p>Health ICT is rapidly gaining popularity among policy makers and health consumers. Specific platforms for use in cancer care are missing.</p>
<sec><title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim of this pilot study was to: 1) test the feasibility, functionality and usability of a patient-led cancer care web platform: CanCare, in a sample of people undergoing cancer treatment and 2) ascertain if CanCare could enhance communication between patients, family, friends and health professionals.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title>
<p>Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were invited to participate. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews, online surveys and a website usage program.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title>
<p>Nine patients with four different types of cancer completed the study. All saw the potential of the website but many found it too complex to use, particularly when unwell post treatment. Many were frustrated by the lack of integration with existing hospital systems and the need to enter relevant data manually. The cancer-specific information tab rated highly and was used extensively. The website used alone did not promote interactions between family and/or health professionals.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>A patient-led cancer care website has the potential to help patients manage their cancer care but needs to be intuitive to use, integrated into hospital systems and requires significant family/carer and health professional engagement.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112458668" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Improved diagnosis and treatment means people are living longer with cancer with around 60 per cent of Australians surviving for at least 5 years after diagnosis (AIHW, 2010). Consequently, cancer is now considered a chronic illness that impacts on multiple aspects of a person’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112458668">McCorkle et al., 2011</xref>). A cancer diagnosis requires patients to engage in self-management with the support of many health professionals and lay carers across multiple settings of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112458668">Phillips and Currow, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This re-conceptualisation of cancer as a chronic disease has not been translated into current healthcare systems, resulting in a significant risk of care fragmentation and suboptimal patient outcomes. In addition, insufficient information and communication between health professionals and family/friend caregivers impacts negatively on supportive care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112458668">Aranda and Hayman-White, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112458668">Morris and Thomas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112458668">Hudson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The model of care for many chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes appears to be streamlined with effective evidence-based models of care supporting patient self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458668">Bodenheimer et al., 2002</xref>). As with other chronic illnesses people living with cancer are required to self-monitor and report complex symptoms. They are required to engage in numerous self-management activities, for example an exercise plan to combat treatment-related fatigue, which are important during and after episodes of cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112458668">Kearney et al., 2009</xref>). Current evidence suggests that, when performed well, self-management results in better communication with clinicians, improved self-reported health and lower distress, fewer hospitalisations and decreased health system costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112458668">Barlow et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been exponential growth in the use of online health information and support services over recent years, with the internet being a frequently utilised resource for many people affected by cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112458668">Im, 2011</xref>). Cancer websites offer access to expert information, peer support and practical advice and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987112458668">Winefield et al., 2004</xref>). Online support groups for patients with cancer are increasing in number (Han et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112458668">Hoybe et al., 2010</xref>) as are support groups for caregivers. Such groups allow users to participate at a time convenient to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112458668">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>) and without revealing their true identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112458668">Im et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of Web 2.0 technology for cancer healthcare is relatively new but is gaining momentum, particularly in the areas of care coordination and personal health record amalgamation. Admittedly, the experience of implementing shared electronic health records (EHRs) internationally has been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112458668">Greenhalgh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987112458668">Sheikh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987112458668">Winblad et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, policy makers, clinicians and consumers believe that EHRs will improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare by making key information accessible across multiple care settings. Despite such potential benefits some of the intended end users will be reluctant to engage and consideration must be given to increased workload and the need to extend implementation timelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112458668">Greenhalgh et al., 2010</xref>). These areas are worth noting when considering the implementation of any new health ICT system, patient-led or politically led, that require engagement from a range of end users to ensure success.</p>
<p>Preliminary evidence indicates that computers can also aid in the communication of symptoms in the cancer setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112458668">Wilkie et al., 2001</xref>). A mobile phone based advanced symptom management system (ASyMS<sup>©</sup>) supported patient-led monitoring and symptom management at home after chemotherapy, improved communication with health professionals and greater confidence in self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112458668">Kearney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112458668">McCann et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, an opportunity exists to support people affected by cancer (patient and family members) within a chronic illness framework through the use of interactive consumer health information and communication technology (health ICT) or e-Health platforms. This paper reports on the second year of a 2-year government-funded project (year 1 data are reported elsewhere) where an ICT designer and healthcare researchers partnered to adapt a pre-existing base platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.seecare.net.au">www.seecare.net.au</ext-link>) into a cancer-specific site known as CanCare. CanCare differs from other health ICT platforms in that it is designed to be patient-led and aims to link patients directly to their health providers, and health providers to each other, across various care settings via electronic means.</p>
<p>The Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia where the study was conducted provided ethical approval for this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112458668"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this pilot study was twofold:
<list id="list1-1744987112458668" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>To test the feasibility, functionality and usability of the CanCare web platform in a sample of people undergoing cancer treatment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ascertain if CanCare could enhance the relationship and communication between patients, family and friends, and health professionals.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112458668"><title>Methods and procedures</title>
<sec id="sec4-1744987112458668"><title>Design</title>
<p>An exploratory, mixed-method study utilising qualitative and quantitative measures was used to provide meaningful data on the experience of using a website for cancer care.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112458668"><title>The CanCare website</title>
<p>CanCare is a patient-led cancer care website that utilises Web 2.0 technologies with the aim of promoting patient self-management through the sharing of care plans, improved access to supportive care information and services for patients, carers and health professionals. The key feature of CanCare is that it allows patient users to invite family, friends, carers and health professionals to support them through the website. These groupings of people are referred to as <italic>circles of care.</italic> Circles of care facilitate the development and implementation of a shared care plan around patient identified problems. Other key functions include developing a calendar of appointments related to cancer and/or personal activities, developing care plans for treatments and managing symptoms, listing medications including start and end dates, permitting others to view and/or update care plans and appointments and recording chemotherapy-related symptoms between cycles. An information tab allows users to list personal health data, for example results of blood tests, information resources including general cancer information, evidence-based self-care information and reputable websites. A status bar is a one-line update to communicate the individual’s status on that day, at that time for example ‘I feel tired today; please don’t ring’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112458668"><title>Nurse researcher care manager role</title>
<p>A nurse researcher (LS) (also a cancer nurse and member of the project team) was appointed as a ‘care manager’ for each patient enrolled on the study. The care manager assisted patients when using various functions of the website and supported them to develop care plans and access information via the website relevant to their healthcare needs. The care manager was automatically given permission to view and/or update most aspects of the patients’ website. Should the website be used in usual care the care manger role could be filled by the patient, if well enough, or a designated member of a circle of care.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987112458668"><title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants self-selected to take part in the study by responding, via telephone or email, to a flyer, handbill or poster advertisement displayed in the Chemotherapy Day Unit (CDU) at the specialist cancer centre.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1744987112458668"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title>
<p>Patients with any type of cancer, who were receiving chemotherapy, were able to read and converse in English, were ≥18 years of age and had internet and email access at home could participate. Patients had to agree to have the Nurse Researcher as their ‘care manager’ on the website. Patients with severe cognitive/emotional issues or an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) (Oaken et al., 1982) ≥3 as assessed by the treating team were ineligible.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987112458668"><title>Recruitment</title>
<p>After contacting the research team to express interest in participation, the study was explained and a brief demonstration of the functions and use of CanCare provided. If still interested, patients were asked to sign a consent form and a mutually convenient time was arranged for face-to-face training by the nurse researcher or research assistant in the CDU. During training, participants registered on the CanCare website and were encouraged to invite family, friends and/or carers and CDU nurses to register at that time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987112458668"><title>Measures</title>
<p>Data collection occurred at three time points: Time 0 (after recruitment and prior to using CanCare), Time 1 (6–8 weeks after commencing use of CanCare) and Time 2 (end of study). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987112458668">Table 1</xref> shows what data were collected at each time point.

<sec id="sec11-1744987112458668"><title>Medical and demographic information</title>
<p>Medical and demographic information were collected from both the patient’s medical record and baseline questionnaires. Information included: gender, marital status, employment status, education level, cancer diagnosis and stage of disease, age at diagnosis, current treatments and co-morbidities. Alteration to medical information was also collected during the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987112458668"><title>Semi-structured interviews</title>
<p>The first audio-taped semi-structured interview asked about managing cancer treatment and relevant information, reason for interest in CanCare and expectations of the role CanCare would play in the management of their illness. This interview was carried out either face to face or over the phone.</p>
<p>A second audio-taped semi-structured interview asked about the participants’ experience of using CanCare, usefulness of the website in helping to manage their illness, most useful/least useful aspects of the website and suggestions for change or improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987112458668"><title>Structured online surveys</title>
<p>Patient participants completed structured online surveys at Time 1 and Time 2 and non-patient participants (family, friends, carers) completed a survey at Time 2 only. The survey was based on website usability questionnaires and adapted for the purpose of this study. Participants were asked to rate on a five-point scale the ease of use, usefulness and appropriateness of various aspects of CanCare with additional questions about the sustainability of the website at Time 2. Due to small participant numbers only frequencies of each response were calculated. Survey responses were anonymous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987112458668"><title>Emotion think-aloud testing</title>
<p>This usability test was conducted with patients while using CanCare twice during the project. Participants were asked to choose from a group of emotive words (five positive, eg pleased, six negative, eg frustrated and one ambiguous, eg surprised) to describe how they were feeling when completing a reasonably difficult task on the website. This form of testing enabled the researchers to gain a better understanding of how the system was being used, identified barriers to use and to look for functions that could be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112458668">Petrie and Harrison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112458668">Cooke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112458668">Olmsted-Hawala et al., 2010</xref>; Petrie and Precious, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987112458668">Seman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987112458668"><title>Website usage data</title>
<p>Usage reports were provided by the ICT partner with non-patient users being given the opportunity to opt out of usage data collection if they preferred. The report included time of day the website was used, usage patterns for different functionalities, average time spent and the average number of logins per week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987112458668"><title>Chemotherapy symptom assessment scale (CSAS)</title>
<p>The CSAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112458668">Brown et al., 2001</xref>) was incorporated into the CanCare website to enable patients to record their symptoms between cycles of chemotherapy. It has 24 items, each representing a common symptom (eg nausea, fatigue, constipation) rated on three scales: symptom presence (yes, no); severity; and distress. The information was used by the CDU nurses to monitor symptoms and management between subsequent treatments. This measure was not used as part of usual care.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987112458668"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive analysis was performed on online surveys at Time 1 and 2. Semi-structured interviews underwent content and thematic analysis. Frequency tables were developed to present website usage data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1744987112458668" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>From early May until the end of July 2011, 20 patients expressed interest in the study and 11 were recruited. Reasons for not participating included wanting to access personal medical information which was not possible through the website (<italic>n</italic> = 3); carers were more interested in being involved than patients (<italic>n</italic> = 3); already using other ICT systems to organise their appointments (<italic>n</italic> = 2); and one patient was too unwell.</p>
<p>Of the 11 participants, two patients (both male) withdrew after baseline data collection but consented to have their data included in the analysis. Their reasons for withdrawal were:
<list id="list2-1744987112458668" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>unable to synchronise personal diary using Blackberry<sup>©</sup> and CanCare without duplicating data entry;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>feeling fatigued and unable to manage the website.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The baseline sample consisted of five females and six males with a mean age of 56 years (range 36–63). Five participants had advanced cancer, two of whom had been living with this extent of disease since 2009. Eight patients spent more than one hour per day on the internet and were frequent users of social networking sites. All patients used email. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112458668">Table 2</xref> provides further detail. By the end of the study three of the five patients with advanced cancer had further disease progression; one experienced a side effect from chemotherapy which made using a keyboard difficult and another became unwell due to existing co-morbidities and side effects of treatment.

<sec id="sec19-1744987112458668"><title>Baseline interview (prior to using CanCare)</title>
<p>Three themes were identified from baseline interviews: a means of becoming organised; high expectations and not wanting to be a burden to family and friends.</p>
<sec id="sec20-1744987112458668"><title>A means of becoming organised</title>
<p>Patients envisaged the website as a one-stop-shop where they could keep all their cancer information in one place.</p>
<p>‘I’ve got so much documentation, trying to put it all together, keep it all together and put the rest in a file somewhere … much easier to look at everything (on this website)’ (woman with advanced breast cancer aged 36 years).</p>
<p>‘Just being able to keep the plan up of what I’m doing like treatment cycles and appointments. Distinct information about cancer or side effects [from] drugs will also be a crucial part as well’ (male with advanced colorectal cancer aged 63 years).</p>
<p>Having all their cancer information in one place was seen as a facilitator for information sharing with family, friends and even health professionals.</p>
<p>‘It depends on how much information I can get to put on there about my particular cancer and treatment … , that’s what I was hoping would be useful from the point of view of my local GP, my pharmacist’ (male with advanced lung cancer aged 63 years).</p>
<p>As indicated by this participant electronic sharing of health information among health professionals and across care settings sounds logical and simple but is currently not a reality. Barriers to this practice include lack of compatibility between information systems, concerns about privacy and ownership of information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1744987112458668"><title>High expectations</title>
<p>Patients voiced the expectation that using the website would make a difference to their cancer journey.</p>
<p>‘I was hoping that this was something I’d get out of this website … everything that I should know would be put on this website’ (male with advanced lung cancer aged 63 years).</p>
<p>‘I think networking with the people working [here] and if possible networking with people who are in the same boat as you - other patients would be good down the road’ (male with multiple myeloma aged 50 years).</p>
<p>Such comments reflect participants’ comfort and familiarity with giving access to others via social networking mediums. While this may be desired and acceptable in a non-healthcare setting it was not viewed the same way by health professionals who tended to have a more paternalistic approach to accessing information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1744987112458668"><title>Not wanting to be a burden to family and friends</title>
<p>Family and friends involved in the patients’ care were not approached directly by the researchers as part of the consent process. Instead, patients were encouraged to invite family and friends to be involved and support them via the invitation function on the website. Although the patients were keen to be involved in this research project, they commonly felt their friends and carers had already done so much for them throughout their diagnosis and treatment that they did not want to further burden them with having to register and use a website.</p>
<p>‘I’ll feel uncomfortable if I sort of say to them you must use this, or this might help. That’s the only thing … I’ll mention it, but I don’t want them to feel that they have to’ (woman with breast cancer aged 56 years).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987112458668"><title>Semi-structured interview Time 2</title>
<p>End of study interviews were carried out with seven of the nine remaining participants. Three themes were identified: ‘simple is best when unwell’; ‘the need for integration into the hospital systems; and “the lack of health professional involvement”’.</p>
<sec id="sec24-1744987112458668"><title>Simple is best when unwell</title>
<p>This theme was twofold. For most of the patients, many of the functions within the website were difficult to use unless used regularly.</p>
<p>‘I could see that there was a lot of complex things and they tried to cover a lot of things with the website … I don’t think that was user friendly for someone like me’ (woman with breast cancer aged 56 years).</p>
<p>‘But the rest is all a bit of a challenge, but I don’t use it enough to become familiar with it’ (male with colorectal cancer aged 56 years).</p>
<p>‘… because it’s not been an easy site, cause if it was I might’ve kept using it’ (woman with breast cancer aged 57 years).</p>
<p>For some patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment and feeling unwell meant using the website to manage their illness was not appealing, and in general, carers were not involved in using the website.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t use it as much as I anticipated … . with everything going on … . the chemo brain … . I didn’t have the capacity to even look at it’ (woman with advanced breast cancer aged 36 years).</p>
<p>‘As things deteriorated I didn’t get online at home even. I just wasn’t feeling up to it’ (male with advanced lung cancer aged 63 years).</p>
<p>However, the information resource tab was described as a useful way to have all information resources in one place.</p>
<p>‘… being able to have something that had all the information there as well. That was good too. It was handy having a database with it’ (male with advanced colorectal cancer aged 63 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1744987112458668"><title>The need for integration into the hospital systems</title>
<p>The inability to integrate CanCare with the hospital system made its use frustrating for some patients. In particular, some wished the hospital appointment system would automatically upload appointments into CanCare.</p>
<p>‘… probably something more interactive so that things like appointments would be a two way process. A capacity to have direct interface with [hospital] systems so that appointments could just be uploaded. That was probably the main thing I was interested in’ (female with advanced lung cancer aged 55 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1744987112458668"><title>The lack of health professional involvement</title>
<p>Despite inviting the CDU nurses to provide support via CanCare most patients felt this did not occur. Similarly, patients could not get other health professionals to engage with them via the website.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t communicate with anyone else apart from [the nurse researcher] on the website’ (woman with breast cancer aged 57 years).</p>
<p>‘I actually found that the other professionals … they didn’t really care too much for it, at least that’s my impression’ (woman with advanced breast cancer aged 36 years).</p>
<p>Participants described having the nurse researcher as the care manager as a positive aspect of the study. The care manager was able to assist with using the site as well as providing supportive care and advice during face-to-face meetings with the participants. Uploading personalised information into each participant’s website also fell to the nurse researcher. This aspect of her role as well as the information itself was highly valued by all participants, highlighting the potential of the site to enhance patient–health professional communication and support.</p>
<p>‘We probably spent about 20% of the time talking about CanCare and the rest of the time talking about chemo and cancer and medical issues … which is the human side of medical care’ (male with colorectal cancer aged 56 years).</p>
<p>‘I did have support there because of [the nurse researcher] … I really only communicated with her … the support was just immense. Knowing she was putting relevant and reliable information onto my site was very reassuring’ (woman with breast cancer aged 56 years).</p>
<p>The patients embraced the use of the CSAS. For some it provided a personal record of symptoms experienced. Unfortunately, some did not see it as a means of engaging or communicating with the CDU nurses. The CSAS was introduced for the purpose of the study as it was not part of usual care. While it was embraced by the patients it was not well utilised by the nurses. This may be explained by the fact it was seen as increasing their already heavy workload.</p>
<p>‘I thought that the CSAS was very useful, I thought that was fantastic, the whole idea of it – because it was like, they really want to know how I’m going’ (woman with breast cancer aged 56 years).</p>
<p>‘The nurses they didn’t/couldn’t take advantage of my CSAS – which I found actually very useful in recording how I was travelling … It didn’t fit into their routine’ (male with colorectal cancer aged 56 years).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1744987112458668"><title>Structured online surveys</title>
<p>At Time 1 seven patient participants completed the survey and five completed it at the end of the study. When comparing responses between the time points several benefits associated with using CanCare as well as barriers to use were identified. Benefits of use overtime included: most participants found navigation of the site and ease of use improved; access to technical assistance when required was suitable; participants liked being able to group friends according to role or help provided; the information tab was well used and very popular and several participants felt the site helped them manage their cancer-related information and develop a sense of control over their situation. Barriers to use included the time required to enter data and create a profile page and careplans. Despite the interest expressed in the status bar during the development and consultation phase, no one used this function on a regular basis. Most participants did not think the site assisted them to interact with their healthcare professionals. In terms of options for sustainability three out of five did not think advertising on the site was appropriate, and one out of five would be willing to pay to use the site. Two of the five said they would recommend the site to others and one was unsure. Patients also had the option of providing comments in addition to answering questions. Responses included:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Once you know how to navigate and to get to where you want to be after being told, then doing it a couple of times, it is easy’.</p>
<p>‘A good idea to have everything on one site with all dates etc, but can be very time consuming trying to put all that information in the site and sometimes we just don't have that time’.</p>
<p>‘Healthcare professionals need to be hooked into the system and monitoring/responding’.</p>
<p>‘I think the concept is great and with modifications to make it more user friendly it could be great’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Only one ‘carer’, the husband of a patient completed an online survey at the end of the study. This user classified himself as being very computer literate and his only comment was: ‘It appears the site was originally designed for a different purpose and this makes it somewhat difficult to use for this purpose’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1744987112458668"><title>Emotion think aloud test</title>
<p>Seven patients completed a think aloud test approximately 4 weeks after first using the CanCare website. This usability test was difficult for participants as they were asked to perform one of the more complex functions within the website, so expressions of confusion and frustration were frequent.</p>
<p>‘I find it confusing … all the action plans, the care plans … there are so many plans’ (female with advanced lung cancer aged 55 years).</p>
<p>However, they were hopeful and confident that regular use would improve their ability to use the website to self-manage their cancer care.</p>
<p>‘I feel quite confident now … because it’s easy to sort of work your way through … every now and then you might get a little glitch and you might need some help’ (male with advanced colorectal cancer aged 63 years).</p>
<p>Six patients completed a think aloud test at the end of the study with some developing a degree of confidence with using the site.</p>
<p>‘Feel pretty confident that I can get into my things’ (male with advanced colorectal cancer aged 63).</p>
<p>However, most participants continued to lack confidence in their ability to use the site and felt their confidence and skills had not improved over time.</p>
<p>‘It’s like a lot of things that sometimes you drop out of using them and you forget they’re there. I keep forgetting this bottom thing [referring to the plan list at the bottom of the home page]’ (male with advanced colorectal cancer aged 63).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec29-1744987112458668"><title>Website usage</title>
<p>On average 34 minutes was spent on the website during each visit (range 10.33–51.17). Log-ins occurred mostly during business hours and in the first 3 months users averaged 28 logins per week. This dropped to seven logins per week in the last 2 months of the study (range 3–62 over the whole testing period). The information tab was visited on average 17 times per week (range 1–51) with users spending an average of 5 minutes on this page. At the end of the study, participants could opt to continue using the patient-led system without health professional or researcher support, and four patients chose this option.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec30-1744987112458668" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to test a cancer care website, known as CanCare, and assess feasibility, usability and functionality with a particular focus on enabling self-management and communication between providers and between patients and their family, friends and health professionals.</p>
<sec id="sec31-1744987112458668"><title>Feasibility</title>
<p>There was overwhelming enthusiasm from patients and carers about the potential benefits of using the CanCare website during consultations in the first year of this study. However, testing the website in real-time produced a different response as there was dissonance between usual clinical practice, integration with organisation thinking and user expectations. While some health professionals were initially enthusiastic about the idea they did not engage when the system was being trialled. For health professionals, interacting with patients through CanCare was seen as an added burden, rather than a means to reduce workload, because of the need to duplicate patient notes and information. Therefore, it is essential to provide an incentive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112458668">Kaplan and Harris-Salamone, 2009</xref>) as well as ‘selling the concept’ and providing a clinical champion for health professionals when introducing health ICT into the workplace.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for lack of engagement by patients was our inability to have CanCare integrated or linked in any way to current hospital systems. As a result any information, such as appointment times, medical information and a record of medications, entered into the hospital system had to be re-entered into CanCare. We had hoped patients would manage this type of information or allocate the role to a family/friend care manager. Instead we found patients were not well enough to take on this responsibility and were often reluctant to delegate the role for fear of burdening family and friends. Consequently, the role of the nurse researcher as care manager was essential. It was the nurse researcher who entered appointments, sent reminders to complete the CSAS before the next cycle of chemotherapy and uploaded patient-specific information. Often patients only accessed the website when in contact with the nurse researcher. Reasons for this primarily relate to usability (discussed below) and the fact that CanCare was developed based on feedback from patients with cancer who were relatively well in comparison to the sample that trialled the website. These assertions need to be further investigated in a larger and perhaps less unwell sample.</p>
<p>Lack of engagement by family, friends and health professionals meant that it was not possible to test whether relationships and communication could be enhanced by using CanCare. This patient-led website had the potential to overcome care fragmentation issues that exist between the acute care setting and the community by providing a central repository for relevant information that could be accessed as required.</p>
<p>The nurse researcher role did mimic the potential role of health professionals in using CanCare to communicate with and support patients. This interaction was highly valued by participants in the study highlighting the role nurses could play in mediating the integration of Web 2.0 systems into clinical practice. However, the reliance on the nurse, or any other health professional and the need for an ICT skill set must also be considered in terms of long-term sustainability of the system. There is a clear need for further research into integration of such systems into usual care processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec32-1744987112458668"><title>Usability and functionality</title>
<p>Issues related to usability and functionality are closely linked and are therefore discussed together. Given the small sample size and the limited independent use of the site by patients and carers it is difficult to make robust conclusions about usability and functionality. However, we believe the following explanations are worth considering.</p>
<p>The use of patient self-selection as a recruitment strategy did not result in many expressions of interest or recruitment of patients, resulting in smaller than expected participant numbers. An alternative strategy would have been to approach patients directly while they were waiting in CDU and inform them about the project. This is a very resource-intense strategy and undermines our initial assumption that those interested in the use of health ICT (computer savvy early adopters) would respond to advertisements. An e-recruitment strategy has been described as an efficient means of recruitment to ICT projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987112458668">Smith and Manna, 2005</xref>), thus promotion of the project, with publication of the CanCare URL on social networking and community sites may have been a useful strategy. However, this was deemed by the hospital HREC to be an unsuitable method to use in a clinical setting where patient information was involved. The ethical concerns this project raised for the oversighting HREC who had not previously had to consider this type of research, also limited feasibility. In particular, the HREC placed significant restrictions on the inclusion of personal health information on the site despite patient consent processes. The inclusion of personal health information was identified as the major benefit of the website for patients during the consultative phase of the project. Of note HREC members were particularly concerned with privacy and legal issues in using an ICT resource that gave patients the ability to share medical data with whomever they chose. This raises significant questions about who owns health information and narrow interpretations of national and state privacy legislation.</p>
<p>Evaluation data showed that the website was not particularly intuitive or user friendly for patients because the multiple functions were complex and difficult to navigate. Thus, website usage did not increase over the life of the project. In addition, most activity only occurred during interactions with the nurse researcher. This points to the important mediating role of health professionals in promoting use of Web 2.0 systems for clinical support. We suggest that patients will interact more with a system that brings them into closer communication with their healthcare team.</p>
<p>The complexity issues identified may reflect the project team’s decision to try to incorporate as many requested functions as possible. During the consultation phase end users identified 32 new or different functions they thought would improve the website. This list was prioritised according to a benefit versus effort analysis to assign the best improvement given the available resources. The website changes were perhaps too ambitious given the performance status of end users. It may have been more appropriate to make one to three major changes that were easy to use and encouraged engagement.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112458668">Das et al. (2011)</xref> it is vitally important to consider the unique challenges of being ill and/or taking medication when designing an interactive healthcare website. Patients in year 1 who determined new functions were well, thus their perspectives did not reflect the impact chemotherapy could have on patient functioning and their ability to interact with a complex ICT system.</p>
<p>The most commonly accessed function was the information tab with patients being very satisfied with the ability to have personalised and reliable information targeted to their situation that was easily accessible. The intention was for this function to be managed by the patient and/or family member but in reality it was the nurse researcher, as care manager who populated this function for patients. This commonly occurred during the patients’ attendance in CDU and patients were most likely to review this information again soon after their appointment or just prior to their next one. The fact that this function was managed by the nurse researcher may reflect the patients’ compromised health status or the complexity of the site that made navigation difficult.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec33-1744987112458668" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pilot testing the CanCare website with a heterogenous sample of patients with cancer who were receiving chemotherapy produced mixed results. The concept of a patient-led website that facilitated and promoted self-management and communication between people affected by cancer and those caring for them was initially well supported. However, the reality of developing and implementing such a system presented numerous challenges at the provider, care process and organisational levels, including barriers related to the use of health information. These barriers significantly limited the ability to populate the system with health information desired by both patients and health professionals and thus limited the usefulness of the system in facilitating communication.</p>
<p>The potential of Web 2.0 technologies to enhance communication across settings will be limited unless such systems can be integrated into current processes of care and workflow. Auto population of health information is essential to avoid duplication, and efforts to overcome the real and perceived privacy and legal barriers to this are required. The desire of some participants to continue using the patient-led care system on completion of the study without any HP involvement or support suggests the potential appeal of such systems.</p>
