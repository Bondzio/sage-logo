<title>The Relationship of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to the Common Core</title>
<p>In their report, “How Well Are American Students Learning?” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512445996">Loveless (2011)</xref> of the Brookings Institution studied 171 items from the 2009 NAEP test with 98 from the number strand and 73 from the algebra strand. Using the new Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as a coding rubric, the researchers discovered that the mean fourth-grade NAEP number strand item was 3.2 and the mean eighth-grade item was 3.7. In terms of algebra, the mean grade level was 6.3, which means that all of the items would come from a pre-algebra course or earlier. The items of the eighth-grade NAEP are, on average, 2 to 3 years below the mathematics standards recommended by the Common Core. With assessments now being developed to measure the Common Core, the NAEP may assess different mathematics and report different results to the public. They recommend that the NAEP ratchet up the difficulty of the items or perhaps use adaptive testing to bridge the chasm between the two tests (e.g., computer-based assessments).</p>

<title>College- and Career-Ready: What Does It Mean?</title>
<p>In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512445996">U.S. Department of Education (2010)</xref> <italic>Blueprint for Reform</italic>, one of the priorities listed was college- and career-ready students. The report recommends that every student graduate from high school ready for college and a career and all states need to adopt standards in English language arts and mathematics that build toward that goal. But what are the characteristics of college and career readiness? What does it mean to be college- and career ready? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512445996">Rapp (2012)</xref> summarizes the research on college readiness and describes that it takes to succeed. Four of these key components included in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512445996">Conley’s (2009)</xref> definition include (a) cognitive strategies such as intellectual openness, inquisitiveness, analysis, interpretation, precision and accuracy, and problem solving; (b) academic knowledge and skills such as the ability to write well, conduct research, and understand big ideas in each content area; (c) academic behaviors such as self-monitoring, study skills, persistence, and the ability to work in groups; and (d) contextual skills and awareness such as managing financial aid, applying to college, and adjusting to the college culture. Schools therefore need to “create and maintain a college-going culture, align the academic program with college-readiness standards, teach self management skills, and prepare students for the complexity of applying for college” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512445996">Conley, 2009</xref>, p. 6).</p>

<title>Early Childhood Assessments</title>
<p>Three broad approaches are used in assessing preschoolers: direct assessments, observation checklists and scales, and samples of children’s work. Direct assessments use traditional tests that provide individual and group scores. These types of assessments are used for screening children with exceptionalities and identifying students who need specialized interventions. Teachers use observation checklists and scales informally within the classroom to record what students are doing. These measures typically contain indicators that demonstrate a predetermined standard of mastery for a discrete skill along a continuum. Purposeful samples of children’s work can also document progress. These samples may include written, audio, and video documents. Each approach offers tradeoffs. For example, while direct assessments may be more reliable, they may also not be as authentic as teacher observations or direct samples of students’ work. In their survey of 54 pre-K programs, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) found that most programs preferred to use observations or multiple forms of assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512445996">Ackerman &amp; Coley, 2012</xref>). Use was dependent on the degree of choice that individual providers have regarding which measures may be used because of local and/or state policies and how frequently child outcome data are collected and reported. Because preschool education is becoming more important in ensuring that all children who enter school are ready to learn, efforts to measure preschool progress is becoming more common. The ETS hope that their report will be useful to educational practitioners and policy makers.</p>

<title>2012 Education Issues</title>
<p>The Education Commission of the States, a nonpartisan research organization, has identified 12 pressing issues for 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512445996">Zinth &amp; Christie, 2012</xref>). According to the Commission, all of the areas share common themes: implications for the early years through postsecondary, high leverage, and related to one another. The 12 issues are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512445996" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Pre-K: Expanding the focus to P-3</italic>. The focus on P-3 learning increases the likelihood that students will be proficient readers by the end of Grade 3 and makes a smoother transition from pre-K to the early grade.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>K-12 finance: Creating and maintaining efficiency and financial accountability without lowering expectations</italic>. Part of this issue is identifying successful practices and scaling up proven success. Practices need to be aligned to research-based, data-driven approaches.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Blended learning: Getting moving. Getting it right</italic>. This issue examines the greater personalization of instruction using self-paced progressions and interventions that target student needs. Students need to be provided with real-world learning opportunities, develop 21st century skills, and continue their learning outside the school day and school year.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>CCSS: From talking to doing</italic>. CCSS create common expectations in math and English language arts that focus on greater numbers of students learning higher order thinking skills and becoming ready for college and careers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Developing civic engagement in pre-K-12: State action in the absence of federal funding</italic>. This issue focuses on engaging students in more civic activities to build and sustain a strong democratic society.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Teaching quality: Fasten your seatbelts!</italic> Because the quality of the teacher in the classroom is what matters most, identifying effective and ineffective teachers is a first step in maximizing their value to students.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Rural: Enhancing the potential of education in rural America</italic>. Rural communities need to be revitalized so that public K-12 students will progress to postsecondary education.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Data: Access to what teachers and leaders need to improve student outcomes (and the skills to use it)</italic>. Teachers need to be able to identify and address areas of student need and deliver education more efficiently to increase student retention.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Individualized instruction: Faster. Cheaper. Smarter</italic>. This issue focuses on students below grade level, at grade level, and gifted students. In terms of gifted students, they need acceleration and need a way of demonstrating that they know the knowledge and skills.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Performance funding: Building a model without a blueprint?</italic> This issue involves postsecondary institutions and their efficiency in increasing access and promoting success. Institutions that spur innovation and enroll, retain, and graduate underserved populations should be rewarded.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Remedial education: We know more now than we ever have</italic>. To address this issue, the Commission suggests that institutions of higher education need to reform remedial education programming using current research that addresses student needs and learning styles.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Credentials of value: Some are better than others</italic>. States should examine their workforce demands and invest in those programs of study.</p>

<title>Multiple Measures for Every Child</title>
<p>Many states have enacted legislation to develop evaluation systems that use assessment results and growth models to track individual student achievement from one year to the next to measure educator effectiveness. The Northwest Education Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512445996">NWEA; 2012</xref>) in collaboration with Grunwald Associates wanted to learn about the perceptions of those educators who are closest to students regarding the new generation of assessments. They conducted a nationally representative survey of K-12 parents (<italic>N</italic> = 1,009), teachers (<italic>N</italic> = 1,024), and district administrators (<italic>N</italic> = 200) to identify not only their views of assessments but also opportunities for improvement and innovation. They found that “parents, teachers, and district administrators want different kinds of assessments throughout the school year to balance assessments at the end of the school year” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512445996">NWEA, 2012</xref>, p. 2). These different types of assessment include formative assessments (e.g., classroom observations, class quizzes, homework, diagnostic tests), interim (e.g., benchmark assessments), and summative assessments (e.g., state or districtwide standardized tests, end-of-course exams). The majority of teachers and administrators believe that what matters most for teaching and learning success is (a) monitoring individual student performance, (b) monitoring growth in learning over time, and (c) collaborating with colleagues on instructional needs. Other key findings included the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217512445996" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Parents are interested in a personalized education for their child.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>District administrators believe that assessments that are aligned to the CCSS will matter to their work; fewer teachers agree with this belief.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Parents are more concerned at how their children’s performance compares with others within and outside the school district.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Parents believe that assessments lose their relevance within 1 month after being administered.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Teachers and administrators want to spend more time discussing assessment results and their implications for practice.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Teachers and administrators believe the students who are close to proficiency benefit the most from assessments.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Teachers and administrators have difficulty distinguishing different types of assessments and in making sense of the data.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Parents say they need more information on how to interpret and use assessment results.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All educators<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1076217512445996">1</xref></sup> agree that formative and interim assessments are more valuable than summative assessments because they have a greater impact on instruction.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All educators are interested in measuring thinking skills that are critical in life such as problem solving, critical thinking, communication, creativity, innovation, and collaboration.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All educators agree that local education agencies should make decisions about teaching and learning.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All educators question the amount of time and money spent on assessments.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>All educators believe that assessments induce a considerable amount of stress that affects students and educators negatively.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The researchers recommended that educators need to share decision-making responsibility with teachers, principals, and school leaders; select assessments that provide useful and timely information; provide training and time for educators to understand different assessments and make effective use of assessment data; and compare student data locally and nationally.</p>

<p>The National Association for Gifted Children developed a white paper that responds to <bold>frequently asked questions about the CCSS and gifted education.</bold> Although the CCSS are considered more rigorous than most standards, they still fall short of serving gifted and talented students. To access the FAQs and answers on implementing the common core, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nagc.org/CommonCoreStateStandards.aspx">http://www.nagc.org/CommonCoreStateStandards.aspx</ext-link></p>
<p>The newly established Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation <bold>(CAEP) announced its new commission members</bold>, which includes Camilla Benbow, Dean of Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt University who has studied intellectually gifted students and is coauthor with David Lubinski of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth. The Commission will write the CAEP standards that will define high-quality teacher education programs.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Cambridge International Examinations, the College Board is piloting two new <bold>Advanced Placement courses designed to focus on research skills</bold>. The courses will be tested over the next 3 years in 15 to 18 high schools. The Interdisciplinary Investigations and Critical Reasoning Seminar at the 11th grade will allow students to work in teams to research and write topics of global relevance. The Capstone Research Project at the 12th grade will assess the student’s ability to design, plan, and manage a research project.</p>
<p><italic>The Chronicle of Higher Education</italic> with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has created a website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://collegecompletion.chronicle.com">http://collegecompletion.chronicle.com</ext-link>, and is designed to share data on <bold>completion rates in 3,800 American higher education institutions</bold>. Success measures include completions per 100 students, spending per completion, and comparisons between institutions. The site also includes articles and commentary from <italic>The Chronicle</italic> and an online discussion tool.</p>
<p>The Kahn Academy, a nonprofit organization, has built a <bold>free online collection of thousands of digital lessons and exercises</bold> in subjects ranging from algebra to microeconomics. They also have resources that show teachers how to use data and individualize units. To access the Academy, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">http://www.khanacademy.org/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Funded with a US$1.85 million grant, a <bold>new high school focusing on advancing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)</bold> skills among the region’s students will open in August at Chattanooga State Community College. The creation of this Innovation Hub involves a coalition of partners, which included businesses, K-12 school districts, higher education, and community-based organization. Although the school will serve students at the high school level, it will also help disseminate best practices to all K-12 schools in the region and provide regionwide professional development for teachers.</p>
<p>The Thomas B. Fordham Institute has released a new evaluation of <bold>science standards</bold> from every state and the District of Columbia, finding that the majority earn Ds or Fs, with only a handful receiving As (see the State of States Science Standards 2012 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edexcellence.net/">http://www.edexcellence.net/</ext-link>). In particular, the analysis found state standards vague, overemphasizing inquiry-based learning without clearly conveying a connection between math and science. The authors recommend a purposeful focus on improving or replacing today’s standards as a key part of a comprehensive effort to boost science performance nationally.</p>
<p>Researchers are finding that behaviors like embracing novel experiences, supporting peers, and pestering parents can predict whether a child will <bold>emerge as a leader</bold> in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512445996">Pappano, 2012</xref>). The longitudinal research that tracked students from age 1 through 29 may also help educators encourage leadership if teachers know what behaviors to look for and support. Children as young as 2 years revealed temperaments that predicted later leadership. Researchers also found that children who placed the most demands on teachers and parents to join or do activities were more likely to be leaders as adults. More critical than the type of activity they lobbied for was the emergence of a quest to acquire new skills and knowledge. Equally important was the parent’s support in fostering new passions and interests. While researchers found “a little overlap” between those with the strongest inner motivation and those with top IQ scores, the data showed that stronger motivation trumped higher IQ. For more information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512445996">Pappano (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>According to the National Governors Association, 36 states have established policies that give districts and schools some degree of ability to <bold>award credits to students based on mastery of a subject</bold>, rather than “seat time.” These policies include building flexibility to allow students to earn credit based on demonstrating mastery in the classroom and expanded learning opportunities, modifying school funding formulas to allocate resources based on student mastery of content and skills as opposed to enrollment, ensuring that data systems are linked across state agencies and education providers, and requiring public institutions of higher education to accept student transcripts with credits earned by demonstration of mastery.</p>
<p>A new teacher training program (Educator’s Equity STEM Academy in Baltimore, MD) is designed to <bold>help girls and minorities succeed in the fields of STEM</bold> by focusing on small actions in the classroom that can affect a student’s achievement such as calling on boys more often than girls or having lower expectations for certain minorities. An US$886,000 grant from the National Science Foundation will fund the 3-year program. A program using similar strategies for physics teachers in Dallas helped boost girls’ performance on the Advanced Placement physics test. There, girls’ pass rates on the exam rose from 12% to 41%. Boys’ pass rates increased from 45% to 59%.</p>
<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has released an update to its preliminary findings for its <bold>Measures of Effective Teaching</bold> (MET) project, investigating the properties of five instruments for classroom observation: Framework for Teaching (FFT), Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations (PLATO), Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI), and UTeach Teacher Observation Protocol (UTOP). All five instruments were positively associated with student achievement gains. Evaluators found that reliably characterizing a teacher’s practice required averaging scores over multiple observations. They also found that combining observation scores with evidence of student achievement gains on state tests and student feedback improved predictive power and reliability.</p>
