<abstract>
<p>In this article, I critically review important concepts in new geographies of waste. I focus on both the conceptual frameworks that are used to examine issues concerning waste and the political possibilities produced by understanding waste differently. By plotting a range of concepts of waste along two axes – positive versus negative definitions of waste, and dualist versus relational concepts of waste and society – I contextualize scholarship on waste within the broader discussion about the ‘rematerialization’ of geography and social science. Understanding when, how, and why waste matters provides a fruitful lens for examining contemporary sociospatial processes.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>

<p>garbage has to be the poem of our time because garbage is spiritual, believable enough to get our attention, getting in the way, piling up, stinking, turning brooks brownish and creamy white: what else deflects us from the errors of our illusionary ways, not a temptation to trashlessness, that is too far off and, anyway, unimaginable, unrealistic… (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512437077">Ammons, 1993</xref>)</p>
<p>After all, what is more <italic>material</italic> than garbage? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132512437077">Myers, 2005</xref>: x)</p>
<p>So who or what is tickling the ticklish subject? The answer, of course, is <italic>the object</italic> – however, <italic>which</italic> object? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0309132512437077">Žižek, 2006</xref>: 17)</p>
</disp-quote>Over the last decade, geographers studying waste have contributed to the emergence of a substantive field in the social sciences. A growing focus on waste in academic circuits coincides with new geographies of waste: a billion dollar industry in hazardous waste trade; expanding interests in and uses of alternative practices of waste management; large-scale development institutions’ investment in waste-related infrastructure in the developing world; increasing subnational transfers of municipal solid waste; and growing piles of e-waste overwhelming local dumpsites, to name a few. As much as people and places are connected by flows of commodities and goods, they are also united by flows of waste and remainders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132512437077">Moore, 2011</xref>). In this sense, garbage might indeed be ‘the poem of our time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512437077">Ammons, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, waste has increasingly been used by researchers as a <italic>lens</italic> to explore environmental politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512437077">Gandy, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512437077">2002</xref>), urban history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309132512437077">Melosi, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512437077">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0309132512437077">Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0309132512437077">Sterner, 2008</xref>), social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512437077">Barr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0309132512437077">Strasser, 1999</xref>), social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512437077">Cresswell, 1996</xref>), capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512437077">Clapp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>), modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512437077">Moore, 2009</xref>), risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512437077">Bickerstaff and Simmons, 2009</xref>), regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132512437077">O’Neill, 2000</xref>), and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512437077">Bulkeley and Askins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512437077">Davies, 2008</xref>). These somewhat disparate literatures draw on a wide array of concepts of waste (hazard, object of management, commodity, resource, archive, filth, fetish, risk, disorder, matter out of place, governable object, abject, and actant). Through these diverse concepts, new geographies of waste have begun to interrogate <italic>what waste is and how, why and to whom it matters</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>). Such questions, I argue, are central to recent attempts to think through the political potentials of ‘more than human geographies’ by examining, defining, and animating the material. If, as Garth Myers claims, there is nothing more material than garbage, then the new geographies of waste are well-positioned to contribute to these efforts. Scholars of waste, after all, have always been interested in the material – whether matter and materialism were construed as the ‘thingness’ of garbage, shit, or toxic waste (given or constructed), the daily realities of managing or living with waste, or the social relations and political-economic processes concealed or revealed in the waste itself. Rather, however, than proposing one concept or a synthesis of several concepts as the resolution to the problem of understanding how, when, and to what ends matter and the material are politically effective, I propose that, as an object of study, waste itself might best be thought of as a parallax object: ‘that which objects, that which disturbs the smooth running of things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0309132512437077">Žižek, 2006</xref>: 17). The concepts deployed in new geographies of waste thus (at least <italic>implicitly</italic>) provide what Žižek calls a ‘parallax view’ that centres waste, whether because of its inherent qualities (risk, hazard, filth), or because of its indeterminacy (as out of place, disorder, abject), as that which disturbs or disrupts sociospatial norms. In order to demonstrate the myriad ways that waste disturbs, I therefore abstract the concepts from their roles as lenses in particular subfields, and focus instead on how each concept relates to two questions: how is waste defined (as a positivity or negativity) and how is waste related to society (in a dualist or relational way; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309132512437077">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This is a schematic that highlights emerging literature on waste along two axes. The first axis (positivity-negativity) refers to the degree to which a given approach to waste argues for a specific nature or character of waste that is important. On the left side of the axis are concepts that imbue waste with a specific, unique quality. On the right are concepts that do not define waste as having a specific meaning, but rather as something that defies easy categorization. The second axis (dualist-relational) describes the degree to which waste is defined as something that is separate from society. Concepts that fall above the axis tend to portray waste and somewhat distinct entities that come into contact with one another through sociospatial processes. Concepts that fall below the axis view waste and society as mutually constitutive.</p>

<p>I further argue that the disturbances caused by waste and other such parallax objects might provide opportunities for what Isin calls ‘[b]eing political’ – those ‘moment[s] when the naturalness of the dominant virtues is called into question and their arbitrariness revealed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512437077">Isin, 2002</xref>: 275). Throughout the paper, therefore, I highlight the ways that attempts to understand waste from multiple vantages are fruitful avenues for a politics of things (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512437077">Braun and Whatmore, 2010</xref>) that interrogates the modernist shibboleths of cleanliness, hygiene, and sanitation, and the often unjust and highly exclusionary sociospatial orders produced through them (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512437077">Isin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512437077">Sibley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0309132512437077">Stallybrass and White, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>II Plotting conceptualizations of waste</title>
<p>In order to discuss how waste is conceptualized, I plot emerging literature on waste along two axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309132512437077">Figure 1</xref>). The first axis (positivity-negativity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309132512437077">1</xref></sup>) refers to the degree to which a given approach to waste argues for a specific nature or character of waste that is important. Is there an essential quality of waste itself (a positivity) that matters to how it is valued or devalued and in constraining or opening up its political potential? On the one side – positivity – waste is imbued with meaning that may or may not be pregiven, but is located largely within the object itself. In these conceptualizations, waste is often assumed to be a hazard (to environmental and public health) or a remainder of prior social, political, and economic processes. Concepts on this side of the axis, therefore, objectify and essentialize waste, though to varying degrees, as indicated by their relative position within each quadrant. On the other side of the axis – negativity – the meaning and value of waste are largely indeterminable and escape or exceed easy categorization. Concepts of waste that emphasize its social, cultural, and spatial relativity are located on this side of the axis. The value of waste for thought and its political potential on this side of the axis lies in the mobility of the concept itself.</p>
<p>The second axis, that of dualist-relational, describes the degree to which waste is defined as separate from society. All of the literatures discussed are interested in relationships between waste and society in one way or another. Following work in nature-society relations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512437077">Braun, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512437077">Castree, 2003</xref>), I therefore use the term dualist to denote conceptualizations that explicitly or implicitly define waste and society as separate spheres that act on or encounter one another in myriad ways. For example, waste is often posited as an externality of certain sociospatial processes (particularly production and consumption) that must be managed by society. On the other hand, relational, rather than dualist, concepts focus on mutually constitutive, immanent, and emergent encounters between people and things.</p>
<p>At issue here are two basic questions about space, things, people and their relatings. (1) Can objects be defined positively – by essential characteristics inherent to them – or negatively – only in opposition to something else? (2) Do certain social processes pre-exist objects and subjects or do objects and subjects, together, help to constitute society and space (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512437077">Braun and Whatmore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132512437077">Latham and McCormack, 2004</xref>)? My purpose in dividing the literature along these two questions is neither to provide a coherent definition or concept of waste that all scholars should use (an unproductive exercise at any rate) nor to endorse one approach over another, but rather to highlight how various and sometimes competing explicit and implicit notions of waste underlie attempts to revalue and reassess the political potential of waste as a material part of everyday life.</p>
<p>While specific concepts are plotted and associated in the text with individual authors and articles, it should be noted that many scholars employ more than one concept or framework in their research. Further, as is true in much social science research, many of the authors discussed are reflecting the views and opinions of research subjects and their use of multiple concepts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512437077">Davies and O’Callaghan-Platt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512437077">Lepawsky and McNabb, 2010</xref>). Additionally, the concepts are unevenly divided among the quadrants, representing more and less developed avenues of inquiry. The placement of each concept is a critical interpretive act on my part and my primary interest is not to emphasize the fixed coordinates, but rather to highlight the confluences, juxtapositions, and divergences posed within the continuous knot of work that deploys these concepts. While this analytical cut through the literature, then, necessarily divides what in practice is indivisible, my hope is that it does so in a productive way, as I believe that the myriad concepts deployed highlight the richness, variation, and sheer volume of critical investigations of waste and provide a model for thinking about the political potentials inherent in a geography of ‘things’.</p>

<title>III Conceptualizations in quadrant I</title>
<p>In quadrant I (Positivity/Dualist) is work that, on the whole, identifies waste as having a specific characteristic that defines it and as something that is largely external to society. The preponderance of research on waste in geography has existed in quadrant 1 where waste is alternatively viewed as ‘hazard’, ‘commodity’, ‘resource’, ‘object of management’, or ‘archive’.</p>

<title>1 Waste as hazard</title>
<p>Geographers and others have long been interested in remedying the unjust distribution of environmental and public health hazards throughout society by addressing the uneven <italic>disposal</italic> of hazardous and/or toxic materials, including human and animal waste, in low-income or minority neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512437077">Bowen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512437077">Bullard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512437077">Jewitt, 2011</xref>) and the historical sociospatial processes that <italic>produce</italic> marginalized populations and that create and unevenly distribute environmental risks (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512437077">Heiman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132512437077">Pulido, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0309132512437077">Pulido et al., 1996</xref>). While varied in approach and analysis, such research has in common a definition of waste as hazard as a point of departure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512437077">Bjelland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512437077">Bourne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512437077">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512437077">Cutter and Solecki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512437077">Higgs and Langford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512437077">Holifield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512437077">Ishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512437077">Kurtz, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512437077">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309132512437077">Maantay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0309132512437077">Petts, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0309132512437077">Watson and Bulkeley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0309132512437077">Wolsink and Devilee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of waste as hazard positions waste as a lens for studying the uneven inter- and intranational distributions of waste disposal facilities and social movements, gender and racial politics, discourses of distributional and/or procedural justice that accompany them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512437077">Adamson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512437077">Agyeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512437077">Agyeman and Evans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512437077">Bjelland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512437077">Bullard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512437077">Davies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512437077">Di Chiro, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512437077">Fischer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512437077">Girdner and Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512437077">Harvey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512437077">Heiman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512437077">Holifield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512437077">Ishiyama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512437077">Kurtz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0309132512437077">Newman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132512437077">Pulido, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0309132512437077">Szasz, 1994</xref>), as well as environmental pollution and habitat destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512437077">Holifield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0309132512437077">Njeru, 2006</xref>). The political and regulatory successes of the environmental justice movement in the United States speak to the salience of this notion of waste in some, but not all, national contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512437077">Davies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512437077">Gottlieb, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0309132512437077">Szasz, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Waste as hazard, therefore, focuses research on ethical questions of the just distribution of toxic materials throughout society and demands intervention in terms of increased regulation of the disposal and production of such materials. Because there is at least an implicit concern with the local effects of extra-local processes, the issue of scale arises, both for analysis and for activism around environmental justice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132512437077">Kurtz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0309132512437077">Towers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0309132512437077">William, 1999</xref>). Scale becomes an obstacle to organizing opposition to unjust distributions of waste, the production and disposal of which is often decided outside of local arenas. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512437077">Bickerstaff and Agyeman (2009</xref>) note, for some authors the ‘very concept of environmental injustice precipitates a politics of scale – since locally experienced sources of pollution are inevitably rooted in political-economic relations and processes distributed across far-reaching spatial networks’ (p. 784). In these cases, then, waste is largely external to the central processes that constitute society (political, spatial/scalar, cultural, economic). For some scholars, this dualist construction runs the risk of ‘overlaying social analyses on top of physical sciences, whilst preserving their domains of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>: 1027). On the other hand, as Gregson and Crang argue, such work often also addresses the specific noxious qualities of substances, and therefore ‘brings back the material properties of different forms of waste’ (p. 1027).</p>

<title>2 Waste as resource</title>
<p>Reframing waste as a resource addresses part of what is missed by thinking solely of waste as hazard.

These disparate literatures have in common an emphasis on the myriad ways that disposed items can be recovered by re-entering formal cycles of economic production or reused in informal systems.</p>
<p>In <italic>Recovering Resources – Recycling Citizenship: Urban Poverty Reduction in Latin America</italic>, for example, Jutta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512437077">Gutberlet (2008</xref>) demonstrates the necessity of reconceptualizing waste as a resource and the implications of such a reconceptualization for understanding urban development in poor metropolitan areas of Brazil. While waste scavengers make significant contributions to the economies of such areas, the informal settlements in which many of the scavengers live are affected by the negative health and environmental consequences of industrial society. Valuing waste as a resource, Gutberlet argues, can limit the marginalization of people who make their livelihoods through informally collecting it, while reforming waste management in terms of efficiency and environmental responsibility. For many scholars interested in scavenging and recycling, one important issue is to redeem the value of waste, either by reintegrating it with the production system somehow, or by recognizing the use value of certain objects. Work in formal recycling often focuses on the important issue of how to achieve environmental sustainability by using recycled materials as production inputs; research on scavenging and informal recycling, on the other hand, tends to emphasize redemption of wasted objects <italic>and</italic> labor power through formalization. While these constructions of waste sometimes centre the economic as the dominant and most important generator of value (both of objects and of holders of labor power), viewing waste as resource also allows researchers to ‘demonstrate the material and social consequences of one type of waste material metamorphosing into another as it traverses the circuits of production, distribution, consumption, reclamation, and ’annihilation’’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512437077">Gille, 2010</xref>: 1050). In an investigation of the international trade in electronic waste (e-waste), for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512437077">Lepawsky and McNabb (2010</xref>) argue that ‘e-waste qua waste does not always represent the extinguishing of value’ and that such materials do not follow a ‘one-way transformation of value-to-waste along a linear chain of production-consumption-disposal’ (p. 186) Further:<disp-quote>
<p>E-waste flows are neither linear nor easily construed as simply cyclical in form … What these scenarios suggest is a need to more carefully conceptualize the ‘transubstantiation’ of ‘waste’ electronics into ‘value’ through highly contingent processes linking different geographies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512437077">Lepawsky and McNabb, 2010</xref>: 186)</p>
</disp-quote>Here, waste may be transformed into value through an international division of labor where geography ‘plays a determining role’ in the transformation of what is waste in one place into what is value elsewhere (p. 190). Such work is distinguished by the way that labor around the object ‘is constitutive of broader social geographies of belonging and marginalization’ (p. 190). Understanding such processes, therefore, is key to a politics of inclusion.</p>

<title>3 Waste as (non-Marxian) commodity</title>
<p>In contrast to the concepts above, the notion of waste as a commodity provides understandings of the patterns and processes involved in trading waste (both hazardous and solid), particularly between nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132512437077">O’Neill, 2000</xref>). Much work in this area is concerned with waste as a hazard to public and environmental health, but it also positions waste as a good to be traded and/or regulated through market mechanisms. In such work, waste is given value by its re-entry into the processes of production and through circuits of exchange (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512437077">Berglund and Soderholm, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0309132512437077">van Beukering and Bouman, 2001</xref>). Here, the logics of international environmental economics sometimes prevails; suggesting that in a ‘first-best’ world of equal trade relationships, international trade in hazardous waste could be beneficial to all countries involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0309132512437077">Rauscher, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309132512437077">2</xref></sup> The large and growing amount of e-waste being traded is a particular concern for new geographies of waste as a commodity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0309132512437077">Shinkuma and Huong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0309132512437077">Shinkuma and Managi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While they have different foci, work that posits waste as a simple commodity that can be exchanged to create wealth and economic growth in and among countries has some similarities with work that constructs waste as resource. In these accounts waste is often positively identified as a hazard, but is also conceived as a commodity with a market value, which provides incentives for the development of a multi-billion-dollar industry in waste trade. For geographers and others critical of the dominance of market logics and the uneven flows of waste they might produce, the primary political tool to address potential problems with the distribution of hazardous materials is regulation at the local, national, and international levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512437077">Ibitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132512437077">O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0309132512437077">Sonak et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>4 Waste as manageable object</title>
<p>Other scholars conceptualize waste as an object to be managed and governed at different scales. This is apparent in work that discusses various facets of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in megacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512437077">Ehlers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512437077">Kopfmuller et al., 2009</xref>), in comparative cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0309132512437077">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), in EU New Member States like Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512437077">Lasaridi, 2009</xref>), and in the context of new regulations such as producer responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512437077">Deutz, 2009</xref>). Questions that arise from this view of waste often involve the implications of waste management for urban sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512437077">Ehlers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512437077">Kopfmuller et al., 2009</xref>), the effects of supra-local regulation on municipal waste management, issues of privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0309132512437077">Samson, 2010</xref>), the efficacy of community-based waste management (CBWM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0309132512437077">Pariseau et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0309132512437077">2008</xref>) and, in more recent work, (urban) governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512437077">Bhuiyan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512437077">Boyle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512437077">Bulkeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512437077">Davies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512437077">Davies and O’Callaghan-Platt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512437077">Davoudi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512437077">Eden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512437077">Forsyth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0309132512437077">Oosterveer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0309132512437077">Van Horen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Governance, of course, has many definitions, but primarily highlights the interactions between state and non-state actors that produce policies and influence the sociospatial extent of formal and informal waste management systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512437077">Bulkeley et al. (2007</xref>), for example, propose an approach that highlights various modes of governance around the collection, transportation, and disposal of waste. Here, depending on various rationalities and strategies of governance, there are alternative ways of managing waste which imply more or less community and/or state control. Rather than focus on barriers to inter- and intrastate cooperation in municipal solid waste management, then, Bulkeley et al. propose the idea of ‘modes of governance’ as ‘an alternative analytical perspective … through which to explore the dynamic sociotechnical contexts within which the policies and practices of municipal waste are being shaped’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512437077">Bulkeley et al., 2007</xref>: 2752).</p>
<p>Anna Davies, in <italic>The Geographies of Garbage Governance</italic> (2008), also informs her comparative account of waste management in New Zealand and Ireland with a governance approach that she argues highlights ‘the institutions, structures and actors involved in the process of governing’ (p. 36). Similarly, Garth Myers uses a comparative governance approach to study sustainable development in Dar es Salaam, Lusaka, and Zanzibar. This comparison allows him to argue that there is no necessary trajectory toward either inclusive governance or more efficient garbage management in these places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132512437077">Myers, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As Gregson and Crang argue (2010), while Bulkeley et al., Davies, and other scholars of waste management draw on Foucault’s notion of governmentality (see also section VI(1) below), the focus in each of these cases is on governance and waste management: waste as such is not interrogated, but rather a given object of municipal management. In this way, waste tends to be construed positively as an unexamined remainder – an object that exists in space – and that is somewhat external to society. As a manageable object, waste is open to technical and, in the case of some governance literature, institutional solutions.</p>

<sec id="section8-0309132512437077">
<title>5 Waste as archive</title>
<p>In contrast to the above, waste as archive is a source of knowledge about contemporary geographies of production, consumption, and waste management practices. To garbologists, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0309132512437077">Rathje and Murphy (2001</xref>: 4), landfills are ‘lodes of information that may, when mined and interpreted, produce valuable insights – insights not into the nature of some past society, of course, but into the nature of our own’.</p>
<p>Garbage, refuse, and waste, in this case, are positively identified as the remainders of everyday life, as artifacts of material culture that reveal specific social and cultural behaviors through their presence or absence. These potentialities of waste are extended by the work of Patricia Yaeger, who draws on 20th-century American fiction to argue that trash can become an ‘archive or instrument of historical reinscription’, particularly for marginalized groups needing to recoup social presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0309132512437077">Yaeger, 2003</xref>: 109). Here discarded objects are poignant reminders of the previously existing social relations from which they were expelled. In other words, ‘history is no longer a trash heap we are trying to escape, but a trash heap that reeks: a mess with a message’ (p. 114). Thus, waste is a record of previous and contemporary social relationships and carries a message that society should heed. Wasted objects tell stories about contemporary culture from the margins, the left behind.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing waste as either artifact or archive highlights the value of waste for illuminating both marginalized histories and the contradictions of contemporary consumer culture. The distinctions made in garbology, between mental and material realities, cultural forms and the material record, make waste largely external to society, as remainder, reminder, and cautionary tale (cf. section V(1) below). While waste here has the potential to reveal the contradictions of consumer society, the political implications of this ‘revealing’ are unclear. As an external reminder of wasteful consumer practices and exclusionary social processes, could not waste simply be once again displaced, removed, forgotten?</p>

<title>IV Concepts in quadrant II</title>
<p>While the preponderance of work on waste in geography and other social sciences has traditionally identified waste positively, particularly as hazard, resource or commodity, other concepts of waste are emerging as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309132512437077">Figure 1</xref>. Examples of this are found in quadrant 2 where conceptualizations of waste lean toward negative definitions of waste, but, like those ideas in quadrant 1, also view waste as largely external to society. Here, waste is not given any specific meaning based on a physical characteristic internal to the object itself, but is defined by its inability to be categorized neatly. Waste is depicted as ‘out of place’ or ‘disorder’ following Mary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512437077">Douglas’s (2004)</xref> famous formulation. While there are only two basic concepts listed in this quadrant, both are important to new geographies of waste, particularly as they relate to questions of power and identity as they are mapped onto certain spaces and bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512437077">Hawkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132512437077">Riley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-0309132512437077">
<title>1 Waste as disorder and matter out of place</title>
<p>Many scholars interested in the relationship between waste management, development, and the history of colonialism have drawn on the concept of waste as ‘out of place’, in conjunction with Cresswell’s notion of transgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512437077">Cresswell, 1996</xref>), to argue that notions of waste have played an important part in excluding certain groups of people from specific social, political, and physical spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512437077">Hill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512437077">Moore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0309132512437077">Sundberg, 2008</xref>). For example, Juanita Sundberg argues that remnants left by undocumented migrants on the border between Arizona and Mexico produce evidence of border-crossers as ‘out of place’ litterers who can be clearly distinguished from legitimate Americans. In examining debates over the ‘border environment’ produced by NAFTA, Sarah Hill also uses Douglas’s observations about dirt and disorder to argue that ‘what the media presented along the USA-Mexico border during 1991–1994 was an extreme portrait of ‘“matter out of place” implicitly borne by the movement of people out of place: Mexican immigrants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512437077">Hill, 2006</xref>: 779). She goes on to explain that, while many United States citizens feared industrial pollution specifically, ‘it is impossible to dismiss the associations drawn between self-soiling Mexicans, mired in their own excrement, and the larger projection of the expanding border, seeping like a swamped septic system’s drainage field across the greater American landscape’ (p. 793).</p>
<p>In another context, Hetherington builds on Douglas’s description of waste as matter out of place to analyse disposal and draw attention ‘to the spatiality of disorder and the subsequent ordering acts that aim to correct disorder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512437077">Hetherington, 2004</xref>: 162). Rather than being about waste, per se, disposal is about placing and is therefore a fundamentally spatial practice. As such, the process of disposing of waste becomes ‘thoroughly constitutive of social and indeed ethical activity’ (p. 158).</p>
<p>Also concerned with issues of disposal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132512437077">Riley (2008</xref>: 80), following Douglas, argues that ‘[p]ositioning waste (matter out of place) as dangerous and threatening can be seen as central to both contemporary and wartime recycling efforts’. In comparing contemporary recycling projects in the UK with those in place during the Second World War, Riley uses Douglas’s interpretation of waste as matter out of place to highlight the commonalities and differences in crisis narratives surrounding waste. Three main points of crisis are discussed, all of which have in common a limit on the symbolic and physical elimination of waste: (1) landfills that play the role of hiding waste from society become points of contention through their secondary effects (methane gas production that contributes to global warming, for example); (2) contests over waste disposal siting highlight a problematic proximity to waste for certain communities, both physically and metaphorically; and (3) landfill siting becomes increasingly problematic as appropriate sites are exhausted.</p>
<p>In quadrant 2, waste is not clearly defined; rather, it is its resistance to categorization that is crucial to the political potential of waste in society. Because dirt, waste, and other sources of pollution are culturally determined and identified by their tendency to transgress categories, they prompt strong social sanctions that exclude certain practices and groups of people deemed as unclean, to produce sociospatial order. Here, then, waste is a fundamentally geographical problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512437077">Engler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512437077">Hetherington, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This notion of waste as out of place makes it potentially transgressive and disruptive. If waste is ‘out of place’, it challenges the normative assumption that it should be out of sight and raises concerns about the usual practices of distancing it from particular places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512437077">Moore, 2008</xref>). While such work makes it clear that waste as matter out of place could have the political potential to challenge existing social orders, it often relies on an implicit separation between society and objects. In Douglas’s work, the reliance on the realm of the symbolic and its (sometimes muddied) opposition to the real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512437077">Hetherington, 2004</xref>), separates signifying practices (the purview of society) from material characteristics of objects seen to merely exist here or there. For many scholars interested in waste, such as those discussed in section V below, this misses the ‘real stuff of waste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>V Quadrant 3</title>
<p>Concepts of waste that propose a more or less essential character of waste that is internally related to society are located in quadrant 3. This includes work that proposes waste as filthy, disgusting material whose affective qualities make it imperative that it be removed from sight/smell. For many authors, this need to get rid of waste is generative of social practice and space.</p>
<sec id="section12-0309132512437077">
<title>1 Waste as filth</title>
<p>As Hawkins and Muecke argue, ‘waste can touch the most visceral registers of the self – it can trigger responses and affects that remind us of the body’s intensities and multiplicities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512437077">Hawkins and Muecke, 2003</xref>: xiv). Here, the significance of waste often lies in its inherently repugnant nature. It is positively identified as filthy, disgusting matter that has the ability to move people to act.</p>
<p>Hawkins explores this further in an essay on shit and the politics of drains (see also section VI(1) below):<disp-quote>
<p>The force of disgust <italic>throws out</italic> the desire for action, a feeling based in <italic>both</italic> the body and culture, in instinctual and everyday ethical and political judgments. Gut reactions are part of what counts as ‘environmental awareness,’ part of all those angry questions: what kind of science and bureaucratic reason could turn the beach into a ‘sewerage treatment works’? … Is that what the triumph of sanitation means, the hint of shit in a gentle coastal breeze? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512437077">Hawkins, 2003</xref>: 40)</p>
</disp-quote>Waste, in this account, is imbued with and defined by the profound ability to disgust and to enrol other social actors in its elimination, giving it an important role in the constitution of society and space. The disgust and revulsion provoked by waste become powerful political forces: ‘This is the political possibility of affect as a response where different becomings might emerge – without such responses there can be no ethics of <italic>respons</italic>ibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512437077">Hawkins and Muecke, 2003</xref>: xiv).</p>

<title>2 Waste as risk</title>
<p>While waste as hazard (section III(1) above) posits waste as external to society and full of meaning, waste as risk nuances this by emphasizing the cultural and historical specificity of risks and people’s responses to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512437077">Bickerstaff and Simmons, 2009</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512437077">Chilvers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512437077">Davis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0309132512437077">Murray, 2009</xref>).

<p>Waste as risk has in common with waste as hazard an emphasis on danger and toxicity, but because of its focus on ‘socially constructed and produced “quasi-subjects”’ or on waste as a ‘powerful uncontrollable “actor” that delegitimates and destabilizes state institutions with responsibilities for pollution control, in particular, and public safety, in general’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512437077">Beck, 1999</xref>: 150), it posits a more emergent relationship between society and waste. Waste as risk also focuses less attention than ‘waste as filth’ on the physical reaction that one might have to waste and instead, focuses on the processes of modernization through which society has created a number of quasi-objects beyond its technological and political control. This, in turn, causes a crisis of legitimacy for the institutions expected to control these environmental bads. As garbage and other risks go rogue, they present the capacity to undermine existing political and management institutions and their related sociospatial orders.</p>

<title>3 Waste as fetish</title>
<p>There is a growing literature on consumption that examines waste as the intersection of the household and the public economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512437077">Bulkeley and Askins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512437077">Bulkeley and Gregson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512437077">Gregson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132512437077">Lane et al., 2009</xref>). This research often begins with the fundamental notion that waste is a fetishized commodity; it has a use and exchange value, but it also obscures the social relationships behind its production and circulation. As fetish, waste embodies the social relations of its production, but obscures these as it becomes an object through which surplus value circulates. To think of waste as fetish is to propose that wasted objects contain, and thus have the power to reveal, the uneven political and economic relations of capitalist production. In this way, waste presents friction for the smooth operation of capitalism across space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>). Waste as fetish provides a counterpoint to work that describes waste as simple commodity that is circulated through systems of exchange. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512437077">Gregson et al.’s (2010)</xref> discussion of ships, for example, makes it clear that the urge to follow objects in the social sciences has generally traced items up the value chain and ignored how things come apart and deteriorate. Further, they argue that ‘even objects as durable as this 30 year old ship, eventually start to come apart, economically and physically, symbolically and socially’. This means that the object is ‘but a temporary moment in an endless process of assembling materials, a partial stabilization and a fragile accomplishment that is always inexorably becoming something else, somewhere else’ (p. 853). It becomes a limiting factor to the continued economic growth necessary to the perpetuation of capitalist relations. While this view of waste shares much with new political ecologies of nature and, as such, no longer views the non-human (object) as distinctly separate from human society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512437077">Braun, 2008</xref>), it sometimes positions objects as products of previously existing economic processes. It is unclear, here, if and how waste can avoid a spatial fix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512437077">Harvey, 2006</xref>) that continues to distance and alienate it from many sectors of society and render it inert as a political object. Remedying problems with waste, therefore, requires that political action ‘address[es] the broader forces that make waste distancing a normal and accepted pattern of everyday industrial life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512437077">Clapp, 2002</xref>: 159).</p>

<title>VI Quadrant IV</title>
<p>In this final quadrant is work that pays less attention to a specific quality inherent to waste itself, but that sees it as a constitutive element in contemporary sociospatial relations and economic processes. Here, waste is the (often) unvalued and indefinable other that is expelled by society in order to shore up individual and societal borders. This includes notions of waste as governable object, waste as abject, and waste as actant. Some of the work in this area has much in common with the work of Douglas (section IV), but the relationship between society and waste is less dualistic.</p>
<sec id="section16-0309132512437077">
<title>1 Waste as governable object</title>
<p>As briefly discussed in section III(5) many new geographies of waste draw on Foucault’s idea of governmentality. While the examples in III(5) use governmentality mostly to complement a governance approach that does not, as its main focus, interrogate how waste becomes an object of management, work in quadrant 4 explores this aspect more fully. It does so by focusing more on the creation of waste as a governable object, as part of a complex of things and people through which the state operates, directly and indirectly. Here, careful attention is brought to the way that waste became a distinct object for state management and means of controlling certain populations through scientific theories of disease and contagion. This view of waste pays less attention to the material properties of things; rather, it focuses on how waste comes to be understood and categorized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309132512437077">3</xref></sup> In doing so it positions waste as constitutive of sociospatial relations. The case for such a governmentality approach to waste has been made by urban historians and planners who effectively argue that waste imprints itself on the city, in part through the urban services designed to manage it. In <italic>The Sanitary City</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512437077">Melosi (2000</xref>: 14) argues that service delivery ‘often blends so invisibly into the urban landscape; it is part of what we expect a city to be’. While allowing for the importance of ‘economic forces’ in processes of urbanization in the United States, Melosi emphasizes the need for infrastructure. Critically, appropriate infrastructure to manage waste varies through time, however, not only because of technological change, but because:<disp-quote>
<p>[s]anitary services … are linked inextricably to prevailing public health and ecological theories and practices, which have played a large part in the timing of their implementation and in determining their form … In other words, public health theories, such as the miasmatic – or filth – theory and the bacteriological theory of disease or ecological ideas informed the decisions made about the type and extent of sanitary service to be used. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512437077">Melosi, 2000</xref>: 14–15)</p>
</disp-quote>Addressing specifically the issue of waste as a governable object, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512437077">Melosi (2000</xref>: 227) argues that ‘[r]efuse … came into the public consciousness significantly during the late nineteenth century and raised several uncomfortable questions about health, aesthetics, and the quality of urban life’.</p>
<p>A different aspect of governmentality is highlighted in <italic>History of Shit</italic>, where Dominique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309132512437077">Laporte (2000</xref>: 56) proclaims: ‘Surely, the State is the Sewer’. He argues that the state as keeper of the Freudian triad ‘cleanliness, order, beauty’ extends its power by institutionalizing sanitation and hygienic practices. The more complete the institutionalization, the more totalitarian the state. Waste, as governable object, helps to create the power it becomes subject to. Gay Hawkins draws heavily on Laporte and Foucault for her argument about the politics of shit. Clarifying what she believes to be one of Foucault’s critical points about biopower, Hawkins argues:<disp-quote>
<p>For Foucault relations of bio-power depend not on the mere removal and evasion of the negative, but on its <italic>active exploitation</italic> … This historically specific labour of the negative initiated complex relations between said and unsaid, public and private, pure and impure, and it was fundamental to the organization of relations of bio-power. And just as sex became subject to a multiplicity of discourses and networks of power in the making of a modern social body, so too did shit. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512437077">Hawkins, 2003</xref>: 43)</p>
</disp-quote>If waste historically becomes an object over and through which state power operates, then the extension of the sewer and other sanitary systems represents, not a teleological unfolding of modern technologies, but rather the emergence of certain power/knowledges that, however imperfectly, discipline modern subjects and produce modern spaces. The political possibilities inherent in viewing waste this way are based on a rejection of the metaphysics of presence that argues that waste ‘just is’. The category of waste itself can be deconstructed and the institutional relationships that constitute and are constituted by it undermined by finding different ways of understanding, using, and valuing waste.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0309132512437077">
<title>2 Waste as actant</title>
<p>In contrast to the above, researchers who focus on waste as an actant largely reject a governmentality framework as too focused on epistemological concerns and ignorant of the ontological status of the thing itself. In their review article on waste and policy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang (2010</xref>) argue that waste can be viewed as a hybrid in the Latourian sense. It operates its influence through networking with human and non-human others. Focusing on industrial wastes, they argue that waste is a ‘vital inorganic actant in a thoroughly networked world’. This approach accounts for the material properties of waste while eschewing, at least in part, the ontological stability of non-human others.</p>
<p>Gregson and Crang follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512437077">Bennett (2004</xref>: 349), who uses the term ‘thing-power materialism’ to propose a ‘speculative onto-story’ of how the non-human flows around and through humans. As part of an assemblage, waste in this account becomes thoroughly constitutive of the socionatural order including such important geographic phenomena as scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512437077">Bickerstaff and Agyeman, 2009</xref>). As part of an immanent plane of becomings, waste actively constructs networks of <italic>agencement</italic>, shaping the material world and socionatural relations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512437077">Gille (2010</xref>: 1050) argues, here, ‘waste itself – its production, its consumption, its circulation, and metamorphosis – is constitutive of society’. Proposing the term ‘waste regime’, Gille argues that it is possible to maintain an analytical distinction between micro- and macro-levels, while rejecting certain types of abstraction that ignore the concrete characteristics of waste. Rather than something that moves across pre-existing spatial scales, then, waste is, along with other actors, constitutive of them. These dynamic regimes have three interrelated components that must be analysed: production of waste; representation of waste; and the politics of waste. Here, the politics of waste comprises questions about the existence and nature of public discourses about waste, policy tools to deal with waste, the people enrolled in dealing with waste, and the goals of political instruments that define and manage the waste/non-waste divide. This broad notion of the politics of waste implies a number of points of intervention at different levels of practice and analysis.</p>
<p>Also drawing on Bennett, Jennifer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512437077">Gabrys (2009</xref>) conceptualizes waste as spill – that which exceeds the capacity of sinks to absorb them. She further argues that such spills might evoke disruptive geographies with political implications: ‘Spilling over, rather than cleaning up, is a figure that is as much political as it is ecological’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512437077">Gabrys, 2009</xref>: 680). Waste can escape and exceed, not just our categories for it, but also the physical limits and boundaries imposed on it, and is given capacity to act on society in interesting and surprising ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309132512437077">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0309132512437077">
<title>3 Waste as abject</title>
<p>The third concept in quadrant 4, waste as abject, is also concerned with the boundaries, both created and exceeded by waste. Waste here is thoroughly constitutive of subjects who must expel it in order to survive. Waste as abject posits waste as something that is expelled from the social body in order to shore up the boundaries that divide that which belongs from that which does not. Drawn from the work of Julia Kristeva, waste as abject does not have any necessary, positive meaning as ‘the abject has only one quality of the object – that of being opposed to the <italic>I</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512437077">Kristeva, 1982</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>The abject is created not through identification, but rather through its always incomplete exclusion. It therefore ‘threatens one’s <italic>own and clean self</italic>, which is the underpinning of any organization constituted by exclusions and hierarchies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512437077">Kristeva, 1982</xref>: 65). The abject, in other words, is the result of the ‘weakness of the prohibition’ necessary to constitute the social order (p. 64). The relationship between pure and impure here differs from Douglas’s formulation in that, rather than resulting from or merely perpetuating symbolic orders that differentiate acceptable and unacceptable persons and practices, it is constitutive of them. Waste as the abject has no essential characteristic, but creates society through its expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0309132512437077">Scanlan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In human geography, there has been an effort to use the concept of abjection to explain social processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0309132512437077">Popke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512437077">Sibley, 1995</xref>). For example, in <italic>Geographies of Exclusion</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512437077">Sibley (1995</xref>) argues that the exclusionary practices that seek to establish the (always porous) boundaries between clean and dirty (self and other) often reinforce the physical marginalization of some groups from urban space as with the ragpickers of Paris. In the case of waste as abject, processes of expelling wasted objects, places, and people are essential to the production of modern spaces and citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512437077">Moore, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512437077">2009</xref>). Because abjection is always incomplete, waste constantly threatens to destabilize sanitary spaces and subjects. This opens the possibility for a politics of manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512437077">Moore, 2008</xref>) where the public secret of waste is fully exposed.</p>

<title>VII Conclusion: waste material, disturbance and politics</title>
<p>In this article, I have mapped the ways that new geographies of waste are proliferating within the social sciences by tracing the literature through more and less developed avenues of inquiry. My main goal was to highlight some of the convergences and divergences of the concepts used in social science work on waste in terms of their value for understanding and enacting politics around waste. These were emphasized through reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309132512437077">Figure 1</xref>, which illustrates heuristically how each concept defines what waste is (the axis positivity-negativity) and why, how, and to whom it matters (dualist-relational). By cutting through the literature in this manner I have framed these concepts in terms of two questions core to debates over the political potential of the material in social science: first, can objects be defined positively or negatively; and, second, do certain social processes pre-exist objects and subjects or do objects and subjects, together, help to constitute society and space (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512437077">Braun and Whatmore, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512437077">Gregson and Crang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132512437077">Latham and McCormack, 2004</xref>)? By plotting conceptualizations of waste along these axes, I highlighted the ways that different views of what waste is, as <italic>material</italic>, are productive of many forms of scholarship that have the potential to disturb certain taken-for-granted ideas about value, politics, and the sociospatial order more generally.</p>
<p>I proposed in the first section that waste might be thought of as parallax object – as something that ‘disturbs the smooth running of things’. Whether viewed as hazard or risk, fetish or commodity, abject or affect, waste, therefore, evokes conversations about development, justice, sustainability, and progress. It offers opportunities for scholars to engage in ‘being political’ by undermining the modern shibboleths of cleanliness, order, sanitation, and hygiene integral to many exclusionary sociospatial arrangements. I view the concepts discussed as largely complementary in their attention to the kinds of politics historically enabled by keeping waste out of site, enforcing order, and the implementation of sanitation and hygienization policies globally. Further, because work on waste in geography and social science, based on all of these concepts, is growing, I think it is less useful to identify a best or preferred trajectory than to highlight the work that each concept can do.</p>
<p>Synthesis or reduction of these concepts is less productive than revelling in the parallax gap between concepts of waste where opportunities to ‘disturb the smooth running of things’ abound. Revelling in this gap calls for continued intra- and interdisciplinary engagement that takes as its starting point not a specific concept or definition of waste, but rather the way that this parallax object escapes and exceeds any one perspective. While such efforts are sometimes hindered by (sub)disciplinary concerns and training, as well as institutional interests, taking seriously how waste constitutes researchers’ desires for less exclusionary (and polluting) sociospatial orders – despite methodological, epistemological, and even ontological divides – is a crucial starting point for collaboration. Garbage is, then, not only the poem of our time, but also an exemplary object through which to forge cooperative research, because, after all, ‘what else deflects us from the errors of our illusionary ways, not a temptation to trashlessness, that is too far off and, anyway, unimaginable, unrealistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512437077">Ammons, 1993</xref>).</p>

<p>Such logic is also found in statements by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) who argues that one reason to export hazardous waste is that, in some cases, ‘hazardous wastes constitute “raw” material inputs into industrial and manufacturing processes.

<p>The United Nations defines MSW as ‘waste originating from: households, commerce and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings)’. This ‘includes bulky waste (e.g. white goods, old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g. waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if <italic>managed as waste</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0309132512437077">UN, 2009a</xref>). This definition highlights the importance of the social context in deciding what is and what is not garbage: waste is what is ‘managed as waste’. Hazardous waste, in contrast, can be broadly defined as ‘waste that, owing to its toxic, infectious, radioactive or flammable properties poses an actual or potential hazard to the health of humans, other living organisms, or the environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0309132512437077">UN, 2009b</xref>). This is also a broad definition, and one that leaves much room for debate over what should and should not be regulated as hazardous waste. For that reason, most waste must be listed in specific annexes according to national or international laws and agreements to be regulated as hazardous waste.</p>
