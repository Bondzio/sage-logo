<body>
<p>Ankle sprains are the most common sports-related injury, accounting for as many as 2 million acute injuries per year in the United States alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546512455397">46</xref></sup> Most of these injuries involve the lateral ligament complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512455397">8</xref></sup> The majority of lateral ankle sprains will resolve with the appropriate nonoperative therapy; however, up to 20% of these injuries may require surgical stabilization of some form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512455397">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512455397">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgical strategies for treating lateral ligament deficiency have been broadly divided into 2 categories, including those that repair the 2 main ligaments and those that replace the ligaments. Several authors have described direct anatomic repair of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512455397">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512455397">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512455397">26</xref></sup> In addition, anatomic or direct repair of the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) has also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512455397">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512455397">19</xref></sup> Complications arising from direct anatomic repair and its modifications include nerve injury (3.8%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512455397">41</xref></sup> recurrence or feeling of postoperative instability (5%-12%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512455397">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512455397">22</xref></sup> and stiffness in the ankle and subtalar joints. Hennrikus et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512455397">20</xref></sup> reported that 9% of patients undergoing a Broström procedure describe subjective stiffness after surgery.</p>
<p>Checkrein procedures typically involve using the peroneus brevis to provide stability across the talocrural joint. Where insufficient normal ligament remains to fashion a direct repair or in the presence of collagen insufficiency, this method of obtaining ankle stability has been useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512455397">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512455397">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546512455397">47</xref></sup> However, long-term studies have implicated checkrein procedures with higher rates of nerve complications, wound problems, and postoperative stiffness in addition to arthritis of both the subtalar and ankle joints than are traditionally experienced with anatomic reconstructive procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512455397">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512455397">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512455397">32</xref></sup> This may be in part because of the altered joint mechanics imposed by the tenodesis procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512455397">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concerns with the checkrein procedures have prompted several investigators to look at autograft and allograft substitutes for both the ATFL and CFL and to use these grafts in a more anatomic repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512455397">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512455397">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512455397">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546512455397">42</xref></sup> Despite initially encouraging results, concerns exist regarding donor site morbidity, correct anatomic orientation of the transferred fibers, correct anatomic positioning of the grafts, and weak pull-out strength of suture anchors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512455397">5</xref></sup> The best surgical option for the treatment of lateral ankle instability is therefore controversial.</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials by de Vries et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512455397">11</xref></sup> in the Cochrane database on the best management of surgical treatment for chronic lateral ankle instability, the authors concluded that, given the lack of statistical significance and poor methodology employed in these trials, no conclusion could be drawn as to the best method of treatment. Several good quality studies, however, have compared the 2 principal methods of treatment and concluded that anatomic reconstruction has the least number of complications and appears to restore kinematics and proprioceptive function in comparison to checkrein procedures, which were regarded as technically demanding with higher complication rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512455397">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512455397">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512455397">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of these findings, the current authors have developed a hybrid anatomic reconstruction of the lateral ligaments for use in cases where the ATFL is attenuated or unrecognizable as a distinct anatomic structure. This construct requires using one-third of the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon and transposing this to the exact anatomic footprint of the original ATFL. In addition, the CFL, if attenuated, can be plicated rather than replaced, thereby obviating the concern of overtightening the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. Previous testing on a laboratory robot may provide some insight as to the benefit of using this hybrid reconstruction in lateral ankle ligament reconstruction. Prisk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512455397">39</xref></sup> demonstrated that anatomic graft reconstruction restores native ankle joint contact mechanics more closely than the Broström procedure alone. Furthermore, it avoids the propensity of the Gould modification to increase contact areas beyond that of the normal ankle. The hypothesis of the current study, therefore, was that by using a combination of anatomic reconstruction and tenodesis, adequate mechanical fixation can be produced without compromising anatomic or physiological principles and that the construct will facilitate a return to sporting activities in an athletic population.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Fifty-seven patients underwent a hybrid anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction procedure under the care of the senior author (J.G.K.) and are included in this study. Patients returned to the clinic on a routine basis for follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after surgery. Patients completed a Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) questionnaire and a standardized Short Form–12 (SF-12) general health questionnaire at 12 and 24 months after surgery. Identical questionnaires were completed before surgery and as such were available for comparison in this study. Additional questionnaire-based follow-ups beyond 24 months were not required for this study, as all data were available either in the patient charts or on file in the foot and ankle research office. Institutional review board approval was obtained before commencement of the study.</p>
<p>Clinical evaluation was used to determine the presence or absence of mechanical stability after surgery by applying a valgus stress to the ankle. This test was graded dichotomously in terms of the presence or absence of a solid end point to ankle inversion compared with the contralateral side. An anterior drawer test was also performed and compared with the contralateral side. The senior surgeon performed these tests at the standard postoperative visits. A modified Romberg test was also used to evaluate the presence or absence of functional stability at 12 months after surgery, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512455397">14</xref></sup> The senior author performed this evaluation at the final clinical follow-up. The modified Romberg test consisted of the patients performing a unilateral leg stand on the affected ankle, with their eyes open and arms outstretched in front of them such that they were within reach of, but not touching, those of the examiner. If the patient could stand balanced on the affected side under his or her own power, the patient was considered functionally stable. By comparison, if the patient required holding onto the examiner during the test for stabilization, the patient was considered functionally unstable.</p>
<p>An arthroscopic evaluation of the ankle joint was performed on all but 3 patients in the same procedure but before the reconstruction was executed. These were performed to diagnose and treat any potential additional ankle joint injury that may accompany symptoms of instability. The 3 patients who did not undergo arthroscopy were early in the current series. Komenda and Ferkel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512455397">31</xref></sup> reported that 93% of patients who had chronic ankle instability also had some form of intra-articular lesion, including osteochondral lesions, impingement, and synovial hypertrophy. This has also been the experience of the senior author in the current study, and it is for that reason that lateral ligament reconstructions are now accompanied by an arthroscopic evaluation.</p>
<p>All patients included in this study had peroneus longus grafts substituted for the native ATFL. Forty-six patients did not require CFL plication at the time of surgery, as subtalar joint stability and the quality of the ligamentous fascial condensation were deemed satisfactory with intraoperative examination. The remaining 11 patients (19%) did require plication of the CFL in addition to the ATFL reconstruction, and this was performed accordingly.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was taken to evaluate cartilage or other soft tissue injury after surgery at standard time points of 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Any area of cartilage deficiency or arthrosis in the ankle and subtalar joints was evaluated before surgery using the Outerbridge classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512455397">37</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512455397">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>Patients were selected to undergo lateral ligament reconstruction who had reported a history of chronic ankle instability, had a positive anterior drawer test finding on physical examination, and had failed 12 weeks of functional rehabilitation in the form of a triple-phase therapy program. Exclusion criteria for this study included combined medial (ie, deltoid ligament) and lateral ankle instability. Congenital collagen deficiency and patients weighing over 250 lb were considered contraindications to this surgery.</p>
<p>Only patients undergoing the hybrid procedure are included in this study. However, in the senior surgeon’s practice, the gold-standard Broström-Gould procedure is typically the surgical technique of choice unless preoperative MRI had demonstrated that the ATFL was (1) shortened secondary to cicatrization, (2) of poor quality, or (3) was absent entirely. In these cases, the hybrid reconstruction was recommended. However, this decision was often not made until the time of surgery, when the quality of the remaining ATFL was evaluated, and if insufficient, then conversion to the hybrid procedure was employed.</p>

<title>Patient Demographics</title>
<p>The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 28 years (range, 17-65 years), including 39 male and 18 female patients. The mean follow-up time was 32 months (range, 12-47 months). Forty-one patients (72%) reported competing at some level of athletic sport before surgery, from recreational to elite levels of play (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512455397">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>In cases where the procedure was accompanied with an arthroscopic evaluation, standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals were made, and the joint was evaluated under traction. All areas of capsular thickening or synovial hyperplasia were removed using a 3.5-mm resector. In the experience of the senior surgeon, hyperplasia of the synovium at the trifurcation or tibiofibular syndesmosis was pathognomonic of instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512455397">Figure 1</xref>). The joint was carefully evaluated for any chondral or osteochondral defects, and these were treated accordingly if identified. Once the joint was thoroughly inspected and areas of pathological lesions documented, the joint was closed, and the traction was removed for the remainder of the procedure. Conversion to the open procedure was then employed.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0363546512455397" position="float">

</fig>
<p>A 4-cm incision was made obliquely from the most distal aspect of the fibula to the talar attachment of the ATFL. Care was taken to avoid the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512455397">Figure 2</xref>) and the sural nerve in the most posterior aspect of the incision. This incision allows access to the ATFL, the peroneal sheath and tendons, as well as the CFL and is a utilitarian incision for all ankle instability reconstructions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Once the ATFL remnant was visualized, the decision was made as to whether a Broström or hybrid procedure would be employed. If a hybrid procedure was chosen (as in all cases of this study), the remnant of the ATFL was dissected from the talar footprint and released from the fibular attachment, allowing some periosteal fibers to remain; the native anatomy could then be identified throughout the procedure and subsequently restored.</p>
<p>The peroneal sheath was then opened and the CFL inspected. In our experience, the CFL is a thicker, broader band of tissue, as it coalesces clinically with the peroneal sheath and subtalar capsule and confers subtalar stability. It is less likely to be injured than the ATFL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512455397">36</xref></sup> and when injured, it is, in our experience, often stretched and not truly torn. In addition, when the CFL is handled at the time of surgery, it has a more robust feel than the ATFL. If the CFL was attenuated in this fashion, a longitudinal incision was made in the broad band that is the CFL, peroneal retinaculum, and subtalar capsule. This allows visualization of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. Synovial hyperplasia and exostoses were then removed at this stage, if necessary. This fascial condensation of the CFL, peroneal retinaculum, and capsule was then plicated in a vest-over-pants fashion using 0-Vicryl sutures (Ethicon, Inc, Somerville, New Jersey). Fixation was tested manually until deemed stable and strong. In the experience of the senior surgeon, care must be taken not to overtighten the most anterior calcaneotalar band, as this can cause pain postoperatively.</p>
<p>The peroneal tendons were then inspected, and the peroneus longus was brought into the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512455397">Figure 3</xref>). A 4.5-cm-long and 4-mm-thick band (ie, approximately one-third of the width) of the peroneus longus was excised and sent to the back table for preparation. The tendon graft was tubularized with 2.0 Vicryl (Ethicon), allowing 2 free ends for tendon passing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512455397">Figure 4</xref>). The remaining part of the peroneus longus tendon, from which the graft was taken, was then tubularized using 4-0 PDS (Ethicon).</p>

<p>Two drill holes were made to accept the tendon graft in addition to the interference screws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512455397">Figure 5</xref>). These were 5-mm drill holes created using a standard biotenodesis screw set (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida). The native talar footprint of the ATFL was overdrilled to a depth of 15 mm. The fibular footprint was also overdrilled along the line of the ATFL orientation in an oblique fashion, exiting approximately 3 cm above the tip of the distal end of the fibula. The tendon was then fixed in the talus with a 5.5 × 15–mm absorbable biotenodesis screw. With use of a small Keith needle, the tendon was then passed into the fibular tunnel and tensioned until the graft fit snugly and held the ankle mortise from gentle inversion in neutral dorsiflexion. Once the desired tension was achieved, the second biotenodesis screw was advanced to secure the graft with an interference fit in the fibula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512455397">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The remaining ATFL remnant was then laid over the graft and secured not only to act as an additional structural graft but also to allow proprioceptive fibers to remain in situ to potentially aid in the rehabilitation of functional stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512455397">Figure 7</xref>). After this, the ankle and the subtalar joint were put through a range of motion and stability checked. All soft tissue layers were closed and the ankle placed in a standard posterior splint.</p>

<title>Postoperative Protocol</title>
<p>Patients were immobilized in a postoperative splint in a neutral position for 2 weeks and instructed to be nonweightbearing, at which time sutures were removed. Patients were then placed in a CAM boot and allowed 10% body weight for an additional 2 weeks using crutches. At 4 weeks, patients were encouraged to remove the boot for 1 hour per day and perform ankle pumps (ie, dorsiflexion-plantarflexion exercises). A lockout brace was sometimes used in select instances when patient compliance with the postoperative protocol was questioned. In these cases, the lockout brace was set to allow a 20° arc of motion for patients to control movement. Weightbearing was then advanced 10% per day so that by 6 weeks postoperatively, patients were fully weightbearing. At that time, an ankle brace was substituted for the CAM (BioSkin, Cropper Medical Inc, Ashland, Oregon). Physical therapy was commenced at 6 weeks, progressing to sport-specific drills at 10 weeks. The postoperative protocol was not altered by the addition of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation for an osteochondral lesion or the resection of bony or soft tissue impingement at the anterior aspect of the ankle.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>A standard statistical software package was utilized for this study (SPSS 20, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). The Student <italic>t</italic> test was employed for statistical comparison of preoperative and postoperative outcome scores. Fisher exact test was utilized to determine whether the presence of functional instability significantly influenced a return to the previous level of athletic play. A 2-sample, 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test was also utilized to determine whether the presence of a particular intra-articular pathological lesion significantly influenced clinical outcome. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered a statistically significant outcome.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All patients achieved mechanical stability at final clinical follow-up, as tested by the anterior drawer and varus tilt tests. Seven patients (12%) demonstrated functional instability via the modified Romberg test at final clinical follow-up.</p>
<p>The FAOS improved from 58 points (range, 22-86 points) preoperatively to 89 points (range, 61-99 points) postoperatively and was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The SF-12 score improved from 48 points (range, 29-79 points) before surgery to 80 points (range, 72-97 points) at final follow-up and was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Five patients (9%) did not return to their previous level of sport; all were mechanically stable but functionally unstable. This included 4 recreational athletes (2 basketball, 1 rugby, and 1 soccer) and a single collegiate-level football athlete. In this regard, the presence of functional instability was found to significantly influence not achieving the previous level of sport (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512455397">Table 2</xref>). Of the 5 patients who did not return to sport, 3 patients stated that they did not want to risk further injury, and 1 patient complained of lateral ankle pain in a ski boot. The last patient was a high-level collegiate athlete who did not have the eligibility to return for an additional season. No patient stated that the perception of an unstable ankle was the reason for not returning to the previous level of sport.</p>

<p>There were 13 osteochondral lesions identified on the talar dome. In all cases, these were 8 mm or less in diameter and treated with arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation and an injection of concentrated bone marrow aspirate. Nine of 13 lesions (69%) were on the centrolateral aspect of the talus, 3 were medial talar lesions, and a single lesion was located posterolaterally.</p>
<p>Chondral lesions (ie, those that did not penetrate to bone) were also identified on the medial aspect of the talar dome (8 cases) or medial malleolus (11 cases); 3 cases had both. These were never larger than 4 mm in diameter and were resected to smooth the cartilaginous surface. Loose bodies were removed, and all areas of cartilage degeneration noted.</p>
<p>During the arthroscopic portion of the procedure, anterolateral capsular scarring was noted in all cases but was only resected in 49 cases according to the operative reports. The remaining 8 cases had the lateral scar resected at the time of the open portion of the procedure.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed the progression of arthrosis in the ankle joint in 2 of 57 patients (4%). Arthrosis in the posterior facet of the subtalar joint was identified in 2 of 57 patients (4%) who had no previous evidence of arthrosis. Progression of arthrosis was seen in an additional 3 patients (5%) with pre-existing subtalar arthrosis. A total of 7 patients (9%) had some degree of arthrosis in the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. Only 1 of these patients had a CFL plication at the time of surgery.</p>
<p>Typically, the graft harvest site at the peroneus longus is read as a longitudinal split of the tendon by the radiologists postoperatively up to 2 years. However, there was evidence of tendon remodeling in all but 1 case, which was a single case of peroneal tendon hypertrophy. While this patient’s eversion strength was deemed clinically normal, the tendinous bulk produced by the hypertrophy caused pain in a ski boot after prolonged downhill skiing, and the patient did not want to consider further treatment. This patient did not, therefore, return to the previous level of sporting activity.</p>
<p>Two cases of SPN neurapraxia were also recorded. In 1 case, this did not resolve until 8 months after surgery. The area of cicatrization did not correspond to the surgical incision; an ultrasound evaluation demonstrated that it was more proximal in line with the needle track of a regional ankle block. The other SPN neurapraxia was directly related to a scar at the anterior aspect of the wound. This resolved within 6 weeks after surgery and did not delay the normal postoperative rehabilitation schedule. One superficial wound infection responded to empiric antibiotic treatment and removal from a CAM boot where the liner had irritated the incision.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>More than 50 surgical procedures have been described to treat lateral ankle instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512455397">28</xref></sup> These procedures can be broadly divided into anatomic reconstructions using the available ATFL and checkrein procedures using graft reconstruction. The Gould modification of the Broström procedure is perhaps the gold standard for lateral ligament reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512455397">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512455397">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512455397">32</xref></sup> Despite excellent long-term outcomes, there are limitations and complications associated with the Broström-Gould procedure. Patients who have a previously failed ligament reconstruction, who are physically active and weigh over 250 lb, or in cases where the ligament is absent or attenuated typically do poorly with a Broström procedure or its modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512455397">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512455397">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In those cases, the alternative surgical treatment is traditionally a checkrein procedure using autografts or allografts. The majority of these procedures, however, have considerable concerns, particularly with reference to overtightening the subtalar joint and a greater risk of developing arthritis in the subtalar and ankle joints than the Broström procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512455397">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512455397">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512455397">40</xref></sup> Many of the inherent problems in the checkrein procedures using either autografts or allografts come from their failure to reproduce the anatomic orientation and alignment of the ligaments they are designed to replace.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512455397">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512455397">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512455397">38</xref></sup> It was for these reasons that the current authors sought an alternative to use the most advantageous aspects from both the anatomic reconstruction and the checkrein procedures using autografts.</p>
<p>From cadaveric studies, it has been determined that the ATFL is typically 2.48 cm in length and 0.72 cm in width.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512455397">5</xref></sup> Using semitendinosus or plantaris tendon grafts, it would therefore be difficult to reproduce this native anatomic sizing. For this reason, we chose the adjacent peroneus longus as an autograft. Using a 4.5-cm-long graft allows for 1 cm to be held in each intraosseous tunnel with an interference screw. The intraosseous capture is important because suture anchors have been shown to be inferior to interference screw fixation in graft stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512455397">25</xref></sup> The width of the graft is typically less than one-third the diameter of the peroneus longus tendon; the remainder of the tendon is therefore left undisturbed. In previously described checkrein procedures, the peroneus brevis is utilized as the graft (eg, Chrisman-Snook, Watson-Jones). Our concern with this is that the peroneus brevis is the primary dynamic stabilizer of the ankle joint and should therefore remain intact and undisturbed whenever possible. Should the peroneus longus tear subsequent to the harvesting, there would be less concern, as this is often involved in plantar flexion of the first ray, a contributor to the cavus deformity that is often associated with ankle instability.</p>
<p>Having the correctly dimensioned graft obtained from the same surgical incision is only useful if biomechanical principles are adhered to in aligning the graft. In this regard, we used the exact anatomic footprint of the original ATFL. We have previously conducted an in vitro biomechanical model demonstrating that this hybrid procedure may be mechanically more advantageous than the Broström-Gould reconstruction in maintaining normal talocrural mechanics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512455397">39</xref></sup> The current authors acknowledge that a robot model does not reflect the variables that can be seen in vivo. However, it does provide meaningful mechanical data that can validate the biomechanical principles of these graft-type reconstructions.</p>
<p>Only a relatively small subset of patients (19%) required plication of the CFL at the time of surgery, as it less likely to be injured than the ATFL alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512455397">36</xref></sup> The current authors are also aware that proprioception is critical in maintaining functional stability, and to that end, any remaining fibers of the original ATFL were preserved and sutured to the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512455397">14</xref></sup> Whether this was of any benefit is difficult to ascertain from the current study, but it does not add any additional complexity to the case and was therefore done whenever fibers were seen to be remaining.</p>
<p>The overall outcome of this hybrid procedure compares favorably with previously published outcomes using the Broström-type and checkrein procedures. Karlsson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512455397">28</xref></sup> have described up to 90% satisfactory outcomes with their modification of the Broström procedure at 2 years’ follow-up. Other authors have demonstrated rates varying from 80% to 90% good outcomes using anatomic reconstruction techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512455397">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512455397">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512455397">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512455397">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study also compares favorably with the checkrein procedures, which can have good outcomes in up to 80% of cases despite higher short- and long-term complication rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512455397">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512455397">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512455397">23</xref></sup> Therefore, our original hypothesis that the hybrid procedure could provide good outcomes in the presence of lateral ankle instability has proved substantiated in the current study.</p>
<p>Despite good outcomes, there were some areas in this study that require further investigation. The high rate of functional instability 2 years after surgery in the cohort was alarming. In fact, 12% of the 57 patients had functional instability despite demonstrating normal mechanical stability. This was better than the current authors reporting on the Broström-Gould procedure previously, with a 16% incidence of functional instability in a 73-patient cohort. We had emphasized functional rehabilitation as an integral part of the postoperative protocol, and physical therapists were instructed on this in the current study. In the patients who demonstrated functional instability, just 2 of the 7 patients stated that they did not complete a formal physical therapy program, as it was too lengthy and time consuming. The 5 remaining patients stated that they did complete the formal therapy program instructed and were not aware that they had functional instability. This implies that they developed functional instability after they were discharged from physical therapy or that they never regained functional stability at therapy in the first place. Interestingly, in the 5 patients with functional instability who did not return to athletic sport, none of these patients stated that functional instability was the cause. The development of more sensitive methods of investigation for functional instability may be useful in future studies.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that subtalar instability can be a factor in patients with concomitant ankle instability. While it is difficult to determine in the clinical setting, during surgery, the integrity of the CFL can be evaluated to determine whether, in a lax state, it could potentially contribute to subtalar instability. Accordingly, we examined the CFL in all patients, and if determined to be attenuated or lax, it was tightened accordingly. It is therefore unlikely that postoperative subtalar instability contributed to patient dissatisfaction, but this is not clearly demonstrable in this study.</p>
<p>In all cases where an arthroscopic evaluation was performed, intra-articular pathological lesions of some degree were identified. Additional surgical procedures were carried out at that time, and no additional rehabilitation was required for those with additional procedures. The presence of intraoperative findings at arthroscopy has been reported previously by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512455397">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512455397">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512455397">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512455397">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512455397">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546512455397"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512455397">45</xref></sup> The incidence of intra-articular lesions concomitant with ankle instability described in these level IV studies supports the use of arthroscopy at the time of ligament reconstruction in future treatments and studies. Effectively treating these lesions at the time of ligament reconstruction may help to maintain the good outcomes expected from ankle stabilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512455397">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current investigation, a bone marrow stimulation procedure combined with ligament reconstruction trended but did not reach significance, with poorer outcomes in terms of the FAOS. In time, however, this may become more significant as the fibrocartilage ultimately degrades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512455397">13</xref></sup> We agree with Gregush and Ferkel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512455397">18</xref></sup> who state that the treatment of osteochondral lesions at the time of lateral ligament reconstruction is safe and effective but that the presence of an osteochondral lesion may impair the results over the long term. We also suggest that not identifying intra-articular lesions at the time of ligament reconstruction may account for up to 20% of patients who complain of ankle pain after ligament reconstruction without arthroscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512455397">1</xref></sup> The presence of intra-articular lesions of some degree and chondral or osteochondral lesions in more than 60% of patients in the current study is significant and once again underscores, despite the lack of level I–strength evidence, the importance of arthroscopy at the time of ligament reconstruction.</p>
<p>The presence and/or progression of cartilage degeneration in the ankle joint was seen in 2 patients who had pre-existing arthrosis of the ankle joint. Similarly, progression of arthrosis in the subtalar joint was seen in 3 patients, and a further 2 patients developed subtalar arthrosis after surgery. It is necessary to further evaluate the change in contact mechanics at the subtalar joint after plication of the CFL and this will be the subject of further investigation at our institution in the coming months.</p>
<p>We were unable to obtain enough patient data about the energy of injury to determine whether the degree of the initial injury was causative of arthrosis. Despite this, it is reasonable to suggest that to be the case. Van Dijk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512455397">45</xref></sup> have reported this previously in a series of 30 patients who had ankle arthroscopy at the time of ligament repair. A higher incidence of cartilage injury was seen in those with high velocity injuries in comparison to low energy injuries. Similarly, medial ankle pain secondary to cartilage loss was seen in those patients with high velocity injuries 1 year after surgery. In light of previous investigations and data presented in the current study, it is unlikely that the ligament repair was causative in the development of or the progression of arthrosis either in the ankle or subtalar joint. Restoring near-normal coupling biomechanical motion will most likely have reduced the risk of developing further arthrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512455397">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study is retrospective in nature and therefore introduces inherent confounding limitations. Data collection bias was limited wherever possible by standard data collection points before and after surgery, in addition to blinding the senior surgeon to any outcome data for this study. Furthermore, the senior surgeon performed subjectively the clinical evaluations including mechanical and functional stabilities, introducing the possibility of evaluation bias. In this case, any potential bias is likely small, as these tests were performed as part of a standard postoperative clinical evaluation in the senior surgeon’s practice. Patients were not asked to return to the clinic, and these data were thus available exclusively from chart review.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The hybrid anatomic lateral ligament reconstruction technique described in the current article utilizes concepts from both traditional anatomic and checkrein tenodesis reconstruction procedures. In cases where insufficient normal ligament remains to fashion a direct repair of the ATFL, this technique restores the native anatomy while providing an alternative to checkrein procedures, where overtightening of the ankle and subtalar joints remains a concern. The current procedure also provides the versatility necessary to access and plicate the CFL if required. The presence of functional instability was associated with a failure to return to the previous level of athletic play and underscores the need for a proper physical therapy program after surgery, particularly in the athletic population. The most optimal surgical treatment strategies for chronic lateral ankle instability remain controversial and require high-quality and collaborative, evidence-based level I research to fully elucidate the issue.</p>
