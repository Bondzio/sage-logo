<p><italic>Power Performance: Multimedia Storytelling for Journalism and Public Relations</italic> sets out to be a handbook for storytelling using multimedia. Power performance is defined by the authors as storytelling that engages the audience with relevant and targeted content told with compelling words, pictures, video, and sound. There is also a promise that this book is unique because it will acknowledge that stories presented on the web essentially have a global audience, so readers will learn how to create stories for that global audience.</p>
<p>The book starts out strong with a fascinating premise that multiplatform journalism is not new. The authors point to Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite as journalists who worked in print, radio, and television. They also provide historic examples of journalists innovating with technology to get the story out, and suggest today we would call Abraham Zapruder a citizen journalist.</p>
<p>The first chapter, however, falls down in the attempt to convince the journalist that “and Public Relations” is ok. The authors make a strong case for public relations (PR) professionals needing multimedia storytelling skills, because they now can directly tell their stories to the public, without needing journalists as intermediaries. But the purist in most journalism educators who might use this book will have a problem with the blurring of that line. And quite frankly, there is little content targeting PR professionals. Beyond Chapter 6, which attempts to cover all things PR, there is only the occasional mention of various storytelling techniques from a persuasive communication perspective.</p>
<p>The heart of the book comes in Chapter 2, “Reporting Stories across Media.” This chapter is one of the better overviews of how to approach storytelling, as opposed to just reporting. The ideas are not simply presented as “do it this way” prescriptions, but include the whys of good storytelling techniques. For example they note, “… stories are written for people, not other reporters,” and people want to “connect … care … and commit,” especially in times of crisis or tragedy.</p>
<p>Using the Knight Digital Media Center’s definition of multimedia, the authors establish a clear vision of multimedia. That definition focuses on two characteristics—multimedia comes together online and is a “nonlinear” combination of text, photos, video, audio, graphics, and interactivity. The rest of the chapter focuses on research about multimedia and when it is best used. The checklist for when a story should have interactivity is one example of the practical information in this chapter.</p>
<p>The biggest problem comes after Chapter 2 when the authors fall back on their area of professional expertise—television news—and seem to forget multimedia. For example, Chapter 3, “Writing the Story for Print and the Web,” never addresses writing for print. There is a history of newspaper reporting and then a long section on the differences between newspaper and television, before getting to writing for the web 16 pages in. There are also sections on using cell phones for newsgathering and promoting print stories in other media which disrupt the focus of the chapter.</p>
<p>There are similar problems in Chapter 4, “Video Storytelling on the Air and on the Web.” This chapter is great for teaching television news reporting, but little mention of how video is used differently on the web, or the linear nature of television stories versus the nonlinear nature of how stories are consumed on the web. The focus on television continues in Chapter 5 on performance. This chapter presents 23 rules for on-camera performance, and rarely mentions the web. The rules are great, but only for television.</p>
<p>The book continues to ignore its multimedia title in Chapter 7 on ethics, where the reader finally gets some of that global perspective that was promised in the introduction. It is not presented as a how-to globalize stories, but instead a discussion of the changing world and media landscape, and the dangers of reporting in the world’s hot spots.</p>
<p>Finally, the Wiley-Blackwell designers did not do the authors any favors in the layout of the book. This is supposed to be a book on multimedia storytelling; yet, it is not visually stimulating. There are few pictures, no internet screen grabs, and the pullout boxes are only slightly differentiated from the rest of the text—often broken up by page breaks. There does not appear to be a companion website or DVD available either. Ultimately, the power in this book is in the area of television storytelling, not multimedia.</p>
