<p>This book offers an ample analysis of the UK’s labour market, focusing on the impact of the UK’s migration policy, where immigrant workers have been in major supply. The chapters are organized with different contributions and comments to each chapter, combining to create a very rich debate. Each author analyses economic sectors in which migrants have been traditionally participating. In a time of change in the UK’s immigration policy and of critical economic conditions, this book centres its diagnosis on the scenarios facing the UK’s labour market and the likely role played by the migrant labour force within it. Specific sectors analysed include healthcare services, social care, hospitality, agricultural and food businesses, construction, and financial services, studied in terms of demand and supply and other structural characteristics.</p>
<p>Martin Ruhs and Bridget Anderson accurately explain a very complex and segmented labour market. They introduce us to the book with a debate on the UK labour market’s need to recruit migrants. From their conclusion, the complexity of the UK’s labour market runs along a highly segmented supply of labour, where the employer is a determinant factor in terms of defining demand and exerting a control on a flexible supply. A continuous detrimental condition is the effect on general wages and labour standards which is the likely outcome if the UK’s policy of immigration does not accommodate the needs of the foreign labour force with an enforcement of labour rights.</p>
<p>Arguably, the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) appears to be an innovative mechanism with which to advise on labour shortage in all sectors but also aims to regulate supply and demand in the UK’s labour market. However, the author Mayhew comments on its limits to match the demands from employers for a flexible labour force with the labour supply, which is a variable out of the MAC’s control. Following the argument put forward by the authors, he agrees on the complexity of implementing a migration policy which satisfies employers’ demands and maintains labour standards for EU and national workers. A fundamental question is prompted in both the introductory chapter and its comments: how far could the UK’s immigration policy reach an equilibrium point between labour market requirements and workers’ welfare? This question is related to the composition of the labour market where migrants appear to be concentrated in certain sectors. Thus, the basic concern of all the authors is to understand to what extent the labour market could be feasibly self-sustained with national rather than foreign supply.</p>
<p>Following the debate on the UK’s immigration policy and its possible effects on high-demand migrant sectors, the rest of the book analyses how employers’ requirements shape the UK’s labour market. Beyond this point, the book reviews labour market policy by producing a balanced diagnosis for both the national and foreign workforce.</p>
<p>First, the authors Vanna Aldin, Dan James and Jonathan Wadsworth describe the participation of foreign-born population (immigrants as they are defined) within the UK’s economy. They suggest a need for further analysis of employers’ preferences and migrants’ expectations to understand why and in which sectors they are concentrated. In the commentary, Mayhew asserts that even if a better training system could diminish the UK’s dependency on migrant labour, there is a system dependence that perpetuates the condition.</p>
<p>Distinctions are made between non-European foreign workers and national workers, and, more recently, Eastern European migrants. In Chapter 4, Stephen Bach addresses the reasons that could explain an increase and dependency on migrant workers in the healthcare sector. He also brings up the lack of investment in training and a greater preference for importing foreign skilled health professionals. However, recent inflows from EEA countries are not replacing the traditional Commonwealth health workers. A clear advantage for the latter group seems to be language, shared training cultures, and a more simplified recognition and accreditation of their skills. In the complementary chapter, Robert Elliot stresses the lack of planning and policies in the long run to increase the national workforce in the health sector.</p>
<p>The social care sector also appears to have been increasing its proportion of migrant workers, most of them from non-EU countries. The author Jo Moriaty describes how demographic changes and policies for public funding are creating a greater demand for mostly migrant women, under low-paid and deteriorating working conditions. From Alessio Cangiano’s perspective, the social care system is relying on migrant workers where demographic trends and restrictive immigration policies will have negative effects on the quality and accessibility of the service.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the hospitality sector shows a further complex labour market where attributes such as gender, age, personality, flexibility, stereotyping, and employers’ social and ethnic preferences are among the determining factors. In Chapter 6, Rosemary Lucas and Steve Mansfield demonstrate a mismatch between the new points-based system with the needs of the labour market when skills correspond to a more subjective frame rather than an educational or training level. Linda McDowell in her complementary chapter underlines the importance of a growing services sector which requires further analysis.</p>
<p>The sectoral analysis continues with the food production and construction sectors. In Chapter 9 Andrew Jones explains how high-skilled migrants have come to occupy the highest ranks in the financial services industries. Finally, in Chapter 10, Philip Martin compares the UK and US labour markets. He questions how far the labour market needs a flexible and temporary migrant workforce and how to avoid negative effects on national or already settled immigrants. From his perspective, an independent advisory body such as the MAC could positively balance demand and supply in the US.</p></sec>
