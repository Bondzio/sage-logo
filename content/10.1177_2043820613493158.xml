<abstract>
<p>This paper emerged from discussions held over a two-day symposium hosted by the University of Western Sydney and the Institute of Australian Geographers in December 2011. Drawing on contemporary themes in economic geography around postcolonial theory and a concern with the histories of the sub-discipline, the symposium sought to triangulate these discourses using Raewyn Connell’s (2006, 2007a, 2007b) concept of ‘Southern Theory’ as a means of beginning a process of critical reflection about the types of economic geographies that are produced from and in the ‘Antipodes’. After introducing these debates and presenting a critical reflection on how Connell’s Southern Theory potentially provides a useful means of bringing them into conversation, the paper presents five considerations from geographers who have made significant contributions to contemporary economic geography understandings, drawing on, in various ways, their Antipodean positionality. The paper assesses to what extent are Antipodean economic geography knowledges: (i) unique and embedded in specific conditions and events, (ii) inexorably tied to other economic geographical knowledges produced elsewhere and (iii) how Antipodean economic geography knowledges have been exported and assembled within and beyond the discipline of geography.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the beginning of 2011, we were drawn to the theme of understanding what, if anything, made the economic geographies produced from and within the Antipodes ‘different’ to those produced elsewhere? While we were certain that there was a difference, and recent work around postcolonial theory and economic geography endorsed such a position, in many respects such differences often went unacknowledged. In thinking about our geographical position in Australia, the phrase ‘neither here nor there’ seemed fitting. On the one hand, we are geographically distant from the Anglo-American centre of economic geography. However, on the other hand, Australia and New Zealand’s colonial histories, global connections, and relative national and per capita wealth do not place our understandings (both theoretical and empirical) in the ‘purely’ postcolonial south. In many ways, by being situated literally in the Antipodes, Australian and New Zealand economic geographers find themselves oscillating between the core and periphery and in that movement reinforce and have first-hand experience of how situated and problematic such binary categorisations like core/periphery, north/south and developed/developing are.</p>
<p>In contending with this idea of ‘difference’, in December 2011, we (Wray and Dufty-Jones) hosted a two-day Antipodean Economic Geography Symposium at the New South Wales State Library sponsored by the University of Western Sydney and the Institute of Australian Geographers. The aim of the symposium was to examine and critically reflect on the economic geographies produced from an Antipodean perspective across a range of themed panel sessions. Such sessions included urban economic geographies, governance and neoliberalism, cultural economy and diverse economic geographies. The collegiality and enthusiasm for this topic made for a well-attended symposium with almost all of the economic geographers (postgraduates and academics) working in this region attending.</p>
<p>This paper, then, is an extension of the symposium and its purpose is twofold. The first purpose is to start a process of critical introspection about the types of economic geographies that are produced from and in the Antipodes. To what extent these knowledges are (i) unique and embedded in specific conditions and events, (ii) inexorably knotted and tied to economic geographical knowledges produced from elsewhere and (iii) how Antipodean knowledges have been exported and travelled across the discipline are just some of the questions, which we aim to explore. To enable this process of critical introspection, the second purpose of the paper is to create a dialogue that deliberately sutures together a postcolonial and critical historical account of Antipodean economic geography using sociologist Raewyn Connell’s concept of Southern Theory.</p>
<p>Before progressing we need to make two disclaimers. First, we recognise that the Antipodes is far from an unproblematic category. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820613493158">Gibson (2009</xref>) notes the term ‘Antipodes’ is just one of the many regional terms used to describe the area in which Australia and New Zealand are located. As he points out ‘even before they were fully traversed and mapped by Europeans, the Antipodes were considered an inversion of northern civility, nature, and norms, a “place of perversity”’ (Ryan, 1996: 105 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820613493158">Gibson, 2009</xref>: 226). However, those who are familiar with the discipline of geography would also know that Antipode is the name taken for the <italic>Journal of Radical Geography</italic>. We therefore chose to use this term because of its multiple spatial and cultural resonances both for those from this region and for the discipline of geography generally. Second, while we are keen to explore the types of economic geographies produced from the Antipodes, we neither seek to construct these knowledges as singular and homogenous nor as a conscious set of ‘other’ economic geographies. Neither do we intend to infer that Antipodean economic geography is an identifiable and knowable category. Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes (2012</xref>) highlighted how there is no tidy logic to Anglo-American economic geography, the same goes for Antipodean economic geographical knowledges – a point that will become clearer as the paper progresses.</p>

<title>Interpreting Antipodean economic geography</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework begins with three separate dialogues that until now we argue have had limited interconnections. The first dialogue concerns the postcolonial sensibility that has rippled through parts of economic geographical inquiry in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2043820613493158">Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2043820613493158">Pollard et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2043820613493158">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2043820613493158">Pollard and Samers, 2007</xref>). The second pertains to the flurry of critical histories of Anglo-American economic geography and geography generally that have also emerged in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493158">Barnes, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493158">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493158">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493158">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820613493158">Domosh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820613493158">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2043820613493158">Scott, 2000</xref>). The third dialogue from which this paper takes inspiration is sociologist Raewyn Connell’s concept of Southern Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613493158">Connell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820613493158">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820613493158">2007b</xref>), which asserts the importance of recognising the validity of non-metropolitan experiences to challenge the terms in which theory is constituted.</p>
<sec id="section3-2043820613493158">
<title>Postcolonial interventions in economic geography</title>
<p>As indicated, our first motivation for the paper and symposium comes from recent postcolonial interventions within economic geography. Here, postcolonialism has been used as a heuristic that seeks to disrupt, contest and in some instances transcend western ways of knowing, writing and seeing the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2043820613493158">Pollard and Samers, 2007</xref>: 323). Some of the central tenets to these postcolonial interventions has been focussed on recognising (i) the Anglo-American centrism of what constitutes most geographic theory, (ii) the way in which readings of the world tend to be made from the formal spaces of advanced western economies and (iii) the way in which certain categories and theories often become circulated as universal truths rendering other sets of knowledges as marginal or redundant.</p>
<p>Such interventions have considerable purchase in an Antipodean economic geographical context. At an obvious level, many of the theories, categories and vocabularies associated with Anglo-American geography do not necessarily reflect the specificities or conditions in Antipodean contexts. Widely debated topics in Anglo-American geography such as devolution, agglomeration, clusters and the post-productivist countryside or city-regions that command considerable space in geography journals and conference sessions have little meaning or application in an Antipodean context. Consequently, and as Beer points out later in this paper, Australian and New Zealand examples are often marked out by the singularity of their subject material or reduced to quirky case studies bolted onto mainstream theories.</p>
<p>Likewise, while it has been highlighted how the majority of economic geographical research is undertaken from the spaces of advanced western economies, paradoxically the dominance and wealth of the Australian economy in the global economy, which is continuing to rise, tend to endure a relatively ‘off-stage’ location in these explorations. For example, in the latest national quarterly accounts, Australia is entering its 21st year of continuous economic growth; perhaps the only ‘developed’ nation (alongside Canada) that can currently lay claim to such a figure, while many advanced western economies continue to struggle with post-financial crisis recessionary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820613493158">Cadden, 2012</xref>). The pertinent question is to what extent this neglect is attributable to the way such wealth is produced, that is, digging holes in the ground and extracting mineral and petroleum products for exports in the case of Australia and farming in the case of New Zealand. Such simplistic generalisations about national economic bases jostle with the dominant script of capitalist accumulation in the rest of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries – which tends to cast a linear pattern of transition from economies based on agriculture and natural resources through to manufacturing and the service-based, creative and knowledge economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820613493158">Gibson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2043820613493158">Wray, 2009</xref>). Part of the functioning of colonial international relations is to simplify discourses of the ‘worth’ of nations as it appears to economic centres – the sum effect being to recast even advanced countries such as Australia and New Zealand as ‘provincial’ and somehow ‘behind’ transitions in the ‘core’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2043820613493158">
<title>Critical histories</title>
<p>The second dialogue from which this paper takes inspiration is the flurry of critical histories of Anglo-American economic geography that have emerged since the turn of the century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493158">Barnes, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493158">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493158">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493158">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820613493158">Domosh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820613493158">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2043820613493158">Scott, 2000</xref>). A concern with the history of the discipline provides an awareness of how knowledge produced by geographers is inescapably infused with the concerns and knowledges of those practitioners who have gone before us. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes (2012</xref>: 1) argues ‘our geography and history … seep into the very pores of the ideas we profess’. Indeed these critical histories have shown how such knowledges are deeply tied not only to other disciplinary influences but also to wider geopolitical, economic and sociocultural events and concerns (Sheppard, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820613493158">Castree, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While a number of critical histories have been produced around the colonial origins of geography generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820613493158">Driver, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2043820613493158">Hudson, 1977</xref>) and economic geography specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493158">Barnes, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820613493158">Fellmann, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2043820613493158">Scott, 2000</xref>), these are openly acknowledged as representing the history of the discipline and sub-discipline from an Anglo-American perspective. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes (2012</xref>: 1) laments that ‘the discipline of Anglo-American economic geography seems to care little about its history’, we argue that the case is far dire for any histories of the sub-discipline that go beyond the global north. As a consequence, there exists a considerable gap in our understandings of how non-Anglo-American economic geographic knowledges have contributed to the development of the sub-discipline or to what extent Antipodean economic geography might be a ‘slave to a set of defunct geographers’ or influenced by a distinct set of historical conditions or events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes, 2012</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Such dialogues are not new and have long been influenced by the critiques around the ‘situatedness’ of geographical knowledge that emerged during the 1990s in response to the wider spatial turn in the social sciences. The idea that the philosophy and histories of geography were problematically ‘aspatial’ was advanced by a number of authors during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493158">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2043820613493158">Livingstone, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2043820613493158">Yeung, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2043820613493158">Yeung and Lin, 2003</xref>). Yet, it is our observation that the way in which debates around the situatedness of knowledge has developed has largely gravitated around whether or not there is an Anglo-American domination in how geographical knowledge is disseminated, with language and the location of key journals being attributed to maintaining this hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493158">Aalbers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493158">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2043820613493158">Garcia-Ramon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2043820613493158">Gutierrez and Lopez-Nieva, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2043820613493158">Paasi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2043820613493158">Rodriguez-Pose, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2043820613493158">2006</xref>). While these interventions draw necessary attention to the way that Anglo-American hegemony seems to be produced and maintained, it is our assessment that such discussions may have inadvertently limited attention being paid to how geographical knowledges and their critical histories produced beyond the core have emerged, influenced and are actually used by those in the Anglo-American centre and beyond.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2043820613493158">
<title>Southern Theory</title>
<p>To extend this critique, we draw on our third inspiration for this paper: sociologist Raewyn Connell’s concept of Southern Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613493158">Connell, 2006</xref>, 2007a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820613493158">2007b</xref>). In some ways, there is little new in Connell’s Southern Theory that geographers have not already noted. For instance, Connell argues that the way in which the production and circulation of social scientific knowledges are organised generally rely on the intellectual tools and assumptions produced in the north and that an uncritical approach to the ‘whereness’ of this knowledge production only serves to reproduce these, often unacknowledged, ‘geopolitical’ biases. Indeed, a critique that can be levelled at Connell’s work is that while professing to represent the social sciences generally, she fails to engage with the contributions made by geographers already in this area. But what Southern Theory <italic>does</italic> offer geographers is the way in which it productively combines postcolonial theory with a critical and spatially aware history of sociological thought. In so doing, Connell does not just identify the role of the periphery in terms of its absence, invisibility or data-heavy/descriptive role in the production and maintenance of Northern Theories. Instead, she goes further to specifically identify the ways in which ‘colonized and peripheral societies produce social thought about the modern world which has as much intellectual power as metropolitan social thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820613493158">Connell, 2007b</xref>: xi). In other words, Connell argues that knowledges and theories that are produced in the so-called periphery not only have considerable explanatory power but are frequently used and appropriated by the metropole – even if not always recognised.</p>
<p>Anthropologists Comaroff and Comaroff (2012) make similar arguments suggesting that the global south is rarely seen as a source of theory and explanation for world historical events, or as the wellspring of universal learning, which remains securely seconded on European American terrain. Instead the global south is relegated to a position of difference, always requiring explanation and synonymous with uncertain development and unorthodox economies (Comaroff and Comaroff, 2012). Drawing on Homi Bhaba (1994), Comoroff and Comoroff seek to invert the order of things and posit a project of theory making from an ‘excentric site’ so as to invite readers to see familiar things in unfamiliar ways, and in doing so, highlight how ‘historical or contemporary processes can just as well be narrated from its undersides as it can from self-proclaimed centres’ (2012: 115–117).</p>
<p>This collection of observations made by Connell and Comoroff and Comoroff marks an important advance on debates about the Anglo-American centric nature of knowledge production and poses a novel conundrum for economic geographers generally. Let us explain.</p>
<p>While we welcome and support postcolonial interventions in economic geography, we are critical of the way this approach has tended to present an ahistorical account of theory production in economic geography often arguing for the global south to ‘theorise back’ at the global north. The problem with this approach is that it presents Anglo-American economic geographical theory as the natural order of theory production against which all other types of economic geographical knowledges have followed on from. Because of this, we see value in the argument presented by Southern Theory that usefully calls into question the extent to which dominant economic geographical theories have been constructed purely from the Anglo-American core to begin with. Rather than advocating a need to ‘theorise back’ at the knowledges produced in the core – the approach postcolonial interventions frequently advocate – Connell argues that the ‘core’ is already being spoken to and is appropriating knowledges and categories produced from elsewhere but that this goes unacknowledged. This marks a subtle departure from the way in which postcolonial interventions in economic geography have been couched and operationalised to date. Rather than taking as given a dominant Anglo-American hegemony in most economic geographical research, with a view to creating ruptures to reveal multiple geographical knowledges, Connell’s work provides a springboard to critically reflect on some of the assumptions that are central to viewing economic geography through a postcolonial gaze.</p>
<p>In sum, triangulating the concept of Southern Theory with postcolonial interventions in economic geography and critical histories of the sub-discipline serves to bring into conversation three cross-disciplinary dialogues that until now have developed independently of each other. In turn, this triangulation supplies a useful theoretical framework to start thinking about how postcolonial theory and critical histories of economic geography could begin to intersect from an Australian and New Zealand perspective and hence interrogate the notion of ‘difference’ raised at the beginning of this paper.</p>

<title>Antipodean reflections</title>
<p>Having now established the theoretical framework and intention of this paper, the next section presents five reflective contributions from a mixture of Australian and New Zealand geographers who (we feel) have made significant contributions to contemporary economic geography understandings. When invited to contribute, each author was asked to write their reflection on the above dialogues and to draw on the following questions.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Who have been the key economic geography thinkers, texts and/or teachers that have influenced you? Do you think Antipodean economic geographers tend to be ‘slaves’ to particular thinkers/theories in economic geography? If so, who and why?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Has coming/researching/writing from Australia and/or New Zealand played an important role in how your economic geography research and contributions to economic geography knowledges developed? Why/why not?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If you were to think of them, what would you identify as specific Antipodean economic geography knowledges? Who or what have produced these Antipodean economic geography knowledges? What historical and geographical conditions have enabled these knowledges to emerge?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How useful is the term ‘Antipodean’ to describing the economic geographical knowledges you have produced?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To what extent and how have these Antipodean knowledges been exported and assembled beyond Australia and New Zealand? Have there been any barriers to these processes of translation and assemblage?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Do you see yourself as having contributed to a specifically Antipodean way of thinking in economic geography? Do you think it is recognised as such and do you see this as an opportunity, barrier or a bit of both?</p>

<p>It is to these contributions that the paper now turns.</p>

<title>An Australian in Massachusetts, Chris Gibson</title>
<p>In February this year, I had the privilege and pleasure of visiting Clark University in Worcester, just outside Boston. It was a long haul from Australia’s east coast, but a trip worth the cost, time and resulting carbon emissions. Clark has for decades been both a hub of critical/left scholarship and a benchmark of quality against which to judge institutional intensity of investments in geography<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820613493158">1</xref></sup>. My visit was brief, but hosted by my generous friend and colleague Mark Davidson, I had an opportunity to present a departmental seminar, to meet and to socialise over a few days with staff and graduate students in the Clark graduate geography program.</p>
<p>I reflect on this visit here, as a contribution to the special symposium on Antipodean economic geography. The visit to Clark provided an opportunity to peer within one of the best geography departments. It was also, in a modest way, a journey from margin to core – a fleeting chance to transgress the stubborn geometries of power that structure our discipline. Despite repeated calls for decentring the means of production of geographical knowledges, hegemonic disciplinary practices still ‘valorize American geographies as “unlimited”, and marginalise other geographies… as “limited”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493158">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>: 131). Following a path beaten more thoroughly before me by Kathie Gibson and Ruth Fincher (both Antipodeans who studied at Clark), I was drawn in, with excitement, to one of the discipline’s most important gravitational centres.</p>
<p>What observations from Clark are relevant for Antipodean economic geography?</p>
<p>First, the hard truths. Most obviously, in Australia and New Zealand, we lack critical mass. We have cultivated distinctive Antipodean ‘neighbourhoods’ for geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2043820613493158">Mee, 2006</xref>), but nowhere has geography ever been big enough institutionally to support intense specialisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820613493158">Gibson, 2007</xref>). Second, we do not ‘do’ theory anywhere near as convincingly. At Clark, the large intake of graduate students and coursework PhD curriculum structure immerses students deeply into theory. Our ‘better’ students find their way into theory within three-year research-only PhDs, from personal motivation or curiosity rather than systematic pedagogy. Perhaps, at some distance from the northern ‘core’, we feel less compelled to cite the canon of white male Northern theorists. The flip side is when we publish our work, we rely too much on the exceptional nature of Antipodean case studies rather than assume a central stance from which to make theoretical contributions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820613493158">2</xref></sup>. Third, we are a long way from where the action is. Echoing mainstream media and news coverage, we barely rate a mention in the northern hemisphere academy. In the view of one (anonymous) American geographer, ‘economic geography in Australia barely has a pulse’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2043820613493158">Molotch (2002</xref>) argued that place gets into the design of things, so too does place seep into the articulation of ideas. Arguably, Antipodean geographers more often start with an overt engagement with place (Anglo-American geographers instead seek a theoretical or conceptual starting point). In Antipodean university geography, we read and teach across conceptual boundaries as a necessary prerequisite to come to grips with this place’s intellectual and political challenges. A certain amount of jostling of Marxist, poststructuralist, feminist and postcolonial ideas is needed to make sense of the Antipodes. This is an inverted Europe, an othered geopolitical region, a destination for colonial investment and a source of global resource extraction, both a convict/settler nation and an idealised South Seas tourism paradise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820613493158">Gibson, 2009</xref>). The Antipodes are structured into the tentacles of empire and flung to the very edge of the world, its conquest and incorporation into European domination premised on racist superiority and maintenance of the north as central intellectual and economic space. Australia received the British criminal underclass and underpinned British industrial expansion (through export of raw materials), and hosted Pacific Theatre American troops during World War II. Indigenous peoples have been denigrated, their sovereign rights trampled. Today the Antipodes are caught within webs of transnational capital, tourism fantasies and financial follies, contradictory economic crises and mining booms. We are negotiating a new imagined (and actual) place in Asia, and yet still struggling with an inhospitable landscape, uncooperative soils and changing climate. Questions of Aboriginal sovereignty and competing claims over land, resources and identity in Australia are unresolved. Figuring all this out within critical geographical analysis has been less an attempt to ‘fit’ northern universalist theory to a southern peripheral other than to recognise northern theories and local experiences as relationally configured in an evolving imperial view from the West, each exposing knowledge as an ‘ensemble of limits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493158">Berg and Kearnes, 1998</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>Subdisciplinary promiscuity is also a simple fact of available institutional resources. My experience is fairly typical: I have taught political geography, postcolonial and Aboriginal studies (at Sydney), urban and regional political economy (at University of New South Wales) and social geography (at Wollongong). Individual Australian universities are lucky to have a specialist economic geographer and course (though more likely ‘economic’ content will be absorbed within ‘urban’, ‘regional and rural’ or ‘development’ studies). Hence, what constitutes economic geography in the Antipodes bears only some resemblance to that in the north. Ours is instead a loose coagulate of hybrid economic/more than economic geographies – short on specialisation, but an assemblage arguably well-positioned to confront contemporary global crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2043820613493158">Gibson-Graham, 2011</xref>). In a context where one might teach financialisation in a morning lecture and Aboriginal land rights in the afternoon, the ability to build theory and connect ideas across otherwise disconnected fields is critical.</p>
<p>My other observation from Clark is more prosaic: about the everyday practices of staff and students at this ostensible heartland of geography. My sense – admittedly shaped by only a very brief visit – was that those perceived to be at the core of Anglo-American hegemony are not at all uninterested in the outside world nor smug with centrality. Clark’s graduate students are encouraged to think critically about orthodoxies, centres and margins and systems of privilege. Staff and students were intrigued, even fascinated, by the Australian case and its differences from the particularities of American neoliberalism. Lengthy, passionate debates were had (over pizzas and many pitchers of beer) on lines of connection between the experiences of different places in an age of crisis and uncertainty.</p>
<p>I suspect that the practices that cast Anglo-American geographical knowledges as ‘unlimited’ versus everything else as ‘limited’ are not so much a function of people harbouring superiority complexes, as a combination of the chronic time poverty of academics, the political economy of publishing and brutalities of competitive academic labour. After all, anyone anywhere can only search, find and read so much. Antipodean geography is distinct, and such difference shapes perspective – but only to a point. More significant is the underlying uneven landscape of academic capitalism: UK and American conferences that gift keynote slots to ‘their’ own geographers; journal editing practices that preference authors from well-known institutions; publishing firms that commodify knowledge; evaluation metrics that punish those writing from the margins (and those with parenting and community responsibilities) and institutions with inherited reputations and bequests that out-compete those in ‘peripheral’ places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2043820613493158">Klocker and Drozdzewski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2043820613493158">Paasi, 2005</xref>). In parallel to other cultural/knowledge-producing industries such as music, film and design, the increasingly individualised and competitive academic industry buttresses a system that creates ‘superstars’ and institutional vortexes around specific departments, universities and journals (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2043820613493158">Gibson and Klocker, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are tensions, then, between process and product, between the heterogeneity of internal practices and the homogeneity of external experience and between infrastructures of cores and margins and distributed agency actually involved in the performative reproduction of disciplines. What transcends core–periphery dynamics, and provides me hope for better future dialogue, is what I observed at Clark: a broader sense of political affiliation, solidarity and internationalism.</p>

<title>Poststructuralist political economy, Wendy Larner</title>
<p>During the late 1980s and early 1990s, I attended a series of Institute of Australian Geographer workshops that brought together industrial and feminist geographers to discuss what was then called ‘economic restructuring’. These were enormously stimulating two-day events; I have particularly fond memories of the workshop held in the former Quarantine Station in Sydney Harbour. Through this initiative, I came to know an array of Australian colleagues; not just the stalwarts of Australian economic geography such as Mike Webber, Bob Fagan and Ruth Fincher but also a newer generation that included Phil O’Neill, Kathie Gibson and Louise Johnson, amongst others. At the workshops, we read well beyond conventional economic geography literatures. The conversations between economic and feminist geographers were usually mutually respectful and, in retrospect, subdisciplinary boundaries between economic and cultural geography, or economic and development geography, are much less significant than elsewhere. In New Zealand, my trans-Tasman academic encounters were actively supported by senior geography colleagues, including Richard Le Heron, Dick Bedford and the late Evelyn Stokes, as well as another Australian, sociologist Anna Yeatman, then Head of Women’s Studies at Waikato University.</p>
<p>Two decades later, the projects that have emerged from these Australasian intellectual engagements help underpin the claim there may be recognisable Antipodean Economic Geographies. Certainly, Australian feminists, including feminist geographers, were reading poststructuralist literatures well before many of their counterparts elsewhere and brought these literatures into disciplinary debates. There are wider academic and political genealogies to be traced here; for example, in 1985, Australian philosopher Liz Grosz used her own translations of Luce Irigaray’s work, then largely unknown in the Anglo-American world, to teach a Sydney University seminar on corporeality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2043820613493158">Grosz, 1987</xref>). Those from various countercultural networks who sat in on this class (including me and a feminist photographer friend) outnumbered the formally registered students. In Aotearoa/New Zealand academic-activist encounters took a very different form; the 1980s was the decade in which feminism and biculturalism gave rise to a distinctive form of postcolonial identity politics that re-inflected theoretical debates about race, gender and class. As I have observed elsewhere, for me these New Zealand encounters between grassroots politics, feminist theories and economic geography were both intellectually and politically formative and enormously influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2043820613493158">Larner, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>But these were never simply Antipodean ideas and exchanges. Many of the academics named above had either studied and/or worked elsewhere, and the workshops, conferences and classes (and indeed political movements) we engaged in inevitably drew on ‘international’ theories and knowledge. Those inspirations from elsewhere were not applied slavishly, rather they were asked to do new work in Australasian settings. ‘Intellectual bricolage’ has long been a characteristic of the work of postcolonial scholars and, if there is indeed a distinctively Antipodean way of thinking, this term may still be the best way to capture it. While today ‘Antipodean economic geographies’ may appear to take distinctive forms, developing a genealogy of these intellectual formations would involve asking how diverse ideas were imported and assembled (t)here, as well as how they were subsequently exported and assembled elsewhere. And, as I have emphasised above, it is highly likely that tracing these processes of translation and assemblage would take us well beyond the academy.</p>
<p>Nor are these Antipodean economic geographies individual projects. If ‘poststructuralist political economy’ has become a recognisable intellectual formation in economic geography, then it has a deeply intertwined trajectory with Australasian economic geographies in general and with the work of Kathie Gibson and Richard Le Heron in particular. I first used this term in the title of my Canadian doctoral dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2043820613493158">Larner, 1998</xref>). To be honest, I thought the term had been borrowed off Arturo Escobar, but when Richard asked me for the exact reference several years later, it turned out Escobar’s term had been poststructuralist political ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820613493158">Escobar, 1996</xref>). I used the term ‘poststructuralist political economy’ to indicate my ambitions to draw together longstanding interests in feminist and poststructuralist theorising with the neo-Marxist and regulationist accounts that then dominated both economic geography and Canadian political economy. The thesis attempted to understand the dramatic political–economic changes in New Zealand, but also reflected conceptual engagements with what we eventually called ‘global governmentality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2043820613493158">Larner and Walters, 2004</xref>). It was Kathie who had pushed me to be intellectually brave in my thesis (as we both learned to skate on the Rideau Canal over the course of a long Ottawa winter), and Richard who subsequently encouraged me to engage wider questions of embodied and emplaced theories and methodologies through our joint project on the spaces and subjects of the globalising economy (largely conducted over flat white coffees in Gloria’s cafe after I moved back to Auckland).</p>
<p>Poststructuralist political economy subsequently became the shorthand name for Richard’s and my efforts (later joined by Nick Lewis amongst a number of others) to develop situated accounts of political–economic processes. Inspired by J-K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820613493158">Gibson-Graham’s (1996a)</xref> ‘querying’ of the ‘globalisation script’, our aspiration was to rethink the universalising, largely ‘northern’, accounts of globalisation and neoliberalism that dominated mainstream economic geography. We began from observations that the aspects of New Zealand’s experience didn’t accord with those identified as significant elsewhere. For example, these observations had informed my interventions in wider discussions of neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2043820613493158">Larner, 2000</xref>), and Richard and I were amongst the first commentators to point to the significance of calculative practise such as global benchmarking and league tables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820613493158">Larner and Le Heron, 2002</xref>). While these accounts were deeply embedded in diverse empirical projects, our disciplinary interventions were largely conceptual. ‘Intellectual bricolage’ continued to mark our academic style; together we drew on a wide range of theoretical influences and debates. We had already made an explicit shift in terminology from ‘globalisation’ to ‘globalising processes’, and began to explicitly ‘follow the thing’ we were researching (policies, industries and politics) as they were ‘in the making’. As we did so, the co-constitutive aspects of globalising processes were revealed, as were the diverse political projects they gave rise to. Importantly, we also learned not to pre-suppose the outcomes of such projects and found ourselves looking for and indeed creating the ‘rooms and moments’ where things might be other than originally expected.</p>
<p>What do I take from these reflections on two decades of intertwined personal, geographical and intellectual commitments? Most obviously, we can’t reduce Antipodean economic geographies to the Antipodes, the discipline of geography or even the academy. What new politics emerge from an explicit recognition of this? This is not simply a question of developing distinctive intellectual agendas and ‘writing back’ against established canons, but rather involves asking how certain academic styles and political positions might open up new conversations. One of the shared features of Antipodean economic geographies – including poststructuralist political economy – is that we have actively worked to assemble diverse knowledges and capacities. We are deeply invested in understanding how intellectual and institutional relationships can be reconfigured, and generating the academic and political projects that might contribute to this. Of course these ambitions are not unique and can reflect the ‘broader senses of political affiliation, solidarity and internationalism’ Chris Gibson identifies above. Examples that come to mind include the early career initiatives such as the Summer Institute in Economic Geography and the Antipode Institute for Geographies of Justice. In a context of profound geoeconomic and geopolitical change, and when many in the historical core are struggling to understand how their geographies can be reconfigured, the approaches explicitly named and fostered by Antipodean economic geographies have a lot to offer.</p>

<title>Regional and rural economic change, Andrew Beer</title>
<p>Geography has a substantial legacy as an academic discipline in Australia, a reflection of European conquest and colonisation in the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as broader intellectual trends within the industrialising world. But much of this geography was both general and highly descriptive and a more analytical perspective did not emerge until the 1950s and beyond, with the rise of specialisations within the discipline. As I have argued elsewhere, economic geography was one of the first geography specialisations to emerge in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613493158">Beer, 2012</xref>), and there was a particular focus on understanding the nature and drivers of Australia’s urban system. From the 1950s onwards, researchers such as Mal Logan, Chris Maher, Alan Rose and Max Neutze embraced the ideas of writers such as Walther Christaller about the ordering of settlement systems. They quickly moved beyond concepts drawn from other places to create their own analytic frameworks that better explained the unique features and circumstances of Australia’s towns, metropolitan regions and small settlements.</p>
<p>Such writing had an influence on me during my undergraduate years but did not emerge as important until I commenced my own academic career in the early 1990s when my first major commission of academic work was to examine Australia’s regional cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820613493158">Beer et al., 1994</xref>). Suddenly, past work that I was aware of but not fully conversant with was of acute interest intellectually and of obvious policy/political significance. I was struck at the time both by the quality of the work done over the previous 30 years and by the fact that while economic geography in Australia remained both vibrant and dynamic, it remained a relatively small pool of researchers who were active in the field. I also noted that there was something of a schism between what could be thought of as ‘regional’ research on the one hand and ‘economic geography’ on the other hand. The former tended to be less theoretical, more quantitative and draw upon a range of disciplinary backgrounds, while the latter was grounded in theoretical debate but more distant from the day-to-day concerns of communities and governments.</p>
<p>The gap between what might be thought of as regional research and economic geography is central to understanding the challenge of attempting to identify an Antipodean economic geography. Both the fields of research are very small: the Australian and New Zealand Regional Science Association International has never had more than 120 members and has not supported a hard copy journal for some years. While the presence of a single organisation attests to trans-Tasman dialogue, the fact that much of the focus is on questions of policy and practice means that genuine dialogue is difficult. The New Zealand physical environment is very different to that of Australia, one nation has a unitary system of government, while the other is a federation and the two economies are structured differently. Within economic geography, there is greater potential for engagement between scholars from the two nations in theoretical debates, but the number of participants active in this ‘space’ is small, such that the sheer quantum of cross-national discourse is barely noticeable. In both regional research and economic geography, the intellectual agenda appears to have evolved in parallel rather than via a deliberate process of engagement and discussion. The exchange of key personnel between nations may well explain how regional research and economic geography in Australia have managed to behave like an asymptote – always approaching each other, but never quite touching.</p>
<p>I suspect that despite being unable to identify processes, there are bodies of work that are identifiable as Antipodean ‘economic geography’ and distinctively Australian and New Zealand ‘regional research’. When compared with research and writing in Europe and North America, Australian regional scholarship tends to be much more quantitatively grounded and descriptive in focus. As with the first generation of economic geographers in Australia, there is an enduring task to document and describe economic processes in two developed economies that are unlike others. The writings of researchers such as Neil Argent, Scott Baum, Peter Smailes, Bob Stimson and Kevin O’Connor serve to remind us of the prominence of this body of work. New Zealand and Australia literally stand alone in their corner of the globe, but are also distinctive in how economic processes are expressed within their human-created landscapes. We only need to reflect upon the fact that as North America emerges from recession, and Europe continues to battle economic turmoil, Australia has remained untouched by recession since the early 1990s. The Indigenous nations of Australia and New Zealand also add to the distinctive character of work on economic geography and processes in the Antipodes. And while there are similarities with other parts of the world – Canada, United States, Northern Europe and so on – the differences are sufficiently significant to have a noticeable impact.</p>
<p>The intellectual practices and traditions of other nations have also contributed to the emergence of a distinctive Antipodean economic geography and regional studies literature. For an Australian attending conferences abroad, forums such as the meetings of the Regional Science Association can appear daunting and inaccessible because of their predilection for econometric methods – such as Computable General Equilibrium modelling – and their focus on North American, Asian and European economic systems that differ markedly from Australia and New Zealand. The Regional Studies Association, the alternative academic forum for ‘regional’ researchers, is more accessible methodologically but can appear overly focussed on European Union programs that bear no relation to the lived experience of Australia or New Zealand. Even within geography conferences, Antipodean geographers are marked by the singularity of their subject material and context. Of course, coming from ‘outside’ can work to the advantage of individual researchers and I for one have produced a number of papers for special issues of journals or edited books, where a contribution on Australia is needed to demonstrate that the volume is not overly dominated by European or North American perspectives.</p>
<p>The growth of research capacity in many Asian nations – our most significant neighbours – offers the potential for further intellectual development within Antipodean economic geography as there are significant links between the production systems of Australia and New Zealand and many of the countries to our north. In some respects, Antipodean and Asian nations share supply chains and processes, albeit from different positions within that evolving dynamic. The organisation of global conferences on economic geography first in Singapore and then Korea gives some indication of how Antipodean researchers will be able to benefit from increased dialogue with an emerging cohort of economic geographers working and writing in Asia.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise to economic geographers to learn that there is a contradiction evident in the world, where on the one hand, we can observe that the world has ‘shrunk’, but on the other hand, we acknowledge that ‘place’ is now more important than it was 30 or 40 years ago. Australian and New Zealand economic geographers come from a part of the world that is labelled the Antipodes. That appellation gives us voice; gives us a position within international forums and adds strength to scholars from two small nations. We should seek to strengthen that tradition and embrace it without reservation. I do.</p>

<title>From financialisation to financialising work, Richard Le Heron</title>
<p>Discussion at the Antipodean Economic Geography conference prompted me to wonder what it might mean if we thought of sub-disciplines like economic geography as constituted and distinguished by lines of expanding/reducing commitments to particular practices of knowledge production and we also attuned ourselves to the situatedness of our economic geographies. Would we see previously invisible initiatives and trajectories of inquiry fashioned in differing contexts, but missing in dominant narratives, and better grapple with what the intellectual, institutional, material and discursive conditions and possibilities of context mean for producing and deploying knowledge practices? These are Post-Structural Political Economy (PSPE) reflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2043820613493158">Le Heron and Lewis, 2011</xref>; Lewis N, Le Heron R and Le Heron E, submitted for publication) and I use them to position my argument that recent New Zealand research on globalising dairying, which has focused on ‘<italic>financialising work</italic>’ rather than ‘<italic>financialisation</italic>’ per se, comes from trying to know economy differently.</p>
<p>Australasian economic geographers engaged a quarter of a century ago with matters financial when they saw the hallmark of the 1980s globalising and neoliberalising restructurings as the recomposition and elaboration of the three circuits of capital – trade, production and finance – through territory. Those involved drew much on international political economy and critical realism, tempered by theorising in a manner that would start and end with the differences and dilemmas of contexts. The object of analysis was capitalist accumulation. We knew from our context that capital could circulate anywhere in the world, and that the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of this are institutionally mediated. We read the literature <italic>already</italic> aware of difference in processes and outcomes and this fed into reframings of the three circuits and capital–labour–state relations to understand new internal and external connectivity. The theoretical claims, first proposed at conferences (e.g. the IGU Congress 1988 Sydney and IGU Industrial Geography Commission meetings in Rutherglen, Tasmania 1988 and Eppenheim, Germany 1989), were synthesised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820613493158">Fagan and Le Heron (1994</xref>) and extended, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2043820613493158">Pritchard and Fagan (1999</xref>). Theorising was contested by thinking through and away from examples, what we called at the time theoretically informed empirical research. Studies included the overseas growth of Australian and New Zealand companies by financing offshore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820613493158">Fagan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2043820613493158">Le Heron, 1988</xref>), leveraged buyouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2043820613493158">Le Heron, 1990</xref>), corporate raiding in Australia and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2043820613493158">Le Heron, 1991a</xref>) and new dimensions of New Zealand’s agriculture–finance relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2043820613493158">Le Heron, 1991b</xref>). The geographies of accumulation project culminated in the Changing Places books in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613493158">Britton et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2043820613493158">Le Heron and Pawson, 1996</xref>) and the Geographies of Economic Restructuring initiative in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820613493158">Fagan and Webber, 1994</xref>). Thus, we had begun to see traces of transformations in economy and society from reincorporating the countries into wider circuits. Key were the growing influence of financial motives, financial values and technologies, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in and on the operation of domestic and international economies and behaviours of corporations, individuals and households – the stuff of the financialisation literature (Epstein, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820613493158">Englelen and Faulconbridge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820613493158">French et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2043820613493158">Pike and Pollard, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>New Zealand today features <italic>continuing</italic> politically assisted marketising, privatising and financialising processes, accompanied by <italic>continuing</italic> reimagining, reorganising and rescaling of the assets, environment and labour of New Zealand territory into new geographic configurations of linkage in and beyond the country. PSPE developed as process-based inquiry (see Larner, this paper; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820613493158">Larner and Le Heron, 2002</xref>) in part as a knowledge technology to facilitate new means of engaging and enacting. A number of academics and dairy executives started collaborative discussions in 2006 that became an intellectual relation of co-learning and co-production of knowledge (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820613493158">Gray and Le Heron, 2010</xref>). The research interrogated the emergence of New Zealand dairying, the growth of Fonterra New Zealand’s global dairy corporate (ranked 6th) and the new dairy spaces of globalising dairying, <italic>from</italic> New Zealand. The methodology of <italic>following </italic>Fonterra as it has sought to rearticulate dimensions of globalising dairying reveals much about efforts by many actors to create institutions and practices that will deliver expanded value from dairying wherever possible.</p>
<p>The logic of scaling up and intensifying the dairy sector pervades thinking and models of dairy farming, processing and industry governance, and has been used to justify accumulating farm debt ($33 billion by 2010). Crucially, Fonterra was formed from, and remains embroiled in, public debate over cooperative versus corporate organisational principles. Fonterra holds its cooperative capital structure constrains its global aspirations on behalf of its farmer shareholders, by limiting borrowing for expansion. Exiting of dairy farmers in the severe drought of the 2008 season, causing cash flow pressures for Fonterra, is said to have opened the door for capital restructuring. A closer look, however, at the relationality of Fonterra since its inception would suggest a far more complex and complicated situation. While expansion meant defending, extending and making new markets and developing the dairy supply chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2043820613493158">Gray et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2043820613493158">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2043820613493158">Tamasy et al., 2010</xref>), institutional innovation by Fonterra, centred on financial practices, is remaking the sociotechnical framework of global dairying. The innovations include denominating all Fonterra’s transactions in US dollars and foreign exchange hedging to bolster revenue, hiring Chief Executive Officers from outside New Zealand and outside dairying, the creation of the Global Dairy Trade auction in Chicago in 2008 to establish a world price of milk powder, creating new internal metrics around carbon, energy and nutrient density, influential support of the Global Dairy Platform to restory dairy product features and close technical <italic>collaboration</italic> with the International Dairy Federation. An attempt to partially float Fonterra in 2009 rejected by farmers led to the design of a Trading Amongst Farmers (TAF) model, whereby a separate financial pool would fund exits at the same time as enabling payouts to be linked to the world auction price and tying the price of tradable shares to value added performance by the company. Syndicated conversion of farm land to dairying, farm amalgamation, farmer initiatives off shore, retirement of farmers, entry of Maori incorporations into dairying and new milk processing entrants has added to the ownership and organisational mix of the sector, all feeding into ‘farmer’ shareholders recently approving the TAF scheme.</p>
<p>The value to international economic geography of following Fonterra is the contradictory nature of its emergence, weaving a financial web for and in spite of its farmer shareholders. This is insight, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2043820613493158">McMichael (2012</xref>) contends, into the pivotal struggle over the calculus by which investment decisions are made – profits or planetary futures. Little of this finer detail would be discernible, make sense or its significance probed were the point of entry a dairy space other than New Zealand, or the strategy of knowledge production detached from deliberation and decision-making. For instance, geographers at the New Zealand Geographical Society (NZGS) 2008 conference in Wellington attending the copresented keynote address, ‘Globalising New Zealand – Fonterra and shaping the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2043820613493158">Gray and Le Heron, 2010</xref>), were the first academics in the world to hear that Fonterra had launched the Global Dairy Trade auction that very morning – from the manager (a geographer) responsible for the launch! By asking what work is underway, which emphasises economic and institutional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613493158">Caliskan and Callon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2043820613493158">Mitchell, 2010</xref>), the trajectory of intersecting <italic>new relations</italic> being assembled in and across dairy spaces can be grasped as a <italic>mix</italic> of market making, production and supply chain as well as financialising elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2043820613493158">Peck and Theodore, 2012</xref>). The globalising dairying example indicates associations and alignments that are having cumulative effects – a structural directionality that is exercisable in and because of a supportive New Zealand and international (e.g. WTO) regulatory framework. A PSPE approach stresses that the broad structural features as lived context is vital in engaging and enacting with actors in the micro- and macro-politics of investment decision-making. Narrating how we are and can do ‘knowing’, especially of emergence, is indeed a major challenge ahead for economic geographers.</p>

<title>Tensions within Antipodean representations of the state, Phillip O’Neill</title>
<p>My brief is to reflect on a body of work that I have written on the state from an Australian perspective (O’Neill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2043820613493158">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2043820613493158">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2043820613493158">O’Neill and Argent, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2043820613493158">O’Neill and Moore, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2043820613493158">O’Neill and McGuirk, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2043820613493158">O’Neill and Fagan, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2043820613493158">McGuirk and O’Neill, 2012</xref>). I want to do this by exploring a major tension in state theory among economic geographers. This tension comes from the expectation that as academics, we should create general knowledge about the state by bringing order to our observations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2043820613493158">Lakoff (1987</xref>) reminds us that we build order using categories. Yet, categories also stylise our experience of the world, rendering some things universal and pervasive such that we can fail to recognise both the contingent nature of the general things we say about the state, and the new things that the state is doing and becoming. What I argue, then, is that tension in our state theory is sourced from the ways language and knowledge are linked.</p>
<p>At the core of language are those words and phrases that distil understanding from a field of endless observations. One important distillation is the periodisation. In the last three decades, economic geographers have charted their understanding of economic change through the periodisations of Keynesian-Fordism, the fiscal crisis of the state, Thatcherism, the third way and neoliberalism. These periodisations give economic geography a common language to converse about the state including with other social science and political communities.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, we need ways of depicting political and economic systems as contingent, incapable of being predicted from rules and norms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2043820613493158">O’Neill and Argent, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2043820613493158">Simandan, 2010</xref>). We need to see the state as slippery in each of its manifestations around the globe, and avoid nominating a Western European or a North American case as normal, and, say, Australia or New Zealand as exceptional. At the same time, we need to recognise that there are tendencies towards an idealised form of the state, manifest, for example, in policy mimicries traceable to centres of ideological power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2043820613493158">Peck, 2011</xref>). In short, we need to recognise states as complex assemblages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2043820613493158">McGuirk and Dowling, 2009</xref>), scripted by imported narratives, sure, but also constructed by domestic narratives, and then by worlds of unscripted events and practices.</p>
<p>To proceed further, to what extent can Antipodean experiences recompose general narratives of the state? Given that power and language formations are inseparable, the answer is inevitably ‘very little’, and certainly this is true of my contribution to state theory in economic geography. An examination of the citations history of my articles on the state shows their appropriation in asserting the importance of the state as an indispensable organiser of economy and society – as a qualitative player, if you like. Yet, my arguments for taking seriously the role of event-filled fields of distributional narratives of the state in Australia have a negligible citations history. Economic geography’s state remains a relatively stable, northern social and political construct.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613493158">Connell (2007c</xref>) presents a grand view of northern hegemony, of global norms built from observations from a local hearth, and she is concerned at the ‘grand erasure’ that ensues, quite rightly. Yet, erasure to some extent or other is the nub of knowledge creation. There is always a need for frameworks that privilege macrorelations within periodised time, so that there is a common set of subjects and categories for talking about things. These give our work technical efficiency and enhance labour productivity. Then, there is a need for a common-enough language of analysis as the basis for intertextual thinking, which generates further language development and, therefore, innovative provocative theory. And, then, we need language with common categories for conversations with cognate disciplines like political economy and economy and society, and with a wider public audience. In which case, can Antipodean economy geography offer anything more than local illustrations of Northern Theory, of unique cases that do little more than spar with the general (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2043820613493158">Sayer, 1989</xref>)? Do Antipodean economic geographers have little choice except to buy in to the periodisations, structures and processes generated by northern state theory so as to participate in that intertexuality event and its flood of texts, with a niche responsibility to argue for the idiosyncratic?</p>
<p>Sheer weight of work from the north will ensure this, especially in an economic geography dominated still by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2043820613493158">Ruddick (2009</xref>) describes as a search for structured coherences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613493158">Barnes and Sheppard, 2010</xref>). But an edgy position can give critical attitude to Antipodean work. The Antipodes is a place where the terrain between idealised social structures and materialised worlds is always exposed. And being Antipodean brings a raised consciousness about epistemology and the methods of knowing. ‘How do I know this?’ becomes a normal question. The Auckland-based work on the situated nature of knowledge creation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2043820613493158">Le Heron, 2009</xref>) is a recent example of such normalcy away from the centre.</p>
<p>My final observation draws on the work of Claus Offe and Karl Polanyi and a view that the actually existing state is always messy, complicated, contradictory and conflicted, and never observable in anything like a general form, just the play out of a state entwined with itself and with just about everything else. Which, to me, means that the point of our work shouldn’t worry so much about the stable character of the state but rather what the state becomes as it responds to capitalism’s crises. Žižek makes the point:<disp-quote>
<p>In the UK, the Thatcher revolution was, at the time, chaotic and impulsive, marked by unpredictable contingencies. It was Tony Blair who was able to institutionalise it, or, in Hegel’s terms, to raise (what first appeared as) a contingency, a historical accident, into a necessity. Thatcher wasn’t a Thatcherite, she was merely herself; it was Blair (more than Major) who truly gave form to Thatcherism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2043820613493158">Žižek, 2007</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote> In this sense, a search for general truth misses the point, either in the north or elsewhere. It is in the construction of possibilities for state roles in production and distributional outcomes that should be the core concern of our state theory. In such a research agenda, there is a role for all geographical research positions.</p>

<title>Afterword: Antipodean geographies here and there?</title>
<p>Capitalising on our Antipodean position, which straddles the cleavage of purely global south and global north, this paper started from a curiosity to explore what, if anything, made the economic geographies produced from the Antipodes different? This curiosity led us to draw on work conducted in anthropology and sociology on ideas around Southern Theory and fusing it with debates in economic geography around postcolonialism and critical histories of the discipline. But, rather than merely adding to and reinforcing what postcolonial tendencies in economic geography have usefully started to do, our point of departure in this paper has been to question to what extent the so-called universal and dominant knowledges and theories have been produced purely in the global north and from the spaces of advanced western economies to begin with?</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than theorising back at the economic geographical knowledges produced from the Anglo-American core, prompted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613493158">Connell (2007c</xref>) and Comoroff and Comoroff (2012), we have ‘inverted the order of things’ and have suggested that the ‘core’ may already be being spoken too but is somehow blinkered by the dominance and legitimacy afforded to narratives that imply and accept an Anglo-American hegemony (see also Larner in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2043820613493158">Pollard et al. (2011</xref>)). In our opinion, scholars in the international economic geography community are already, but often unknowingly, using and appropriating categories, concepts and heuristics produced beyond the ‘core’, and, as has been demonstrated in this article, some of these categories and heuristics have their historical antecedents in Antipodean perspectives and contexts.</p>
<p>Although there appeared to be continuum of opinion amongst our contributors around whether or not the Antipodes has been a site of novel theory production or, that Antipodean scholars might not ‘do’ theory nearly as much as counterparts in the north, instead preferring to start with an overt engagement with place. Our paper has demonstrated how numerous Antipodean scholars have provided some of the earliest critiques, important leadership and guiding frames on theories and topics that have significantly shaped the international economic geography community, despite these theories deriving from specific conditions and events unique to an Antipodean context. Examples include financialisation, the qualitative state and poststructuralist political economy. Another powerfully generative contribution has been the work of Gibson-Graham who has sought and continues to decentre and challenge capital-centric readings of the world highlighting the multiplicities and alternative logics of economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2043820613493158">Gibson-Graham, 1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2043820613493158">2006</xref>, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2043820613493158">Gibson-Graham et al., 2013</xref>). Not only are these contributions indicative of the way Antipodean economic geographical knowledges travel and are assembled beyond our geographical and institutional borders but also that narratives from the ‘undersides’ do have explanatory power (Comoroff and Comoroff, 2012).</p>
<p>Moreover, while mention was made about the smallness of the Antipodean economic geography community and the difficult, perhaps impossible, task of decentring the widely acknowledged political economy and geographically biased nature of journal editing, citation rounds and publishing practices orientated around the Anglo-American hearth. It would seem that it is our ‘edgy’ location that not only gives us a voice within the international economic geography community but a unique strength to our theory production. It is precisely the situatedness and uniqueness of Antipodean events and experiences, which have enabled us to provide novel theories that originally were required to speak to the distinctive features and circumstances of Australia and New Zealand but which have since been taken up and appropriated beyond the Antipodes. Notably, the possibilities offered by poststructuralist political economy to enable this uptake and appropriation of knowledge, via its focus on contingency, assemblage and hybridity, has played a central facilitating role. Equally while there may have been consensus that Antipodean economic geographies are different, by no means was it implied that such knowledges were produced in a vacuum. The way in which such knowledges are deeply intertwined and ‘mangled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes, 2012</xref>) with knowledges, events, experiences and positionalities produced beyond the Antipodes have been central to the development of Antipodean economic geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the corpus of Antipodean contributions to the sub-discipline, it is our assessment that their ‘whereness’ and historical antecedents go relatively unremarked within the international economic geography community (for an exception, see Jessop’s comments cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2043820613493158">Larner and Le Heron, 2002</xref>). Thus, raising questions around how many other concepts and theories used in the international economic geography community have not necessarily been derived from the Anglo-American core? It is precisely this blind spot that prompts us to advocate for more critical and spatially aware histories of the sub-discipline to be written from perspectives beyond the Anglo axis.</p>
<p>There are, however, some important caveats to our argument. First, we do not seek to lump northern scholars into a single homogenous category, nor do we seek to overlook or deny hybridity to a range of northern-based scholars working in the global south (Laurie, Sidaway), transitioning economies (Stenning, Smith, Birch), marginal zones (Roberts) or even the Antipodes (Tomaney). Questions also remain about where our assertions leave those scholars working in the Asia Pacific (Yeung, Lai, Bunnell) or Middle East region – regions neither of us (Wray and Dufty-Jones) have theorised from or engaged with empirically. Third, we also need to recognise and reflect on our own positionalities. For example, many economic geographers based in the Antipodes tend not to undertake empirical research beyond the Antipodean borders. While there are longstanding debates about geographers doing research in their own back yards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2043820613493158">Markusen, 1999</xref>), our paper raises a pertinent question as to whether there is a non-north empiric that is neglected, or treated in a perverse way, that we are in fact part of not counter to.</p>
<p>So where next? Well, like others in the discipline, we concur with scholars advocating greater awareness about the ‘whereness’ and politics of knowledge production and circulation. As already mentioned, we also encourage critical and spatially aware histories of the sub-discipline to be written from perspectives beyond the Anglo-American hearth and that such disciplinary histories should be written in a critical and bold way with an emphasis on naming ideas and concepts to show how these have contributed to the development of the discipline. While these histories will (and should) be critiqued and questioned, unless such histories are written, nobody will know about them thus stifling the opportunity for further critical reflection on how economic geographies have and will continue to develop – thus running the risk of the ‘core’ perpetually blinding themselves to the contributions from the periphery (Pratt, 1992 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493158">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493158">Barnes (2012</xref>), who argued that remembering history rather than forgetting, it is important if economic geography wants to make its own history, we see this dialogue and attempt to redress the invisibility of critical histories of the discipline as a beginning rather than as an end point.</p>
<p>Likewise, further studies of ‘special moments of encounter’ like those advocated and witnessed by Le Heron and Lewis (2009) to examine the disjuncture between intended messages and the realities of geoeconomic, geopolitical and intradisciplinary power relations would tell us much about ‘the requirement for altered practices in the conduct of critical geography necessary to achieve effective change in the politics of knowledge production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2043820613493158">Le Heron and Lewis, 2007</xref>:6). Similarly, more inclusive initiatives like the Summer Institute in Economic Geography (which may like to take place outside of America or Europe), the Global Conference on Economic Geography and the International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography, which had a far more spatially distributed series of contributions are welcome additions to opening up new conversations about the politics and whereness of knowledge production and circulation.</p>
<p>Finally then, as regards the title of this paper, rather than Antipodean economic geography being neither here nor there, such knowledges are always situated and always being actively rearticulated and configured. Indeed, so as to recognise the existence of economic geography with multidirectional interdependencies rather than a ‘one-way’ model, Antipodean economic geography is always here<italic> and</italic> there.</p>
