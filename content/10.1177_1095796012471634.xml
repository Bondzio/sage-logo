<p>In the 1970s, a generation of young labor activists influenced by the civil rights and antiwar struggles were drawn to the cause of democratizing unions from the bottom up and infusing them with rank-and-file militancy. Following the murder of United Mine Workers (UMW) reformer Joseph A. “Jock” Yablonski on New Year’s Eve in 1969 by henchmen of the union’s president, W.A. “Tony” Boyle, activists built a powerful movement under the banner of Miners for Democracy (MFD) to challenge Boyle’s criminality, authoritarianism, and failure to defend his members’ interests. The MFD spearheaded the successful election of Arnold Miller as UMW president in 1972 and helped inspire a young Richard Trumka. Influenced by the MFD’s example, a group called Teamsters for a Decent Contract (later Teamsters for a Democratic Union), challenged Teamster boss Frank Fitzsimmons’s negotiation strategy in 1976, beginning a long fight that would eventually elect reformer Ron Carey to the union’s presidency in 1991. In 1977, Ed Sadlowski galvanized labor activists with a quixotic bid for the presidency of the United Steelworkers.</p>
<p>For a time, it seemed that these insurgencies might revive a postwar labor movement that had clearly lost momentum. Even in the depths of the Reagan era, the signs were encouraging. The journal <italic>Labor Notes</italic>, founded in 1979, emerged as the leading organ of the union reform movement in the following decade, promoting a vision of rank-and-file activism through its reporting, conferences, and books. Activists within the United Automobile Workers built a vibrant caucus called New Directions that challenged that union’s concessionary bargaining in the 1980s. And the aircraft assemblers of Boeing formed a range of caucuses called Unionists for Democratic Change (UDC), Machinists for Solidarity, Rank and File, and New Crew critical of the leadership of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW). Movements for union democracy seemed to be afoot across the labor movement.</p>
<p>That moment has passed. From the vantage point of today, well into the twenty-first century, it is clear that the promise of the union reform movement has dimmed. While reform caucuses still maintain an important presence in many unions, the élan that infused the ranks of activists in the 1970s and 1980s has been sapped by the accelerating crisis of the labor movement. The earlier generation of activists operated from the belief that organized labor’s leaders had become too cozy with capital and their organizations had become too bureaucratic. If only rank-and-file members took back the control of their organizations and made them more militant, they believed, the movement as a whole could be revived. While many still adhere to this vision, the events of the last decade have made it harder to argue that organized labor’s troubles are attributable primarily to the cupidity of its leaders and the ossification of its institutions. In the private and public sector alike, unions are in retreat, their treasuries and membership roles shrinking, their leaders scorned and vilified. The call to reform and democratize union governance seems less urgent now that the very survival of unions in any form no longer seems assured.</p>
<p>Yet, at this moment of deepening crisis, it would be a mistake for us to neglect the vital work of renewing unions as vehicles of democracy, for as labor girds itself against a new wave of attacks, it is more important than ever that union members feel that their organizations belong to them. This is the essential lesson of Dana L. Cloud’s provocative new book, <italic>We Are the Union: Democratic Unionism and Dissent at Boeing</italic>.</p>

<p>Cloud tells the story of the rise and fall of reform caucuses at Boeing plants in Washington State’s Puget Sound region and Wichita, Kansas. Her work is based largely on her interviews with caucus leaders, such as Keith Thomas, the founder and leader of the UDC caucus in Wichita. Through the experiences of Thomas and others, she recounts how activists came together in the aftermath of a disappointing contract achieved after a strike in 1989, built their organizations in the early 1990s, and pushed the IAMAW to fight harder in the strike of 1995. During the sixty-nine-day 1995 walkout, the caucuses helped galvanize rank-and-file members to reject two tentative contracts before finally achieving one they could support.</p>
<p>Yet, as Cloud shows, Boeing’s reform caucuses did not fare well after 1995. As the 1990s drew to a close, Boeing was “retaking the offensive” (p. 121), threatening massive layoffs as it moved toward an increasingly lean production model. “The official union was on the run” by 1999, Cloud argues, adopting “the attitude that workers should cooperate with management” (p. 45). Yet the company’s aggression and the union’s quiescence did not energize the reform caucuses or galvanize rank-and-file militancy among Boeing’s machinists. Thomas’s Wichita-based UDC, which dissolved in 1995, did not reemerge to push the union into a fighting posture, and similar caucuses in the Puget Sound region also exerted little influence. Although Thomas and other activists urged their colleagues to prepare for a strike when their contract expired in 1999—“Get Ready for the Long One,” was their motto—layoff-wary machinists were not anxious for a fight. They approved Boeing’s 1999 offer without a strike. And in 2002, they approved a concessionary contract, even though the IAMAW’s leaders had asked them to vote for a strike that might give them more leverage in the negotiations.</p>
<p>In Cloud’s telling, it was not so much the larger economic environment and the fear of layoffs that undermined support for Boeing’s reform caucuses as it was the missteps of caucus leaders and the structural problems associated with serving as a “loyal opposition” within the unions in which “fighting the union becomes an end in itself <italic>and</italic> the activists see little way to fight the union except from its head” (pp. 139-140). Reformers spent too much time contesting for political power within their locals, she argues, and too little time inspiring the rank and file to believe in its capacity to “fight in its own interests” (p. 128). She charges that “the UDC was consumed with internal politics” and ended up replicating the behavior of the Administrative Caucus that ran the IAMAW (p. 129). Remarkably, she devotes a whole chapter to reproducing a dialogue between herself and Thomas in which she questions his leadership, taking him and other dissidents to task for being “kind of obsessive about . . . elections,” which she judges to have been “an ineffective use of resources” (pp. 165-166).</p>
<p>Thomas counters that it “certainly was not for lack of trying” (p. 159) that his movement failed, and that his caucus’s electoral work was necessary to sustain its credibility and answer the charges of those who said, “Well all they ever do is complain, but they never run for anything. So why don’t they try to change it?” (p. 167). But Thomas’ explanations appear to have little impact on Cloud, who implies that a Gramscian “optimism of the will” could have sustained a vibrant reform movement against the odds, no matter what was happening with Boeing or the world economy. “Here’s what I think should happen,” Cloud tells Thomas: “Someone like you needs to focus on . . . building support for ideas in the rank and file. And having all-members meetings, with everyone involved, having a dues-based organization, and building, building, building over the long term” (p. 171).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this relentlessly prescriptive quality weakens Cloud’s otherwise interesting book and raises questions about how well she really understands the forces against which Thomas and colleagues contended. These questions multiply as one searches in vain for precise details of the contracts negotiated in 1995, 1999, and 2002, a survey of the changing worldwide passenger jet market (Boeing’s competitor Airbus is mentioned only in passing), or a clear accounting of the decline in Boeing’s American-based workforce over the last two decades. Cloud does not mention Boeing’s bitterly contested 2009 decision to move a 787 Dreamliner production line to right-to-work South Carolina.</p>

<p>Doubts about Cloud’s interpretations are furthered by errors in her text. She refers to the “Economic Free Choice Act (EFCA)” (p. xi); she says “Harry Truman signed the Taft-Hartley Act,” when in reality Congress overrode his veto (p. 18); and she calls the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 “the Clinton antiracketeering law (RICO)” (p. 146), although it was passed when the future president Bill Clinton was just entering Yale Law School. This book took Cloud far afield from her other solely authored volume, <italic>Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetoric of Therapy</italic> (1997) and, at times, the signs of this long stretch show.</p>
<p>These troubling features of her book aside, Dana Cloud has done us a very useful service in this moment of deepening crisis for organized labor. By preserving—even imperfectly—the memory of a “brief and shining moment” (p. 162) in the mid-1990s when Boeing activists challenged their union to fight, she reminds us that ultimately labor’s very survival, let alone any revival, will require members to decide that their unions are worth fighting for.</p>
