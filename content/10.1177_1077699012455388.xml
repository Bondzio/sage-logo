<abstract>
<p>In this study, the concept of forgiveness was proposed as an outcome variable to crisis management, and relationships among message appeals, causal attributions, and forgiveness were investigated. A 2 (causal attributions: internal vs. external) × 2 (message appeals: information-centered vs. emotion-centered) between-subjects design experimental study was conducted. The two types of causal attributions had significant main effects, and the different types of causal attributions and message appeals had interaction effects on forgiveness. This suggests the importance of selectively determining message appeals based on the public’s perception of causal attributions during a crisis.</p>

<body>
<p>A growing number of organizations have been experiencing a wide range of crises because of the increasingly complex society in which they operate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012455388">1</xref></sup> Communication researchers have made substantial efforts to identify the most effective communication strategies that could help organizations address diverse types of crisis situations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012455388">2</xref></sup> In particular, public relations scholars supporting a relationship management perspective have claimed that the ultimate goal of crisis communication management is to restore the relationship between organizations and the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012455388">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies of crisis communication have suggested that providing accurate information is of the utmost importance in crisis communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012455388">4</xref></sup> In addition, experts have posited that crisis communicators should provide target audiences with crisis-related information and demonstrate compassion for victims. However, few studies have examined which of the two approaches (information and compassion) is more appropriate for different types of crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012455388">5</xref></sup> In this regard, the present study examines how different types of message appeals used in crisis communication influence the public’s responses.</p>
<p>Concepts such as the public’s acceptance of messages and perceptions of organizational reputation before and after a crisis were frequently posited in previous research as outcome variables influenced by crisis communication messages. In other words, outcome variables have typically been used for measuring changes in the level of the target public’s cognition. In fact, scholars have suggested that, for theoretical development in crisis management, it is necessary to explore affective and behavioral changes in target publics as well as cognitive changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012455388">6</xref></sup> The present study suggests and explores the concept of “forgiveness,” which has been actively researched in psychology, as a potent outcome variable that can capture the public’s affective responses. In interpersonal relationships, forgiveness is often discussed as a factor that may restore ruined relationships.</p>
<p>The present study conducts an empirical analysis to determine whether forgiveness is an important outcome variable in the context of crisis communication and to examine the effects of two types of causal attributions (external vs. internal) and two types of appeals (information vs. compassion) on forgiveness.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-1077699012455388">
<title>Crisis Management and Forgiveness</title>
<p>Crisis management reflects a diverse and complex process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012455388">7</xref></sup> Previous studies have defined organizational crises in many ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012455388">8</xref></sup> Pearson and Mitroff defined an organizational crisis as “an incident or event that poses a threat to the organization’s reputation and viability.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012455388">9</xref></sup> A crisis can also be defined as a major occurrence that threatens the existence of an organization in that it interferes with the organization’s ability to deliver its products and services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012455388">10</xref></sup> An organizational crisis is considered a grave event that can devastate the relationship between the organization and the public and harm the organization’s reputation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012455388">11</xref></sup> Other scholars have argued that crises should not be solely defined as devastating events and that the definition of crisis should include publics’ perception about the crisis events, as it can greatly affect crisis outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012455388">12</xref></sup> For instance, Coombs defined crisis as “the perception of an unpredictable event that threatens. . .the organization’s performance and generates negative outcomes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012455388">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies of public relations have maintained that for restoring a damaged organization–public relationship, it is most critical to select effective crisis communication strategies appropriate for the given type of crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012455388">14</xref></sup> The bulk of crisis communication strategy research is based on apologia and image restoration theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012455388">15</xref></sup> In addition, most of the previous crisis communication research has typically considered organizational image, organizational reputation, and crisis responsibility as outcome variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012455388">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Coombs’s situational crisis communication theory categorized various types of crises based on organizational responsibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012455388">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, Coombs suggested the following strategies for crisis communication: denial, diminish, and rebuild. Subsequent studies have reported that for the organization most responsible for the crisis, rebuilding strategies (including apologies and corrective action) are more likely to be accepted by the public than denial and diminish strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012455388">18</xref></sup> However, to expand the understanding of crisis communication, it is necessary to explore diverse variables from other fields. Because previous studies have typically focused on cognitive changes in the public as outcome variables, it would be meaningful to consider the public’s emotional and behavioral responses.</p>
<p>The concept of forgiveness, a widely researched concept in psychology since the late 1980s, may be a potential outcome variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012455388">19</xref></sup> According to North, forgiveness is a universal phenomenon in human lives and can be explained as “the overcoming of negative affect and judgment toward the offender by endeavoring to view the offender with compassion, benevolence, and love.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012455388">20</xref></sup> Beatty described forgiveness as a relational concept and suggested that it plays a pivotal role in reducing conflicts and restoring interpersonal relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012455388">21</xref></sup> In crisis management, what an organization wishes to accomplish is not so different from Beatty’s description of what forgiveness can do for interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is precipitated when the offender apologizes. Empirical studies have reported that an apology has a substantial impact on forgiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012455388">22</xref></sup> For example, Ohbuchi, Kameda, and Agarie found that their participants were more likely to forgive their offenders when they received a genuine apology than when they received no apology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012455388">23</xref></sup> In addition, previous studies of forgiveness have emphasized that attribution is an important antecedent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012455388">24</xref></sup> In this regard, crisis communication research, which relies heavily on attribution theory, should benefit from this body of knowledge.</p>
<p>Scholars have regarded forgiveness as an integrative concept encompassing a person’s cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012455388">25</xref></sup> The cognitive dimension of forgiveness can explain how one understands and abandons negative attitudes toward the offender. The affective dimension indicates the extent to which one withdraws hatred for the offender. The behavioral aspect of forgiveness is about how one can meet the offender and improve one’s relationship with the offender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012455388">26</xref></sup> In this regard, the forgiveness concept may provide useful guidelines on integrative assessments of the public’s responses to crisis communication.</p>
<p>Based on the literature review, the present study argues that the concept of forgiveness can provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights into crisis communication. In particular, this concept should shed some light on interdisciplinary research on apology strategies. The present study adopts the forgiveness concept as a dependent variable in the context of organizational crises. In this research, we define the public’s forgiveness of an organization as the “public’s effort to reduce negative thinking, overcome unpleasant emotion, and restore their damaged relationship with an organization due to a crisis that affected both the organization and the public.”</p>

<sec id="section3-1077699012455388">
<title>Causal Attributions</title>
<p>Scholars have adopted attribution theory as a strong conceptual foundation for evaluating the effects of crisis message strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012455388">27</xref></sup> According to attribution theory, individuals are likely to search for causes of events that are negative, unexpected, and important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012455388">28</xref></sup> Coombs argued that, because organizational crises are unexpected events perceived mostly as negative by the public, attribution theory can provide a better understanding of effective communication strategies during crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012455388">29</xref></sup> McAuley, Duncan, and Russell suggested stability, external control, personal control, and the locus of control as the four causal dimensions that individuals may use in making attributions for a given event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012455388">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Coombs proposed four types of organizational crises that can induce attributions and used the following two dimensions to explain crisis attributions: external control and personal control/the locus of causality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012455388">31</xref></sup> External control refers to the degree to which external agents have control over the crisis, and personal control/the locus of causality indicates the degree to which the organization itself can control the crisis. Although useful, these two dimensions appear to overlook possible variations in attributions during crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012455388">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this regard, Lee proposed simplified but comprehensive two-attribute dimensions (internal and external) by integrating the locus and controllability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012455388">33</xref></sup> According to Lee, individuals who perceive that a crisis was caused by an organization (internal locus) are likely to regard the crisis as controllable, whereas those who perceive that the crisis was not caused by a particular organization (external locus) are likely to view it as uncontrollable. Several studies have verified that causal attributions can precipitate judgments about crisis responsibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012455388">34</xref></sup> When an organizational crisis is regarded as internal and controllable, the public tends to believe that the organization should take more responsibility. In such a situation, the public may not easily forgive the organization. On the other hand, when a crisis is perceived to be external and uncontrollable, the public is more likely to forgive the organization involved in the crisis. Based on previous research, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012455388" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H1:</bold> Internal and external causal attribution types have direct effects on cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of forgiveness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H1a:</bold> Publics are more likely to cognitively forgive the organization involved in a crisis when the crisis is perceived as external and uncontrollable than when it is perceived as internal and controllable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H1b:</bold> Publics are more likely to emotionally forgive the organization involved in a crisis when the crisis is perceived as external and uncontrollable than when it is perceived as internal and controllable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H1c:</bold> Publics are more likely to behaviorally forgive the organization involved in a crisis when the crisis is perceived as external and uncontrollable than when it is perceived as internal and controllable.</p></list-item>

<title>Message Appeals (Information/Rational vs. Compassion/Emotional)</title>
<p>Previous crisis studies have focused on crisis message strategies, based on the theory of apologia or impression management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012455388">35</xref></sup> According to Coombs, the dominant crisis communication strategies include <italic>information</italic> and <italic>compassion</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012455388">36</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Information</italic> refers to providing accurate information on a crisis, and <italic>compassion</italic> refers to expressing concern for those harmed by the crisis. Focusing more on <italic>compassion</italic> than <italic>information</italic>, crisis researchers elaborated on crisis message strategies and integrated them into an accommodative-defensive continuum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012455388">37</xref></sup> Defensive strategies emphasize protecting the organization and consist of <italic>attacking the accuser</italic> and <italic>shifting blame</italic>, and accommodative strategies stress helping victims with <italic>corrective action</italic> and <italic>sincere apologies</italic>.</p>
<p>Given that crisis messages must not only provide crisis-related information, but also express compassion for victims, it is imperative to explore the effects of compassion and information on the public’s response to a crisis involving an organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012455388">38</xref></sup> In this regard, the present study considers both information and compassion as primary factors in crisis message strategies and examine their effects during a crisis.</p>
<p>A comparative study of information and compassion in terms of crisis message strategies can be seen as parallel to research on the following two types of message appeals: rational and emotional. Rational appeals focus on providing concrete and clear information about the given topic, in order to change the recipient’s beliefs by relying on arguments or reason. On the other hand, in persuading the recipients, emotion-centered appeals focus on presenting various images and words that stimulate positive or negative emotions and atmosphere about the given topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012455388">39</xref></sup> In this regard, information may be viewed as a rational or information-centered appeal if it is designed to stimulate a cognitive appraisal by offering concrete information on the crisis, while compassion may be regarded as an emotional or emotion-centered appeal in that it can induce an affective appraisal from the public (e.g., the message can be designed to show the organization’s concern for those affected by the crisis).</p>
<p>In sum, information in crisis communication strategy can be conceptualized as a rational appeal that “focuses more on providing factual and concrete information on a crisis event itself and describing the steps the organization is taking to manage the crisis situation.” On the other hand, compassion can be defined as an emotional appeal that “focuses more on expressing the organization’s sincere sorrow, regret, and concern for those affected by a crisis in describing how the organization is managing the crisis situation.” There has been an ongoing debate about the relative power of rational and emotional appeals through advertising. However, advertising scholars have typically suggested that the effect of the message varies considerably according to the type of appeal emphasized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012455388">40</xref></sup> In this regard, the public’s responses to crisis message strategies may vary according to the type of appeal employed.</p>
<p>The present study suggests that crisis message appeals may moderate the causal relationships between causal attribution and forgiveness. For instance, Jin found that individuals are likely to feel anger when they perceive a crisis as internal and controllable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012455388">41</xref></sup> Thus, in such a situation, an emotion-centered appeal (e.g., showing compassion) may reduce their anger and elicit more positive attitudes. Meanwhile, when a crisis is perceived as external and uncontrollable, individuals may be frightened and thus want more information on the crisis. Hence, an information-centered appeal (e.g., providing information) may be more appropriate than an emotion-centered one. Based on the above discussion, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list2-1077699012455388" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>H2:</bold> Different types of crisis message appeals will have indirect effects on the publics’ forgiveness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2a:</bold> When a crisis is perceived as external and uncontrollable, publics are more likely to forgive the organization involved in the crisis if a rational appeal is used in crisis advertising.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>H2b:</bold> When a crisis is perceived as internal and controllable, publics are more likely to forgive the organization involved in the crisis if an emotional appeal is used in crisis advertising.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The respondents were 200 undergraduate students enrolled in communication courses at a university in Korea. Males accounted for 52.0% of the respondents. All the respondents were users of one of the largest and most popular social networking sites in Korea (C Corporation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012455388">42</xref></sup> They spent an average of 18.94 minutes (<italic>SD</italic> = 23.340) per day using the site. Their attitudes toward C Corporation, measured with a 7-point Likert-type (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) scale question (“In general, I feel good about corporation C”), were positive (<italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.185). Respondents were asked to answer this question at the outset of the experiment, prior to the exposure to the respective scenarios. Approximately 75% of the respondents had experienced a leak of personal information.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077699012455388">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses, we employed a 2 (causal attributions: internal vs. external) × 2 (message appeals: information-centered vs. emotion-centered) between-subjects design. The manipulation was embedded in the description of a hypothetical incident in which there was a leak of personal information. In Korea, a leak of confidential information on the Internet has been considered one of the most serious types of crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012455388">43</xref></sup> Recently, there were two such crises in Korea. In 2008, a major Internet portal was involved in a massive leak of internal information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012455388">44</xref></sup> An employee of Daum, a major Internet portal site in Korea, accessed the personal database and sold it to marketing firms. This incident can be classified as a case of internal attributions. The other crisis was caused by hackers, and a major shopping site suffered massively as a result.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012455388">45</xref></sup> This crisis can be categorized as an external attribution case. At the time of this research, the information leakage issue was still an ongoing social concern in Korea; thus, we chose a leak of personal information as a hypothetical crisis. For this hypothetical crisis, we developed four scenarios by considering different combinations of causal attributions and crisis message appeals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012455388">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<p>For forgiveness, we used a total of nine items. These items, including three items for each dimension of forgiveness (cognitive, affective, and behavioral), were adapted from Oh’s Korean Forgiveness Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012455388">46</xref></sup> which has been revised and further developed from the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI). First, cognitive forgiveness items were (1) “I cannot trust C online service anymore because of the personal information leakage accident,” (2) “I would not be able to change my negative thoughts about C online service because of the personal information leakage accident,” and (3) “I would not regard C online service as a good company because of the personal information leakage accident.” Second, affective forgiveness items included (1) “I am disappointed about C online service because of the personal information leakage accident,” (2) “The personal information leakage accident prompts me to dislike C online service,” and (3) “I feel anger toward C online service due to the personal information leakage accident.” Third, behavioral forgiveness items covered (1) “I would not be able to visit the C online service as I used to because of the personal information leakage accident,” (2) “I would not feel safe using C online service after the personal information leakage accident,” and (3) “I would not be able to pleasantly use the C online service because of the personal information leakage accident.” Items of acceptance and empathy, which have been widely regarded as communication effect measures in crisis management research, were also adopted in order to test the discriminant validity of forgiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012455388">47</xref></sup> The respondents rated these items on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of the manipulation for causal attributions and message appeals, we provided the respondents with four items. One of the two items for causal attributions assessed the degree to which the organization was responsible for the leak and was anchored by <italic>not at all caused by the organization</italic> (1) and <italic>totally caused by the organization</italic> (5). The other item assessed the degree to which the organization could have controlled the leak and was anchored by <italic>not at all controllable</italic> (1) and <italic>totally controllable</italic> (5). One of the two items for message appeals assessed the degree to which the message provided concrete information on the crisis and was anchored by <italic>lacks concrete information</italic> (1) and <italic>concrete information is fully provided</italic> (5). The other item assessed the degree to which the message was emotional and was anchored by <italic>emotion-oriented</italic> (1) <italic>and information–oriented</italic> (5). All of the responses were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</p>

<title>Manipulation Checks</title>
<p>We aggregated the two items for the causal attribution manipulation check and the two items for message appeals to construct a single manipulation check variable. First, the higher the score for the causal attribution variable, the more likely the recipient is to perceive an internal cause, whereas the lower the score, the more likely the recipient is to perceive an external cause. As expected, the mean for the manipulation check variable was higher in the internal condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.30) than in the external condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.18), and there were significant differences in the means (<italic>t</italic> = 4.420, <italic>df</italic> = 198, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Second, higher scores of the message appeal variable reflected a greater degree of perceived rational appeal, and lower scores indicated a greater degree of perceived emotional appeal. As expected, the mean for the manipulation check variable was higher in the rational condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41) than in the emotional condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27), and there were significant differences in the means (<italic>t</italic> = −5.372, <italic>df</italic> = 198, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Reliability and Validity of the Forgiveness Construct</title>
<p>The indicators of forgiveness were examined in terms of their effectiveness in measuring the intended concept (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012455388">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, we assessed the reliability and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of the constructs and conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) by using SPSS 15.0. Cronbach’s alpha tests for forgiveness consisting of three subdimensions showed acceptable levels of alpha coefficients: .84 for cognitive forgiveness, .91 for emotional forgiveness, and .90 for behavioral forgiveness. In terms of the multidimensionality of forgiveness, the results of the PCA indicate that, as expected, there were three subdimensions, which explained approximately 83.88% of the variance. In addition, we determined construct validity with AMOS 7.0, by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results of the CFA indicated adequate construct validity (χ<sup>2</sup> = 47.480, <italic>p</italic> = .002, <italic>df</italic> = 23, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.064, NFI = .973, GFI = .953, AGFI = .908, RMR = .056, CFI = .986).</p>

<title>Comparison of Respondents</title>
<p>For this study’s between-subjects analysis, we controlled for the effects of extraneous variables (e.g., the respondents’ status and stances) on forgiveness by using the chi-square test and conducting a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). We selected those factors that could influence the respondents’ responses to a leak of personal information, including their sex, experience with a leak, attitudes toward C Corporation, and use of the C site (i.e., the amount of time spent using the site). We employed the chi-square test for their sex (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.083, <italic>p</italic> = .555) and experience with a leak (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.545, <italic>p</italic> = .909) and the ANOVA for their attitudes toward C Corporation (<italic>F</italic> = 0.320, <italic>p</italic> = .811) and use of the C site (<italic>F</italic> = 1.212, <italic>p</italic> = .307). There were no significant differences between the experimental groups for these four factors. These results suggest that we successfully controlled for any spurious effects of extraneous variables.</p>

<p>Second, we examined the interaction effects of causal attributions and message appeals on the three dimensions of forgiveness. The interaction effects of two variables on cognitive (<italic>F</italic> = 7.620, <italic>p</italic> = .006) and emotional (<italic>F</italic> = 6.281, <italic>p</italic> = .013) forgiveness were significant. The results indicated that the respondents who were exposed to a crisis caused by external factors were more likely to forgive the organization when an informational apology was used. On the other hand, the respondents exposed to an internally caused crisis were more likely to forgive the organization when an emotion-centered message (compassion) was used. However, causal attributions and appeals had no significant interaction effects on behavioral forgiveness. Thus, <bold>H2</bold> was partially supported.</p>

<sec id="section14-1077699012455388" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion and Limitation</title>
<p>In this study, we assessed the applicability of the forgiveness concept as an outcome variable to crisis management. In addition, we investigated the relationships among message appeals, causal attributions, and forgiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077699012455388">Figure 1</xref>). The results indicated the following: First, forgiveness was indeed a useful concept in the assessment of crisis message strategies. The validity and reliability of the forgiveness construct were satisfactory, and existing crisis communication variables such as causal attributions and appeals had causal relationships with forgiveness.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1077699012455388" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Interaction Effects between Attribution and Message Appeal</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077699012455388-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Second, the results revealed that the two types of causal attributions had significant main effects on forgiveness and that all the different types of causal attributions and message appeals had interaction effects on forgiveness. Specifically, the respondents who perceived hacking as a crisis caused by an external factor were more likely to forgive the organization than those who perceived it as an internally caused crisis. Consistent with the findings of Lee, causal attributions had significant effects on the respondents’ cognitive and affective responses to the crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012455388">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, the respondents in the external condition were more likely to have positive attitudes for an information-oriented message than for a compassion-oriented message. On the other hand, the respondents in the internal condition were more likely to make a positive appraisal of the crisis when a compassion-centered message was used. This suggests the importance of selectively determining message appeals based on the public’s perception of causal attributions during a crisis.</p>
<p>However, the participants under an external attribution condition were more willing to forgive the organization than those under an internal attribution condition regardless of message appeal types. This result indicates that the extent of public forgiveness toward an organization is determined not solely by the given messages, but also by causal attributions they make about the crisis. Organizational crises can occur by both internal and external causes, and PR practitioners do not have control over the causes. However, regardless of where the cause exists, PR practitioners are responsible for developing and managing the crisis communication strategy. In particular, developing effective messages for crisis communication channels is one of the most important works for the practitioners. It is true that an internally caused crisis can be much more devastating than an externally caused one. However, even when the organization is at fault in a crisis, a PR practitioner is responsible for alleviating and minimizing the damage through strategic crisis communication. In this sense, the results of this study provide some guidelines for how one should put more or less weight on the emotional or rational appeal depending on where the causal attribution exists.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is also noteworthy that there was no significant impact of attribution and message appeal on behavioral forgiveness. Kim and Im explained that a series of psychological processes needs to take place in order for behavioral forgiveness to actually occur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012455388">50</xref></sup> Because the respondents in this study were presented the forgiveness questionnaire immediately after they have been exposed to the advertising messages, it is likely that they did not have enough time to develop behavioral forgiveness. To further explore behavioral forgiveness, we conducted an additional structural equation model analysis. We designed a sequential causal model in the order of cognitive forgiveness, affective forgiveness, and behavioral forgiveness. The results indicated that the sequential model had a satisfactory fit with the data (χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.064, GFI = .953, AGFI = .908, NFI = .973, CFI = .986). In this sense, our analysis provided support for Kim and Im’s argument that behavioral forgiveness occurs after cognitive and affective forgiveness take place. In other words, this analysis explained to some extent the reasons why attribution and message appeals had no significant impacts on the behavioral forgiveness dimension.</p>
<p>This indicates that in order to elicit behavioral forgiveness from the public, it is necessary to communicate with them repeatedly and continuously in crisis situations. The study results support the PR professionals’ argument that organizations should not think that a one-time transmission of one-way messages in crisis situations will be sufficient. In order for an organization to obtain behavioral forgiveness from the public, it should first have genuine willingness to take the responsibility for the crisis at hand, and the apologetic communication should be implemented continuously and consistently through various channels to show such willingness.</p>
<p>However, this study has some limitations. First, because a random sample is difficult to obtain, we employed a convenience sample, and, thus, the generalizability of the findings to the entire population of Korea or to groups in other countries is limited. In this regard, future research should consider a wider range of samples to validate the results of this study. Furthermore, we focused on one type of crisis (a leak of personal information on the Internet) and one type of organization (a private for-profit firm), and, thus, future research should examine crisis message strategies by considering a wider range of crises and organizations. In this study, we used a forgiveness construct designed specifically for the Korean population, and, thus, cross-cultural replication studies should develop more generalizable constructs. In addition, as organization–public relationships are reported as main factors affecting the outcomes of organizational crises in recent studies, future research should further investigate the impact of organization–public relationships on forgiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012455388">51</xref></sup></p>
