<p><italic>Raising the Stakes</italic> explores the field of competitive computer gaming dubbed “e-sports.” Beyond examining the more immediate aspects of gaming, the book considers notions of professional identity among gamers, efforts to shape and build this budding industry, the spectacle of competition, and how it produces audiences. In particular, T.L. Taylor considers the activity surrounding e-sports in South Korea, both at the government and industry levels and in relation to South Korea’s famed PC bangs (venues for networked gaming) and individual South Korean gamers. This regional focal point is apt, given the gravitational pull South Korea exerts on the world of competitive gaming or as Taylor puts it, its position as “a powerful, at times nearly mythical, waypoint for e-sports internationally” (p. 161). She examines at length the activities of South Korea’s KeSPA (the Korea E-Sports Association), a governmental agency that promotes gaming with an interest in building the high-tech sector and as an officially-condoned leisure activity for teens.</p>
<p>However, <italic>Raising the Stakes</italic> does not confine the study of e-sports to any one nation-state, but attempts to capture something of its global span in a grounded way through online observations and through a series of offline events including both minor and international tournaments. This presents, of course, a considerable challenge to the practices of the ethnographer. Taylor is, however, the right scholar for the task, one who has been thinking creatively and expansively about the challenges of situating fieldwork for some time now. In other writing, she has addressed the questions of method directly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Taylor 1999</xref>). Her first book <italic>Play Between Worlds</italic> entailed some component of virtual ethnography and her own participant-observation work in EverQuest, a networked gaming environment where she was a dedicated player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491549">Taylor 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This time around, Taylor’s ethnography of e-sports is pursued largely offline, at events and venues such as the World Cyber Games 2007 where she positioned herself principally in the role of spectator. While the book revisits many earlier themes undertaken in <italic>Play Between Worlds</italic>—on embodiment and virtuality, and on gender and gamer identity in particular—it takes on a more apparent political economic framing, explores further the business side of competitive gaming, as well as how national identity is engaged and contested in international competition. This book also offers an even deeper and more satisfying development of some of these revisited themes. In particular, the section on the presence of women in the e-sports world examines multiple and alternative masculinities, specifically probing the relationship between geek masculinity and hegemonic masculinity, as well as issues of race and intersectionality.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Taylor explores the parallels between e-sports and conventional (athletic) sports. The latter is typically understood as unmediated and physically embodied athletic competitions in contrast to the mediated, presumably non-athletic and virtual game play of the former. She relentlessly picks away at such presumed distinctions and the notion that e-sports are not “real” sports. As she notes, competitive sports of all types entail mediation via clothing and athletic gear. These are the source of continual revision by leagues and oversight bodies. E-sports are no exception. Machines are standardized according to competition guidelines and professional gamers likewise bring their own gear, mouse and keyboard, calibrated and worn in, like the specialized tennis rackets preferred by the tennis pro. Another false distinction deconstructed is the notion that the algorithmic dictates of computer software serve as ultimate arbiter, trumping the need for rules or referees in e-sports.</p>
<p>Yet, at events such as the World Cyber Games Grand Final, referees are not only present, but their judgment is both required and contested. Her close examination at the level of interaction with the gaming interface and with other players throughout the game reveals the remarkable creativity of pro gamers, the strategy and discovery within the game apparent at this elite competitive level, and the psychological game involved in outsmarting competitors. This takes the account far from the caricature of “button mashing” (p. 38). Despite all the parallels with conventional sport, the nascent status of the industry and pressure from skeptical family and friends produces ambivalent heroes, gamers for whom competition remains a “for now” occupation with an uncertain long-term outlook, something often pursued on the way to more legitimate careers.</p>
<p>In drawing a parallel between e-sports and conventional athletic sports, Taylor sets up some larger points about the value of studying gaming for other issues of sociological interest. As the author argues, it is also about exploring the boundary between leisure and work and processes of professionalization, of subcultural identity and the tensions surrounding the mainstreaming of subcultural activities, and of how nationalism is activated in international competition. The analytical opportunities of this scholarship are born of the ambiguity of this new phenomenon, competitive computer games that can yield lucrative prizes and even national fame, as gamers and e-sports organizers strive for legitimacy.</p>
<p>In the ongoing scholarly concern with computer gaming and the relationship of gamers and game developers to hegemonic masculinity, Taylor adds much needed nuance. She points out that the particular variants of “geek masculinity” often entail “less heteronormative constructions of sexuality and identity” (often through complementary engagements with imaginative science fiction) that possibly make more room for queer identities and other alternate arrangements of intimacy (p. 111). At the same time, Taylor laments the self-interest and territorialism, specifically in comments from male gamers reflecting hostility toward women-only leagues as drawing away resources from the “serious” gamers. The section on gender and sexuality is also, however, where the strains of pursuing an ethnography on such a scale are more apparent. The traces of fieldwork are far less apparent and some of the points draw especially heavily from other scholarship, rather than inspired by new empirical work or the specific context of e-sports. In a few cases gamers are re-quoted from work by other games scholars. The women involved in e-sports appear to be very scarce indeed.</p>
<p>While <italic>Raising the Stakes</italic> fits neatly within the gaming studies or media studies genres, it is also an exciting and novel contribution to the growing body of work in what might be termed global technology studies. The book shows the marks of influential scholars in science and technology studies (STS) including Lucy Suchman and Bruno Latour. Like the more established approaches in STS, this book is very much about the meeting point between humans and computational devices, through rich and meaningful engagement with machines directly and with other humans through the mediation of the machine and gaming interface. However, this book operates at several levels of scale and contends with place and history in ways that more conventional STS approaches often do not. The attention is not just to the micro-mechanisms of game engagement and the formulation of an intimate gaming community, but to the political economy of gaming, ways the nation-state and national identity are engaged or subverted, and of the consequences of the global economic crisis to nascent efforts to build an e-sports industry.</p>
<p>The emerging and evolving and increasing global practices of computer gaming by professionals and amateurs alike continue to yield new possibilities for scholarship. As the author notes, gaming has been (and will likely continue to be) “an incredibly fertile area to explore” (p. 240). The study of computer gaming offers a rich space for bridging between longstanding sociological interests and the new role of digital and computational systems in human societies, in the domains of both work and play.</p>
