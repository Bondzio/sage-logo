<abstract>
<p>Reflexive and voluntary levels of processing have been studied extensively with respect to possible impairments due to alcohol intoxication. This study examined alcohol effects at the ‘automated’ level of processing essential to many complex visual processing tasks (e.g., reading, visual search) that involve ongoing modifications or reprogramming of well-practiced routines. Data from 30 participants (16 male) were collected in two counterbalanced sessions (alcohol vs. no-alcohol control; mean breath alcohol concentration = 68 mg/dL vs. 0 mg/dL). Eye movements were recorded during a double-step task where 75% of trials involved two target stimuli in rapid succession (inter-stimulus interval [ISI] = 40, 70, or 100 ms) so that they could elicit two distinct saccades or eye movements (double steps). On 25% of trials a single target appeared. Results indicated that saccade latencies were longer under alcohol. In addition, the proportion of single-step responses and the mean saccade amplitude (length) of primary saccades decreased significantly with increasing ISI. The key novel finding, however, was that the reprogramming time needed to cancel the first saccade and adjust saccade amplitude was extended significantly by alcohol. The additional time made available by prolonged latencies due to alcohol was not utilized by the saccade programming system to decrease the number of two-step responses. These results represent the first demonstration of specific alcohol-induced programming deficits at the automated level of oculomotor processing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Investigation of how acute alcohol consumption affects human behavior has a long and venerable history, and much of the research in this domain has focused on psychomotor processes that apparently play an integral role in alcohol-induced impairment of critical everyday tasks like driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111400645">Moskowitz and Fiorentino, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111400645">Moskowitz et al., 2000</xref>). Yet, it is only recently that significant attention has been paid to the use of basic oculomotor paradigms and eye tracking measures in an attempt to pinpoint the information processing mechanisms on which performance of such tasks depends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111400645">Abroms et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111400645">Fillmore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One benefit of using such finer-grained methodologies and analyses is that basic oculomotor paradigms can yield rich data sets that go well beyond those that emanate from reliance on measures like reaction time and error rate, typical in many assessments of cognitive and psychomotor performance. A second and critically important advantage of basic oculomotor tasks is that they can be chosen to reflect specific <italic>levels</italic> of visual processing and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111400645">Leigh and Kennard, 2004</xref>). In this connection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111400645">Findlay and Walker (1999)</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111400645">Findlay and Gilchrist, 2003</xref>)) have outlined an empirically based theoretical framework that details the hierarchical organization of processing levels in oculomotor performance and links it to underlying mechanisms and neural substrates that control each level. Two parallel pathways, one responsible for temporal aspects (when), the second responsible for spatial aspects (where) of the eye movement, are hierarchically organized across distinct processing levels, ranging from <italic>automatic</italic> to <italic>automated</italic> to <italic>voluntary</italic>. Input from all levels can influence when and where to make the next saccade, either by modifying output from the next lower level or by directly sending information to a fixate and/or move center (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111400645">Findlay and Walker, 1999</xref>, for details on related empirical research and the underlying neural circuitry). Before focusing on the largely neglected automated level, alcohol-related effects on the better researched automatic and voluntary levels are briefly reviewed.</p>
<p>On the <italic>automatic</italic> level, functioning is considered to be largely independent of previous experience (learning) and intentions. Investigations of alcohol’s effects on this level of processing have relied primarily on examination of performance on the ‘pro-saccade’ task in which a simple saccade is executed to a target stimulus that appears in the visual periphery. Results have reliably indicated that alcohol increases saccade latency and sometimes reduces velocity, but has no appreciable effect on accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111400645">Baloh et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111400645">Blekher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111400645">Gale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111400645">Jantti et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111400645">Lehtinen et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111400645">Lockemann and Westhofen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111400645">Moser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111400645">Wegner and Fahle, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the <italic>voluntary</italic> level represents the highest processing level of oculomotor control. It incorporates the ability to make conscious decisions about where to direct the eyes in a given situation. Here, effects of alcohol have been explored using the ‘anti-saccade’ task, in which participants are asked to try to suppress an automatic saccade toward a stimulus appearing in the visual periphery and to execute an eye movement in the <italic>opposite</italic> direction instead. A number of studies have found alcohol to have effects on temporal and spatial saccade parameters in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111400645">Blekher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111400645">Crevits et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111400645">Khan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111400645">Vassallo and Abel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting not only that alcohol increased saccade latency and decreased velocity, but also that it modified normal saccade amplitude (the distance between mean fixation positions on successive saccades). Other studies on this processing level used the countermanding or stop-signal task in which the prepotent response (i.e., saccade toward the site of the onset of a peripheral target) has to be cancelled whenever a stop signal is presented. Results suggest that moderate doses of alcohol impaired the ability to inhibit such a prepotent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111400645">Abroms et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111400645">de Wit et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111400645">Fillmore and Vogel-Sprott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111400645">Marczinski and Fillmore, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111400645">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111400645">Mulvihill et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, most investigations of alcohol’s effects using visual performance tasks have focused on these extremes of automatic and/or voluntary processing, while neglecting the intermediate <italic>automated</italic> level of processing, despite its prevalence and importance.</p>
<p>In contrast to the largely reflexive nature of automatic processing, the <italic>automated</italic> level of processing involves actions that are influenced by implicit learning and memory, but are not quite voluntary or even conscious. Such automated processing actually comes into play very frequently, whenever well-learned routines are used to address specific stimuli, contexts, or task demands. Prime examples are the characteristic saccade patterns (scan paths) evident in reading and visual search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111400645">Radach et al., 2008</xref>). This modulation is clearly not achieved by consciously adjusting every aspect of eye movement behavior, which would be highly inefficient. Rather, it represents the implementation of an adaptive top-down intervention at an ‘automated’ level of processing. Similarly, scan paths in visual search are influenced by implicitly learned contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111400645">Manginelli and Pollmann, 2009</xref>). Across all domains, eye movement control is developed via implicit oculomotor learning, resulting in automated routines designed to serve the needs of ongoing visual and cognitive processing. Instances of this automated control are evident in the adaptive programming of sequences of saccades that occur almost constantly in everyday life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111400645">Reilly and Radach, 2006</xref>, for a model in which automated visual routines and cognitive processing co-determine observable eye movements in reading).</p>
<p>The present study sought to remedy the neglect of this intermediate processing level, though we recognize some of the reasons for it. After all, automatic responding represents the most basic level of behavior that might be affected by alcohol, so it is perhaps logical that investigations would begin there. Likewise, concern about alcohol’s effects on conscious and deliberate processing is understandable, given the fact that an obvious feature of human functioning compromised by alcohol intoxication is the ability to voluntarily generate and execute adaptive responses to complex environmental demands. Yet, this does not justify a lack of concern for how alcohol affects automated processing, which is a critical component of processing and action in many routine tasks fundamental to everyday life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111400645">Liversedge and Findlay (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111400645">Radach and Kennedy (2004)</xref> for recent overviews). Only very few alcohol-related studies can be even loosely related to automated control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111400645">Watten and Lie (1997)</xref> studied effects of alcohol on some indices of oculomotor behavior in reading, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111400645">Crowdy and Marple-Howard (2004)</xref> focused on cerebellar functioning in a gross motor behavior task. Unfortunately, neither study allows a fine-grained analysis of impairments specifically related to the automated level. Clearly, a direct and more precise analysis of alcohol-related impacts on the automated level is warranted.</p>
<p>The present study sought to address this need by using the ‘double-step’ paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111400645">Becker and Jürgens, 1979</xref>), which not only permits evaluation of alcohol’s effects on sequential eye movements, but also allows targeting of a core mechanism that underlies it, namely ‘saccade programming.’ With the double-step paradigm the ability to adaptively adjust eye movement behavior on the grounds of new visual information can be tested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269881111400645">1</xref></sup> A trial starts with a fixation point in the center of a visual display. After a brief delay, an initial visual target is presented in the periphery, to the left or right of a central fixation point. On most trials, after a variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI), the initial target is replaced by a second visual target at a different location. This visual set-up gives the impression that the target in the periphery ‘jumps’ from one position to another. In our application, the second target was always displaced in the <italic>same</italic> direction as the first target presented, relative to the initial, central fixation point, constituting the simplest variant of this task. Participants were instructed to follow the peripheral target as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Different eye movement behaviors can occur in response to double-step conditions. Perhaps the most intuitive patterns are either that (a) the two peripheral stimuli may trigger two rapidly sequential saccades, with each ending in a fixation close to one of the two targets in succession, or that (b) a single saccade may ‘skip over’ the first stimulus and fixate directly on the second. However, another possible pattern is that (c) a first saccade lands at an intermediate position <italic>between</italic> the two stimuli, followed by a second saccade aimed at fixating on the second target. The double-step paradigm has been studied for more than 50 years, and over the decades experiments have reliably demonstrated that saccade amplitudes (i.e. the extent or length of the saccades) become longer as ISIs are made shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111400645">Levy-Schoen and Blanc-Garin, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881111400645">Westheimer, 1954</xref>), suggesting an adaptive mechanism.</p>
<p>A unique and particularly useful feature of the double-step paradigm in studying automated oculomotor control is the use of <italic>reprogramming time</italic> as a critical dependent measure. This measure is defined as the time between the commencement of the first saccade and the onset of the second saccade target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111400645">Becker and Jürgens, 1979</xref>). Therefore, reprogramming time depends on two factors: (1) the duration of the ISI and (2) the individual saccadic response time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111400645">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>For a fixed ISI, reprogramming time becomes longer if the saccadic response time is slow. With a longer ISI, available reprogramming time will be shorter for a given saccadic response time. In addition, faster individual saccadic response times reduce available reprogramming time, whereas slower saccadic response times lead to an increase in available reprogramming time. Thus, by using reprogramming time as a critical dependent variable, the double-step paradigm becomes a useful tool for examining the parallel programming of saccades and hence a compelling way to study adaptive behavior at the automated level. If reprogramming intervals are long, then there is an opportunity to cancel or modify the imminent saccade to the initial target and replace it with a more efficient one-step response to the final position. When reprogramming times are short, however, the result is a higher number of two-step responses because there is not enough time for the new information to influence saccade parameters. Behavioral data confirm these assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111400645">Becker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111400645">Ottes et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111400645">Becker and Jürgens (1979)</xref> observed that, within an intermediate range of reprogramming times, initial saccades tended to be of intermediate amplitude, that is, landed between the targets. Specifically, for medium reprogramming times (between 80 and 150 ms), longer initial saccades were observed and their length increased linearly with reprogramming time. In contrast, shorter reprogramming times were more likely to result in two-step responses (separate landings on each of the two targets, with the initial saccades obviously shorter than those occurring in connection with medium reprogramming time). Finally, longer reprogramming times yielded more of the long one-step saccades to the second fixation target. These relationships can be represented in an <italic>amplitude transition function</italic>, which results in an ogive-shaped curve when average saccade amplitude is plotted for different reprogramming times. This pattern captures the combination of previous findings for saccade durations and amplitudes in the double-step paradigm. It also mirrors the temporal and spatial integration of visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111400645">Becker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111400645">Deubel et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111400645">Findlay and Harris, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the current study, the reprogramming time variable is especially valuable because it allows control and elimination of the variations in time attributable to alcohol intoxication. Hence, for the first time, a direct comparison of alcohol versus no-alcohol performance <italic>within identical reprogramming time intervals</italic> can be made.</p>
<p>In the absence of any prior study of the effects of alcohol intoxication on automated performances like those in the double-step paradigm, we proposed our hypotheses somewhat tentatively, but they can be linked to relevant theory and empirical work that has used other oculomotor paradigms. For example, considering results for the effects of alcohol observed in pro-saccade and anti-saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111400645">Blekher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111400645">Gale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111400645">Moser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111400645">Wegner and Fahle, 1999</xref>), it was expected that the impact of acute alcohol intoxication on performance in the one-step trials would be seen mainly in the form of prolonged latencies, with little or no impact on saccade amplitudes. Increased saccade latency due to alcohol was also expected to be evident on double-step trials, and such an effect would yield a potential increase in the available reprogramming time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111400645">Figure 1B</xref>). This raises the interesting question of whether such an extension of available reprogramming time due to alcohol would actually be <italic>used</italic> within the spatial processing pathway of the oculomotor control system. If so, a higher percentage of one-step responses would be expected in the alcohol condition. However, if the additional reprogramming time could not be utilized, the percentage of one-step responses would not differ across beverage conditions. Further, if alcohol intoxication impairs abilities related to spatial recoding of saccade targets, as suggested by results from studies using anti-saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>), the percentage of one-step responses under alcohol should be lower than under no-alcohol and should be largely independent of available reprogramming time.</p>
<p>The research questions and hypotheses discussed thus far rely on analysis of double-step trials for different manipulations of ISI. However, as discussed above, the analysis by reprogramming time can yield even more interesting results. By incorporating this variable, we expected to find effects of alcohol on the percentage of one-step responses or, more specifically, fewer one-step responses under alcohol than no-alcohol when reprogramming time was the same for both beverage conditions. In essence, it was predicted that acute alcohol intoxication would result in significant deficiencies in the participants’ ability to make adaptive cancellations and reprogram saccades on the basis of new visual information.</p>
<p>In sum, the present study used the double-step paradigm as a tool to examine alcohol’s effect on performances that involve adaptive programming of sequential eye movements, a core element of effective oculomotor behavior. As such, it represented the first effort to examine the specific impact of acute alcohol intoxication on automated processing and oculomotor control. Accordingly, this work has the potential to provide novel insights that can contribute to a deeper and more complete understanding of how acute alcohol intoxication affects the brain and human performance.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>The present study used a within-subject repeated-measures design. Each participant was tested in two sessions, an alcohol session and a no-alcohol control session (see below for rationale behind choice of a no-alcohol vs. placebo control). The order of these sessions was counterbalanced across participants, who were randomly assigned, within gender, to one or the other order. For each participant, sessions were scheduled at the same time of day and at least 2 days, but not more than 7 days, apart.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881111400645">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants (<italic>N</italic> = 34; 16 men) were of legal US drinking age (21+) and had recent experience with alcohol doses comparable to those administered in this study. To ensure eligibility, age was verified via official, government-issued picture identification. In addition, participants were administered a Drinking Behavior Survey, a Medical Screening Questionnaire, and the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111400645">Selzer et al., 1975</xref>)). Grounds for exclusion were reports of an average of more than five drinks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269881111400645">2</xref></sup> per day for men (or more than four for women), any medical condition that might contraindicate alcohol consumption, or a score of &gt;3 on the SMAST. Female participants also had to have a negative result on a urine sample pregnancy test (Quick Vue One-Step hCG: Quidel, San Diego, CA). To avoid inclusion of ‘outliers’ in terms of alcohol metabolism, participants’ body mass had to be within two standard deviations of norms for height and sex.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol for at least 24 h and from all other drugs for at least 72 h prior to each session. To minimize craving and other potential nicotine-related effects, the study protocol allowed smokers to have a cigarette immediately prior to the drinking phase and encouraged use of the same pattern of smoking on both testing days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269881111400645">3</xref></sup> In addition, all participants were told to have a light lunch, but afterward to abstain from all food and beverages (except water) for at least 4 h prior to arrival for their appointments, which were always scheduled to occur in the late afternoon or early evening. Further, beyond the usual conditions of consent, all prospective participants had to agree to remain at the experimental site until their measured breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) was at or below 20 mg/dL, that is, in a range legally defined as safe and identified as such in the National Council on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommended ‘Guidelines on Ethyl Alcohol Administration in Human Experimentation’ (2005). Finally, all participants had to make a commitment to comply with prescribed arrangements for transportation or escort. These latter requirements represent conservative safeguards designed to ensure that no one would drive home or walk home alone, even with only negligible BrAC. Participants received credit toward a course research participation requirement, a payment of $5 per hour, or a prorated combination of the two. All procedures for the study were approved by the Florida State University Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>Of the 34 persons (16 male) scheduled for participation in the experiment after screening, three failed to return for the second session, and the data set from one additional participant had to be discarded because she did not reach a sufficiently high peak breath alcohol level (i.e., obtained peak BrAC was &lt;40 mg/dL, despite use of well-established dosing procedures). This resulted in usable data sets for 30 participants (16 male) that were used in all analyses. Mean age of these participants was 24.1 years (range 21–31 years). Their self-reported drinking behavior for the past year indicated a mean of 1.95 (standard deviation [SD] 1.01) drinking episodes per week and a mean of 3.68 (SD 2.16) drinks per episode. Although men seemed to show a tendency toward more frequent weekly drinking (mean 2.22 episodes/week, SD 1.15) at higher levels (mean 3.97 drinks/episode, SD 2.75) than women (mean 1.64 episodes/week, SD 0.75; mean 3.36 drinks/episode, SD 1.21), gender differences were not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Beverage manipulation</title>
<p>A peak blood alcohol level of 70 mg/dL was selected as the target for the alcohol condition. This level was chosen because it is well above the minimum shown to impair performance on a wide range of complex psychomotor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111400645">Holloway, 1994</xref>) and is also just below that constituting prima facie legal evidence of alcohol intoxication for driving purposes in most US jurisdictions. In the alcohol condition session, participants received a beverage containing chilled tonic water mixed with 100-proof vodka in a 5 : 1 ratio. The amount of alcohol administered to reach target blood alcohol level was calculated for each participant based on height, weight, age, gender, and the length of the drinking period (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111400645">Curtin et al., 1998</xref>, for details of the algorithm used). The beverage was equally distributed into four containers, each of which was to be consumed by the participant in a series of consecutive 5-min periods. This 20-min drinking period was followed by a 20-min absorption period. Accurate information was given about the approximate equivalence of the total alcohol content of the beverages in terms of standard alcohol drinks. BrAC was measured before the drinking period (to ensure a zero baseline), at the end of the absorption period, and immediately prior to and immediately following the oculomotor testing, using an Alco-Sensor® IV (Intoximeters Inc., St Louis, MO).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269881111400645">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In no-alcohol sessions, each participant received the same total beverage volume that he or she would have needed to reach the target BrAC in the alcohol session, but it consisted of tonic water only. Accurate information about beverage content was given in both conditions. The decision to use a simple no-alcohol control rather than a placebo control condition in this experiment was made for several reasons. First, it was efficient for an initial study to implement the simplest possible design that still included the critical beverage contrast. Second, it is widely acknowledged among alcohol researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111400645">Martin and Sayette, 1993</xref>, for a review) that, at least when using oral administrations of alcohol and particularly when doses yield BrACs above 40 mg/dL (as they did here), it is quite difficult to achieve even nearly equivalent levels of either alcohol expectancy or subjective intoxication across alcohol and placebo conditions, thereby rendering suspect any inferences that might be drawn from alcohol/placebo comparisons. Third, there is some evidence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111400645">Testa et al., 2006</xref>, for a review) that placebo participants might ‘try harder’ than no-alcohol participants in the hope of compensating for anticipated (but nonexistent) alcohol impairment and hence have the potential to produce performances that are superior to those obtained in simple no-alcohol conditions due to the extra effort. We wanted to avoid this. Of course, future research might do well to include both placebo and no-alcohol control conditions, but that seemed premature until simple effects were documented.</p>

<title>Eye movement recording</title>
<p>Eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink2 head-mounted, video-based pupil tracking system (SR Research Ltd., Ottawa, Canada; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eyelinkinfo.com">www.eyelinkinfo.com</ext-link>), sampling at 500 Hz. The system has a relative spatial resolution in the order of a few minutes of arc and its absolute accuracy exceeds 0.33° with proper calibration.</p>
<p>Viewing was binocular, but eye movements were recorded from the right eye only. Participants were seated in a comfortable chair with a viewing distance of 82 cm in front of a nominal 22 in CRT monitor. The monitor was run with a resolution of 1024*768 at a refresh rate of 160 Hz. To ensure measurement accuracy, calibration trials with three horizontal targets were performed before each block of trials. Mean average position error in an accuracy validation routine was not to exceed 0.33° and routinely produced values of around 0.10°. In addition, experimenters continuously visually checked fixation accuracy on the central fixation point. The online saccade detector of the eye tracking system was set to detect saccades with an amplitude of 0.15° or greater, using an acceleration threshold of 8000°/s<sup>2</sup> and a velocity threshold of 30°/sec.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881111400645">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After consent and eligibility screening, participants were seated in front of a monitor and the eye tracking equipment was set up for training. In this phase the experimenter checked that participants’ eyes could be tracked accurately and asked participants to remove any make-up that might interfere with the eye tracking system. The training consisted of two elements. First, the double-step task was explained to participants, using stimulus presentations and timing that were manually controlled by the experimenter. Then, the calibration routine of the eye tracker was introduced and 20 double-step practice trials were presented in real time. Following training, participants were weighed to determine the amount of beverage to be administered, and either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages were prepared according to condition assignment. Apart from the type of beverage administered, sessions one and two were identical. During the drinking and absorption periods, participants responded to a battery of individual difference questionnaires pertaining to alcohol and other drug use, as well as some aspects of personality, emotional and behavioral attributes. These were retained for later exploratory analyses of possible moderators of the effects of primary interest and are not reported here. At the end of the absorption period, BrAC was assessed. Next, participants performed the experimental trials and BrAC was measured again at the end of the task. In the alcohol session, participants completed additional BrAC tests until two consecutive readings were below established criteria for release (&lt;20 mg/dL), at which time they were driven or escorted home. Following the second session, participants were fully debriefed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881111400645">
<title>Task procedure</title>
<p>Stimulus presentation was programmed and controlled using the ExperimentBuilder software from SR-Research. An experimental trial started with the presentation of a light gray fixation cross with a 0.5° diameter in the center of an otherwise black screen. One second after onset of the fixation cross, a light gray circle (0.3°) was presented as a peripheral target at 3° eccentricity to the left or right of the fixation cross. In 75% of the trials, this first target stimulus was replaced by a second one at 6° eccentricity. The timing of the appearance of the second target was varied quasi-randomly, using ISIs of 40, 70 and 100 ms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269881111400645">5</xref></sup> These ISIs were selected because they have been shown to produce reliable data over a wide range of reprogramming times in prior, methodologically similar studies of the long-term effects of cannabis intoxication on double-step performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111400645">Huestegge et al., 2009</xref>). The second target remained visible for 1 s. The decision to have the second target visible for this extended period of time vs. eliminating the second target after a brief presentation was reinforced by the fact that eliminating the visual target would have required participants to represent the target location endogenously, thereby adding a possibly confounding memory component to the task. After a pause of 500 ms (blank screen), the next trial began. Participants were instructed to follow the targets with their gaze as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
<p>There were a total of 240 trials divided into five blocks. Within blocks, the number of trials per ISI was balanced for double-step trials. The order of left and right presentation was randomized within blocks. Each block took approximately 2 min to complete, resulting in a total duration of about 15 to 20 min for this critical portion of the study, including calibration of the eye tracking system at the beginning of each block. This duration minimized any concerns about performance variations based on position (i.e., ascending versus descending limbs) on the blood-alcohol curve. All participants were tested during the plateau surrounding peak BrAC (see Results on beverage manipulation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881111400645">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Saccades were detected online using EyeLink software. Raw data files were converted into SPSS data matrices, using custom-built software. Trials with primary saccade latencies shorter than 60 ms or longer than 800 ms, as well as primary saccades with amplitudes &lt;1.5° and &gt;12°, were excluded from analysis. These restrictions resulted in 94.2% valid primary saccades across all trials, corresponding to a total of 13,566 primary responses. Data were analyzed separately for trials in response to a single target and those triggered by a succession of two targets. No difference was found in the number of valid responses for single (3332 valid primary saccades, 93%) and two-target trials (10,234 valid primary saccades, 94%). For all analyses, single-step responses were defined as saccades with a primary amplitude of at least 1.5° and a secondary saccade amplitude of less than 0.5°. If the primary saccade was followed by a saccade larger than 0.5°, this constituted a double-step response. These conventions have proved to be optimal in our earlier research using the double-step task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111400645">Huestegge et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reprogramming time was determined for each double-step trial by calculating the saccade latency (time between first stimulus onset and start of the saccade) and subtracting from this value the length of the ISI, resulting in the critical parameter that reflects the time span between the onset of the second target and the commencement of the first saccade. In addition to this reprogramming time, between-step latencies were calculated for trials in which two-step responses were detected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111400645">Figure 1A</xref>). These between-step latencies were defined as the time from the end of the initial saccade (to the first target) to the beginning of the secondary saccade (directed to the second target).</p>
<p>For trials in which a required single-step response was correctly executed, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed to analyze differences between alcohol conditions. Trials requiring a double-step response were analyzed in two different ways. A 3 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used first for the within-subject factors of ISI (40 vs.70 vs.100 ms) and Beverage Condition (alcohol vs. no alcohol). This analysis was used to establish basic results regarding saccade parameters and their modulation by ISIs in the two alcohol conditions. More important, a second 5 × 2 repeated ANOVA with the within-subject factors of Reprogramming Time (&lt;80 vs. 80–120 vs. 120–160 vs. 160–200 vs. &gt;200 ms) and Beverage Condition (alcohol vs. no alcohol) was performed to test hypotheses regarding the effects of alcohol intoxication on the ability to flexibly adjust saccade programming due to new visual information.</p>

<title>Beverage manipulation</title>
<p>Naturally, there was a main effect of Beverage (alcohol vs. no-alcohol) on BrAC, so this factor was not considered in analyses of the beverage manipulation. Instead, the analysis consisted of a 2 (Gender) × 3 (Time) repeated measures ANOVA for alcohol sessions only. Time was a within-subjects variable representing the points at which BrAC was assessed after drinking, namely, at the end of the absorption period (mean 67 mg/dL, SD 15, min 40, max 95) and immediately prior to (mean 69 mg/dL, SD 13, min 45, max 100), and immediately following (mean 66 mg/dL, SD 10, min 43, max 93) the experiment. The effect of Time was not significant, and BrAC while performing the double-step task was best represented by averaging results of the latter two assessments (mean 68 mg/dL). There was neither a main effect of Gender nor a Gender × Time interaction for BrAC (both <italic>F</italic> &lt;1). Possible Gender effects were also explored for all eye movement-dependent variables and these analyses yielded no significant effect. Thus, to simplify presentation, the results reported below were collapsed across gender.</p>
<p>In addition, drinking history was considered as an additional predictor variable, but the sample yielded too little variability on this factor. Consequently, it was removed from the reported analyses.</p>

<title>Analysis of single-step trials</title>
<p>Although primary saccade amplitudes were very accurate and did not differ across Beverage conditions (mean 2.96° and 3.04° for alcohol and no alcohol, respectively), saccade latencies in single-step trials were significantly longer in the alcohol than in the no-alcohol condition (mean 237 ms, SD 51 ms and mean 217 ms, SD 46 ms, respectively; <italic>t</italic><sub>(29)</sub> = −6.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Saccadic peak velocities were also slower under alcohol compared with the no-alcohol control condition (mean 175°/s, SD 36 and mean 191°/s, SD 39, respectively; <italic>t</italic><sub>(29)</sub> = 4.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This pattern, predicted from prior research, was also evident in the effects of Beverage on latency and amplitude in the double-step trials, but it was to some extent moderated by ISI (see below).</p>

<p>Primary saccade latencies on double-step trials were longer under alcohol compared with the no-alcohol condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111400645">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Regarding the between-step latencies (time between first and second saccade in case of a double-step response), there was also a significant main effect for Beverage condition (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 24.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with longer latencies under alcohol than no-alcohol (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111400645">Table 1</xref>). Note that only 26 participants contributed enough cases (&gt;10) in all conditions for this analysis. Again, the Beverage × ISI interaction reached significance (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,24)</sub> = 3.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but here the interaction emerged because the difference between Beverage conditions was smaller for 100-ms ISIs than for either 70-ms (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 4.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) or 40-ms (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 6.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) ISIs, which did not differ significantly from one another.</p>
<p>For saccade amplitude, there was a significant decrease as ISIs increased (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,28)</sub> = 85.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111400645">Table 1</xref>), but no significant main effect of Beverage on primary saccade amplitude for double-step trials. The Beverage × ISI interaction fell short of significance for primary saccade amplitude on these trials (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,28)</sub> = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.088), but the pattern of results is very similar to that found for primary saccade latencies. Specifically, there appeared to be a tendency for the Beverage influences in the 40-ms ISI condition to run counter to those observed in the 70 and 100-ms ISI conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, peak velocities were found to be significantly lower under alcohol compared with the no-alcohol condition (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,29)</sub> = 15.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and also affected by ISI (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,29)</sub> = 53.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas the Beverage × ISI interaction was not significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10). The effect of ISI is not surprising given the shorter saccade amplitudes with longer ISI, which should result in slower peak velocities.</p>
<p>The proportion of one-step responses decreased with increasing ISI, as is typical in the double-step paradigm (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111400645">Table 1</xref>). Statistically, this was reflected in a significant main effect for ISI (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,28)</sub> = 67.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Although there was no main effect of Beverage on proportion of one-step responses, the ISI × Beverage interaction reached significance (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,28)</sub> = 4.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). None of the post-hoc comparisons of the alcohol conditions for the three ISIs was significant. However, an analysis of the contrasts for differences between alcohol and no-alcohol conditions revealed significant differences between the 40-ms ISI and both longer ISIs (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,29)</sub> = 7.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,29)</sub> = 5.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but no difference between 70 ms and 100 ms (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,29)</sub> = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10). Apparently, the ISI × Beverage interaction was attributable to the slightly smaller proportion of one-step responses on the 40-ms ISI under alcohol, whereas the proportion was larger for alcohol in the other two ISI conditions. These results for the percentage of one-step responses seemed to parallel those for primary saccade amplitudes noted above.</p>

<title>Analysis of double-step trials by reprogramming time</title>
<p>In considering the amplitude transition function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111400645">Figure 2</xref>, upper panel), the expected relationship between reprogramming time and saccade amplitude was evident in that amplitudes became significantly longer as Reprogramming time increased in both Beverage conditions (<italic>F</italic><sub>(4,24)</sub> = 427.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, there was a main effect of Beverage condition, such that saccade amplitudes were shorter in the alcohol condition than in the no-alcohol condition (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> = 12.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The Reprogramming time × Beverage condition interaction was also significant (<italic>F</italic><sub>(4,24)</sub> = 4.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This interaction derived from the fact that differences between Beverage conditions were significantly different only for two medium-duration reprogramming time intervals (80–120 ms: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> = 10.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 120–160 ms: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> = 16.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and borderline significant for the third medium-duration interval (160–200 ms: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> = 3.90, <italic>p</italic> = 0.058), whereas there were no differences between alcohol and no-alcohol conditions (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10), for either the shortest or longest reprogramming times.</p>

<p>With respect to the specific influence of alcohol on the percentage of one-step responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881111400645">Figure 2</xref>, lower panel), analyses revealed significant main effects for Beverage condition (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,27)</sub> = 28.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and Reprogramming time (<italic>F</italic><sub>(4,24)</sub> = 331.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The percentage of one-step responses was smaller for the alcohol than the no-alcohol condition and larger for longer available reprogramming times than for shorter ones. In addition, the interaction between these two factors also reached significance (<italic>F</italic><sub>(4,24)</sub> = 8.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This Beverage × Reprogramming interaction appeared to arise mainly from the fact that there was no Beverage effect on the relation between reprogramming time and relative frequency of one-step responses for short reprogramming times. Indeed, in comparisons across Beverage conditions, differences were significant for the shortest versus all other Reprogramming times (&lt;80 vs. 80–120: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 9.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; &lt;80 vs. 120–160: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 19.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; &lt;80 vs. 160–200: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 8.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; &lt;80 vs. &gt;200: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,25)</sub> = 8.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas none of the Reprogramming times &gt;80 ms differed from one another (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.10) in terms of the magnitude of Beverage effect on relative frequency of one-step responses.</p>
<p>Saccadic peak velocities were found to be ∼20°/s slower under alcohol across all reprogramming time intervals. More detail regarding peak velocity analyses can be found in the supplementary material.</p>

This work was partly motivated by the observation that, despite the fact that a great deal of critical information processing in real world settings takes place at this level, previous studies of alcohol and cognitive control have tended to focus either on highly automatic, almost reflexive, responses or on complex deliberate responses that involve a high level of voluntary control. Single-step trials in the current experiment reflected the former type of processing at the automatic level and hence provided a reference point from which to make comparisons with prior alcohol-challenge studies that have mainly used the pro-saccade paradigm. Our results for the single-step trials did indeed show longer saccade latencies under alcohol, but no Beverage effects on saccade amplitude, a pattern that replicated earlier findings for automatic processing in pro-saccade studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111400645">Baloh et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111400645">Blekher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111400645">Gale et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111400645">Jantti et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111400645">Lehtinen et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111400645">Moser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111400645">Vassallo and Abel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881111400645">Wegner and Fahle, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Before discussing the results for double-step trials, it should be noted that the decision to cancel a saccade directed towards a location where the target is no longer perceived and reprogram it to the new target location instead should not be construed as an incorrect response. Rather, it reflects adaptive behavior on the automated processing level. A number of basic findings associated with this classic paradigm when applied in studies of sober individuals were replicated in the present study. For example, the proportions of single-step responses to the second target, as well as the amplitudes of primary saccades, decreased with increasing ISIs. Interestingly, although some small Beverage × ISI interactions emerged for saccade amplitude, at no point were the differences between no-alcohol and alcohol conditions found to be significant. This was also true for the proportions of one-step saccades that accurately landed on the second target. However, alcohol intoxication did significantly influence saccade latencies. Not only were the latencies for primary saccades longer in the alcohol condition, but so were the latencies for between-step responses, demonstrating a general slowing effect of alcohol on saccade preparation. Taken as a whole, this pattern indicated that the additional time resulting from prolonged latencies due to alcohol could not be utilized by the saccade programming system to decrease the number of two-step responses. In contrast, the proportion of one-step responses did not differ across Beverage conditions, suggesting that the underlying processes involved in the reprogramming of saccades did not seem to be impaired by alcohol intoxication.</p>
<p>Specific alcohol-induced impairments in automated processing became more readily apparent when the saccade amplitudes and the proportions of single-step responses for different reprogramming time intervals were considered.</p>
<p>For saccade amplitudes the expected Reprogramming time effect was evident in the amplitude transition function, which reflected participants’ overall tendency to adjust saccade amplitudes gradually so that longer reprogramming times led to increases in amplitudes. However, this main effect of Reprogramming time was significantly moderated by Beverage condition in such a way that the alcohol versus no-alcohol difference was more pronounced for medium reprogramming time intervals in the range of 80 to 200 ms than at either extreme of reprogramming time. This finding makes sense when one considers that, for very short reprogramming times, adjustments to amplitudes cannot be implemented even in the no-alcohol condition and hence primary saccades usually land on the first target. At the other extreme, when reprogramming times are substantially longer, there is apparently sufficient opportunity to allow even those in the alcohol condition to correct saccade amplitudes and direct the eyes to the second target. Accordingly, it was only in the medium range of reprogramming times that the deleterious consequences of alcohol were evident, having the effect of decreasing saccade amplitudes.</p>
<p>Reliable differences in the proportion of one-step responses for alcohol versus no-alcohol conditions emerged for reprogramming times greater than 80 ms. Although the proportion of one-step responses showed the typical pattern of more one-step responses for longer reprogramming times in both Beverage conditions, the curve for the alcohol condition was shifted to the right relative to the curve for the no-alcohol condition. In other words, it was clear that, when intoxicated, participants needed more reprogramming time to achieve the same proportion of one-step responses as they were able to execute when sober.</p>
<p>In this connection, it is noteworthy that the reprogramming times necessary to modulate saccade amplitude and to modify the target location (i.e., to program a one-step rather than a two-step response) differed. The amplitude transition function of the raw data showed that amplitudes were modulated at reprogramming times as short as 60 ms and a plateau was reached at reprogramming times on the order of 150 ms. The constricted range of this parameter represents a relatively tight frame for the timing, the extraction of information during saccades, and the cancellation or reprogramming, but it conforms to one that has been established previously by other researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111400645">Deubel et al., 2000</xref>, for a discussion). The minimum reprogramming time necessary to perform a one-step instead of a two-step response was approximately 100 ms, which was considerably longer than the reprogramming time necessary to influence saccade amplitude. This finding suggests that saccade amplitude could be modulated independently of the decision to execute a one-step or two-step response. Thus, although alcohol intoxication appeared to influence both of these processes, as discussed above, it was only for the proportion of one-step responses that the effect of alcohol was evident even for long reprogramming times (200 ms or more), indicating that additional time did not enable participants to compensate for the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>With respect to the underlying neurophysiological substrate, the current results suggest specific impairments on cortical and subcortical structures that are involved in the generation of eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111400645">Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 2002</xref>). These structures include the frontal eye fields (FEF), the supplementary eye fields (SEF), the parietal eye fields (PEF), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the superior colliculus (SC), the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP), and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111400645">Leigh and Kennard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111400645">Scudder et al., 2002</xref>, for details).</p>
<p>Obviously, our first attempt to locate alcohol-specific impairments in the saccade generating system during automated processing cannot reveal the complete picture of alcohol-related effects on all these structures. However, some interesting inferences about underlying processes can be drawn. Our finding that saccade amplitudes per se were not affected by alcohol indicates that cerebellar functioning is intact. This notion is corroborated by the fact that saccade amplitudes under alcohol were not more variable compared with the no-alcohol condition, a finding also reported for pro and anti-saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111400645">Vorstius et al., 2008</xref>). Results of prolonged saccade latencies point towards the FEF as a locus of ethanol-related effects. Additional analyses also revealed slower peak velocities of saccades under alcohol, suggesting an involvement of motoneurons or the premotor substrate (premotor burst neurons for horizontal saccades in the paramedian pontine reticular formation [PPRF], and/or omnipause neurons in the pontine nucleus raphe interpositus). The present study offers a good starting point for a better understanding of alcohol-related effects on the automated processing level, but clearly more experimental research with a broader variety of paradigms is warranted to tease apart the exact effects of alcohol on the underlying neurophysiological substrate.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results reported here indicate that acute alcohol intoxication <italic>selectively</italic> impaired the automated process of adaptive cancellation and reprogramming of saccades on the basis of new visual information. Specification of such effects represents a contribution that advances the scientific analysis of how alcohol impacts oculomotor control beyond the simple observation of a slowing of single saccade latencies in the absence of any substantial effect on saccade amplitudes. Moreover, as the first experimental investigation of alcohol’s effects at the automated level of processing, this work serves to fill an important gap in the literature on alcohol and cognitive processing, which has heretofore been dominated by studies targeting automatic and/or voluntary levels, to the neglect of the intermediate level. By helping to fill out the picture, this effort promotes more precise mapping of alcohol-related effects across the whole range of processing.</p>
<p>In addition to focusing on identifying the affected underlying neurophysiological substrate, future research should seek to address some of the limitations of this initial experiment by investigating possible alcohol expectancy effects via the use of placebo controls and by exploring dose–response patterns as they relate to automated processing. It would also be of interest to examine the effects of chronic alcohol exposure, particularly during brain development through early adulthood, on automated as well as other levels of cognitive processing. Finally, it will be important to replicate and extend the current results by evaluating the nature and extent of alcohol’s impairment of performance on tasks, such as reading and continuous visual search, that require frequent and serial saccadic reprogramming and provide a closer link to achievement and adaptive behavior in real world contexts. The present work provides an ideal starting point for this line of research, as the double-step task can be seen as a direct analog to situations in which saccades have to be frequently reprogrammed on the basis of newly incoming information. The advantage of the research paradigm advocated in the present paper is that it allows delineation of the precise interplay between components of local control processes that underlie such complex visual–cognitive tasks.</p>
