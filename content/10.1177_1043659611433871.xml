<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose/Design:</bold> This qualitative study used focus group methodology to explore attitudes and beliefs of Hispanics regarding hypertension prevention behaviors. <bold>Method:</bold> The sample was composed of 17 participants from varied Hispanic backgrounds. The theory of planned behavior guided interview questions. <bold>Findings:</bold> Analysis indicated that participants were knowledgeable about and had a positive attitude toward preventing hypertension. However, they identified numerous barriers to preventive behaviors. Two key themes, limited resources (e.g., no time to prepare healthy meals or exercise) and cultural expectations and values (e.g., traditional food as a marker of ethnicity, hospitality, and affection; valuing social interaction over solitary exercise) summarized significant barriers to engaging in recommended preventive behaviors. <bold>Discussion/Conclusions:</bold> Findings suggest that literature about lack of knowledge about hypertension prevention in Hispanics may be outdated or not applicable to many Hispanics. Select resource and cultural barriers to engaging in hypertension prevention behaviors are important areas to target. <bold>Implications for Practice:</bold> Exercise, stress reduction, and diet modification strategies for hypertension prevention among Hispanics should be consistent with the cultural norms regarding the importance of social interactions and leisure.</p>

<body>
<p>Since 1980, the number of Hispanics in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043659611433871">1</xref></sup> has nearly tripled from a little more than 5% to 15% currently. By the year 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611433871">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>), the number of Hispanics is expected to double to 30% of the U.S. population, making Hispanics the fastest growing racial/ethnic population in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433871">Ortman &amp; Guarneri, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These demographics as well as the incidence of uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and HTN risk among Hispanics warrant learning more about their HTN-prevention beliefs. Age-adjusted prevalence rates indicate that HTN (i.e., systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg) affects 1 in 4 Hispanics in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433871">Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2005)</xref>. Although this prevalence rate is lower than the prevalence of HTN in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433871">Betancourt, Carrillo, Green, &amp; Maina, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433871">Soto-Greene, Salas-Lopez, Sanchez, &amp; Like, 2004</xref>), data from a number of studies suggest that Hispanics have a high prevalence of many of the risk factors for HTN. These risk factors include excess weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433871">Ogden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433871">Okosun, Boltri, Anochie, &amp; Chandra, 2004</xref>), poor dietary habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433871">National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2009</xref>), lack of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611433871">CDC, 2008</xref>), and a high incidence of pre-HTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433871">Hsia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433871">Ostchega, Yoon, Hughes, &amp; Louis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>More than 30% of Hispanics have pre-HTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433871">Hsia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433871">Ostchega et al., 2008</xref>). Pre-HTN (i.e., systolic BP of 120-139 mmHg or diastolic BP of 80-89 mmHg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433871">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>) is a significant problem, as it is highly predictive of the development of HTN within 5 years and cardiovascular events within 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433871">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>). Death from both ischemic heart disease and stroke “increases progressively and linearly from BP levels as low as 115 mmHg systolic and 75 mmHg diastolic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433871">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>, p. 1210). Diseases of the heart are already the leading cause of death for Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433871">NCHS, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Once Hispanics develop HTN, they have comparatively more problems with HTN awareness and control and suffer from a disproportionate degree of morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled HTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433871">Betancourt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611433871">CDC, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433871">Satish, Markides, Zhang, &amp; Goodwin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433871">Perez-Stable &amp; Salazar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433871">Soto-Greene et al., 2004</xref>). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043659611433871">2</xref></sup> describe Hispanics as significantly less likely than non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites to be aware of their condition, be treated with antihypertensive medication, take prescribed medication, and have BP control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433871">Ostchega et al., 2008</xref>). Common explanations for low rates of HTN awareness and control and high morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled HTN include Hispanics’ limited access to care because of language difficulty and lack of insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611433871">Aranda &amp; Vazquez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433871">Betancourt et al., 2004</xref>). Another explanation pertains to health beliefs: Many Hispanics believe that lifestyle changes are unimportant for control of HTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611433871">Aranda &amp; Vazquez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433871">Okonofua, Cutler, Lackland, &amp; Egan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that much of the literature about HTN in Hispanics is culled from data that are provided by limited groups of Hispanics. For example, until recently, the only group studied in the NHANES studies was Mexican Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433871">Ostchega et al., 2008</xref>). Studies about specific Hispanic subpopulations (e.g., Puerto Ricans, Central Americans) tend to be with samples that are low income or not highly educated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433871">Tucker et al., 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433871">Murguia, Peterson, &amp; Zea, 2003</xref>, for examples). This not only limits knowing about HTN awareness, control, and risk in a more diverse group of Hispanics but also restricts using the extant literature to guide studies related to Hispanics’ attitudes and beliefs about HTN prevention. Rather than using the current literature about Hispanic HTN awareness, control, and risk to extrapolate to Hispanics’ attitudes and beliefs about HTN prevention behavior, we chose to use an inductive approach to elicit relevant themes about prevention from a diverse sample of Hispanics.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043659611433871">
<title>Purpose of the Current Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the attitudes and beliefs related to the prevention and control of high BP among a diverse group of Hispanics living in Orange County, central Florida. The problem of HTN in Hispanics is especially relevant for this area as almost 1 in 4 (23.5%) persons living in Orange County is Hispanic. The Hispanic population in Orange County is also diverse: 51.7 % are Puerto Rican, 30% are Central or South American, 12% are Mexican, and 7% are Cuban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433871">U.S. Census Bureau News, 2009</xref>). In addition, the socioeconomic status of Hispanics in Orange County is varied. Most of the Hispanics residing in Orange County (73%) have at least a high school education and 17% hold a college degree. A total of 19% are classified as professionals or managers, whereas 43% work in service or construction jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433871">U.S. Census Bureau News, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>A qualitative descriptive design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433871">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>) with focus group methodology was used to gain insight into the attitudes and beliefs of persons of Hispanic origins regarding HTN prevention attitudes and beliefs. The focus group interviews were guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611433871">Ajzen, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433871">2001</xref>), which focuses on attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention as predicting health behaviors, including preventive health behaviors. The study was a replication of a study of HTN prevention beliefs among African Americans, which used a similar interview guide also based on the TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433871">Peters, Aroian, &amp; Flack, 2006</xref>). Two of the researchers (RMP and KJA) for this study were also part of the African American study. Human Investigation Committee approval from the two participating universities was obtained prior to implementing the study.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Following human subjects approval, purposive, maximum variation sampling was used to recruit participants from varied Hispanic backgrounds. Recruitment was done using face-to-face verbal advertisement at a Hispanic professional organization and a food service worksite with a high percentage of Hispanic employees. Persons who self-identified as Hispanic, who were between 25 and 60 years of age, and who were residing in metropolitan Orlando, Florida were eligible. The food service site was chosen because a large number of local Hispanics are service workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433871">U.S. Census Bureau News, 2009</xref>). The professional organization site was selected to include Hispanic professionals. We intended to conduct two focus groups of men and women from each recruitment site. However, neither of the two men from the professional organization who agreed to participate attended. Because of work constraints, only five of the nine food service workers attended, but the remaining four were willing to reschedule. Thus, we conducted two additional groups, each with two food service workers participating. Since we obtained data saturation from these 17 participants, we did not recruit additional participants.</p>
<p>Participants included 8 professionals (e.g., lawyers, teachers) and 9 food service workers (e.g., cooks, dishwashers) for a total of 17 participants in four focus groups. Demographic characteristics of participants reflected a range of age, education, income, and Hispanic backgrounds (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611433871">Table 1</xref>). We did not collect exact data on years in the United States because of the difficulty calculating time spent back in the homeland during circular migrations, which are particularly common among Puerto Ricans. However, we reconstructed an approximation of time spent in the United States based on self-reports embedded in the interview data.</p>

<p>The focus groups were held in conference rooms at community sites in Orlando. The actual group session was 90 minutes. Participants received $25 gift certificates for participating. The groups were led by two (KJA and NR) of the three study coinvestigators. One focus group was conducted in English. Three focus groups were conducted in Spanish because some of the participants preferred Spanish even though they spoke English. The coinvestigator who conducted the groups in Spanish (NR) is fluent in Spanish but it is not her native language. Her fluency is from studying at a university in Colombia and from providing nursing care to Spanish-speaking patients for more than 25 years. Focus groups were audio-recorded. The focus group conducted in English was transcribed verbatim. The Spanish-language focus groups were translated by NR into English and then transcribed. A bilingual research assistant, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico and is highly familiar with local Spanish dialects through her work as a nurse with the local study population, compared the Spanish audio-recordings with the English transcripts and validated that the translations were accurate.</p>

<sec id="section6-1043659611433871">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis reflected alternating use of a priori theory-based coding with open coding. First, the three study investigators reviewed and discussed the transcripts to provide multiple perspectives based on each investigator’s areas of expertise (i.e., HTN prevention and the TPB, cultural diversity and health beliefs, and the local Hispanic community). Next, they coded the data according to the TPB by isolating data about behavioral, normative, and control beliefs. Behavioral beliefs (i.e., causes, consequences, and behaviors to prevent HTN) were easily discerned in the data. However, coding the data separately for normative and control beliefs was difficult. Participants’ perceptions of the difficulty of engaging in HTN-prevention behaviors were strongly influenced by social expectations, such that data related to subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were intertwined. Thus, the investigator with expertise in cultural diversity and health beliefs used open coding to further analyze the data. This process yielded a number of barriers (e.g., diet, exercise, certain Hispanic cultural norms), which were regrouped into more conceptual categories and subcategories at higher levels of abstraction. Categories and subcategories were examined for variation and consistency. The final construal was reviewed and validated by the third investigator and three health professionals from the local Hispanic community. Consistent with the recommendation to not use member checking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433871">Sandelowski, 1993</xref>), the three health professionals who validated the final construal did not participate in the focus groups. Rather, they read the final construal and validated that it fit their perceptions of Hispanics’ attitudes toward and beliefs about HTN prevention.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Despite variation in socioeconomic background, Hispanic heritage, and time in the United States, participants reported very similar attitudes toward and beliefs about HTN prevention behaviors. Participants used very few qualifying statements to suggest that certain attitudes and beliefs pertained only to select subpopulations of Hispanics. When qualifying statements were used to suggest group differences, they are described further below.</p>
<sec id="section8-1043659611433871">
<title>Behavioral Beliefs About Perceived Causes and Consequences of Hypertension</title>
<p>Everyone was knowledgeable about the causes and consequences of HTN and had favorable beliefs and outcome evaluations regarding the behaviors necessary for HTN prevention. Participants reported that the propensity to develop HTN could be genetic. Nonetheless, they also believed that HTN is strongly influenced by unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight from the confluence of a poor diet and lack of exercise.</p>
<p>Certain emotions, particularly feeling too “stressed out,” “excited,” “worried,” or “upset,” were also identified as causes of HTN. A common feature of these emotions was that they were “hot,” a term that connoted intense reactions. Hot emotions were specified as a Hispanic trait. Participants explained that Hispanics “are emotional” and get “worked up” easily. Hot emotions were problematic regardless of whether they were expressed or “bubbled up inside.”</p>
<p>Participants agreed that the consequences of HTN were serious, and were able to list possible consequences (e.g., stroke, kidney disease). They also believed that HTN could be prevented or controlled, even in people with a genetic predisposition. Although medication was mentioned, participants identified lifestyle modification as preferable, both for prevention and control. A participant explained, “I think some people depend too much on medication . . . more than behavioral changes to prevent it.”</p>
<p>Diet and managing stress were identified as the two most important ways to prevent HTN. A participant who identified Hispanics as “too emotional” stated, “If you could bring the emotional level down, that would help immensely.” Meditation was mentioned by a number of people as a good technique for “calming down.” Although exercise was reported as a way to control weight, participants reported that a major benefit was its effect on stress. A participant explained, “Exercise just doesn’t help your body. It’s like a spiritual therapy. It relaxes you.”</p>

<title>Normative Beliefs, Control Beliefs, and Barriers to Prevention</title>
<p>Despite knowledge about HTN prevention and consequences from uncontrolled HTN, participants reported that engaging in HTN prevention behaviors was difficult. They not only noted that individuals differ in their personal motivation and will power but also identified a common set of prevention barriers faced by most Hispanics. Only a few barriers varied due to geographical area of origin, age, or perhaps social class. Barriers to prevention can be classified into two main categories: limited resources and cultural expectations/values.</p>
<sec id="section10-1043659611433871">
<title>Limited Resources</title>
<p>Limited resources included three subcategories: <italic>health insurance</italic> for HTN screening; <italic>money</italic>, specifically not being able to afford healthy food; and the greatest limitation, <italic>time</italic> to exercise or prepare healthy meals. Each of these subcategories is described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043659611433871">
<title>Health insurance</title>
<p>“Regular physicals” were viewed as a means of HTN prevention by “catching it early before it is too late.” However, not having health insurance and having to pay for health care out of pocket was identified as problem for many Hispanics, regardless of socioeconomic status. A participant stated, “It’s in all classes and across the board, not just the impoverished.” Another participant added, “Most Hispanics don’t have health insurance because they are independent contractors or seasonal or on-call workers.” Her personal situation exemplified this generalization: “I own my business with my business partner. We have to get individual insurance and I can’t afford it.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043659611433871">
<title>Money</title>
<p>In addition to not having money for health care, participants noted that eating healthy food was more costly and identified limited finances as a barrier for some Hispanics. Participants explained, “Some people are low income and have to eat whatever they find.” and “A meal at a good restaurant would be 20 dollars. So, you end up eating at McDonald’s.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043659611433871">
<title>Time</title>
<p>Lack of time was cited as the greatest resource barrier to preventing HTN. Time constraints interfered with living a healthy lifestyle and engaging in activities to reduce stress. One participant stated, “This pace of life, you don’t have time to sit down to do anything; never mind putting down a game plan on how to be healthy.” Preparing healthy foods was particularly time consuming. A participant offered,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How am I going to fit another twenty minutes to pick up fresh food or read labels? All I can do is open a can and microwave. Just get it over with as quick as possible and get on to other worries you have to tackle.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A participant added, “You eat fast food because it is fast, even if it fills your veins with fat and causes all kinds of problems.”</p>
<p>Although time issues are not unique to Hispanics, participants attributed time constraints to their immigrant or minority status. Life in the United States was experienced as overly hectic and stressful in comparison with one’s homeland. This viewpoint was universal, regardless of socioeconomic status or whether one’s time in the United States was longstanding or relatively recent. A participant who had lived in the states since childhood explained, “I am in America. I gotta live the dream—compete, make a big salary.” A participant who was more recent to the United States explained, “The U.S. is so hurried. You have to work two jobs to get enough money. In our country, we don’t have so many bills.” Participants also described how they had to prove that they were the ideal minority. A participant stated, “I have to do it better because I am the diversity within the corporation.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043659611433871">
<title>Cultural Expectations and Values</title>
<p>The second main category of barriers to HTN prevention was <italic>cultural expectations/values</italic> and included six subcategories: traditional foods as a marker of ethnicity, hospitality, and affection; valuing social interaction over solitary exercise; trying to be the ideal Hispanic; fatalism; not seeking health care; and for some Hispanics, being overweight as normative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043659611433871">
<title>Traditionally prepared foods as a marker of ethnicity, hospitality, and affection</title>
<p>Participants who had been born or reared in the United States described Hispanic food as “a link to the past.” Similarly, people who somewhat recently (i.e., within the past 8 years) left their homelands associated eating Hispanic food with “camaraderie with your Hispanic friends.” Every participant portrayed Hispanic food as a symbol of love, affection, and hospitality, which created a social value for eating traditional food. Participants explained, “Your mom shows you she loves you by feeding. I love you, so eat this” and “I was trained that feeding is love. That this is what you do to make people happy.”</p>
<p>Hispanic food was described as generally unhealthy because it was fried, salty, and contained large portions of lard, meat, and carbohydrates. This was particularly the case for participants from Puerto Rico. Similarly, the participant from Argentina emphasized that her country is also known for large meat portions. Everyone agreed that vegetables and salads were not part of the usual diet and that seemingly healthy foods, such as rice with beans, were made with lard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a number of qualifying comments suggested that the stereotype of Hispanic food as unhealthy was not necessarily true. A participant stated, “It depends on how you make it.” Many participants reported adapting or knowing other Hispanics who adapt traditional recipes to make them healthier, but acknowledged that individuals who “cook healthy” are typically younger Hispanics. A participant explained, “My grandmother and aunts, the older generation is the last of the unhealthy Hispanics. Younger people want healthy. It’s new, this health craze.” Another participant explained, “Nowadays, the eating and being healthy trend is going a bit towards the South American countries. Friends my age [young middle-aged adults] take care of themselves.”</p>
<p>However, only traditionally prepared foods, not healthy adaptations, symbolized the positive emotions and behaviors associated with so-called Hispanic food. As a result, healthy adaptations of Hispanic foods were not an option for social occasions. Spending time with other Hispanics created fairly regular opportunities for unhealthy eating. A participant explained, “We’re never going to have a low-fat meal for a party at our house! That would be unacceptable.” Others agreed: “Whenever I make a meal in my home for guests, I make a special meal from my country—not a healthy meal, but something special we eat there”; “I cook healthy for my husband but not when guests come over”; and “Whenever people get together, we have the traditional foods.” Even U.S.-born Hispanics cooked traditional foods for social occasions to assert their ethnic identity. A participant gave her daughter as an example. She explained, “She was born here and married an American. She cooks healthy for her family but when she goes to her in-laws, she makes Cuban food the way it used to be prepared.”</p>
<p>Because traditionally prepared Hispanic food was symbolic of hospitality and affection, participants also explained that the social norm is to eat traditional foods when offered, even if the food is not healthy. Participants explained, “They show you their appreciation by giving you food. You cannot turn it down” and “People would get offended if I said I were on a diet. I may have a sick heart because of all the empanadas they make, but I don’t have the heart to say no thank you.”</p>
<p>In addition to social norms, participants also described how culture influenced personal values and intentions for eating healthy foods. The camaraderie or nostalgia created by eating traditionally prepared foods prompted unhealthy eating when feeling homesick. A participant explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If there is a restaurant serving food from my home country, I am not going to eat healthy because I miss the flavors. It’s emotional. Whatever I eat there might ruin my diet but you think, “I haven’t had that in forever so eat and enjoy!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant explained, “You think, ‘Oh, I haven’t had these in years’ so you don’t just eat one. You have another one.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043659611433871">
<title>Valuing social interaction over solitary exercise</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, exercise was valued as a means of stress reduction. However, cultural norms dictated that exercise was only acceptable if it was “in moderation” and did not interfere with spending time with family and friends. A participant stated, “Someone who exercises every day, he’s doing the right thing but he’s not being social.” Another participant added, “It’s part of the culture to have fun. If you are living your life for exercise and say, ‘Oh, I can’t go out to dinner with you because I have to go to the gym,’ that’s not acceptable.” Conversely, culturally acceptable forms of exercise included both fun and social interaction. A participant explained, “Dancing is a part of our culture. Whenever there is an event, there’s always music. We are always dancing. Working out or going to a yoga class—that is not part of our culture.”</p>
<p>The confluence of the cultural value on socializing and limited time to socialize with family and other Hispanics appeared to influence participants’ opinions about what constitutes “moderate” exercise. Participants explained, “If you do it (exercise) a lot, they’d think there was something wrong with you,” and “They will tell you, ‘You’re crazy getting up early in the morning to exercise. What is wrong with you?’ They think you should just chill.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1043659611433871">
<title>Trying to typify the ideal Hispanic</title>
<p>Cultural ideals also contributed to stress and encroached on the time for HTN prevention. This was true particularly for women. Participants explained, “Latin women wear a lot of hats.” Phrases such as “super Hispanic woman” and “thinking about others first” were stated frequently. A participant explained, “Hispanic women, we want to prove, ‘I can do it even better than you.’ . . . that extra notch, being a perfect mom, the house, the husband, work.” Another participant elaborated, “Part of my life is taken up by visiting parents. I call them every night. I don’t know that Anglo women are doing the same.” A participant added, “Being a lover and a great wife is another cultural thing. It’s another job!”</p>
<p>When asked about whether men have similar pressures, participants countered that men have physical stress from working as manual laborers whereas women have emotional stress from wearing many hats. However, this comparison was offered without much feeling. The male participants also agreed that Hispanic women juggled many roles and were perfectionists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1043659611433871">
<title>Fatalism</title>
<p>Another deterrent to HTN prevention was the belief that health outcomes are influenced by fate. A participant explained, “You can feel destined by your family history. I’m doomed so I might as well enjoy life now.” However, participants only briefly mentioned fatalism, suggesting that fatalism was not a major cultural barrier to HTN prevention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1043659611433871">
<title>Not seeking health care unless symptomatic</title>
<p>Participants also discussed not seeking health care for prevention until symptoms become severe. A participant explained, “I better be pretty darn sick before I step into a doctor’s office.” Another participant elaborated, “You don’t go to the doctor unless you are on your deathbed.” This reluctance to seek formal health care was described as being passed from generation to generation. A participant explained, “We were raised on natural remedies, not doctors.” However, similar to fatalism, they only briefly touched on the topic of not seeking health care unless symptomatic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1043659611433871">
<title>Overweight as normative</title>
<p>Another cultural norm was that being overweight is not only acceptable but may also be preferable. A participant explained, “Many Hispanics think being a little heavy is healthy. Culturally, we don’t look like little toothpicks.” Another participant elaborated, “Men like some meat on the bones. Most men don’t like skinny.”</p>
<p>Cultural norms about weight appeared to differ by geographic origin and social class. A participant stated, “Caribbean countries have different norms than South American countries. Venezuela and Colombia, for example, women are so thin. Then in the Caribbean, in Puerto Rico, women are not thin.” Another participant stated, “If you go to [area of Orlando known for its Puerto Rican population] and you ask the women who weigh 160 or 170 pounds, unless they’re really Americanized, they don’t consider themselves fat.” A participant from Ecuador concurred about geographical differences. She stated, “You see a lot of Hispanics who are overweight in this country [the U.S.]. It’s not at home. If you are a size 4 in Ecuador, you are fat.”</p>
<p>Participants also qualified that norms about weight may differ by social class within groups of people from the same homeland. For example, the Puerto Rican community referred to in the above quote is low income.</p>
<p>When being overweight was the cultural norm, family members’ opinions about weight made it challenging to control weight or follow calorie-restricted diets. A participant stated, “When I lost 120 pounds, my entire family thought I was sick and too skinny. And I was still 30 pounds overweight. But they said, ‘don’t lose any more weight.’ That was their mentality.”</p>
<p>Being overweight may also be acceptable for older Hispanics, regardless of geographic origin. A participant from South America stated, “Hispanics tend to start off very small in their teens. When they become parents and get settled, they tend to grow.” Although people tend to gain weight as they age, another participant’s comment suggested that weight gain as one grows older was more culturally acceptable in Hispanics. She added, referring to older Hispanics, “It’s okay to gain weight because we are happy and content. It’s a different mindset. Happiness is more important than concern about looking a certain way.”</p>

<sec id="section21-1043659611433871" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used the TPB to elicit the salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs regarding HTN prevention behavior in a diverse group of Hispanics. Despite having a maximum variation sample with regard to socioeconomic status, country of origin, and generation or length of time in the United States, saturation occurred quickly, with analyses revealing a great deal of consistency and consensus in the beliefs of all participants. Every participant agreed that eating healthy, reducing stress, exercising, and regular blood pressure monitoring were key preventive behaviors and endorsed many of the same barriers to engaging in these preventive behaviors.</p>
<p>Resource barriers for Hispanics in general included time and health insurance, and, for low-income Hispanics, lack of money. Universally reported cultural barriers were the significance of traditional foods, valuing social interaction over solitary exercise, typifying the ideal Hispanic, and, to a lesser extent, fatalism and not seeking health care unless symptomatic. Another cultural barrier that was operative among Hispanics from the Caribbean and perhaps among older Hispanics and those from lower social classes, was that being overweight was normative.</p>
<p>Many of our findings were consistent with the literature about life circumstances for immigrants and minorities as well as the Hispanic culture. Immigrants and minorities experience additional stressors and have limited resources that can interfere with health and health promotion behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433871">Aroian, Norris, González de Chávez Fernández, &amp; Averasturi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611433871">Escobar, Hoyos Nervi, &amp; Gara, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611433871">Smedley, Stith, &amp; Nelson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the emotional value of traditional food is not unique to Hispanics, the social norm for not refusing food may be less widespread among other groups. <italic>Personalismo</italic> and <italic>sympatia</italic>, Hispanic values about the importance of personal relationships and being agreeable and kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611433871">Antsehel, 2002</xref>), are consistent with accepting food even when it is unhealthy. Immigrant or minority status may also make traditional foods more important because traditions buttress against homesickness and assimilation. An extreme example of this function of food comes from a study whereby African Americans pejoratively labeled eating healthy food as “acting White” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433871">Peters et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The emphasis on stress and hot emotions as causes of HTN and the value of exercise for overall health and stress reduction is consistent with Hispanics’ belief in <italic>espirtism</italic>, whereby health is regarded synergistically as a continuation of mind, body, and spirit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611433871">Antsehel, 2002</xref>). Valuing leisure and happiness (e.g., concern with limited time to relax or exercise, tolerant attitudes toward weight because eating makes you happy) and achieving happiness through social interaction (e.g., valuing food as a vehicle for camaraderie, unacceptability of solitary exercise) were meta-themes common to many of our study findings. These meta-themes are also consistent with <italic>espirtism</italic>.</p>
<p>However, not all findings are consistent with the literature. Our findings challenge conclusions from existing studies that Hispanics are unaware of HTN prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433871">Ostchega et al., 2008</xref>), prefer medication to lifestyle changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433871">Okonofua, Cutler, Lackland, &amp; Egan, 2005</xref>), and are overly fatalistic about the utility of preventive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433871">Rustveld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611433871">Terán, Baezconde-Garbanati, Márquez, Castellanos, &amp; Belkić, 2007</xref>). These conclusions have come mostly from studies with Mexican Americans or Hispanics who are older or have limited education and income. Most likely, the participants in our study were knowledgeable about and interested in lifestyle as a means of HTN prevention, not because they were non-Mexican Hispanics, but because they were younger and had higher education than reported in other studies about HTN behaviors in Hispanics. Although our sample varied with regard to age and years of education, the mean age was 37.65 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.26) and everyone had a minimum of a high school education. In other words, our study findings suggest that, like health promotion knowledge and behaviors in general, HTN prevention in Hispanics is socially determined by age and socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Our study findings suggest that exercise and stress reduction programs for Hispanics should capitalize on the importance of social interaction and leisure time by building on the common interest in dancing. Public health campaigns geared toward Hispanics and diet should emphasize that modifying traditional foods to make them healthy is appropriate, not only for regular meals but also for Hispanic parties and social events.</p>
<p>Theoretical implications pertain to expanding the TPB and reconsidering the interrelationship between behavioral, normative, and control beliefs. In the TPB, normative beliefs were originally conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611433871">Ajzen (2010)</xref> as social pressures that are injunctive in nature whereby behavior is affected by the perception of what other people, typically depicted as individuals close to you, want you to do. Our data suggest that subjective norms are formed not only based on expectations of important others but, also arise from broader cultural considerations. The idea of culture as an expansion of subjective norm is consistent with the work done with African Americans related to HTN-prevention behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433871">Peters et al., 2006</xref>) and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611433871">Manning’s (2009)</xref> expansion of subjective norms as descriptive or based on the observed or inferred behavior of others. Our data also suggest the importance of personal motivation that arises from an internalization of cultural norms whereby pressure is not only social but also personal. Personal valuing of one’s cultural heritage, regardless of the presence of others, was found to also affect intention to engage in various behaviors.</p>
<p>The original TPB views attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control as conceptually independent predictors of intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611433871">Ajzen, 2010</xref>). Within our study, social norms arising from cultural expectations and values created normative beliefs, but functioned as control beliefs. Cultural pressures affected participants’ perception of their ability to actually engage in certain behaviors, and as such limited their sense of perceived behavioral control.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study pertains to the difficulty we had recruiting men. However, few gender differences were reported and we validated whether the few men participating in the study agreed with women’s reports of how gender influenced their attitudes and beliefs about HTN prevention. Another limitation is that our study design did not permit examining the extent to which attitudes and beliefs about weight and diet differed for certain subpopulations of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Based on results from our study, we conclude that younger and more highly educated Hispanics are likely to be more knowledgeable and open to lifestyle changes as means of HTN prevention and control than their older and less educated counterparts. This conclusion is consistent with participant reports about age and social class differences in Hispanics’ beliefs about weight and propensity for eating a healthier everyday diet by modifying traditional foods. Although we strongly recommend assessing cultural norms when prescribing lifestyle interventions, developing screening and educational intervention programs, and planning research that targets Hispanics, we caution against using our study findings to stereotype Hispanics. As with any study that seeks to generate common cultural attitudes and beliefs, findings from this study should be used for sensitization about issues that are potentially relevant for Hispanics. The dynamic and variable nature of culture and the number of variables that affect how individuals respond to cultural norms means that the HTN prevention attitudes and beliefs we have identified are not invariant or universal truths.</p>
