<abstract>
<p>Type D personality (the combination of negative affect and social inhibition) is associated with poor prognosis in cardiac patients. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between Type D and health-related behaviours. In a cross-sectional study, 200 healthy participants completed measures of Type D personality, and health-related behaviours. The results showed that Type D individuals engaged in more unhealthy behaviours including smoking, poor diet and lack of physical activity than non-Type D individuals. The association between Type D personality and maladaptive health behaviours may represent one mechanism to explain the link between Type D and ill-health.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type D is a personality construct that is used to describe individuals that experience high levels of negative affect along with high levels of social inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311423117">Denollet et al, 1996</xref>). Research has examined the effect of Type D on patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), and has indicated that Type D individuals have a poorer clinical prognosis than non-Type D individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311423117">Denollet at al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Type D has been identified as an important predictor of poor health outcomes in CVD patients, including mortality, cardiac events, and health status. Several studies have demonstrated that Type D is associated with a four-fold increased risk of mortality in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, independent of traditional biomedical risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311423117">Denollet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311423117">Denollet et al., 2006</xref>). More recent studies have also demonstrated a similar relationship between Type D and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311423117">Schiffer et al., 2010</xref>), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311423117">Aquarius et al., 2009</xref>). Research has also found that Type D is also associated with poor health status (including symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lower quality of life) in various cardiovascular disease patient groups (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311423117">Al-Ruzzeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311423117">Schiffer et al., 2008</xref>). Similar findings have also been reported in non-cardiovascular patients, and healthy participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311423117">Mols &amp; Denollet, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311423117">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>The growing body of evidence linking Type D to ill-health has led to research which has sought to uncover the mechanisms which may explain the link between Type D and ill-health. To-date research has largely concentrated on uncovering potential psychophysiological and behavioural mechanisms. With regards to potential biological mechanisms, several studies have shown a link between Type D and cardiovascular reactivity to stress in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311423117">Habra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311423117">Williams, O’Carroll &amp; O’Connor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311423117">Howard, Hughes &amp; James, 2011</xref>). For example, in one study Type D males were found to exhibit greater cardiac output during an experimental stressor, compared to non-Type D individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311423117">Williams, O’Carroll &amp; O’Connor, 2009</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311423117">Howard, Hughes &amp; James (2011)</xref> demonstrated that healthy Type D females showed a weak myocardial response to an experimental stressor which the authors believed to indicate that Type D’s showed hemodynamic maladaptation to stress, again suggesting that cardiovascular reactivity is a possible mechanism by which Type D may affect health. However, in a further study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311423117">Nyklicek, Vorselaars &amp; Denollet (2011)</xref> did not find any association between Type D and cardiovascular function measured during a 24 hour period using ambulatory cardiovascular monitors, suggesting that Type D may only be associated with cardiovascular function during periods of stress. Studies have also found a link between Type D and immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311423117">Denollet, Vrints, &amp; Conraads, 2008</xref>), and hyperreactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311423117">Molloy, Perkins-Porras, Strike, &amp; Steptoe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311423117">Whitehead, Perkins-Porras, Strike, Magid, &amp; Steptoe, 2007</xref>) among patients with acute coronary syndromes.</p>
<p>Research has also investigated whether behavioural mechanisms may also help to explain the link between Type D and poor clinical prognosis. For example, if Type D individuals engage in poor health-related behaviours, such as smoking and eating an unhealthy diet, this could explain why Type D’s have poorer outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423117">Williams et al. (2008)</xref> investigated the association between Type D and health-related behaviours in a large healthy sample and found that Type D individuals engaged in fewer health behaviours like eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise, and were less likely to get regular medical checkups than non-Type D individuals. However, the study relied of a fairly short measure of health-related behaviour, consisting of only eight items. A more recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311423117">Mommersteeg, Kupper &amp; Denollet (2010)</xref> investigated the association between Type D, self-reported metabolic syndrome, and health behaviours (including smoking, alcohol use, exercise and dietary habits) in a large healthy community sample in the Netherlands. They found that Type D was associated with metabolic syndrome and less healthy behaviours. Specifically, Type D individuals adhered less to the Dutch standards for physical activity, had a less varied diet, and were less likely to restrict their fat intake compared to non-Type D individuals. However, no differences were found between Type D and non-Type D individuals in their smoking behaviour, and Type D’s were found to be less likely to consume alcohol.</p>
<p>Further studies have focussed on the relationship between Type D and specific health behaviours. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311423117">Borkoles, Polman &amp; Levy (2010)</xref> assessed Type D and exercise prevalence among men in relation to body image. Exercise participation was assessed using three categories of physical activity; sedentary, active and weight training. The results indicated that a higher number of Type D individuals were found in the sedentary group (45%) than in the active (14.2%) or weight training (24.5%) groups. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423117">Williams et al. (2011a</xref>) demonstrated in a sample of post myocardial infarction (MI) patients that Type D individuals were less likely to adhere to their medication, compared to non-Type D individuals. Linked to these findings on behavioural mechanisms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311423117">Williams et al. (2011b</xref>) have shown that Type D patients posses a distinct profile of illness beliefs which may help to explain why Type D individuals engage in less health-promoting behaviours, including medication adherence.</p>
<p>The current study aims to expand on previous research regarding behavioural mechanisms by investigating the relationship between Type D and health-related behaviours by utilizing a more comprehensive assessment of health behaviours than has been used previously. Previous research has relied on brief measures of health-related behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2008</xref>), or has focused on specific behaviours, including medication adherence, and exercise behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311423117">Borkoles, Polman &amp; Levy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2011a</xref>). The current study utilizes a comprehensive measure of health-related behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311423117">Vickers, Conway &amp; Hervig, 1990</xref>) and retrospective diary measures of physical activity, smoking, and diet (using an adapted version of the alcohol timeline follow back; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311423117">Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, previous research on the relationship between Type D and general health behaviours (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311423117">Mommersteeg, Kupper &amp; Denollet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2008</xref>;) has only assessed Type D using the traditional categorical cut off points (recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311423117">Denollet, 2005</xref>). However, recent research has suggested that Type D may be better represented as a dimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311423117">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the current study is the first to investigate the relationship between Type D and health related-behaviours using both the categorical and continuous measure of Type D (following the format of several other studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311423117">Whitehead et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the present study has three key aims; (i) to investigate the relationship between Type D and health-related behaviours using a comprehensive measure of health behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311423117">Vickers, Conway &amp; Hervig, 1990</xref>); (ii) to examine the relationship between Type D and health behaviours using seven-day retrospective diary measures of physical activity, smoking, and diet, and (iii) to examine the relationship between Type D and health behaviours using both categorical and continuous measures of Type D.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Data was collected from 200 participants, 118 females and 82 males (Mean Age = 34.3; SD = 15.8). The participants were chosen by means of convenience sampling of staff and students at a Scottish University. Participants were recruited after lectures and in the public areas of the University. They were given a brief introduction of what the study would involve and were invited to participate. Ethical approval was obtained from the Psychology department’s ethics committee prior to testing. Participants provided demographic information, and completed the following measures via a paper-based questionnaire.</p>

<title>Type D personality</title>
<p>The Type D Scale (DS14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311423117">Denollet, 2005</xref>) was used to evaluate Type D personality. The DS14 is a 14-item scale with responses made on a five point Likert scale (ranging from 0 = false) to 4 = true). The measure consists of two seven-item subscales that assess negative affect (NA) (e.g. I often feel unhappy) and social inhibition (SI) (e.g. I find it hard to start a conversation). Traditionally, participants that score highly using a cut off point of ≥ 10 on both scales are classified as Type D individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311423117">Denollet, 2005</xref>). More recently, it has been suggested that Type D may be better represented as a continuous construct (by using the NA x SI multiplicative term) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311423117">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>). Both methods of scoring will be utilized in the current study. Within the present study both subscales were shown to be internally consistent with Cronbach’s α =.84, and .82 for the NA and SI subscales respectively.</p>

<title>Preventive health behaviours checklist</title>
<p>The Preventive Health Behaviours Checklist (PHBC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311423117">Vickers, Conway &amp; Hervig, 1990</xref>) was used to measure health-related behaviours. The PHBC consists of four subscales; wellness maintenance and enhancement, accident control, traffic risks and substance risks. Only the wellness maintenance and enhancement and substance risks subscales were used in the current study due to their relevance for physical health. Participants responded to the 27 items (e.g. ‘I watch my weight’) using ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (in order to reduce the effects of social desirability that would be created by a ‘sometimes’ response. The scale was scored by summing the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ answers to give a total score of preventive health behaviours engaged in by the participant. A ‘yes’ answer scores a 1 and a ‘no’ answer scores a 2. More ‘no’ answers will result in a high score which indicates poor preventive health behaviours. Cronbach’s α = .69 in the present study. When question 7 “I use dental floss regularly” was removed the Cronbach’s α = .70 giving an acceptable level of internal consistency.</p>

<title>Timeline followback measurement</title>
<p>Three Timeline Followback (TLFB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311423117">Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992</xref>) scales were utilized using TLFB procedures over three domains. Participants retrospectively reported their behaviours across the seven previous days, giving details of their consumption of cigarettes, fruits and vegetables and physical activity. The TLFB has been used successfully in other studies measuring alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311423117">Collins et al., 2008</xref>) and cigarette use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311423117">Lewis-Esquerre et al., 2005</xref>). Within the cigarette scale there were three variables that the participants were asked to fill out for each day. They are “Total cigarettes”, “Time of day” and “Specific number at time of day”. Within the fruit and vegetable scale there were four variables, “Portion total for day”, “Type”, “Amount” and “In what form”. Within the physical activity scale there will be four variables, “Total time”, “Type of exercise”, “Time spent on specific exercise” and “Location of exercise”. At the end of each scale participants were asked to indicate with a yes or a no whether this was a typical week’s consumption/activity. Participants filled out the scales recalling the information required for the past seven days starting with the day they filled out the questionnaire. The data was analysed by computing total amounts of cigarettes, minutes spent exercising, and fruit and vegetable portions per week.</p>

<sec id="section8-1359105311423117">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out to examine the difference between Type D and non-Type D individuals using the traditional categorical cut-off method of classifying Type D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311423117">Denollet, 2005</xref>) in relation to their health behaviours (on both the PHBC and TLFB measures). In addition, correlation analyses were performed in order to analyse the association between the multiplicative interaction term of NAxSI and health behaviours. The correlations were carried out in line with recent findings that have suggested that Type D may be best treated as a dimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311423117">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

Additional correlation analyses on the TLFB measures showed that Type D was positively correlated with smoking behaviour, <italic>r</italic>(198) = .171, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and negatively correlated to fruit and vegetable intake, <italic>r</italic>(198) = -.276, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and physical activity levels, <italic>r</italic>(198) = -.165, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study indicate that Type D participants differed significantly from non-Type D participants in relation to health behaviours. It was found that Type D individuals engaged in more disease promoting health behaviours than non-Type D individuals. Specifically, Type D individuals were found to smoke more, exercise less, and eat a poorer diet than non-Type D’s. In addition, the current study is the first to report that when treated as a dimensional construct, Type D was significantly associated with maladaptive health behaviours.</p>
<p>The current study adds to the growing body of evidence relating to the behavioural mechanisms by which Type D may influence health outcomes. Similar results were found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423117">Williams et al., (2008)</xref> who showed that Type D individuals carried out fewer preventive health behaviours and were leading an unhealthier lifestyle than non-Type D individuals, including not getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and getting regular checkups. However, these findings were based on a brief eight-item measure of health behaviours whereas the present findings are based on a more comprehensive assessment of health behaviours. The present study found that those who were categorised as Type D participated in less physical activity than non-Type D individuals. Similar results were also found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311423117">Mommersteeg, Kupper and Denollet (2010)</xref> who showed that Type D individuals were less likely to be meeting the Dutch standards for physical activity than the non-Type D individuals. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311423117">Borkoles, Polman &amp; Levy (2010)</xref> found that Type D individuals were less likely to engage in regular physical activity and were more likely to be sedentary than non-Type D individuals.</p>
<p>The current study also adds to recent evidence which has found that Type D is associated with smoking behaviour in both healthy participants and cardiac patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311423117">Einvik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311423117">Svansdottir et al., 2011</xref>). Previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311423117">Mommersteeg, Kupper &amp; Denollet, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311423117">Williams et al., 2008</xref>) had failed to establish such an association. The present study identified that not only were Type D individuals more likely to be smokers than non-Type D individuals, they also smoked a higher number of cigarettes than the non-Type D individuals.</p>
<p>In addition to previous research that has outlined potential psychophysiological mechanisms linking Type D to ill-health (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311423117">Molloy et al., 2008</xref>), the current findings indicate that Type D individuals may have poorer outcomes due to their maladaptive health behaviours. Accumulating evidence now suggests that Type D is associated with having a poorer diet, engaging in less exercise, and smoking. All of these are known to be important behavioural risk factors for CVD. However, it should be noted that the majority of the research which has investigated potential behavioural mechanisms has been carried out using healthy samples, with the exception of the studies carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311423117">Williams et al. (2011a</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311423117">Svansdottir et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>The limitations of the study should be identified. First, as with the majority of the research into potential mechanisms linking Type D and ill-health, the current sample consists of healthy participants. Future research is required which investigates the relationship between Type D and health behaviours in a cardiac patient population. It will be important to determine whether health-related behaviours do in fact mediate the relationship between Type D and clinical outcome. Furthermore, the current study is limited by a cross-sectional design which does not allow us to infer causality concerning the relationship between Type D and health behaviours. It would also have been beneficial for the current study to have included more socio-demographic information about the participants. Finally, the study is limited by its reliance on self-report measures of behaviours. Future research should aim to use more objective measures of health behaviours as social desirability is known to be a problem in the assessment of health-related behaviours.</p>
<p>The current study has extended the existing evidence relating Type D to health behaviours in two key ways. First, while carrying out a more comprehensive assessment of health-related behaviour than has been used before we have again (in line with previous research) identified a relationship between Type D and maladaptive health behaviours. Second, we have shown that the relationship between Type D and health behaviours is evident when Type D is scored as both a categorical and continuous variable. Overall, evidence now points to a clear link between Type D and health-related behaviours which may help to explain the relationship between Type D personality and ill-health. Behavioural pathways are potentially modifiable and represent one possible route for interventions aimed at Type D individuals.</p>
