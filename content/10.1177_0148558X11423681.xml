<abstract>
<p>This paper attempts to provide some preliminary evidence of possible implementation outcome of the use of fair value option for non-financial assets in the U.S. The characteristics of foreign-listed firms in the U.S. Stock Exchanges who use fair value (revaluation) option for measurement and reporting of property, plant and equipment (PPE) are examined. These firms already use the standard without being required to provide reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP. But only 38 of 232 firms choose to report their assets at fair value. As such, the revaluation model is not very popular among the cross-listed firms and the majority of these firms do not choose the option. We test for differences between adopters and non-adopters using leverage ratios, the intensity of PPE, firm size in terms of sales, market value, and total assets and profitability ratios. Our results show that those who adopt the fair value model for PPE (revaluers) have fundamentally different economic characteristics. We find that larger firms with higher value of PPE, and a higher ratio of the total amount of property, plant, and equipment to total assets are more likely to revalue their long-term assets. Our Probit and Factor analyses further show that larger firms with higher debt ratios (e.g., debt-to-equity), are more likely to adopt the PPE revaluation model.</p>

<p>As global capital markets develop, more companies choose to be cross-listed in multiple stock exchanges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0148558X11423681">1</xref></sup> Many of the firms that are cross-listed in U.S. stock markets use either their national Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for measurement and reporting purposes. One of the main differences between U.S. GAAP and many other national GAAPs (including IFRS) is the availability of alternative measurement choices for nonfinancial assets and liabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel, Jung, Pourjalali, &amp; Wen, 2010</xref>). IFRS and many national GAAPs allow the use of fair market valuation for measurement of all long-term assets (including property, plant, and equipment [PPE]), whereas this option is not available under U.S. GAAP. Although the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has already issued FAS 157 and 159 to provide similar opportunities and remove some of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS in asset measurements, the fair value option is still not available for all long-term assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X11423681">FASB, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X11423681">FASB 2007a</xref>). The FASB has acknowledged that SFAS 159 is the first phase in a two-stage process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X11423681">Guthrie, Irving, &amp; Sokolowsky, 2009</xref>). Phase 2 plans to more comprehensively address fair value measurement by mandating adoption and increasing the scope of eligible items, including nonfinancial instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">FASB, 2007b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0148558X11423681">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a survey of CFOs of U.S. firms on whether they would choose the fair value option for nonfinancial assets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al. (2010)</xref> report that although a significant majority of CFOs would not select the fair value option, some would do so if they knew that their competitor was doing it and that not doing it would put them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Beginning in March 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has allowed multinational corporations not based in the United States to file financial statements prepared according to the English version of IFRS without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X11423681">SEC, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0148558X11423681">3</xref></sup> Although academics and standard setters, as well as practitioners, are debating the use of the fair value option for nonfinancial assets in the United States, knowledge of foreign cross-listed firms in the United States that use the fair value option for nonfinancial assets is limited. Our study attempts to fill this void, and it provides some preliminary evidence of the possible implementation outcome of a proposed standard using a sample of firms that already use the proposed standard without being required to provide reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. Thus, our results can deliver helpful and insightful information to standard setters while they are deliberating.</p>
<p>Given that some of the cross-listed companies are already using and reporting their financial results based on the fair market value of the their nonfinancial assets, our research focuses on why some foreign firms listed in the United States use fair market valuation for these assets,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0148558X11423681">4</xref></sup> whereas others do not. We do this by comparing the fundamental economic characteristics of these two groups of firms (adopters/revaluers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0148558X11423681">5</xref></sup> vs. nonadopters/non-revaluers). In this respect, our results are important because they can help predict which group of U.S. firms may find themselves competing with foreign firms that use fair market valuation for measurement and reporting of nonfinancial assets.</p>
<p>Most other studies examine the usefulness of the fair value measurement option based on other market measures such as stock market valuation and/or reaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148558X11423681">Song, Thomas, &amp; Yi, 2010</xref>). We contribute to the literature by showing that firms’ decisions to adopt the fair value measurement can be closely related to the benefits and costs of adoption.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first empirical research based on a sample of foreign cross-listed firms in the United States. The most related and contemporary articles are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X11423681">Guthrie et al. (2009)</xref>. Daniel et al. show that if given the option, U.S. firms that are larger, more profitable, and more reliant on debt financing are more likely to choose the fair value option. Guthrie et al. show that the adoption decisions are more likely for firms that are less profitable, are highly leveraged, and have a higher proportion of assets and liabilities eligible for fair value measurement, suggesting that these decisions are consistent with income statement and balance-sheet management.</p>
<p>In general, our empirical results support our hypotheses, and we find that revaluers have larger debt-to-equity ratio (<italic>DTE</italic>) as well as leverage (long-term debt to total assets) ratios, indicating that the choice of fair value for PPE may have resulted from closeness to debt covenants. We also find that firm size as well as the intensity of fixed assets affects the decision to revalue a firm’s long-term assets. Our results are consistent with prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton, Eddey, &amp; Harris, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X11423681">Guthrie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X11423681">Lin &amp; Peasnell, 2000</xref>), which suggests that the need to lower the <italic>DTE</italic> is one of the reasons for choosing asset revaluation. In addition, we find that the mean of return-on-equity (<italic>ROE</italic>) is significantly higher for revaluers than for non-revaluers. Our probit and factor analyses show that larger firms with higher <italic>DTE</italic>s are more likely to revalue assets.</p>
<p>Our article is organized as follows: The section titled “Literature Review” provides an overview of the literature. The section titled “Hypothesis Development” provides our hypotheses. The section titled “Sample” discusses sample and data collection, and the section titled “Analysis and Results” provides a detailed analysis of the empirical results. The section titled “Summary and Conclusion” offers a summary and conclusion.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148558X11423681">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>In this section, we review the literature that is relevant to fair market value accounting and its ongoing debate.</p>
<sec id="section2-0148558X11423681">
<title>Fair Value Accounting: Definition and Estimation</title>
<p>Both FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) acknowledge that with respect to assets measured at market value (e.g., financial assets), “Market values incorporate market consensus expectations about future cash flows, in an efficient and virtually unbiased manner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148558X11423681">Hitz, 2007</xref>, p. 324). Three methods for measuring fair market value have been suggested: entry value, exit value, and value-in-use. The primary difference between value-in-use and exit/entry values is that the latter do not incorporate entity-specific competitive advantages such as managerial skills, private information, and other private skills specific to a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Landsman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The fair value concept of both FASB and IASB represents the <italic>exit</italic> market price under idealized market conditions. FASB defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (paragraph 5 of FAS 157), and IASB defines fair value as the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, or an equity instrument granted between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction (IFRS 2.A). In a real-world setting, fair value measurement as defined by FASB leads to systematic undervaluation of a firm because the exit value of an asset on the active market does not incorporate competitive advantages resulting from specific intangible assets, such as management skills, and does not provide incremental information content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148558X11423681">Hitz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The adoption of fair value accounting provokes intense debate. The conflict between fair value and historical cost measures can be linked to the qualitative characteristics of relevance and faithful representation described in Concept Statement No. 8.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0148558X11423681">6</xref></sup> Proponents of fair value accounting argue that fair values provide more relevant and timely measures of assets, liabilities, and earnings than do historical costs. Also, fair value accounting provides a more complete representation of the underlying economic values of assets and liabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X11423681">Eccher, Ramesh, &amp; Thiagarajan, 1996</xref>) and the actual performance of a firm, and is less vulnerable to managerial manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X11423681">Barlev &amp; Haddad, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, opponents of fair value accounting argue that fair value measurements are less reliable, especially when active markets do not exist and significant management estimation is involved in assessing the value of certain assets and liabilities. Management manipulation of fair value accounting can lead to reduced reliability relative to historical costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148558X11423681">Barth, 1994</xref>). In the opinion of opponents of fair value accounting, only historical cost accounting produces reliable and verifiable information. Fair value estimates are subjective, and investors will be reluctant to base capital allocation decisions or valuation of firms on fair value estimates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148558X11423681">
<title>Value Relevance of Fair Value Measurement and Reporting</title>
<p>In an incomplete and imperfect world, fair values of some assets and liabilities are not known to the market (especially for nonfinancial assets and liabilities), and the revaluation or disclosure market values for these items should provide a higher level of informational content. The value relevance of accounting numbers is defined as the extent to which these numbers are associated with share prices and with the capital market’s response to the numbers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X11423681">Eccher et al., 1996</xref>). Even though many question the reliability of fair value measurement, the academic literature provides consistent empirical evidence that fair value instead of historical cost numbers are more significantly correlated with stock returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X11423681">Barlev &amp; Haddad, 2003</xref>). Even in the banking industry, one of the fiercest critics of fair value accounting, research provides evidence for the value relevance of fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and banks’ investment securities. This research further suggests that the volatility of fair value measurements in the banking industry is not reflected in the share prices, and the fair value estimates, in fact, assist regulators in predicting probable capital violations by the banks in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148558X11423681">Barth, Landsman, &amp; Wahlen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, fair value estimates of investment securities are sufficiently relevant and reliable for investors to use in assessing the value of banks’ share prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148558X11423681">Barth et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148558X11423681">Carroll, Linsmeier, &amp; Petroni, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth and Clinch (1998)</xref> provide further evidence that fair value estimates of financial assets are value relevant not only in the banking industry but also in some non-financial-sector firms. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that fair value estimates of <italic>financial assets</italic> are reliable enough to be value relevant and that fair value estimates do not increase volatility in share prices as opponents of fair value accounting claim. Another set of value-relevance research addresses issues relating to <italic>nonfinancial assets</italic>.</p>
<p>Revaluation of nonfinancial assets is considerably more controversial than that of financial assets for which, in a majority of cases, quoted prices are either available in the active market or observable from the price of comparable assets. In most cases, an active market does not exist to observe the fair value of nonfinancial assets, and the fair value of the assets in use must be determined based on the present value of probable future cash flows or by qualified appraisals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0148558X11423681">7</xref></sup> Estimation of the net present value of an asset requires projection of earnings, the cash flows they produce, and a reasonable and justifiable discount rate. This process calls for management’s judgment and inside information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X11423681">Barlev &amp; Haddad, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As nonfinancial assets can be revalued at the discretion of management, the reliability of the revaluation amount is highly controversial and subject to ongoing intense debate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody, Barth, &amp; Kasznik, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X11423681">Lin &amp; Peasnell, 2000</xref>). Upward revaluation of nonfinancial assets also violates the principle of conservatism, which dictates that firms should consider only asset impairment with absolutely no upward valuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>). In addition, assets revaluation includes some large costs such as fees associated with appraising fixed assets, higher audit fees when auditors have to make an additional review of the assumptions the company makes when estimating the fair value of assets internally, the additional expenses for time spent in discussions and negotiations between auditors and management on the new asset value, and recordkeeping costs for less conventional transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown, Izan, &amp; Loh, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these substantial costs, managers may decide to report revalued prices in expectation of their positive impact on investors’ belief. When a rational manager decides to revalue nonfinancial assets upward, the costs of revaluation are assumed to be less than the economic benefits derived from the revaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148558X11423681">Cotter &amp; Zimmer, 1995</xref>). Some contend that when an asset’s book value differs significantly from its fair value, management should make the relevant adjustment to reduce information asymmetry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>) even if this means increasing the book value of the asset in question and violating historical cost and conservatism principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of revalued intangible assets use data from countries where such revaluation is permitted such as the United Kingdom and Australia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148558X11423681">Barth, Beaver, &amp; Landsman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Clinch, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth and Clinch (1998)</xref> find that fair value estimates of intangible assets have shown a consistent and significant positive relationship with share prices despite their presumed unreliability and the room for management discretion. Based on this study, it is noteworthy that probable manipulation by management does not diminish the value relevance of fair market estimates of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Studies investigating the value relevance of fair value estimates of tangible assets (e.g., PPE) also use data from companies domiciled in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, Hong Kong, China, and a number of other countries that allow use of IFRS for measurement and reporting purposes. We find research on the value relevance of the revaluation of PPE in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al., 1993</xref>), the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Clinch, 1998</xref>), and Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148558X11423681">Jaggi &amp; Tsui, 2001</xref>). In general, the finding on revaluation of fixed assets is that it provides value-relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Clinch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth and Clinch (1998)</xref> show that for some industries, there is a strong and consistent relationship between the present value of analysts' forecast future earnings and share prices, and the fair value amounts of financial assets, tangible and intangible assets. Finding that revalued amounts are significantly associated with share prices suggests they have implications for a firm’s future profitability. Interestingly, Barth and Clinch also find that in determining the value relevance of fair value measurement, whether the revaluation is taken in a timely manner is not an important factor and both upward and downward revaluations are value relevant. The authors find that revalued PPE is more consistently value relevant and significantly associated with returns for smaller firms.</p>
<p>Other studies show that the level of the revaluation reserve is a significant explanatory variable for stock market prices and returns of the subsample of industrial firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al., 1993</xref>). Using Australian firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth and Clinch (1998)</xref> show consistent value-relevant results for investments and intangible assets but inconsistent value-relevant results for PPE revaluations. Even though revaluations of assets are widely considered value relevant, some studies that focus on U.K. firms cross-listed in the U.S. capital markets provide evidence of a <italic>negative</italic> relationship between share prices and revaluation balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148558X11423681">Amir, Harris, &amp; Venuti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Clinch, 1996</xref>). This result may suggest that revalued amounts may be perceived as unreliable by U.S. investors.</p>

<title>Other Motivations Behind PPE Revaluation</title>
<p>In addition to providing evidence of the value relevance of the information, accounting literature documents other motivations behind the decision to revalue PPE. Revaluation changes the financial position of a firm, and particularly in the case of upward revaluation, it can directly affect contracts—such as debt contracts—that use accounting numbers. Upward asset revaluation reduces the <italic>DTE</italic> and helps firms stay within an acceptable range of borrowing limits. Some research indicates that this is the primary motivation for asset revaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al., 1993</xref>): Revaluers are highly leveraged and closer to violating debt constraints, and upward revaluation helps avoid violation of debt covenants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck &amp; Veugelers, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al. (1992)</xref> argue that revaluation not only affects contracting and political costs but also helps diminish information asymmetries between the managers and capital market participants. Information asymmetry is reduced through the use of several different signaling mechanisms, for example, financial signals such as the level of debt, the level of debt with the managers’ share of equity, and the dividend level and accounting signals such as the type of auditor, the inventory method, or the choice of the accounting method for reporting PPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck &amp; Veugelers, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148558X11423681">Trueman (1986)</xref> states that the market values managers’ ability to anticipate changes in firms’ underlying economics and theorizes that managers use forecasts to signal their ability as well as firms’ earnings. From this perspective, managers may use financial reporting to signal the firm’s future operating performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck and Veugelers (1999)</xref> provide a theoretical basis for the identification of industries where revaluation can be effectively used as a signal of future performance. Their evidence shows that managers in industries with high variance in performance and low <italic>DTE</italic>s tend to use revaluation of fixed assets as an implicit signal of the expected future cash flow of the firm, which is an indicator of its success or future performance. Consistent with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148558X11423681">Jaggi and Tsui (2001)</xref> show a positive association between upward revaluation of PPE and the firm’s future performance, suggesting that asset value modification motivated the managers’ choices and that managers are simply reporting the current value of the firm by revaluing the fixed assets.</p>
<p>Revaluation can also meet the information needs of nondomestic investors and be used as a measure of management’s performance for compensation evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera (2007)</xref> finds that a firm’s cross-country listing status and ownership structure influence managers’ accounting decisions. As upward revaluation <italic>decreases</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0148558X11423681">8</xref></sup> profitability ratios, managers are less likely to revalue assets in a very spread ownership structure.</p>
<p>Although managers may use their private information to credibly report fair values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148558X11423681">Barth et al., 2001</xref>), prior studies also provide evidence that managers may manipulate inputs for fair values for their own interests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X11423681">Barlev &amp; Haddad, 2003</xref>). For firms with weaker corporate governance mechanisms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148558X11423681">Song et al. (2010)</xref> argue that information asymmetry problems associated with Level 3 fair values may be greater, and the unreliable nature of estimations lowers the value relevance of these disclosures. Consistently, accounting literature asserts that firm size influences revaluation decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck &amp; Veugelers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>) and that economy of scale will help larger firms absorb the cost of revaluation more easily than smaller firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al., 2010</xref>). Based on this background, we develop the hypotheses presented in the next section.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148558X11423681">
<title>Hypothesis Development</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, we intend to determine whether the cross-listed firms that adopted fair market valuation for PPE were fundamentally different from cross-listed nonadopters (users of the cost model to report PPE). Although prior research provides some distinguishing characteristics between revaluers and non-revaluers, there continues to be a need to extend the economic theory to distinguish between revaluers and non-revaluers of fixed assets when an option to revalue fixed (long-term) assets exists. To address this need, our hypotheses provide a framework for defining the distinguishing characteristics between the revaluers and non-revaluers.</p>
<p>Firms’ financial statements are intended for creditors who use accounting information to analyze a firm’s financial standing and assess the risk. To reassure creditors, managers may opt to revalue fixed assets upward. In addition to removing the uncertainty related to accuracy in reporting PPE at cost, upward revaluation reduces debt-to-assets ratios (leverage) and may improve a firm’s ability to raise new loans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148558X11423681">Jaggi &amp; Tsui, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X11423681">Lin &amp; Peasnell, 2000</xref>). This assertion suggests that creditors prefer the fair value of fixed assets, and as a consequence, debtors report fixed assets at fair value in their financial statements. Furthermore, highly leveraged firms, which are close to and want to avoid default on their debt covenants, are more likely to revalue assets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>). Some research has found that revaluers are highly leveraged and are closer to violating debt constraints than non-revaluers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck &amp; Veugelers, 1999</xref>), and upward revaluation helps avoid violations of debt covenants and additional restrictions on debt levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>). As a result, we suggest that cross-listed firms that revalue PPE will have higher leverage ratios (debt-to-total assets) and/or higher <italic>DTE</italic>s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0148558X11423681">9</xref></sup> This leads us to predict that leverage ratio is significantly different between revaluers and non-revaluers. The following hypothesis will test this proposition.</p>
<list id="list1-0148558X11423681" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: Revaluers have higher leverage and <italic>DTE</italic>s than non-revaluers.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>There are two opposing theories of how firm size influences the decision to revalue fixed assets. Some argue that bigger firms with a higher number of analysts’ followings may have other channels to provide information to the capital market, but smaller firms may have to rely only on audited financial reports and hence are more inclined to revalue PPE to lower the information asymmetry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X11423681">Barth &amp; Clinch, 1998</xref>). However, extensive evidence shows that firms that revalue assets are larger and have larger property holdings and lower market-to-book values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X11423681">Gaeremynck &amp; Veugelers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al. (2010)</xref> argue that the use of fair value measurements can be influenced by the size of the firm because of the relative lower cost of revaluation for larger firms. As they enjoy economies of scale, bigger firms are more likely than smaller firms to revalue their assets.</p>
<p>We propose that the larger the PPE amount in proportion to total assets (intensity of fixed assets), the greater the influence of fair value in informing investors of the future performance of the firm and its operating assets. In this situation, managers will be more likely to choose the revaluation option (use of fair value) for PPE. Stated differently, revaluers should have a higher intensity of fixed assets than non-revaluers. Therefore, we predict that revaluers will be larger and have a higher proportion of fixed assets. The following hypothesis will test our prediction.</p>
<list id="list2-0148558X11423681" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: Revaluers are larger and have a higher intensity of fixed-to-total assets than non-revaluers.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Given that the earnings effect of revaluation is reported in other comprehensive income items, one potential benefit of revaluation is the reduction of the firm’s reported <italic>accounting rate of return</italic> and, hence, an improvement in its bargaining position with the unions and government regulators. Prior literature documents that revaluation of fixed assets is often a primary tool for lowering debt and political costs (e.g., Brown et al., 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X11423681">Missonier-Piera, 2007</xref>). To reduce political costs, firms tend to reduce their profitability ratios (e.g., <italic>ROE</italic> and return-on-assets [<italic>ROA</italic>]). As revaluation increases depreciation and decreases the reported earnings, it reduces profitability ratios and may reduce political exposure. Consequently, we argue that firms may choose to revalue assets to reduce political costs, and we propose that <italic>ROE</italic> and <italic>ROA</italic> ratios will be higher for revaluers.</p>
<p>The literature suggests that asset value modification may motivate managers’ choices and that managers who revalue fixed assets are simply reporting the current value of the firm. Some studies show a positive association between upward revaluation of PPE and the firm’s future performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X11423681">Aboody et al., 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148558X11423681">Jaggi &amp; Tsui, 2001</xref>). We also expect that those who have a higher growth rate (measured by Growth Margin) will use revaluation as a signal for future performance. The following hypothesis states these expectations:</p>
<list id="list3-0148558X11423681" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: Revaluers have higher growth margin, <italic>ROE</italic>, and <italic>ROA</italic> ratios than non-revaluers.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Even though prior literature focuses on the implication of upward revaluation to reduce debt costs, we should not ignore the fact that managers also consider investors’ preferred accounting choice. In the U.S. capital market, understandably, U.S. institutional investors prefer U.S. GAAP over other national GAAP or even IFRS, a preference which can be termed a home bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X11423681">Bradshaw, Bushee, &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148558X11423681">Hopkins et al., 2008</xref>). U.S. investors are more familiar with U.S. GAAP, and they find financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP more useful, more comparable, and easier and less costly to interpret. Hence, foreign cross-listed firms are more likely to use an accounting method that the U.S. investors are familiar with; that is, firms are more likely to choose accounting standards that closely conform to U.S. GAAP. As U.S. GAAP does not allow upward revaluation of PPE, we anticipate that cross-listed firms are less likely to revalue PPE.</p>
<p>There are accounting consequences when firms choose fair valuation model. For example, firm’s reported earnings will be reduced to the extent of increase in depreciation of revalued assets. Furthermore, balances for total assets and total equity increase in the balance sheet (while total liabilities remain constant). Given these changes resulting from the choice of fair market valuation, ratios such as <italic>ROE, ROA</italic>, time-interest earned<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0148558X11423681">10</xref></sup> decline, whereas ratios such as <italic>DTE</italic> and Debt-to-Assets (<italic>LEV</italic>) improve. If a firm is subject to <italic>ROA, ROE</italic>, and/or time-interest earned covenants, it may face debt covenant violation as a result of using fair value accounting. However, if a firm is subject to <italic>DTE</italic> and <italic>LEV</italic> covenants, it will distance itself from debt covenant violations as a result of using fair value accounting. Consequently, there is a trade-off between improvement in ratios such as <italic>DTE</italic> and <italic>LEV</italic>, and other ratios such as time-interest earned.</p>
<p>In the section titled “Sample,” we describe our sample in detail; in section titled “Analysis and Results,” we provide empirical analysis and report our findings.</p>

<sec id="section6-0148558X11423681">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We chose our sample from foreign registrants listed on the SEC website in December 2007 for two reasons. First, for most European Union (EU) firms, this was the 1st year that they reported their financial statements (for 2006) using IFRS. This date helped us to include European cross-listed firms that switched their PPE measurement from cost to fair value in 2005/2006, an option granted by IFRS. Second, 2007 was the last year that all foreign-listed firms using (the English version of) IFRS were subject to the SEC requirement to file a reconciliation form with their SEC filings (20-F; <italic>Accounting Reconciliation Rules for Foreign Firms</italic>). On November 15, 2007, the SEC dropped the rules for foreign firms that used IFRS.</p>
<p>We identified 1,145 non-U.S.-incorporated firms that trade in the United States on the AMEX, CAP MKT, GLOBAL MKT, New York Stock Exchange, or OTC. Our sample of non-U.S., cross-listed firms include both December and non-December year-end firms. Adjusting for inactive firms and those missing GV Keys and Central Index Key reduces our sample to 795 firms. Of the 795 firms, 203 firms used U.S. GAAP to measure and report PPE. As mentioned above, U.S. GAAP does not grant the option of revaluation for PPE.</p>
<p>A total of 592 foreign registrants who did not follow U.S. GAAP for reporting were required to file 20-F reconciliation forms prior to November 15, 2007. Of the 592 firms, 126 firms used IFRS and 466 firms used the company’s national GAAP for reporting. We inspected <italic>all</italic> 20-Fs for all 592 companies to find out whether they used fair market value for PPE measurement. We classified these companies as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0148558X11423681" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Those who used historical cost basis for measurement and reporting</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Those who used the fair market value basis for measurement and reporting of at least one class of PPE</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X11423681">Table 1</xref>, we further limited the sample to those companies that were incorporated in a country that allows revaluation of PPE. The total sample then dropped to 232 firms. From this list, we found 38 companies (16.4%) that used the revaluation model to report at least one class of PPE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0148558X11423681">11</xref></sup> A majority of the adopters of the PPE revaluation model (28 of 38) were using IFRS. A total of 22 firms revalued their long-lived assets in transition to IFRS either on January 4, 2005 (as required by EU countries) or earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0148558X11423681">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p>In our analysis, we use two samples: the sample of firms that includes all foreign-listed firms (232) that could have selected revaluation and the subsample of only IFRS firms (126). Each sample contributes differently to the strength of our analysis. The 232-firm sample is more diversified, whereas the 126-firm sample provides a more homogeneous and more controlled environment for testing our hypotheses. Before reporting our results, we acknowledge that this study is limited in two ways. First, although we include all observations that meet our criteria, only 38 companies used the revaluation model to report PPE; the others (194 companies) reported their PPE at cost. This means that although this study includes all for which data can be obtained, the results are subject to small sample size limitations. Second, many of our variables are correlated, and our results are subject to a multicollinearity problem. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148558X11423681">Table 2</xref>, we report the multicollinearity correlation among our independent variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0148558X11423681">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>Such problems are not particular to this study, and prior fair-market-value studies have dealt with similar problems. We address these problems by performing additional sensitivity analyses. We hypothesize that the cross-listed firms that adopt fair market valuation for PPE are fundamentally different from cross-listed firms that are nonadopters. To test this proposition, we compare selected variables for both adopters and nonadopters. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X11423681">Table 3</xref> provides a statistical comparison of the two groups (adopters and nonadopters) for both samples. The average <italic>DTE</italic> of the adopters is significantly higher than that of the nonadopters for both samples, whereas <italic>LEV</italic> (leverage, the ratio of long-term debt to total assets) is significantly different for the sample of 232 firms but not for the subsample of 126 firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al. (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X11423681">Lin and Peasnell (2000)</xref>, among others, suggest that the need to lower the <italic>DTE</italic> is one of the reasons for choosing asset revaluation.</p>

<p>Adopters are also statistically larger (in log of total assets—<italic>SIZE</italic>—and log of revenue) than nonadopters. This finding is consistent with the assertation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X11423681">Lin and Peasnell (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X11423681">Daniel et al. (2010)</xref> that the firm size affects the fair-market-accounting choice. Given that the adopters are larger than the nonadopters, as one can expect, the total amount of PPE for adopters is significantly higher than for nonadopters. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X11423681">Table 3</xref> indicates, <italic>ROE</italic> is higher for firms with revaluation model. The higher <italic>ROE</italic> suggests that firms that choose revaluation model are more profitable than those that choose cost model and remained so even after the choice of fair market valuation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X11423681">Brown et al. (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X11423681">Easton et al. (1993)</xref> also suggest that revaluations may help with profitability ratios. A comparison of <italic>ROA</italic> does not indicate any significant difference.</p>
<p>We calculated the intensity of PPE (<italic>PPETA</italic>—the ratio of PPE to total assets), and although the comparison between the two groups shows that adopters have larger and significantly different ratios in our IFRS sample (126 firms), there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the sample of 232 firms. These results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X11423681">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results show, as we propose, that adopters have different characteristics from nonadopters, and these differences are in line with our predicted directions. Consequently, we have support for a majority of the items mentioned in H1 to H3. These results, however, do not show whether these characteristics can explain why some firms choose the fair value method, whereas others do not. As we are aware of the limitations that a small sample imposes on the results of studies, we ran multiple probit regression models with and without some of the independent variables mentioned above.</p>
<p>When <italic>DTE</italic> and leverage ratios are included in the models, they show significant explanatory power in the choice of fair value. In most cases where <italic>PPETA</italic> is included, its coefficient is significant in explaining fair value choice. The direction of coefficients for these variables suggests that firms with a higher <italic>DTE</italic> and higher <italic>PPETA</italic> are more likely to choose fair value to measure PPE, as we anticipated in H1 and H2, respectively. Although the results show that our explanatory variables are able to explain the fair-market-value choice, given the high level of multicollinearity among our variables, we are uncertain as to which variable has any, or the most significant, effect on the choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0148558X11423681">14</xref></sup> Although the results differ across analyses, we provide a sample of multiple probit regression models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X11423681">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148558X11423681">5</xref> as a basis for our decision to use the next set of analyses.</p>

<p>Inspection of Factor 1 of Panel A and Factor 1 of Panel B indicates that these factors are representative of debt variables (coefficients for <italic>DTE</italic> and <italic>LEV</italic> are the highest) and reveal an interaction with asset (note that the next highest coefficient in both factors is <italic>SIZE</italic>).

<p>We ran probit analyses using these three new factors as independent variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148558X11423681">Table 7</xref>). The results are reported in Panel A (for 232 firms) and Panel B (for 126 firms). In both, the Debt&amp;Asset Factor significantly influences the choice of fair-market-value accounting. In essence, large firms with higher debt are significantly more likely to choose fair market value to report PPEs than others. These results are consistent with our results from the previous part. However, we could not find any significant effect on our dependent variable from Factor 2 (Growth variables) or Factor 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0148558X11423681">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>In summary, the results of our mean comparisons between the two groups and of the probit analyses support our proposition that revaluers show different economic characteristics from non-revaluers, as suggested in H1 to H3. In general, bigger firms are more likely to revalue fixed assets. Revaluers are less profitable than non-revaluers (<italic>ROE</italic> shows consistent statistical evidence compared with <italic>ROA</italic>, in the probit results). As in findings for the United Kingdom and Australian firms, revaluers of firms cross-listed in the United States may report the fair value of PPE to reduce <italic>DTE</italic>s. Consistent to prior findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148558X11423681">Christensen &amp; Nikolaev, 2010</xref>), cross-listed firms are unlikely to adopt the revaluation model, as managers tend to follow the preferred accounting standards of the U.S. investors. On average, those that use IFRS for measurement and reporting purposes use fair valuation more often than others.</p>

<sec id="section8-0148558X11423681">
<title>Summary and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study addresses a very timely topic: the fair market valuation of nonfinancial assets. With the elimination of <italic>Accounting Reconciliation Rules for Foreign Firms</italic>, cross-listed IFRS firms in the U.S. market are given the choice to report PPE values at cost or at fair market value, whereas U.S. firms are prohibited from reporting the same assets at fair market value.</p>
<p>We used the entire set of foreign-listed companies that had the choice between cost and fair value (either through use of IFRS or National GAAP) for which data are available. A total of 232 companies meet these criteria. Among these companies, 126 use IFRS and 106 use their national GAAP to report. The revaluation model is not popular among the cross-listed firms, and the majority of these firms do not choose the option. Only 38 of 232 firms chose to report their assets at fair value. Revaluation of fixed assets is not an accepted practice in the United States, and it is possible that cross-listed firms chose to conform to U.S. GAAP and report their PPE at cost, so that their accounting numbers would be comparable with those of U.S. firms (their competitors). A closer review of 10Ks reveals that 11 firms revalued only property, whereas 27 firms revalued all classes of assets.</p>
<p>We test for differences between adopters and nonadopters using leverage ratios, the intensity of PPE, firm size in terms of sales, market value, and total assets and profitability ratios. We find that adopters (revaluers) are larger in size than nonadopters. Logically, larger firms have a higher value of PPE, and firms with a higher ratio of the total amount of PPE to total assets are more likely to revalue their long-term assets. Our probit analyses further show that the higher the <italic>DTE</italic>, the more likely a firm is to adopt the PPE revaluation model. Hence, we suggest that the intent of the revaluation of PPE may be to reduce adopters’ <italic>DTE</italic>s.</p>
<p>In summary, our results show that foreign firms listed in the U.S. stock exchanges which adopt the revaluation model for PPE have fundamentally different economic characteristics from other foreign-listed firms.</p>
<p>The SEC has allowed multinational corporations not based in the United States to file financial statements prepared according to the English version of IFRS without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. Our study attempts to expand our knowledge of foreign cross-listed firms in the United States that use the fair value option for nonfinancial assets and to provide some preliminary evidence of possible implementation outcomes of a proposed standard using a sample of firms that already use the proposed standard without being required to provide reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. In this respect, our results can provide useful and insightful information to standard setters in their deliberations.</p>
<p>The decision by the SEC in November 2007 changes the comparability of financial statements in the U.S. stock exchange. IFRS foreign firms are allowed to report PPE at fair value, whereas domestic U.S. firms are prohibited from using this option under U.S. GAAP. Hence, at least for the sample of firms included in this study, investors are comparing two sets of asset valuation models to make capital allocation decisions. If the managers of public U.S. firms believe that fair value measurement and reporting of PPE reduces the cost of capital, and if they are given the option, they may choose to adopt fair market valuation in lieu of historical cost for their PPE to ensure that they continue to remain competitive in global equity markets. In essence, our results may suggest that rational managers may choose fair value accounting to influence the decision made by equity investors.</p>

<p>Prior research indicates that cross-listing in U.S. market exchanges results in a significant tpdpositive stock market reaction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148558X11423681">Doukas &amp; Switzer, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148558X11423681">Roosenboom and Van Dijk (2009)</xref> suggest that overcoming market segmentation, increased market liquidity, improved information disclosure, and better investor protection are among the reasons for this positive market reaction. Roosenboom and Van Dijk find that when foreign firms are cross-listed in U.S. exchange markets, they have higher average returns than when they are cross-listed in other stock exchanges.</p>

<p>In most accounting standards, the revaluation of fixed assets results in an increase in the book value of fixed assets and revaluation reserves, which is part of the owner’s equity. If a firm revalues depreciable assets, the accounting profits for the period decrease, but the firm’s net worth increases and the probability of insolvency decreases.</p>

<p>We intended to use ratios after adjusting them for the effect of revaluation. However, the majority of the firms using the revaluation method did not disclose the amount and the effect of revaluation in their financial statements. Consequently, we were forced to use the data affected by revaluation. If the test of this hypothesis shows no results, the lack of results can be attributed to the fact that we used ratios that were already adjusted for revaluation, but if we find results as we predict, they can provide stronger evidence because even with the revaluations, the ratios are higher for those who choose the revaluation method.</p>

<p>Under IFRS 1 First-Time Adopters of IFRS, firms in transition to IFRS from some other set of standards, laws, and so on, are allowed, but are not required, to use fair value on the transition date as the deemed IFRS cost of PPE. This special consideration was introduced primarily to help these entities that may not have previously collected the necessary information to determine cost in accordance with IFRS (IFRS 1.BC41). The concession is, however, available to all entities and has been used by several who could have determined IFRS costs.</p>

<p>When there is no current (short-term) debt in the balance sheet, the two equations—1 and 2 above—are equal. As in all cases current debt exists, the two equations are not exactly the same; hence, the observed correlation of approximately 0.7 between <italic>LEV</italic> and <italic>DTE</italic>.</p>

<p>We also performed stepwise probit analysis. Similarly, we find that debt variables (<italic>DTE</italic> and leverage) and <italic>PPETA</italic> are significant in explaining the revaluation choice.</p>

<p>Having only <italic>DTE</italic> instead of both <italic>LEV</italic> and <italic>DTE</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X11423681">Tables 4</xref>, 5 (where only <italic>DTE</italic> is significant), and 6 (<italic>LEV</italic> and <italic>DTE</italic> show relatively large coefficients in Debt&amp;Asset Factor) does not change the results of our study. Given our results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148558X11423681">Table 6</xref>, however, one can conclude that both <italic>LEV</italic> and <italic>DTE</italic> provide incremental explanatory power in Debt&amp;Asset Factor.</p>
