<p>We were asked, in the note for these texts, to speak of the impact of Berger’s work in personal and pedagogical terms. Graduating in fine art the year before its publication, I remember reading it while working as a welder near London Airport. My first copy was filthy with the grime of an engineering shop within a few weeks. My second, bought when I began to teach, scribbled upon and incessantly forced open for photocopying, quickly fell to pieces. At the same time, the ideas presented within it appeared so axiomatic at that point that they took on a self-evident quality.</p>
<p>Yet a peculiarity has occurred. Over the last 30 years these ideas have again got stranger. What was once understood – or at least sensed as axiomatic – is no longer. The falling rate of profit seemingly has a parallel, it would seem, in the falling rate of knowledge. Superficial ability to use or deploy the image world (nearly always only, today, in the private interest, at least in the US) occurs in inverse proportion to depth of understanding. Art History has retreated all along the line. And the more property relations intrude, the more they are denied.</p>
<p>But it is just here that one wants to ask about what it is about <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> that has given it the resilience to survive in the extended ‘counter-revolution’ (as Marcuse would call it) that currently grips us – though one of the first things we discover on re-reading Berger et al. is that the work has more to say on current politics than we might have imagined.</p>
<p>I will list seven characteristics of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> that I think have enabled this resilience and contributed to its undoubted success. Four are obvious, and can simply be stated. Three are less so, I will say a little more on these.</p>
<p>To begin with the four ‘obvious’ characteristics: first, it is, as we know, an exemplary pedagogical work, perhaps the greatest we have in its field. This is its primary gift. Second, and bound up with the first, indeed part of the reason for the possibility of the first, is that <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> offers a unique and original format. It is, emphatically, a text – and it is the closest that any in this field comes to translating, even intensifying, the virtues of the slide lecture: a genre which, at that moment, we should remember, under the pressure of new subject matter, was first being developed beyond the traditional art-historical model.</p>
<p>Third, a point we will have to make more of, the book possesses an enviable transparency of argument. A rigorously Marxist (in the sense of <italic>Marx-like</italic>) analysis of property relations in art is laid out in a manner that challenges and provokes; and, crucially, is so to a readership not presupposed or delimited as academic.</p>
<p>Fourth, more essential to the book’s success than is usually acknowledged, is the affirmative and declarative rhythm of Berger’s sentences; a cadence that feels close to spoken language and yet which is subtly different in tone and modulation from the rhythm of the spoken text in the television series.</p>
<p>If we add to these four initial characteristics the exquisite timing – its arriving at a moment when certain things needed to be said and could, for the first time <italic>or so it seemed</italic> be spoken of in this way (and in a manner more direct, even naïve, than seemed possible later) – then we have a complex of factors which, if they by no means explain <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> (as if, in laying out these factors, we elucidated the recipe of a complex dish) <italic>begin</italic> to tell us of the conditions that have enabled it to have such peculiar success, to be seductive, so forceful. But these are not all, or more exactly, they are not quite sufficient. In the sense of giving it its unique content at least three other characteristics are essential.</p>
<p>It is worth briefly outlining them.</p>
<p>The first of these conditions – our fifth characteristic overall – is that <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is unrepentantly political. It is the work of a committed militant; one who fears, as in Walter Benjamin’s famous line from ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">1970[1940]</xref>), ‘that not even the dead will be safe from the enemy if he is victorious’ (p. 257). Matched by an equally militant commitment, as in all Berger’s work, to the struggle on behalf of art in its struggle against the insistent demands of the market, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is exceptional in that these two realms are thought from the beginning in <italic>internal</italic> relation to one another, This is why ‘the entire art of the past has now become a political issue’ (Berger et al., 2008[1972]): 33).</p>
<p>Because we still have difficulty with this relation, and because Berger’s formulation chides us as to how little, in fact we have progressed beyond it, it is worth reminding ourselves of his argument:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the aims of this essay has been to show that what is really at stake is much larger than the question of Art seen as a narrow professional concern: the learnt assumptions that affect how we take up these issues mystify rather than clarify. The past is never there waiting to be discovered … History always constitutes the relation between a present and its past. … Cultural mystification of the past entails a double loss. Works of art are made unnecessarily remote. And the past offers us fewer conclusions to complete in action. (p. 11)</p>
<p>A people or class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act than one that has been able to situate itself in history. (p. 33)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This insistence that <italic>history</italic> is the horizon of thinking art (and therefore the plane on which art, politics and property relations necessarily interrelate) brings us, by reverse, to the sixth – and somewhat paradoxical – characteristic of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. The book was influential, we know, in the 1970s and 1980s, at least as a beginning text, amongst many whose later books and essays on the seen essentially began from language, or where language – as signification – provides the methodology by which the critique of the visual could be mounted. But in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, language is <italic>not</italic> the necessary and privileged prism through which all that is cultural must be read. Language is not, of course, absent from its concerns. The cover already tells us that it begins with the <italic>question</italic> of the relation between word and seeing, while the discussions of the Hals portraits of the Governors of the Almshouses in Haarlem (pp. 12–16) and of Gainsborough’s <italic>Mr. and Mrs. Andrews</italic> (pp. 106–7) both revolve around the inadequacy of the modes of speaking about art traditionally deployed to account for these paintings.</p>
<p>So language is present in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, but – and this is crucial – it is so only as a <italic>subject for analysis</italic>. As <italic>method</italic>, language devolves to sight. Indeed, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is in many ways a critique of the adequacy of language to encompass the seen. Like all of Berger’s writing, the book is, in effect, a wager on what can be achieved in respect of <italic>thinking seeing</italic> through as direct a confrontation, engagement and encounter with what is before us as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, no encounter has the purity of direct engagement. What is drawn on to help make sense of sight and the seen in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is not language but property relations. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is, in the best sense of this term, a vulgar Marxist text – and in ways that Marx would have recognized. It was precisely this that gave rise to immediate accusations of reductionism – see Lawrence Gowing’s complaint vis-à-vis Berger’s analysis of Gainsborough’s <italic>Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.</italic> But <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is not reductionist. The converse of speaking of property relations for Berger is that it throws proper attention on the exceptional in art, not as art’s natural state but as that which, in Europe, has to be won, and won against the grain. This is the struggle of art <italic>against</italic> the reduction that property and the market enforce (see p. 110 ff).</p>
<p>This takes us to the seventh characteristic. It concerns critique. Here is the line that Berger uses to complete his analysis of the gaze of the central pair figures in Holbein’s <italic>Ambassadors</italic>, but which also acts as a prescient description of the increasingly perverse economic and political structure of our times<italic>:</italic> ‘Individualism finally posits equality. Yet equality must be made inconceivable’ (p. 97). This is a wonderful instance of Berger’s capacity to move seamlessly between art and the political. Yet the line is also an instance of affirmation, not in the sense, obviously, of the status quo, but precisely the opposite. It is the instantiated affirmation that the non-relation or the relation that is <italic>not</italic> a relation that defines art and politics in our time – the gap between property and human possibility – can be thought through, <italic>providing</italic> ‘a number of parameters are abandoned, a number of novelties introduced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Badiou and Žižek, 2009[2005]</xref>: 82). <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is precisely this. As a text and as an object it instantiates this affirmation in its argument and in its structure – in its formal innovation, in what it lets go of (or declares redundant) and in what it introduces. We are still reading it because, to our surprise, our culture has not yet fully internalized the affirmation that it points to. Berger, perhaps, anticipated this. The last, almost hidden, injunction in the book (it appears on its own page, after the list of works reproduced) is … ‘To be continued by the reader …’ (p. 166). This seems a suitable epitaph to the pedagogic and political task Berger set himself.</p>
