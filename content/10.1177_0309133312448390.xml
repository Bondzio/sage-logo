<p>Frederick E. Clements is known as a key figure in the development of plant succession concepts but earlier arguments over the ‘spontaneous generation’ of plants illustrate the critical relationship between theory and observation. The observations of Thoreau (1860) and Dureau de la Malle (1825) provide good examples of the way in which the theory-observation relationships are contextualized in the prevailing orthodoxies of the time.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>In field science the relationships between observation and theory can be reflexive, with theories not only constructed around observations but also observations being influenced by the prevailing theories of the time. Thus, for new observations to lead to developments in theories there has to be a conscious effort to contest prevailing orthodoxies.</p>
<p>In the early history of ideas about plant succession there were often observations that one type of vegetation in a particular location appeared to be succeeded by another over time. Some of the ideas, however, seemed to be pervaded by the prevailing view that forests were somehow ‘right’ and almost inevitable, with forests being spontaneously generated. In this context it is of interest to pay tribute to the observations of Thoreau (1860) and Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle (1825)</xref> who contested these orthodoxies with their observations. They demonstrated that succession was influenced by the provision and transport of seeds from the surrounding vegetation and by seed dormancy while the resultant vegetation was also dependent upon the interaction between species.</p>
<p>The idea of the ‘rightness’ of forests is typified from, for example, the writings of Eli K. Price (1797–1884), a Quaker who was a noted Philadelphia lawyer and legal reformer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133312448390">Rothrock, 1886</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309133312448390">University of Delaware, 2011</xref>). In Price’s 1877 paper ‘Sylviculture’, written for the American Philosophical Society, and the subsequent correspondence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133312448390">Price, 1878</xref>), he observed not only that was there a natural vegetation but also that new land can be colonized by vegetation. He wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>We may well believe that the earliest of our race found our world covered with forests; except in those places unfitted for their growth. These were the polar regions, where ice cuts off the growth of trees; the mountain crests where both cold and want of soil prevent all growth of trees, and arid deserts … Yet the seemingly barren lands cast up by the sea can be made to bear forests, and to flourish in vegetation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312448390">Price, 1877</xref>: 198)</p>
</disp-quote>
He also asserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312448390">Price, 1877</xref>: 211) that if you were to ‘stop the fires on the prairies, lighted by the hunter for unknown centuries, [then] Nature will clothe them with forests’. But how did nature inevitably ‘clothe’ the land with forests? Nearly 20 years before Price was writing, on 13 December 1860, the <italic>New York Weekly Tribune</italic> published a letter by its Editor, Horace Greeley, to the naturalist and writer H.D. Thoreau. As quoted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312448390">Dean (1993)</xref>, Greeley wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>In the great Pine forest … a long summer drouth [drought] has sometimes been followed by a sweeping fire … the timber is entirely killed. The very next season, up springs new and thick growth of White Birch – a tree not known there before. How do you reconcile it with your theory that trees are never generated spontaneously, but always from some nut, seed, or root, pre-existing in the same locality? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312448390">Dean, 1993</xref>: 632–633)</p>
</disp-quote>
This letter followed the publication of Thoreau’s ‘The Succession of Forest Trees’ in the <italic>New York Weekly Tribune</italic> of 6 October 1860. In this Thoreau had asserted that plants spring up where none of their kind did before only when seeds have been dispersed by the agency of animals, water or wind. Greeley disagreed, arguing that plants could be spontaneously generated.</p>
<p>Their dispute is perhaps difficult to understand, especially as, in the case of birch, their membranous seeds can readily be seen blowing in the wind. As early as 320 <sc>bc</sc> the Greek philosopher Theophrastus had described the ways in which specific plants and trees can grow from seeds in <italic>De causis plantarum</italic> [The causes of plants] and <italic>De historia plantarum</italic> [The history of plants]. Arguing for spontaneous generation, then, almost seems wilfully perverse. The viewpoint, however, can be contextualized in a time when the idea still had some currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312448390">Dean, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133312448390">Farley, 1977</xref>). It is perhaps also understandable since Pasteur’s experiment which refuted spontaneous generation (of microorganisms in broth by excluding their access using a swan-necked bottle) had occurred in 1859 which was only a year before Greeley’s writing. It might also be further understood by examining Thoreau’s writings in more detail and realizing that the study of vegetation dynamics did not really develop until the early 1900s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133312448390">Trudgill, forthcoming</xref>).</p>

<title>II Thoreau as ecologist: succession and ‘nature’s forests’</title>
<p>Henry David Thoreau is generally known as a nature writer, for example <italic>Walden</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309133312448390">Thoreau, 1854</xref>), and his works are central to writings on wilderness (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309133312448390">Turner, 1996</xref>: 81–92). In his history of ecological ideas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312448390">Worster (1994</xref>: 57) refers to ‘Thoreau’s romantic ecology’. He also stresses that it is not widely appreciated that Thoreau made significant ecological observations: specifically that Thoreau’s 1860 essay ‘The succession of forest trees’ was a contribution to both ecology and scientific agriculture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312448390">Worster, 1994</xref>: 268).</p>
<p>Worster’s assessment is that ‘to bring the forest back, even to a limited degree, was Thoreau’s chief hope in his ecological writing. The slightest evidence of nature’s regenerative power reassured him … convinced him that … man could not wholly subdue this stubborn principle of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312448390">Worster, 1994</xref>: 74). He wrote that while Thoreau thus delights in observing ‘young pine seedlings reclaiming a pasture under the farmer’s very nose’ this does not detract from the objectivity of his actual observations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133312448390">Foster, 2002</xref>, for a historical–ecological perspective on Thoreau).</p>
<p>In Thoreau’s article on the succession of forest trees, he is moved to make observations on seed dispersal by wind and animals. Thoreau addresses the apparent contemporaneous puzzlement, encapsulated by Greeley’s remarks above, that seedlings can appear as if spontaneously after woodland clearance. It appears that a chief argument for regeneration had hitherto been one of long-term storage of seeds in the soil, the dormancy of which is broken by the act of clearance. While this can, of course, occur (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312448390">Fenner, 1992</xref>), it does seem to us curious that in 1860, because of ideas of spontaneous generation, he found it necessary to argue that that the agencies of wind, birds and mammals can operate and were not fully appreciated. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133312448390">Thoreau (1860, 1887</xref> version quoted herein):<disp-quote>
<p>In my capacity of surveyor … I have often been asked … if I could tell how it happened, that when a pine wood was cut down an oak one commonly sprang up, and vice versa. To which I have answered, and now answer, that I can tell, – that it is no mystery to me. As I am not aware that this has been clearly shown by any one … When, hereabouts, a single forest tree or a forest springs up naturally where none of its kind grew before, I do not hesitate to say, though in some quarters still it may sound paradoxical, that it came from a seed … If any one asserts that it sprang from something else, or from nothing, the burden of proof lies with him. (Thoreau, 1887: 34)</p>
</disp-quote>
Thoreau (1887: 35) then goes on to explain what, to us, seems perfectly obvious in greater detail. He maintains that ‘it remains, then, only to show how the seed is transported from where it grows, to where it is planted’. His answer is that it ‘is done chiefly by the agency of the wind, water, and animals’. From his own observation he has concluded that ‘the lighter seeds, as those of pines and maples, are transported chiefly by wind and water; the heavier, as acorns and nuts, by animals’. He also made observations on the mechanism of wind transport: ‘in all the pines, a very thin membrane, in appearance much like an insect’s wing, grows over and around the seed … to provide the means of transporting the seed’.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to specifically refute the ‘spontaneous generation’ idea by asserting that ‘there is then no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung up from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in asserting that they come from seeds, though the mode of their propagation by nature has been but little attended to’ (p. 36). He exemplifies his key deductions based on his own observations. On the subjects of tree regeneration and of dispersal mechanisms, he wrote that ‘when you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not at once spring up there unless there are, or have been, quite recently, seed-bearing pines near enough for the seeds to be blown from them’.</p>
<p>The specific refutation of spontaneous generation is:<disp-quote>
<p>as for the heavy seeds and nuts … the notion is still a very common one that, when the trees which bear these spring up where none of their kind were noticed before, they have come from seeds or other principles spontaneously generated there in an unusual manner, or which have lain dormant in the soil for centuries, or perhaps been called into activity by the heat of a burning. I do not believe these assertions. (Thoreau, 1887: 36)</p>
</disp-quote>
In short: ‘every one of these seeds, too, will be found to be winged or legged in another fashion’ (p. 38). He then adds observations about birds and animals eating fleshy fruits, thus dispersing seeds, and carrying larger seeds like acorns. He does thus tend to minimize the importance of dormancy, however, an aspect which Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle (1825)</xref> had seen as more important, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Thoreau’s and Greeley’s differences can be seen as part of the endeavour to explain natural phenomena where there is a struggle between individual’s observations and theories which were as yet not fully developed or tested. Thoreau’s first-hand observations provided critically important evidence, thus giving an indication of the nature of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133312448390">Howe, 2009</xref>).</p>

The most cited work on succession is that published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312448390">Clements (1916)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309133312448390">Figure 1</xref>) who also showed some of his nascent ideas in his study of prairies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133312448390">Pound and Clements, 1898</xref>) and on vegetation in Nebraska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133312448390">Clements, 1904</xref>). Clements came to see succession as a useful concept of practical application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133312448390">Clements, 1935</xref>). He then published his detailed consideration of climax vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312448390">Clements, 1936</xref>) and a later co-authored book on bioecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312448390">Clements and Shelford, 1939</xref>). An obituary for Clements by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312448390">Shantz (1945</xref>: 319) concluded: ‘I would agree with A.G. Tansley and say “that Dr. Clements has given us a theory of vegetation which has formed an indispensable foundation for the most fruitful modern work” and that he “is by far the greatest individual creator of the modern science of vegetation”.’ For wider perspectives, see the reviews of Clements in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133312448390">Cameron and Matless (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133312448390">Journet (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312448390">Worster (1994</xref>: 205–220).</p>

<p>In his review of the early history of plant ecology in Britain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312448390">Tansley (1947</xref>: 137) points out that although ‘Clements’s great book on Plant Succession’ appeared in the middle of the 1914–1918 World War in 1916, it ‘probably influenced British ecology more than any other publication since the foundation works of Warming and Schimper’ (as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133312448390">Trudgill, forthcoming</xref>). Tansley also cited the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133312448390">Moss (1907</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312448390">1912</xref>) on the vegetation of Somerset and Yorkshire saying, however, that ‘[while] we all recognized the fact of succession and Moss used it extensively in more than one of his papers, we still tended, I think, to treat plant communities too statically’. He then celebrated Clements’ contribution thus:<disp-quote>
<p>though some of Clements’s formulations met with little acceptance [at the time], it was his broad and thorough treatment of the subject that made us realize the universal significance of succession as a key process involved in all the phenomena of the communities of vegetation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312448390">Tansley, 1947</xref>: 137)</p>
</disp-quote>
Clements significantly for the development of succession theory referred to the work of Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle (1825)</xref> at some length. Dureau de la Malle’s observations bring us back to Greeley and Thoreau, but here similar observation of vegetation change relies on regeneration from dormant seeds rather than Greeley’s spontaneous generation or Thoreau’s transport of seeds by animals and wind. Dureau de la Malle uses ‘alternance’ which is translated as ‘alternative succession’, but with the ‘alternative’ here really meaning ‘different set of plants which follows the loss of an earlier vegetation’ rather than some kind of ‘choice’ or ‘switching’ alternation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312448390">Clements (1916)</xref> in translation and paraphrasing from Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle (1825)</xref> wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>Dureau de la Malle … as a landed proprietor in Perche, he [carried out] experiments designed to prove that the alternative succession of plants is due to the long retention by seeds of the power of germination. In cutting the woods … composed of Quercus, Fagus, Castanea, Ulmus, and Fraxinus, only oaks and beeches were left as seed trees. The cut-over areas came to be occupied by … Betula and Populus tremula. At the end of 30 years, the birch and aspen were cut, and quickly succeeded themselves [regenerated]. The oak and beech returned only after the third cut, 60 years later, and became masters of the area. Since there were no adjacent aspens and birches, the author believed their seeds could not have been brought by the wind, and he concluded that the seeds remained dormant in the soil for at least a century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312448390">Clements, 1916</xref>: 13–14)</p>
</disp-quote>
As with Thoreau it is primary observation which brings ‘common sense’ to bear upon theory. The importance of long-term observation is also evident. Dureau de la Malle, without mentioning the ‘red herring’ of spontaneous generation, wrote on the longevity of seeds: ‘the germinative faculty of the seeds of many species in a large number of families can be retained for 20 years under water, or for at least a hundred years in the soil, provided they are not subject to the action of atmospheric factors’ (Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle, 1825</xref>: 380).</p>
<p>Additionally, Dureau de la Malle was clearly influenced by the writings of the time. He had read the works of the agriculturalist Arthur Young (1741–1820) on crop rotation which included A Tour in Ireland 1776<italic>–1779</italic> and Voyages en France pendant les années 1787<italic>–</italic>1788<italic>–</italic>1789. Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle (1825)</xref> thought that nature operated on the same rotational principle. Cutting down oak and beech led to an alternative vegetation (‘alternance’) of birch and aspen. His thoughts were that ‘the “alternance” or alternative succession in the reproduction of plants, especially when one forces them to live in societies, is a general law of nature, a condition essential to their conservation and development’. He then generalized that ‘this law applies equally to trees, shrubs, and undershrubs, controls the vegetation of social plants, of artificial and natural prairies, of annual, biennial, or perennial species living socially or even isolated’. He then drew together the ideas from Arthur Young and his observations of nature into one grand design: ‘this theory, the basis of all good agriculture, and reduced to a fact by the proved success of the rotation of crops, is a fundamental law imposed upon vegetation’ (Dureau de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312448390">la Malle, 1825</xref>). He concluded (p. 381) on a theological note about this law and the ‘author (creator) of all that exists’ and that this law ‘est une loi fondamentale imposée à la végétation par l’auteur de tout ce qui existe’.</p>

<title>IV Conclusions</title>
<p>We can reflect how strange it seems to us that there was a reluctance to acknowledge the importance of the influx of seeds from other areas when it was so readily observed, as it was by Thoreau. Indeed it is curious that this was so much so that it was argued that the regrowth of new species after fire or clearance ‘must be’ either from spontaneous generation or long dormant seeds. While we now know that recruitment of seed from surrounding areas and seed dormancy of a range of timespans are both involved (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133312448390">Bradford and Nonogaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312448390">Fenner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312448390">Fenner and Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133312448390">Nicolas, 2003</xref>), what we learn is that some beliefs can have a validity almost irrespective of any evidence for or against them.</p>
<p>In this context, though, it is perhaps useful to make comparisons with the early discussions of the migration of birds. The observation of swallows flying low over water in the autumn and then disappearing led to a hibernation theory. This even included a search for dormant birds asleep in the mud of ponds or elsewhere in winter. Indeed in 1769 Gilbert White in his account of <italic>The Natural History of Selborne</italic> refers to this. He was still clinging to the idea that swallows hibernated in winter and indeed spent some considerable time trying to find swallows hibernating (see the edition of White, 1769, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133312448390">Scott, 1962</xref>: 46–48).</p>
<p>Beliefs and observations might thus be intertwined and influence each other, with the beliefs being resistant to change until there is strong enough empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133312448390">Bowen, 1981</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133312448390">Journet (1991</xref>: 467) concludes in her discussion of ecological theories, ‘the narratives produced by scientists … are created through a complex interaction of assumptions, values and observations … Scientific truth … is not found, but made’.</p>
<p>This, one feels, must be especially true where there are inadequate experimental observations with which to test held beliefs – though the point which is being made is that the experimental observations themselves can be influenced by beliefs.</p>
<p>During this interactive process, the discussion of ideas is a key factor and the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133312448390">Cameron and Matless (2011)</xref> is of especial importance in showing how ecological ideas evolved through the meetings of Clements, Tansley and other key figures of the time. In this significant context, Clements reflected on Darwin’s influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133312448390">Darwin, 1860</xref>) in shaping opinions where they do not rest on experimental knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133312448390">Clements (1909</xref>: 143) wrote the general observation that ‘several inherent difficulties have manifested themselves … chief among these there is the impossibility of ascertaining what might be called the majority opinion of botanists … no two botanists would draw the same line between what is proved and what is merely held’. More specifically, he saw that ‘Darwin’s own view seems to have remained plastic to a degree not always evident in his most widely read books’. Clements himself was thus attuned to the mutability of ideas.</p>
<p>The last word, however, perhaps best belongs to Thoreau, who wrote in response to Greeley’s challenge of Thoreau’s ‘theory’ about seeds that:<disp-quote>
<p>this is not so much my theory as [my] observation. Yours [the idea of spontaneous generation] is <italic>pure theory</italic> [original italics] without a single example to support it. As I have said, I do not intend to discuss the question of spontaneous generation for <italic>the burden of proof lies with those who maintain that theory</italic> [my italics]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312448390">Dean, 1993</xref>: 634)</p>
</disp-quote>
The tensions between observations and theory are ever thus.</p>
