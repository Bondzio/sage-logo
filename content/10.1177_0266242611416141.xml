<p>This article examines the effects of managerial practice and philosophy variables – high-performance work systems (HPWS) and partnership philosophy – on the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and sales growth. The results from a sample of 119 young high-technology firms indicate a non-significant relationship between EO and firm growth. However, firms combining HPWS or partnership philosophy with EO realized significantly higher levels of growth. Specifically, the results suggest that the promise of EO as a means of enhancing the growth trajectories of young firms depends on the extent to which these organizations embrace and establish certain human resource practices and philosophies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The entrepreneurial orientation (EO) construct has been the subject of a growing stream of literature addressing the ability of firms to transform entrepreneurial opportunities into new or renewed growth trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611416141">Covin and Wales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611416141">Miller (1983)</xref>, entrepreneurially-oriented firms uncover and pursue possible avenues for achieving growth through an emphasis on innovation, proactiveness and risk-taking within their strategic processes and behavior. While EO has been generally linked to firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>), the behavioral orientation has produced mixed findings in the context of young firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611416141">Hughes and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611416141">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242611416141">Stam and Elfring, 2008</xref>). This article explores this question further in order to assess the direct effects of EO in young firms as well as the moderating effects that human resource management (HRM) systems and philosophy may have on the performance effects of EO in young firms. Young firms face a distinct set of challenges, including the attainment of social legitimacy, resource stability and operational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242611416141">Stinchcombe, 1965</xref>). This study suggests that whether young firms are able to successfully translate EO into new or renewed growth may depend, in part, on their ability to leverage their human resources effectively. Human resources play an integral role in the entrepreneurial process, as people ultimately represent the active element which drives the process forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611416141">Baron, 2007</xref>). Thus, factors that affect employees’ behavioral choices and performance are likely to be instrumental to the successful utilization of EO in young firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611416141">Burgelman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242611416141">Pinchot, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to focus on young firms, the present study examines organizations that are fewer than 10 years of age (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611416141">Davidsson and Kloftsen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611416141">Reuber and Fischer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242611416141">Steffens et al., 2009</xref>). Newly-founded firms are typically resource-constrained and must make trade-offs concerning how they organize work, and not many young firms will have invested in the development of HRM systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611416141">Cassell et al., 2002</xref>). This issue lies at the heart of the current investigation, which assesses the extent to which HRM factors, such as high-performance work systems (HPWS) and managerial philosophies such as partnership philosophy, affect the relationship between EO and performance. Generally, HPWS are defined as ‘a group of separate but interconnected human resource practices designed to enhance employees’ skills and effort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>: 1069). Traditionally, measures of HPWS include practices related to structured and comprehensive approaches to recruitment and selection, pay-for-performance and other incentive-based compensation plans, information sharing, rigorous performance appraisal processes and training in both generic and company-specific skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, partnership represents a managerial philosophy dedicated to developing a high level of commitment and trust between management and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611416141">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611416141">McCartan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is possible that partnership and HPWS covary, we anticipate that they represent fundamentally different organizational phenomena constituting distinct variables of interest. HPWS reflect a system of specific practices, while partnership operates at the level of managerial philosophy to assess the viewpoint from which a young firm’s manager (and often founder) perceives their employees. Therefore, HPWS and partnership philosophy are introduced into the conceptual model of EO effectiveness advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin (1991)</xref> and refined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref>, as they capture distinct approaches that young firms may take to manage their human capital productively.</p>
<p>This article makes a number of contributions. First, by assessing internal firm-level moderators of entrepreneurial effectiveness, this study adds to an underexplored area in the literature (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611416141">Escribá-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611416141">Kuratko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611416141">Monsen and Boss, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin (1991)</xref> suggest that research exploring moderators of the EO-firm performance relationship may be organized into one of three categories: environmental, strategic or organizational factors. Among these categories, few studies have explored moderators within the organizational boundaries of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0266242611416141">Wiklund and Shepherd, 2003</xref>). However, this line of research is at the heart of recent calls for the exploration of additional moderators to further specify and tighten the EO–firm performance relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps in no other area do such investigations seem more critical than that of young firms, an area where prior results have been mixed with regard to the effectiveness of EO.</p>
<p>Second, the current model builds on recent work concerning fruitful directions for research exploring the intersections between strategic HRM and models of organizational entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611416141">Collins and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611416141">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611416141">Hornsby and Kuratko, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611416141">Kang and Snell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611416141">Kaya, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid (2006)</xref> theorize that it is the <italic>fit</italic> between strategic business processes and human resource systems that ultimately influences the effectiveness of a firm’s strategic implementation. By investigating EO, we provide insight into how human resource systems and philosophies may fit with an organization’s <italic>entrepreneurial</italic> strategic business processes: that is, the ‘methods, practices and decision-making styles managers use to act entrepreneurially’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>: 136)</p>
<p>Finally, this study adds to managerial knowledge by studying young firms. Much of the earlier work on EO and on the connection between human resource systems and innovation was developed in the context of more established firms. This study takes a different approach, seeking to understand the nature of these theoretical connections in young firms where resources are constrained and individual managerial decisions are amplified. Furthermore, in this study we cast a careful eye toward young firm growth. Firm growth has been largely attributed to factors related to the entrepreneur, firm, strategy and firm structural characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611416141">Hansen and Hamilton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242611416141">Storey, 1994</xref>). This study adds to this literature by exploring three particular aspects of firm strategy and structure: entrepreneurial orientation, HPWS and partnership.</p>

<title>EO and young-firm performance</title>
<p>The concept of EO captures an organization’s entrepreneurial strategy-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>) and characterizes the extent to which organizations may be considered entrepreneurial in their firm-level behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611416141">Covin et al., 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611416141">Miller (1983)</xref>, EO is a theoretical construct revealed through an organization’s collective exhibition of innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking. To date, the most notable association involving the EO construct within the literature has been its relationship with firm performance. In a meta-analysis of 51 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al. (2009)</xref> observed a generally positive and moderately large (<italic>r</italic> = .242) correlation between EO and firm performance.</p>
<p>While it is reasonable to expect that young firms pursuing higher-risk, higher-reward strategies are likely to achieve greater levels of growth, in practice the results have been mixed. Exploring a set of 90 new ventures in the high-tech software industry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242611416141">Stam and Elfring (2008)</xref> observed a non-significant relationship between EO and performance relative to competitors. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611416141">Hughes and Morgan (2007)</xref> observed that the dimensions of EO (with the exception of proactiveness) specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> were non-significantly (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) related to customer acquisition and market share gains in young high-technology firms. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611416141">Lee et al. (2001)</xref> observed EO to be positively related to firm sales growth within a sample of young high-technology start-ups in South Korea. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611416141">Runyan et al. (2008)</xref> observed EO to be a stronger predictor of firm performance in younger firms. In addition, a recent study of Spanish firms found a positive relationship between strategic orientation (with a measure including many of the EO elements) and subjective firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611416141">Escribá-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, recent qualitative work reports that a main contrast between growing and stagnant small businesses is a culture of innovation and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611416141">Hansen and Hamilton, 2011</xref>). Thus, the relationship between EO and performance in young firms is not straightforward. This may be due in part to the criticality of certain moderating factors within the EO–firm performance relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). However, despite moderating conditions, young high-technology firms pursuing a high level of EO are likely to attain higher performance for several reasons. First, EO includes such processes as ‘experimenting with promising new technologies, being willing to seize new product–market opportunities and having a predisposition to undertake risky ventures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>: 136). As EO captures the process through which entrepreneurial initiatives are explored within organizations, it represents an important means through which young firms are able to identify opportunities for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0266242611416141">Wiklund et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, EO represents an avenue through which new market entry opportunities may be explored, evaluated and undertaken by young high-technology firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611416141">Sathe, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, young firms with a high level of EO are likely to have better access to critical resources. Firms with higher EO are more likely to build and maintain strategic alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611416141">Marino et al., 2002</xref>). These networks can provide young high-technology firms with better access to information and resources that further enable their organizational growth. In this regard, EO also drives young firms to develop deeper relationships with their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0266242611416141">Walter et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, young firms with a high level of EO should be able to make more productive use of the resources under their control. EO has positive implications for organizational learning, increasing a firm’s ability both to acquire and utilize market information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611416141">Escribá-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611416141">Keh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0266242611416141">Wang, 2008</xref>). Firms with high levels of EO tend to be characterized as more clever at identifying uses for firm resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611416141">Li et al., 2008</xref>). This is of particular relevance within the young-firm context, in which resources often must be recycled, reapplied or otherwise reused.</p>
<p>Moreover, with greater EO, firms are better able to combine their existing knowledge to form new insights regarding possible sources of market opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611416141">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and have a greater chance of identifying industry altering breakthrough innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0266242611416141">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0266242611416141">Wu et al. (2008)</xref>, EO enhances an organization’s ability to thoroughly explore and implement its intellectual capital in order to create higher levels of innovation. In short, theoretical guidance suggests a positive relationship between EO and young-firm performance. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1: EO will be positively associated with young, high-technology firm sales growth.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section4-0266242611416141">
<title>Human resource practice and philosophy moderators of the EO–firm performance relationship</title>
<p>Collectively, research exploring EO suggests that moderators play an important role in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). Following the conclusion of their EO-performance meta-analysis, Rauch et al. posit that ‘detailed examination of the conditions under which EO is particularly beneficial (or detrimental) to performance is an area where substantial theoretical and empirical contributions can be made’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">2009</xref>: 780). Constituting a firm-level strategic orientation, EO has the potential to interact with other aspects of an organization’s system of strategic business practices and managerial philosophies such as HPWS and partnership philosophy. These constructs relate to the management of what is arguably the most important resource in young firms, human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611416141">Collis and Montgomery, 1998</xref>). As noted by several recent enquiries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611416141">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611416141">Kaya, 2006</xref>), there are many benefits to taking a strategic approach to the management of a firm’s human resources. As such, young firms pursuing an EO may benefit further from the development of HPWS and partnership philosophies.</p>

<title>High-performance work systems</title>
<p>The strategic HRM perspective has consistently argued for a system-level analysis of HRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611416141">Delery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>). While a precise and consistent definition of HPWS has not yet been agreed upon in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>), a general consensus suggests that HPWS is a systemic construct that includes a combination of interconnected practices related to structured selection plans, incentive and ownership-based compensation programmes, investment in training and development, information sharing and flexible work practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611416141">Arthur, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611416141">Batt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0266242611416141">Zacharatos et al., 2005</xref>). This literature relies on the assumption that a system of high-performance human resource practices helps to create and develop higher levels of employee skills, motivation to apply those skills and opportunities for employees to engage in discretionary participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Several notable studies have theorized that various individual human resource practices (i.e. rewards and compensation, teamwork, information sharing, etc.) may influence firm-level entrepreneurial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611416141">Kuratko et al., 1999</xref>). First, young firms pursuing a high level of EO are likely to benefit from pairing this posture with a selective approach to staffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>). Utilizing selective staffing techniques ensures that successful applicants have navigated several hurdles. This type of procedure provides better information to decision-makers and increases the firm’s face validity by signaling to applicants that the organization is selective about whom it hires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611416141">Rodwell and Teo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>). This is particularly critical in young firms where hiring suboptimal candidates can have disastrous implications for team dynamics and organizational growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0266242611416141">Williamson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, young firms that routinely invest in training and development activities are likely to see an increase in the levels of knowledge, skills and abilities within their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611416141">Kotey and Folker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>). Enhancements to human capital further allow firms to achieve higher, more productive levels of innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0266242611416141">Thornhill, 2006</xref>). Employees who are able to refine their skill sets continually as necessary to exploit new market opportunities are likely to be more productive in a high EO organization. Additionally, increases in human capital are of consequence in the young-firm context in which individual employees generally are tasked with fulfilling multiple roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611416141">Cardon and Stevens, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, young firms that utilize structured compensation practices that reward high performance are likely to realize benefits. Entrepreneurial behavior is engendered by reward systems that account for feedback and organizational goals while also emphasizing results and individual responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611416141">Kuratko et al., 1999</xref>). As the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242611416141">Shane et al. (2003)</xref> suggests, improvements in entrepreneurial motivation within a firm are likely to lead to a greater number of entrepreneurial opportunities being recognized, developed and successfully executed. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton (2003)</xref> found that small businesses which employ HRM practices that promote discretionary behavior have higher degrees of entrepreneurial performance. Many of the key elements of the discretionary behaviors studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton (2003)</xref> were linked to compensation practices, such as profit-sharing and incentive-based pay.</p>
<p>Finally, by encouraging information-sharing practices, organizations are likely to be more flexible and adaptable when experimenting with new initiatives. With more transparent communication, firms can demonstrate strong managerial support and empower individuals at all levels of the organization to pursue entrepreneurial initiatives with less impediment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611416141">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611416141">Kuratko et al., 1999</xref>). Sharing information supports the exhibition of EO, as new entrepreneurial initiatives arise through human agency and volition when individuals process and select opportunities to pursue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611416141">Schuler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242611416141">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the present research posits that a human resource system that draws upon the human resource practices described above – those practices theorized to produce a HPWS – will work interactively with EO in the young firm context to further enhance firm growth. This rationale builds upon existing research in the field of strategic HRM (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>) in aggregating a variety of established human resource practices, in order to determine the extent to which a young high-tech firm utilizes a <italic>system</italic> that promotes a high-performance workforce, and how this system works to enhance the effect of an entrepreneurial orientation. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2: High performance work systems will moderate positively the relationship between an EO and young, high-tech firm sales growth, and young firms combining EO with HPWS will outperform those that are less adoptive of such systems.</p>

<title>Partnership philosophy</title>
<p>The managerial philosophy of the owner/manager is likely to have a significant effect on performance in young firms, especially those that are entrepreneurially-oriented. Unlike in larger firms, younger organizations cannot hide poor performers, which places a premium on the managerial philosophy enacted to motivate employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0266242611416141">Tocher and Rutherford, 2009</xref>). A managerial philosophy based on partnership is likely to affect the entrepreneurial effectiveness of young firms in a positive way. Partnership is a model that asks young firm leaders to view employees as strategic partners in the success of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611416141">Guest et al., 2008</xref>). Partnership philosophy has its roots in the industrial relations movement. A complete description of this movement is beyond the scope of the present analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611416141">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611416141">Guest et al., 2008</xref>); however, it is noteworthy that partnership focuses on the way in which management (and often ownership in young firms) views the organization’s employees. In the context of young entrepreneurial firms, a managerial philosophy of partnership asks owner/managers to view employees as fellow owners in the firm. While strategic human resource research suggests that human resource philosophy drives policy adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>), at times young firms may lack the resources necessary to develop robust systems to facilitate HPWS early in their development.</p>
<p>At the core of a managerial philosophy based on partnership is the notion of mutuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611416141">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611416141">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611416141">Guest et al., 2008</xref>). Mutuality stresses that what is good for the employment base also will have benefits for the organization. In young organizations, this means laying a foundation that may help lead individual employees to think and behave like co-owners in the firm. This is particularly salient in entrepreneurially-oriented young firms, as individual performance is likely to be closely connected to firm performance. Emphasizing the role of mutuality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611416141">Guest and Peccei (2001)</xref> describe partnership as a concerted effort by owners and managers to create an environment in which employees take a significant psychological stake in the success of the organization through high levels of attachment, commitment and involvement in the firm. Thus, partnership encourages both employees and management to focus on shared goals and interests without being derailed by potentially different positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611416141">Martinez and Stuart, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Trust between employees and the owner/manager may be a key to unlocking the power of EO in young firms. Indeed organizational trust has been shown to be influential to the performance of EO firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611416141">De Clercq et al., 2010</xref>). If employees feel that they are trusted to take calculated risks and are empowered to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, then the organization may be better able to translate an EO into firm performance. However, if employees do not feel trusted by the young firm’s owner/manager with whom they are likely to interact fairly regularly, then they may be more concerned with protecting their employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2005</xref>) than maximizing the effectiveness of their firm’s EO. Under such circumstances innovative ideas may stay locked within the employment base, limiting the young firm’s ability to achieve and exploit higher levels of EO. Additionally, by stressing collaboration and open communication sharing, young firms may benefit further from their EO. For high-EO firms to exploit opportunities, they must recognize that these opportunities exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611416141">Kirzner, 1997</xref>). Partnership philosophy dictates that the owner/manager works closely with their employees in organizational decision-making, and that pertinent knowledge is shared with all organizational actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611416141">McCartan, 2002</xref>). In this way, by establishing such a governing organizational philosophy, managers of young firms are better able to propagate the entrepreneurial goals and strategies of the organization to other employees.</p>
<p>Evidence from a case study of 30 profitable small businesses reports that successful firms had governing philosophies that ‘operate open and inclusive approaches to management, stressing routine and unmediated communication between managers and workers, flat hierarchies, autonomy, trust and teamwork’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611416141">Drummond and Stone, 2007</xref>: 196). We expect to build upon this finding, as based on the proceeding rationales we expect partnership philosophy to enhance the effectiveness of EO within the firm, and ultimately improve young-firm performance. Therefore, we hypothesize:
<disp-quote>
<p>H3: Partnership philosophy will moderate positively the relationship between an entrepreneurial orientation and young, high-tech firm sales growth, and young high-tech firms combining EO with partnership philosophy will outperform those that are less adoptive of such a philosophy.</p>

<title>Sample and data collection</title>
<p>The sample and data collection efforts for this study arose from a larger study of United States-based young firms in the high-technology sector. The National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) database provides data on firm sales performance and employment growth using Dun and Bradstreet market report data. Approximately 2000 young firms (fewer than 10 years old) were selected as an initial sampling frame from the NETS database. Each firm employed at least 10 employees and was listed as an establishment operating in various technology sectors ((SIC-designated industry codes 5045 and 7371–7379). This limited set of industries allowed for a test of firms operating within sectors that traditionally have been identified as high-tech fields (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242611416141">Schilling and Steensma, 2002</xref>). The additional screens were put in place to create a relatively homogeneous sample of young firms.</p>
<p>After pilot testing, an invitation to participate in a web-based survey was mailed to the contact person listed in the NETS database (generally the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) or another corporate officer) during autumn 2007. The survey included measures of 2006 sales growth, 2006 net sales, HPWS, EO, partnership philosophy and other demographic and historic information. Up to four follow-up attempts were made to contact potential respondents: these resulted in 215 responses, providing an overall response rate of 10.7 % however, only 119 respondents provided complete information on the dependent variable of interest in this study. Although low, the response rate for this study is in line with other surveys of young firms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611416141">Neck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0266242611416141">Voordeckers et al., 2007</xref>) and those of top executives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611416141">Hambrick et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242611416141">Simsek, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the relatively low response rate, steps were taken to assess response bias. The first test examined the differences in net sales, employee levels and firm age between responding and non-responding firms. The historical information used to make the comparison was retrieved from the NETS database and indicated that responding firms were slightly smaller (median of 25 versus 31 employees) and had generated slightly less sales volume ($2.5m vs. $3.4m), but these differences were not statistically significant between net sales (<italic>t</italic> = −1.257, <italic>p</italic> = .209), total employees (<italic>t</italic> = −1.502, <italic>p</italic> = .133) or firm age (<italic>t</italic> = .326, <italic>p</italic> = .745).</p>
<p>Also, a time-trend extrapolation test was utilized in order to test for non-response bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611416141">Armstrong and Overton, 1977</xref>). This test assumes that late responders are more similar to non-responders than those who reply at the beginning of the study. Individuals who provided data after the second contact were considered late respondents. In order to examine the differences between these two groups, a multivariate general linear model procedure was used to test the null hypothesis of no significant difference between early and late responders. This analysis indicated no significant difference between the two groups (Wilks’ lambda = .934, <italic>p</italic> = .282) on the variables included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial orientation</title>
<p>EO was measured using the scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin (1989)</xref>, which is a widely accepted and validated nine-item, seven-point scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al.

While these three dimensions of EO can exhibit independent variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>), prior empirical research provides support for the idea that the EO dimensions of innovativeness, risk-taking and proactiveness ‘are of equal importance in explaining business performance’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>: 778). As such, we follow previous research in aggregating the nine items into a single measure of a firm’s EO by taking the average of the nine items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin, 1989</xref>). (The Cronbach’s alpha reliability estimate for the scale is .854.)</p>

<title>High-performance work systems</title>
<p>HPWS were measured using items adopted from existing strategic HRM research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242611416141">Sels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>). Specifically, the items were drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al. (2005)</xref> and asked respondents to indicate the percentage of employees that were covered by each of the selected practices encompassing the major human resource functions:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242611416141" list-type="bullet">

<list-item><p>flexible work practices;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>job security; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>pay level.</p></list-item></list>
<p>We also followed the prescriptions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242611416141">Sels et al. (2006)</xref> in rewording the questions to reflect better the small business context. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way (2002)</xref>, the items then were summed to create an overall measure of HPWS use in each organization.</p>
<p>This approach is consistent with previous work in the strategic HRM literature, which advocates the use of a system-level measure for both methodological and theoretical reasons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611416141">Batt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611416141">Becker and Gerhart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611416141">Delery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611416141">Liao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611416141">Way, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0266242611416141">Zacharatos et al., 2005</xref>). The single-measure approach supports the theoretical principles of assessing the effects of a system-level reflection of HRM. As expressed by Becker and Huselid:
<disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the extant practice in the empirical literatures that an index derived from prior empirical work is the more appropriate measure of the HRM system. First, a single index reflects the notion of a single HRM system as a strategic asset. Second, since the typical index is a summation of individual elements of the HRM system, it implies that within the broad middle range of the index there are multiple ways to increase its value. For example, a strong emphasis on one or two policies will have the same index value as more modest attention to a wide range of polices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611416141">1998</xref>: 64)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Creating a singular measure of HPWS implicitly embraces the theoretical notion of equifinality. If one firm is less rigorous in its hiring practices, it is possible that this may be offset (i.e. ‘substituted’) by greater investments in training, or perhaps greater use of a skills-based compensation system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611416141">Delery and Shaw (2001)</xref> both comment on this issue. For example, Delery and Shaw state:
<disp-quote>
<p>While some general HRM practices or policies (e.g. selective staffing) may be more crucial to the development of certain work force characteristics (e.g. KSAs) than others, it should be clear that two firms may be able to develop the same level of skill among their work forces using very different individual HRM practices. This is the idea of substitutability of practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611416141">Ichniowski et al., 1997</xref>) and leads to equifinality among HR [human resource] systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611416141">2001</xref>: 176)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to remain theoretically consistent with these prescriptions, the present study follows existing research by employing a unitary measure of HPWS utilization. In addition, the unitary measure was deemed appropriate, considering the relatively high Cronbach’s alpha of .724, a similar value to previous reports in studies of HPWS (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611416141">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611416141">Takeuchi et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0266242611416141">
<title>Firm sales growth</title>
<p>Firm performance was operationalized as sales growth, which was assessed using self-reported sales growth figures reported as a percentage. Often, sales growth has been relied upon as the outcome variable in prior studies of young firms and within entrepreneurship (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611416141">Brush and Vanderwerf, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611416141">Covin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611416141">Reuber and Fischer, 2002</xref>), and has been employed as an important outcome in the strategic HRM literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611416141">Batt, 2002</xref>). Self-reported measures of performance have a significant history of use in research linking managerial practices to firm performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611416141">Delaney and Huselid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611416141">Guthrie, 2001</xref>). As privately held firms are often reluctant to report financial information, much of the current research on young firms relies on self-reported measures of performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611416141">Escribá-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0266242611416141">Wiklund et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, recent evidence provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0266242611416141">Wall et al. (2004)</xref> indicates strong convergent validity between self-reported measures of firm performance and objective measures.</p>
<p>The validity of the self-report sales growth information was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between the self-report measures from previous time periods and those from the NETS database (based on employment and sales growth from 2004–2005). Historical data was used, as the time lag in the NETS database did not allow for a comparison during the time period within which the dependent variable data was collected. In this case, ICC(1) values (a rating of the ratio between rating variance and total variance) were created to assess the degree of agreement between the self-report measures and the archival NETS data. ICC(1) estimates are viewed as the proportion of variance in a measure explained by group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611416141">Datta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611416141">Shrout and Fleiss, 1979</xref>). The results of the analysis demonstrate a high degree of consistency between the self-reported measures and the NETS data for both sales (ICC1 = .564) and number of employees (ICC1 = .759). While common agreement is lacking for the acceptable range of an ICC(1) value, both of these items easily exceed the median ICC(1) value of .12 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611416141">James (1982)</xref>.</p>

<title>Controls</title>
<p>Control variables for industry classification, prior sales growth, firm size, firm age and ownership structure were included. Industry classification was controlled for with a dummy code for industry membership at the three-digit level. Firm size was controlled for using the natural log of the number of employees. Firm age was measured as the age since initial firm formation, and ownership structure was dummy coded to indicate whether or not the firm was still being led by one or more of the firm’s founders. Prior sales growth was taken from the NETS database for the growth in sales from the year prior to that reported on the survey. Each of these is likely to have an effect on the utilization of HPWS and also on the firm’s strategic orientation and performance. With regard to ownership structure, whether or not the founder was still leading the firm was included as a control, as this is likely to affect both practice utilization and performance. Also, venture capital financing was controlled for by using single-item responses in the survey. Venture capital financing is an important control variable, as financers may seek to formalize a firm’s management practices.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A Harman’s single factor test was performed to test for common method bias. This test is conducted by loading each of the study variables into an exploratory factor analysis. If a single factor is found after performing this test, it is likely that common method bias exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611416141">Podsakoff and Organ, 1986</xref>). The items measuring EO, HPWS and partnership were entered into a principal factor analysis with Varimax rotation. The results of this test provided six factors with an eigenvalue exceeding 1.0 and explained 77.34 percent of the cumulative variance. This result suggests that common method variance was not substantial in this particular study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611416141">Podsakoff and Organ, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the exploratory factor analysis, a three-factor confirmatory factor analysis was completed using principal components factoring with Varimax rotation. The results of this analysis indicate that the EO and partnership items all loaded on single and separate factors. 16 of the 21 HPWS items loaded on to a third separate factor, with five items cross-loading onto the other two factors, therefore we dropped these items to enable the common variance of our indicators to reflect the unitary latent construct of HPWS more consistently (see the above discussion of the measurement of the HPWS construct). We also ran the analysis with the five cross-loaded items included in the HPWS measure and the results were invariant. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis with the five cross-loaded HPWS items removed are available in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242611416141">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611416141">Table 1</xref> suggests a statistical relationship between the HPWS measure (<italic>r</italic> = .25 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and sales growth, and also between partnership philosophy and sales growth (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

This hypothesis is not supported, as EO was not related to sales growth (β = .012, <italic>p</italic> = .692).

<p>H2 predicted an interaction effect between HPWS and EO on firm performance. After mean-centering the constructs of interest, we performed a regression analysis of the hypothesized interaction between HPWS and EO on firm performance. The test was shown to be significant (β = .024, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In order to analyse the moderation effect further, the interaction term was assessed using the graphing procedures outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611416141">Aiken and West (1991)</xref>. This graph can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611416141">Figure 1</xref> and shows that EO has a more positive relationship with sales growth among firms with higher HPWS scores. H3 also predicted a moderating effect for partnership (β = .122, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). This hypothesis was supported as well in the same direction as the HPWS interaction term. This relationship is graphically demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266242611416141">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Key findings and implications</title>
<p>Several theoretical implications can be gathered from the results. Specifically, this work adds to a growing discussion on the factors that help to produce new venture growth (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611416141">Hansen and Hamilton, 2011</xref>). The present research advances the notion that a young firm’s ability to leverage its EO into significant, meaningful gains in firm performance depends on HRM practices and managerial philosophies. This study observes that the growth effectiveness of EO in young high-technology firms is significantly enhanced through an organizational commitment to the development of HPWS and partnership philosophy. By assessing these relationships, the study provides greater understanding and evidence regarding the potential benefits associated with closer linkages between a firm’s entrepreneurial processes and HRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611416141">Baron, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611416141">Collins and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611416141">Schuler, 1986</xref>), and brings forward the need for more thorough examinations of the EO–performance relationship in young firms.</p>
<p>A growing body of work suggests that systems of human resource practices are important for improving firm performance, to which this study contributes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton (2003)</xref> found that HRM practices that encourage discretionary behavior, knowledge sharing among employees and organizational learning were related to a firm’s self-reported entrepreneurial performance. Further, work by several authors has demonstrated that certain managerial factors, such as rewards and compensation, managerial support and organizational structure, are determinants of a firm’s entrepreneurial culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611416141">Kuratko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611416141">Messeghem, 2003</xref>). This article extends this body of knowledge by demonstrating that the influence of EO on young firm performance is non-significant in the absence of effective HRM, as evidenced through HPWS and a managerial philosophy of partnership.</p>
<p>In general, the finding concerning a non-significant, direct main effect of EO on young firm sales growth is surprising, given the generally positive effect observed between EO and similar cross-sectional measurements of perceived financial performance elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>) and in work on small and medium sized-enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611416141">Escribá-Esteve et al., 2008</xref>). There are many possible explanations for this finding. First, despite our efforts to guard against threats to validity, we should note that it may be simply that the non-significant relationship was an artifact of this particular study or the result of a relatively small sample size. Further, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess (1996)</xref> note, EO may not influence all performance outcomes all the time: it may be that sales growth is less affected by EO in young high-technology firms, where firms are often driven to pursue growth strategies. Another possible explanation lies in the observation that the performance consequences of EO may grow in magnitude over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0266242611416141">Zahra and Covin, 1995</xref>) – nonetheless, EO research typically has measured EO and firm sales growth measures simultaneously and generally observed a positive relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these possibilities, this is not the first study to demonstrate a non-significant relationship between EO and young-firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611416141">Hughes and Morgan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242611416141">Stam and Elfring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0266242611416141">Walter et al., 2006</xref>). This pattern implies that in young firms, it is essential that critical moderating conditions are simultaneously observed and established, if EO is to have any beneficial consequence for firm performance. For example, these conditions include the capability to develop meaningful relationships with external partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0266242611416141">Walter et al., 2006</xref>), particularly within differing industry environments (Stam and Elfring, 2006). The present study extends understanding of the conditions of critical significance to young firm performance to within the firm’s organizational boundaries, with meaningful implications for EO scholarship.</p>
<p>While the main effect for EO is non-significant, the results reinforce the notion that EO has contingent value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). Our study suggests that in young organizations, the value of EO depends upon HRM systems and philosophies. HPWS is observed to interact with EO to enhance a young firm’s ability to achieve above-average firm performance. Our investigation of this relationship helps provide a more nuanced understanding of the important connection between EO and HRM. Young firms seeking to enact EO are likely to see the benefits of being diligent in their selection and development of human capital. As many entrepreneurs often struggle with the day-to-day management of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0266242611416141">Tocher and Rutherford, 2009</xref>), our results highlight the value of spending additional time and resources in establishing HPWS in young, entrepreneurially-oriented firms.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of internal managerial philosophy, the results of this study suggest that a philosophy of partnership is also an enabler of EO effectiveness in young firms. As a collection of beliefs and behaviors, EO can be said to be present ‘where an “entrepreneurial” philosophy permeates an entire organization’s outlook and operations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611416141">Covin and Miles, 1999</xref>: 48). Particularly in young firms, existing scholarship has limited understanding of the important interaction between HRM philosophies and EO as a potential lever of firm growth. A managerial philosophy based on partnership appears to have significant utility in advancing the entrepreneurial performance of young organizations. As such, these results suggest that investigations of additional nuances between EO and managerial philosophies may be fruitful avenues for additional study.</p>
<p>This study also makes a contribution to the literature through an analysis of the connection between human resource factors and firm-level entrepreneurial behavior. Many authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611416141">Becker and Huselid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611416141">Collins and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611416141">Hayton, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611416141">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611416141">Heneman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611416141">Hornsby and Kuratko, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611416141">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611416141">Kang and Snell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611416141">Kaya, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611416141">Schuler, 1986</xref>) have called for additional research in this area, however, relatively little work has been undertaken; therefore, this study advances and supports the efficacy of such calls.</p>

<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>The results also provide insight into the benefits of HRM practices in young, high-technology firms those firms that expend time and resources to formally develop their base of human capital via HRM systems and philosophies appear to enhance entrepreneurial effort to a level where it can meaningfully impact firm performance. This conclusion will resonate with many practitioners, particularly those reliant on the strength of their human capital to define a competitive advantage. However, practitioners may not be fully aware of how critical structured, systematic approaches to managing human resources are for young firms, in order to achieve growth through a firm orientation toward risk-taking, proactiveness and innovation. As managers of young firms are generally encouraged to manifest entrepreneurial orientations, this finding is particularly important. In sum, young firms attempting to leverage entrepreneurial processes appear to be considerably well served by creating a partnership-based culture and developing a systematic approach to human resource selection, training, job analysis and compensation.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Although the results of this study are instructive in a number of ways, the implications should be considered in light of the study’s limitations and directions for future research. First, while the theoretical guidance of a behavioral model of EO effectiveness suggests that EO outcome relationships should exhibit moderation from internal organizational variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>), it is also possible that these variables may reciprocally influence EO. However, we believe this potential limitation exemplifies a theoretical ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem. We presently argue that EO is influenced by a firm’s exhibition of certain HRM practices and philosophies, which incidentally helps to explain the lack of significance concerning the direct effect of EO on young high-technology firm growth. Nonetheless, it is still conceivable that the efficacy of these internal HRM factors may be influenced by higher levels of EO (i.e. EO may also moderate the relationship between HRM factors and firm performance outcomes). Yet, a rationale for contingency would suggest that it is ultimately the presence of both EO and HRM practices and philosophies that together enable superior performance. Moreover, given the limitation of our data being cross-sectional, the multiplicative interaction would be invariant. Therefore, not excluding the possibility that HRM practices and philosophies may interact with firm-level orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611416141">Hornsby et al., 1993</xref>), we believe that our present framing is appropriate and sheds interesting light upon a theoretically meaningful EO moderation–performance relationship, as calls have long advocated for within the EO literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611416141">Rauch et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A second potential limitation of this study is that the theorized relationships were tested using a single performance variable, self-reported sales growth and within a particular industry context: high-technology. While sales growth is a particularly salient indicator of performance in young firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611416141">Brush and Vanderwerf, 1992</xref>), future research should consider exploring the relationships herein using indicators of firm performance from secondary sources. While it is difficult to access such data on private businesses, future work can examine the conclusions made by this study further if such data is reached. In addition, other financial and non-financial outcomes, such as survival, profitability, market share, employee retention and corporate reputation could be examined, as EO may not have a positive effect on all measures of firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). In particular, we believe that a longitudinal study of the effects of EO and HRM factors on firm survival is warranted. Given the risk of failure among young businesses, it would be particularly salient to investigate survival relationships. Although these limitations do not deviate from what have been deemed to be acceptable boundaries in prior research, nonetheless the results of this study must be interpreted in light of these limitations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0266242611416141">
<title>Directions for future research</title>
<p>Future research exploring EO, HRM and firm performance has the potential to be of great additional value. To begin, the null finding for the main effect of EO supports a contextualized view that moderators are an important theoretical element in the model linking EO to young firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>). The current study accentuates the importance of future theoretical and empirical explorations into the possibility of other moderating influences from the domain of HRM, which serve to further strengthen the EO–firm performance relationship. In particular, the present study suggests that finer-grained analyses of specific HPWS practices, such as compensation and rewards systems, information sharing and flexible work practices, may represent potentially fruitful areas to explore.</p>
<p>Additionally, numerous issues at the nexus of EO and HRM are likely to become increasingly salient, as the understanding of the EO concept continues to evolve in the literature. Among other possible avenues for future research is the notion that EO captures organizational processes related to ‘<italic>experimenting</italic> with promising new technologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611416141">Lumpkin and Dess, 1996</xref>: 136, emphasis added). While prior research has recognized that EO implies a process of experimentation, little attention has been devoted to the human resource implications of managing businesses as experiments. Understanding how best to manage organizational processes of trial-and-error learning within and throughout firms will require future research to theorize and investigate more thoroughly the utility of various human resource mechanisms and systems as a means of supporting, directing and, ultimately, harnessing the power of EO to facilitate firm growth.</p>
<p>A second research direction at the intersection of EO and HRM stems from Covin and Slevin’s observation that EO is manifested within firms such that entrepreneurial beliefs and behaviors ‘pervade the organization at all levels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611416141">Covin and Slevin, 1991</xref>: 7). As research on the development and effects of EO is further extended within and examined at all organizational levels, and particularly within non-managerial contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611416141">Monsen and Boss, 2009</xref>), a finer-grained perspective on HRM issues such as staffing, compensation, promotion and leadership development will become necessary in order to understand fully how to manage the exhibition of EO as an organizational phenomenon effectively. Recognition and examination in future research of the organizational pervasiveness of EO at levels below that of the top management team will serve to elucidate further the contribution of other organizational actors to the effective deployment of EO.</p>
<p>Finally, future work also could investigate the construct of partnership in greater depth. While the industrial relations literature has begun to develop a conceptual model of partnership (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611416141">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611416141">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611416141">Guest et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611416141">McCartan, 2002</xref>), more exploration is necessary to understand fully this employment model in non-unionized contexts. Examining this model more completely and extending its connections to additional literatures within entrepreneurship represents a potentially fruitful avenue for investigation. In particular, managerial philosophies with which growth-oriented young-firm leaders may embed and nurture motivation in new employees are an important area of investigation.</p>
<p>In sum, the results of this study are instructive concerning the importance of HRM in the ability of a young firm to transform its EO into new or renewed growth. The findings suggest that the development of EO alone may be significantly less beneficial to the performance of young firms than the research in more established contexts would indicate. However, the study findings suggest that the effect of EO on the growth of young high-technology firms can be raised to meaningful levels when it is exhibited in concert with HRM systems and philosophies such as HPWS and a managerial philosophy towards partnership. While this study only marks the beginnings of promising new areas of investigation between EO, HRM systems and philosophies and firm performance, nonetheless it represents an essential cornerstone upon which future research may build.</p>
