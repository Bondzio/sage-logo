<p>This book is a collection of professional presentations in various areas of mental health practice including children, adult, and geriatric professional cares. The main points in all presentations are the inefficiency and high cost of the current mental health care system and a need for change in policy and practice. Mental health professionals provide evidence that in depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, long-term medical treatment is harmful. They frequently highlight that they are not antimedication, but they believe that misusing and overusing medicine is a form of destructive treatment. The book also provides a history of psychotherapy by Cummings, who is a witness to the change of mental health in this arena. The history includes its golden age, transactional stage, transitional from dominancy of psychotherapy to dominancy of psychiatry, and the medicalization of mental health. The hopes and goals of this book are to educate and empower patients to advocate for their rights, and invite mental health professionals to promote health and change the system. The editors and presenters are successful in presenting information to support the importance of psychotherapy as a first-line intervention in mental health care. This book is recommended to patients, as an empowering source, and it is also recommended to all mental health professionals regardless of their tendency toward the medical or the psychotherapy model of treatment.</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of the health care system, there is a dominance of health policy makers over professionals and in turn dominance of professionals over patients. In this system, there is little room for patients’ choice of treatments, and there is no meaningful connection between patients and physicians. For example, in a patient’s office visit, the physician’s appearance and technical language give a message to the patient that “I am the expert in charge, and you need to do whatever I prescribe if you want to get better.” Besides, a physician has about 10 min to communicate with a patient, as she or he has to rush to visit other patients. If the patient has more questions and concerns, she or he will generally talk to the physician assistant. Psychologists who prescribe medicine, as mentioned in the book, have followed physicians’ methods in prescribing medicine, and have not been good models. This culture of hierarchy is necessary to the system. It helps to convince physicians that the system provides reliable information to help them decide on a certain path of treatment. This includes different kinds of drugs that are presented as useful in the treatment of patients. Physicians rely on the accuracy of the information received. The medicalization model continues to be dominant in mental health due to its ties to the system values of maximizing profit, minimizing cost, speeding up the process of treatment, and the well-being of clients in a short period of time. Psychotherapy, most likely, has ties to the well-being of clients, slowing down the process of treatment, and maximizing profit and minimizing cost in a long period of time.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are pressures on clinicians by institutions and organizations to use evidence-based practice. Information provided in the book increases clinicians’ awareness to evaluate the sources, methods, and funding of research before using them as “evidence” for a specific method of practice. Evidence-based practice is useful if the evidence is reliable. Educators can also use this information to teach students to be cautious in using the results of research. There is always the chance of manipulating data in the different steps of research in favor of research fund providers. Clinicians can also increase their clients’ awareness of their rights and encourage them to take active roles in the process of treatments. Increasing clients’ awareness does not mean to put the responsibility of care on the clients. When a patient suffers, she or he is most likely overwhelmed with her or his problems and is uncertain of making decisions. Indeed, putting the responsibility of care on clients is an unethical practice. </p>
<p>Increasing awareness in clinicians, clients, and educators does not necessarily bring change, but it could affect the hierarchy of the health care system from the bottom up.</p>
