<abstract>
<p>Rapid development by innovative enterprises is the goal of Optics Valley of China. Currently 1,951 hi-tech companies have started operations in the valley. The anchor industries include optoelectronic information, bioengineering and medicine, environmental protection and energy saving, high-end equipment manufacturing and hi-tech services. Since 2000, the average annual economic growth rate of Optics Valley has been nearly 30%. Optics Valley continues to upgrade the development of an open economy and to attract international well-known companies with the advantage of location, policy, industry and environment. A strategic agreement between Optics Valley of China and Silicon Valley of the United States was signed in February 2012. Economic development and people’s livelihood are always the priorities in China. Toward that end, Optics Valley has adopted a framework of requirements specifying the social security responsibility of the foreign-funded enterprises in the valley as a step to accelerate the formation of a social security system. This article analyses the status of industry development, the region’s investment environment and the regulations governing social security in Optics Valley. The intent is to help foreign entrepreneurs interested in establishing an operation in Optics Valley.</p>

<title>The Origin and Development of Optics Valley of China</title>
<p>The Optics Valley area of China is located in Wuhan (the capital city of Hubei Province in central China). Construction in the area started in 1984. This was an important policy of the Wuhan municipal government to further transform this old industrial city. The policy makers planned to model the Silicon Valley in the United States and establish a hi-tech intensive zone to drive industrial upgrading and development of Wuhan along with Hubei Province. In 1988, Wuhan East Lake Hi-Tech Development Zone was formally established and subsequently was approved by the State Council in 1991 as a national hi-tech development zone. In 2000, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Foreign Affairs ratified the zone to be an APEC science and industrial park. Later in 2001, the optoelectronic information industry base (Wuhan Optics Valley of China) was approved by the former State Development Planning Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology. Finally, in 2009, the State Council authorized the title—Wuhan East Lake National Innovation Model Zone. The zone has been given several names, but the most widely recognized one is Wuhan Optics Valley of China.</p>
<p>The total area of the original Optics Valley was 24 square kilometers (or 9.3 square miles). Government agencies have frequently expanded the area. In May 2010, the area was expanded to 518 square kilometers (or 200 square miles). In October the same year, a new zone—East Lake Future City of Science &amp; Technology, with a planning area of 66.8 square kilometers (or 25.8 square miles)—was started. The new zone is just like the Optics Valley, in its interest and commitment to advanced technology and open for development to both domestic and foreign enterprises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712455604">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Technological innovation is the powerful driving force that has supported the rapid economic development of Optics Valley. Over the past 20 years, the industrial base in Optics Valley has increased to nearly 20,000 businesses, including 1,951 hi-tech enterprises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712455604">2</xref></sup> With an average annual growth rate of nearly 30%, the total revenue of the enterprises in Optics Valley was RMB (Chinese Yuan) 381 billion in 2011, which was a 907-fold increase compared when with RMB 0.42 billion in 1991. The Optics Valley took more than10 years to acquire the first RMB 100 billion and then only 3 years to acquire every subsequent RMB 100 billion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886368712455604">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>For 2010, the total revenues of the optoelectronic information, bioengineering and medicine, environmental protection and energy saving, high-end equipment manufacturing and hi-tech services industries amounted to RMB 114.49 billion, 24.8 billion, 23.7 billion, 41.4 billion and 19.2 billion, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712455604">3</xref></sup> The above data show that after years of growth and development, the pursuit of the Optics Valley has become a reality step by step, the wealth effect has begun to appear and anchor industries are now forming.</p>
<p>The regional leaders attach great importance to the development of Optics Valley. In 2011, they decided to transform Optics Valley into a special region of “equity capitalization and intellectual capitalization” to promote industrial development and construction of Optics Valley by means of technology and finance innovation. On November 17 the same year, the governor of Hubei Province, Guosheng Wang, and other leaders attended the opening ceremony of the Optics Valley capital building, which will establish and improve the support for industry and services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712455604">4</xref></sup> The opening of the Optics Valley capital building reflected the strategic thinking of Hubei Province and Wuhan municipal government, emphasizing both the production economy and financial economy. Guosheng Wang made a clear explanation of this strategic thinking at a provincial economy conference: to coordinate the development of the “real economy and the fictitious economy” focused on capital markets so that the two types of economy can integrate with each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712455604">5</xref></sup> Guosheng Wang also welcomed domestic and foreign financial institutions to actively participate in the construction of Optics Valley capital special administrative region and the Wuhan regional financial center and to strongly support the technology and finance innovation pilot in Optics Valley. The opening of the capital building marked the development of Optics Valley and signified the start of a new stage—a combination of technology and finance and a combination of the real economy and fictitious (or financial markets) economy. This combination will boost the development of high-tech industries and is conducive to small and medium businesses. The development potential of Optics Valley will be greater and the future prospect will be brighter.</p>

<title>The Investment Environment and Foreign-Funded Enterprises</title>
<p>Innovation in the region includes technology innovation, business model innovation and organization innovation, with the emphasis on Chinese national or independent innovation. The effect of closed independent innovation will be restricted while open and enhanced international exchanges and cooperation will be expanded to create a win-win situation. On the road of development, depending on the macro background of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, Optics Valley insists on independent innovation and wider opening-up, with a commitment to optimize the investment environment and make it attractive for foreign enterprises and high-end talent. Optics Valley has a unique location, special policies, a growing industrial base and other advantages that make it attractive to foreign enterprises, entrepreneurs and talent to work together.</p>
<p>First, Optics Valley is located southeast of Wuhan City, which is a transportation hub with convenient waterways, railways, highways and air routes. In the past 20 years, the area of Optics Valley has expanded by more than 20 times and is still expanding. Now Optics Valley has plenty of fresh water and land resources. In Hubei Province, a new regional development pattern has formed—Optics Valley is supported by Xiangyang and Yichang national hi-tech development zones and supplemented by the 18 provincial-level high-tech development zones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712455604">6</xref></sup> The businesses of Optics Valley are allowed to establish additional industrial parks outside Wuhan. The foreign companies settled in Optics Valley can take advantage of more convenient land use and lower costs. On the other hand, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces began to jointly implement the “triangulation” strategy—to integrate the resources of the three provinces to innovate development mechanisms and to build China’s new rapid growth economic zone (a cluster of cities in the middle reaches of the Yangtze river). In April 2012, a strategic cooperation agreement was signed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712455604">7</xref></sup> For the foreign companies settled in Optics Valley, this opens a broader market and more space for industrial development.</p>
<p>Second, Hubei Province and Wuhan City have introduced more than 20 supporting policies for Optics Valley such as a credit system, market entities access, improved government services, tax incentives, intellectual property and talent attraction.</p>
<p>In terms of market entities access, evaluating intellectual property rights and human capital to found hi-tech enterprises is allowed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712455604">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of improved government services, about 32 suggestions have been proposed (for instance, strengthening the green channel service for enterprises). The administrative review and approval process for proposed industrial projects in Wuhan was started in a trial phase in August 2011. The program eliminated the approval fees for nine types of industrial projects, which is the first instance of zero fees for industrial and commercial registration in China. The minimum working days for an industrial project to settle in a industrial park in Wuhan is 15 and the maximum is 60. The industrial projects mentioned in the program refer to projects engaged in manufacturing and processing in industrial parks, including both domestic and foreign. In the past, the review and approval for foreign industrial projects needed the approval of at least 13 departments (e.g., the department of business, the department of commerce and the development and reform commission). Now, after a foreign company and an industrial park agree in concept on a proposed development, while the investors apply for approval to use the proposed land, they can conduct at the same time other approval procedures such as an environmental impact assessment. The total approval time is now less than half of the original time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712455604">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of tax incentives, after they are identified as high-tech businesses, foreign enterprises are allowed a 15% reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The revenue of foreign-invested enterprises, foreign-invested research and development centers, foreign enterprises and foreign individuals engaged in technology transfer, technology development and related technology consulting and technology services can be exempted from the business tax.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712455604">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, the plan to create an industrial base in Optics Valley has the photoelectron information industry as the core, with biological, environmental protection and energy saving, high-end equipment manufacturing and the high-tech service industry as strategic industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712455604">11</xref></sup> Additionally, a number of new industries are in development. That makes it easy for the foreign companies settled in Optics Valley to find other companies to create a supply chain.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three main advantages, there is rich high-quality talent reserve in Optics Valley, with more than 80% research institutions and various colleges and universities in Wuhan. These institutions annually prepare 300,000 college graduates, 40,000 postgraduates and 10,000 doctoral graduates, which makes it possible for foreign companies to build a workforce of professional and technical personnel as well as support staff.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712455604">12</xref></sup> Optics Valley has a beautiful natural landscape with lakes and mountains. In Optics Valley, the industrial and living areas are planned for convenience. The stable social order makes Optics Valley a livable and appropriate area to do business. After visiting Optics Valley, Mr. Qian Xun, a member of the U.S. Academy of Sciences, Academy of Engineering, Academy of Medicine and Academy of Arts and Natural Sciences, said with emotion, “if I were only 40 years old, I would choose China to found an undertaking.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712455604">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is now a promotion phrase: “Optics Valley—An Ideal Destination for Innovation and Starting a New Undertaking.” Foreign entrepreneurs or high-end talent and their teams can invest in Optics Valley in three ways:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712455604" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, as wholly foreign-owned companies (e.g., the French company Schneider Electric established its Chinese headquarters in Optics Valley).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, as equity joint ventures between Chinese companies and foreign-owned companies (such as Fujikura Fiberhome Optoelectronic Material Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd. established by Japan Fujikura and FiberHome, which is owned by Wuhan Research Institute of Posts and Telecommunications).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, as contractual joint ventures with Chinese partners, providing capital, technology, main equipment and/or materials. For example, Campania Innovation Institution of Italy, Geneva Biological Incubator and Thermo Fisher Scientific Company of the United States signed cooperation agreements, respectively, with Biolake of Optics Valley in terms of technology, production, talent or services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712455604">14</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The main difference between equity joint ventures and contractual joint ventures is that cooperative enterprises do not necessarily evaluate shares in monetary terms and do not necessarily share in the profits but work together on specific projects and practices in accordance with the contract. Wholly foreign-owned enterprises, Chinese-foreign equity joint ventures and Chinese-foreign contractual joint ventures are commonly treated as foreign-funded enterprises.</p>
<p>Now, more than 50 of the world’s top 500 companies have settled in Optics Valley, such as Nokia, Philips, Siemens, NEC, Microsoft, Schneider, Honeywell, IBM, EDS and France Telecom. Also the branch offices, R&amp;D centers and agencies of 20 Silicon Valley enterprises are now located in optics Valley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712455604">15</xref></sup> Many investment institutions are particularly optimistic about Optics Valley as well. In early 2011, in a biopharmaceutical investment meeting held in Biolake of Optics Valley, more than 10 foreign institutions participated, including UK Trade &amp; Investment and Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712455604">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Social Security System Requirements</title>
<p>Economic development and people’s livelihood are always priorities in China. The fundamental purpose of economic development is to guarantee and improve people’s livelihood. On one hand, Optics Valley has developed its economy rapidly. In accordance with national and local laws and regulations, Optics Valley has incorporated social security initiatives in its economic and social development plans to accelerate the construction of a social security system.</p>
<p>For foreign-funded enterprises and foreign employees in China, national laws and regulations set forth in principle the foundation for social security while local governments concentrate on the implementation details. Optics Valley authorities insist foreigners who start an operation in the region recognize their responsibility for employee social security and related services. The laws and regulations include the following:</p>
<p>Article 4&amp;97 of Social Insurance Law of the People’s Republic of China states that
<disp-quote>
<p>employers and individuals within the territory of the People’s Republic of China shall pay social insurance premiums in accordance with law, and have the rights to inquire about their premium contribution records and personal benefit records and request social insurance agencies to provide social insurance consultation and other relevant services. [Also] Foreigners employed within the territory of the People’s Republic of China shall participate in social insurance analogically in accordance with this Law.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Article 3&amp;4 of “provisions of foreign-funded enterprises, private enterprises, individual economic practitioners participating in basic pension insurance in Hubei Province” emphasized that
<disp-quote>
<p>all foreign-funded enterprises and the Chinese employees who have labor relations with the enterprises shall participate in basic pension insurance, pay basic pension insurance premiums in accordance with law and enjoy legitimate rights and interests of basic pension insurance. After retirement, workers who participate in basic pension insurance can get help and compensation in accordance with the provisions. [Also] In foreign-funded enterprises, both employers and employees shall jointly pay premiums and the model of social pooling plus individual accounts shall be applied. The fund raised from foreign-funded enterprises shall be managed uniformly with funds raised from the state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Article 8&amp;9 advanced that
<disp-quote>
<p>all foreign-funded enterprises shall pay basic pension insurance premiums according to the social pooling rate of basic pension insurance of the state-owned enterprises. . . . If the payment was interrupted for various reasons, the total payment time would be consolidated on a monthly basis. The premiums paid by employers would be listed in pre-tax expenses.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Article 29 states that
<disp-quote>
<p>Where foreign-funded enterprises and the Chinese employees who have labor relations with the enterprises violate this regulation, fail to participate basic pension insurance and fail to pay basic pension insurance premiums on time or in full amount, except for special difficulties and the delay approval from the labor administrative departments above the county (city) level, the labor administrative departments above the county (city) level shall order the enterprises and employees to participate basic pension insurance and to pay premiums within the prescribed time limit. Apart from that, a late-payment fine of 0.02 percent per day should be paid. If no participation or payment after the time limit, the enterprises shall be imposed with a 100%-300% fine by the administrative departments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To facilitate the recruitment of domestic and foreign talent to Optics Valley for work or business, “Wuhan City Talent Residence Permit Provisional Regulations” state that a businessman whose personal investment in Optics Valley is more than RMB 500,000 and other talent who are badly needed by Optics Valley businesses do not need to change foreign nationality and can apply for a Wuhan City Talent Residence Permit in accordance with the provisions. The permit holder shall participate in the unemployment, work injury and maternity insurance scheme and other social insurance programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712455604">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the enterprise employees in Optics Valley are required to participate in the five basic insurance programs. According to “The Notice of Using Average Wage Standard (year 2010) of Active Workers in Urban Units” issued by the social insurance fund settlement center of Wuhan in 2011, the contribution rate of enterprises is as follows: 20% for pension insurance, 8% for medical insurance, 1% for work injury insurance, 1% for unemployment insurance and 0.7% for maternity insurance. As the social security administrative department in Optics Valley, the Wuhan Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau is responsible for issuing policies and regulations, enforcement and inspection of social insurance law and handling violation of regulations. Under the leadership of governments at all levels, the framework for social security in Optics Valley has developed rapidly. In addition, the number of participants in pension insurance, work injury insurance, health insurance and unemployment insurance have increased year by year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712455604">Table 1</xref>).</p>
