<p><italic>Landscapes and the Law: Environmental Politics, Regional Histories, and Contests over Nature</italic> details how the landscape of a budding British hill station in southern India was reallocated through colonial rule of law in the nineteenth century. In the Nilgiri Mountains, conquest, rather than being a matter of straightforward dispossession by the sword, was carried out through a legal process of dispossession where conflict rarely came to violence. Colonists sought to secure sovereignty over this landscape by redefining and codifying what they called ‘customary rights’ in nature.</p>
<p>As the British established themselves as mediators and final judges in the multitude of colliding claims over what the people came to know as ‘property’ and ‘natural resources’, impact on traditional ecological relationships was great. Gunnell Cederlöf argues that originally ethnology was the basis of colonial policy in the region. But by the mid-nineteenth century ethnology was only a dim background against which imperial ideology justified its dominion through an evolutionary framework that saw Toda hill-dwelling pastoralists as primitive and backward, and therefore incapable of owning their homelands as property. In contrast the Badaga agriculturalist population, referred to as ‘Burghers’ (that is, bourgeois) in colonial texts, were granted title over large swaths of land as <italic>patta</italic>. While the Badaga were acknowledged as latecomers in this region and traditionally maintained a subordinate tenant-like status to the Todas, British administrators typically favoured these hardy burghers for the stability they provided and for the revenue that settled cultivation produced. In the process the British, who prized the Nilgiris for its climate reminiscent of Europe, of course also managed to appropriate the majority of the landscape for themselves.</p>
<p>Cederlöf’s monograph reflects a depth of focus, and perspicacious clarity, that can probably only come from many years of dedicated research and writing on a complicated subject. The great strength of <italic>Landscapes and the Law</italic> is thus the intricate depiction of the historical situation of the Toda, Badaga and British in the region, which Cederlöf is able to conjure for the reader. Through an excellent use of the colonial archive, as well as oral history, this book will teach even the most knowledgeable reader much about the changing political and cultural eco-logy of the peoples of the Nilgiris as they struggled with the role of colonial rule and colonial law in their lives. But for anyone familiar with the trajectory of Cederlöf’s work over the last decade, this book will come as little surprise. Half of the chapters here are largely drawn from articles she had published since 2002.</p>
<p>The subject of Cederlöf’s work is very close to Deborah Sutton’s, <italic>Other Landscapes</italic> (Copenhagen, 2009). The two had co-authored an article on the issue of Toda land rights in the colonial Nilgiris (in <italic>Indigeneity in India</italic>, London, 2006). Yet <italic>Landscapes and the Law</italic> is undoubtedly its own book. Situated at the interstices of so many fields of study, it may be safer to summarise this work as an exercise in environmental humanities/social sciences than to individually enumerate the disciplines it touches. At the same time the book adopts such a sweeping multi-disciplinary lens that it also manages to portray an intimate portrait of the commingled communities of the Nilgiri hills of southern India.</p>
<p>Where the book may be said to lose track of itself is in its theoretical frame. In line with the most recent wave of South Asian histories, the book dispels all the usual myths: that of unilinear socio-cultural evolution of so-called tribal groups since the Neolithic period, of colonialism as a monolith, of hills and plains as bifurcated into discrete units of analysis as opposed to fluid zones of contact and exchange, etc. But when Cederlöf tries to add a new apparatus to the toolbox of historiography, by proposing the sub-discipline of ‘environmental history of law’, this is done so in a hesitant and unpromising way. Why is Cederlof so tentative about the concept of an environmental history of law (p. 48)? Perhaps because what she is really writing is a colonial legal history focused on environment, following in a long tradition of histories of colonial rule that focused on the transformation of India’s agrarian economy through law. By claiming this conventional type of study is something new—‘an environmental history of law’—Cederlöf ignores the agrarian roots that prefigure her study; but does her work merely swaps the hills for the plains as the point of focus? To be fair, it must be noted that Cederlöf is by no means the only scholar guilty of this forgetfulness. This is my chief complaint about much recent writing that claims to break new ground in ‘environmental history’. It is not so much doing something new. It is simply looking somewhere else. In the new scholarship the core has become the periphery and the periphery has become the core, ironically feeding into the very sort of theoretical bifurcation of hills and plains that Cederlöf explicitly argues against.</p>
<p>The expropriation of rights and exploitation of resources are central themes in historical studies of colonialism. What Cederlöf adds to nuance these themes, and this is perhaps her major contribution, is an understanding of how through the process of formulating law that allowed for negotiation and contestation from below, such expropriation and exploitation was achieved as a form of hegemony rather than sheer dominance. While many studies have dealt with the effects of laws legitimizing social and territorial conquest, few—even in agrarian history—have chronicled the life of these laws with such vision.</p>
