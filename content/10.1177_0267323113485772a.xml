<p>This is the first collection that examines the contrasting working conditions of people who work in the film and television industries across the globe. Essays in the volume discuss film and TV work in Hollywood, the Soviet Union, Scandinavia, Nigeria, France, the United Kingdom and Bollywood. While this is impressive, the collection lacks contributions on China, South America or Australasia, but not for the want of trying on their part to commission contributions. This is indicative of the uneven interest in production studies globally. The essays also cover a broad range of periods from silent era Hollywood to 1950s France and Soviet Union to the growth in 1990s television freelancing in the UK to present-day Nigeria. The task facing the editors is to create a coherent book out of stand-alone essays. They attempt to do this by dividing the book into four sections: systems of production; manoeuvrable spaces (by which is meant, following King, the historically contingent relative autonomy that labour has in the production process), patronage and clientelism, and creative agency. The challenge for the editors is that the contributors adopt a wide variety of approaches from labour process theory to the work of Richard Florida on creative classes and cities that do not have much in common with each other. This is an almost impossible task and the collection does lack a coherent focus, set of theories and methodological approaches. The book would have benefited from a concluding chapter comparing and contrasting film and TV work across time and space with some indication of how future study might address this issue in a more comparative way.</p>
<p>However, while the parts of this book do not add up to a whole, there are a number of good essays on film and TV work. Richard Paterson is good on the growth of freelancing in the 1990s UK TV industry but it would have been helpful to have been given more information about what has happened since 1998. Katrien Pype’s work on patronage and clientelism in African TV production is highly original albeit already largely published elsewhere. Andrew Dawson’s essay criticizes the ‘flexible specialization’ approach to the post-studio system in Hollywood proposed in the late 1980s by Storper, Christopherson and then developed by Scott. Dawson takes this approach to task for neglecting the continued importance of dominant firms in the distribution of films and its optimistic account of the consequences of flexible specialization for labour. As Dawson points out, these criticisms are accepted by the advocates of the flexible specialization approach. These weaknesses, according to Dawson, mean that we should throw out the theory and replace it with something new. It is not clear what this should be although the hope is expressed that the financial crises of contemporary capitalism will lead to the development of new theories critical of neoliberalism that can be applied to the film and television industries (or, alternatively, a return to a Marxist labour process theory of cultural production). Clearly we are in need of new theories as well as detailed empirical and comparative studies before we can make substantial progress in understanding the ‘global’ character of work in film and TV production.</p>
