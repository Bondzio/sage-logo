The invasion process was also dependent on bacterial quantity and also suggested saturation of cellular receptors above MOI 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985812452579">16</xref></sup> In addition, after invasion, <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis </italic>remained viable for up to 144 hours, raising the possibility that <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis </italic>may persist in non-phagocytic cells in different tissues of sheep and goats, facilitating progression of the infection in the animals.</p><p>The invasion process was dependent on temperature, suggesting that cell metabolism plays an active role in the invasion process. Finally, the incubation of bacteria prior to invasion with sugars, inactivated and whole antiserum, appeared to block specific bacterial receptors and/or cellular ligands.</p><p>Immunofluorescence demonstrated that heat- or UV-killed bacteria were unable to invade the FLK-BLV-044 cell line, suggesting that invasion requires either viable <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> or intact bacterial surface components to interact with the ovine cell surface. Further studies of the invasion and persistence of <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> should aid the development of therapeutics and vaccines and may assist in new aspects relevant to responses against <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> or other facultative intracellular pathogens.</p><p>In conclusion, these in vitro findings raise the possibility that <italic>C. pseudotuberculosis</italic> can persist and disseminate in vivo through non-phagocytic cells, facilitating diffusion of the infection and providing a certain level of protection against animal defenses and a suitable environment for its proliferation, facilitating the establishment of a carrier state.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Spanish Agency for International Development (AECID) for their program of PhD scholarships for foreign students for J.
