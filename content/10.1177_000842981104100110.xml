<p>
<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic>, edited by Hillary P. Rodrigues (University of Lethbridge), is the first book to appear in the new Studying Religions in Practice series by Routledge (of which Rodrigues is himself the general editor). The thirteen pieces collected in<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic> all emphasize in their own way an instance of contemporary Hinduism in practice, and as a group range widely across social class, theistic denomination, ritual form, gender, and geography. Diverse as well are the stages in the research careers of the contributing scholars (only one author, however, is of South Asian origin), and one finds a variety of positions taken in the levels of field-work engagement, ranging from quiet, back-room observer to fully committed participant. In addition to the fact that these contributors are all internationally recognized authorities in their field, the collection has much to recommend it, and is certainly successful in addressing a particular kind of lacuna in religious studies scholarship.</p>
<p>The lacuna in question is a matter first and foremost of undergraduate materials for the study of Hinduism. Judging by its title, one might initially assume that<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic> seeks to correct an imbalance in university textbooks on Hinduism, which have tended to focus on textual, doctrinal and philosophical aspects of Hindu traditions at the expense of lived and practiced religion. In one sense this is the case, and the pieces assembled here by Rodrigues might be classed alongside the Princeton series Religions in Practice, which have sought as well to respond to this disproportion in their own way. Without specifically naming the Princeton series, however, Rodrigues points out in his introduction that in fact such collections often base themselves upon textual (i.e. written ritual, often ancient) sources to get at religion in practice. I would argue that this is indeed the case in the Princeton series, and that consequently the average undergraduate student working with those large volumes is still considerably distanced from contemporary lived and practiced religion. Meanwhile ethnographic studies of Indian religion, although tending to offer better descriptive illustrations of religion on the ground, typically embed their accounts in larger theoretical discussions beyond the reach of undergraduate students.<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic> identifies and seeks to fill this gap in existing undergraduate materials for the study of Hinduism.</p>
<p>But there is a more sharply refined pedagogical purpose driving this volume beyond the need for more accessible accounts of Hinduism on the ground, and these thirteen pieces are not simply undergrad-accessible extracts from or summaries of the various authors’ fieldwork research published elsewhere. Rather, this volume (and presumably this will be the case with the entire Routledge series to follow) has been inspired by a certain classroom dynamic which most instructors will likely affirm from their own teaching experience: first-person narratives have a unique power to communicate directly to listeners and readers. When, in the classroom, an instructor shifts his or her discourse from that of a third-person authority on religion to a first-person account of his or her own trials, tribulations and discoveries as a researcher, students tend to connect more immediately and retain better what is communicated to them. What ties all of these chapters together and makes them so valuable for use in the classroom is their readable, inviting and personal style which places the researcher front and center and makes his or her experiences in the field the basis for a study of Hinduism in practice. Stories of disappointments, unpleasant surprises, dead ends, frustrations, changes of plan, discoveries, “eureka” moments and revelation open each chapter and draw the reader in, and then follow up with more traditional academic discussions of the subject in question. Alf Hiltebeitel’s account, for example, illustrates “how one can doggedly pursue mistaken notions during fieldwork, meet with several dead ends, and yet come upon valuable, albeit different discoveries” (90). All but two chapters include a photo of the author conducting his or her research in India, and as a whole the collection succeeds very well in reversing the (arguably counterproductive) convention of the distanced, impersonal authoritative voice.</p>
<p>Naturally one does find variation in the extent to which the individual authors implicate themselves in their own research narratives. All chapters, however, provide insight into a unique corner of the contemporary Hindu world, and the set yields an amazing span of practices for such a small volume: the recitation of the<italic>Ponnivala</italic> legend in South India (Brenda Beck); the worship of Hanumān in Maharashtra (Jeffrey Brackett); the place of the Satī myth in Hardwar (Paul Courtright); veneration of the goddess Kāmākhyā in Assam (Patricia Dold); Vai⋅ṇava pilgrimage in both America and West Bengal (Jason Fuller); the experience and aesthetics of Classical Indian dance (Anne-Marie Gaston); the South Indian cults to<italic>Mahābhārata</italic> figures (Alf Hiltebeitel); a North Indian Sākhya-Yoga community in practice (Knut Jacobsen); the experience and aesthetics of<italic>tablā</italic> (Jeffrey Lidke); worship of the Goddess in Vārāṇasī (Hillary Rodrigues); exorcism and possession among the<italic>harijans</italic> of the Himālayas (William Sax); Sanskrit dramas in Kerala (Bruce Sullivan); and temple practice in Vārāṇasī and South India (Paul Younger).</p>
<p>Space will not allow a proper survey of the many themes of these colorful pieces, but among the most significant that emerged as I read through them was a recurring pattern whereby scholars had to redefine their expectations of the relationship between text and practice. In a way that is entirely fitting for a volume whose stated purpose is to supplement doctrine with actual practice, we find several accounts characterized by this theme: Dold’s work on a Sanskrit text about the Kāmākhyā temple in Assam (a text which, it turns out, is unknown to the officials at the temple); Hiltebeitel’s experience of having to relinquish his initial interpretation, informed by a deep familiarity with the Sanskrit<italic>Mahābhārata</italic> story, of a Duryodhana festival; Courtright and Beck’s contextualizing of the recitation environments of myth and epic narrative, with surprising discoveries about how the stories are rooted in specific places in a way that cannot be fully appreciated on paper alone; even the classical philosophical school of Sākhyā finds, in Jacobsen’s account, a grounding in lived and practiced devotional religion. Thus the pieces not only illustrate Hinduism in practice in an immediate and engaging way, but many do so as part of a discovery about the limits of text and theory on the ground.</p>
<p>It is an accident of the alphabetical sequencing of chapters by author that Paul Younger’s piece comes last. There is, however, a wonderful sense of closure granted by the chapter’s placement, given the fact that the author’s long career parallels the emergence of the serious study of Hinduism in practice within academic institutions. In Younger’s account, we initially experience the author’s frustration in the late 1950s as his interest in lived and practiced Hinduism was constrained and subordinated to a colonial academic model which could only see value in the study of Vedānta and Buddhist philosophy. Younger then moves the reader along to his work on temple ritual in South India and his experiences of finally studying Hinduism in practice, enjoying an extraordinary degree of access and intimacy with the ritual authorities at Śrīrakam and Citamparam temples. Thankfully, today studying Hinduism in practice no longer suffers from the kind of constraints Younger experienced early on, and there is thus a certain poetry in the fact that students, perhaps encountering lived and practiced Hinduism for the first time as they read through this volume, should conclude with Younger’s chapter.</p>
<p>I believe the operating premise of the volume – that re-personalizing scholarship and developing discussions of Hinduism in practice from first-person narrative accounts can greatly benefit students – is certainly correct. I plan in the future to use this volume myself to accompany more doctrine-oriented textbooks; I do anticipate, however, that some of the material students will encounter in<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic> will provoke cries of “What are we supposed to know from this?” or “Will this be on the test?” The confessional and narrative portions of each chapter in one sense function as doorway stories to invite the reader in, but as such, do not lend themselves to any immediately obvious form of evaluation (and, as all instructors know, without the threat of a failed assignment, enforcing readings can be extremely difficult). The narrative portions are also often rich in details of gods, goddesses, sacred sites, caste groups, liturgical and other forms of technical terminology, which are not always unpacked fully in the ensuing discussion portion of the given chapter. Certainly a larger classroom context will be required for such material to become transparent, and the collection might not fare so well if not carefully coordinated with other course readings and lectures. However, instructors choosing to use<italic>Studying Hinduism in Practice</italic> for their classes will no doubt find students responding positively to these readable and engaging discussions.</p>
