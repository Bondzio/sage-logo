<title>Objective:</title>
<p>This study was carried out to determine high pressure and pulsatile flow perfusion effects on human saphenous vein (HSV) segments obtained from diabetic and non-diabetic patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1479164112461041">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The veins were perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution for 3 h, with a pulsatile flow rate of 100 mL/min and pressures of 250 × 200 or 300 × 250 mmHg. After perfusion, veins were studied by light microscopy; nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, CD34 and nitrotyrosine immunohistochemistry and tissue nitrite/nitrate (NO<sub>x</sub>) and malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1479164112461041">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Light microscopy revealed endothelial denuding areas in all HSV segments subjected to 300 × 250 mmHg perfusion pressure, but the luminal area was similar. The percentage of luminal perimeter covered by endothelium decreased as perfusion pressures increased, and significant differences were observed between groups. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) isoform immunostaining decreased significantly in diabetic patients’ veins independent of the perfusion pressure levels. The inducible NOS (iNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and nitrotyrosine immunostaining were similar. Significant CD34 differences were observed between the diabetic 300 × 250 mmHg perfusion pressure group and the non-diabetic control group. Tissue nitrite/nitrate and MDA were not different among groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human saphenous vein (HSV) patency as a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is known to be inferior to that of arterial grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164112461041">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164112461041"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164112461041">3</xref></sup> This inferiority can be partly attributed to the normal structural and functional differences between veins and arteries, which are exposed to different hemo dynamic forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164112461041">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461041">5</xref></sup> However, despite these disadvantages, HSVs are still widely employed as CABGs.</p>
<p>Although the precise mechanisms involved in graft failure remain unclear, the abnormal pressures imposed on the HSV during surgical manipulation and/or after implantation into the arterial circulation can promote pathological alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461041">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164112461041">6</xref></sup> Endothelium denudation exposes the underlying thrombogenic sub-intimal layer, stimulating smooth muscle cell migration and intimal proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461041">5</xref></sup> Reduced amounts of nitric oxide (NO) result in a predisposition to vasospasm, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet aggregation and leukocyte migration and adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461041">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164112461041"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112461041">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the arterial circulation, vein grafts are subjected to hemodynamic changes, including increased pressure and pulsatile flow, which may result in morphological and functional changes that contribute to premature failure. In diabetic patients, saphenous vein grafts exhibit reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112461041">10</xref></sup> Our previous studies have shown that HSV segments perfused with non-pulsatile flow and increased pressures for 3 h exhibit greater morphological changes in the presence of higher perfusion pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref></sup> The present study extends our previous work by utilizing pulsatile flow for perfusion of HSV segments and by comparing veins isolated from diabetic and non-diabetic patients.</p>

<p>The patients included 14 men and 10 women with an average age of 61 ± 2 years. Among them, 18 patients (75%) have systemic arterial hypertension and are smokers. The systemic arterial hypertension was basically treated with diuretics (all patients), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (11 patients), angiotensin II type 1 (ATI) blockers (7 patients) and associated beta-blockers (3 patients with metoprolol and 2 patients with atenolol). Diabetes was defined when the patient presented two measures of fasting blood glucose level above 126 mg/dL. Among the diabetic patients, eight were treated with oral agents, three with oral agents and insulin and one was treated only with insulin.</p>

<sec id="section8-1479164112461041">
<title>Harvesting of HSV samples</title>
<p>Prior to systemic administration of heparin, the great saphenous vein was dissected using open harvesting techniques by the same team. Veins with macroscopic signs of inflammation (hyperaemia and thrombosis) or varicose dilations were excluded. The side branches were ligated without any saline distension, and the dissected HSV was removed. After harvesting, a segment of the HSV distal portion was placed in Krebs solution (118.3 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 11.1 mM glucose) and transported to the laboratory, where it was attached to the perfusion system described below. All vessels were utilized within 1 h of removal from the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1479164112461041">
<title>Study design and perfusion system</title>
<p>Thirty-six segments of HSV were randomly allocated to one of the six groups, consisting of three groups of samples from diabetic patients and three from non-diabetic patients (n = 6 per group). Once we got a long segment of HSV, in a sufficient length for the proposed analysis, the segment was cut, then a part was perfused according to the protocol and the other was used as control (diabetic or non-diabetic). The control segment was kept in the organ bath for 3 h without perfusion (no pressure and no flow). Twelve segments, six from non-diabetic patients (group 1) and six from diabetic patients (group 2), were used as unperfused controls (0 mmHg pressure and 0 mL/min flow rate). Twenty-four segments of HSV from diabetic and non-diabetic patients were perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution for 3 h with a pulsatile flow rate of 100 mL/min and pressures of 250 × 200 mmHg (lower pressure: groups 3 and 4) or 300 × 250 mmHg (higher pressure: groups 5 and 6). The assigned experimental groups are represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1479164112461041">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The perfusion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164112461041">Figure 1</xref>) consisted of a pulsatile flow pump (Harvard HABP100; Instech Laboratories, Holliston, MA, USA) that was used to propel Krebs solution from a reservoir through silicone tubes to perfuse the HSV segment mounted in an organ bath. The pulsatile flow pump used in this experimental system allows precise control of flow with adjustments in frequency and volume pumped per cycle. The frequency was maintained at 20 cycles/min and 5 mL/cycle, resulting in a flow rate of 100 mL/min.</p>

System temperature was maintained at 37°C by a (8) water-jacket. (9) 95% O2/5% CO2 was bubbled in the (4) organ bath and in the (1) reservoir. A gradated cylinder placed above the (1) reservoir measured the flow.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1479164112461041-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>Resistance was applied to a silicone tube placed distal to the vein in order to achieve the desired pressure for each group. Pressure was measured by a transducer coupled with a record for continuing recordings (GRASS MODEL 7400 Recorder, Astro-Med Inc, West Warwick, RI, USA). A gradated cylinder, placed in series with the circuit, measured flow. The Krebs solution was maintained at 37°C and bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>After 3 h of perfusion (or 3 h of immersion of the control segments in Krebs solution), the HSV was cut into four equal pieces and processed as described below.</p>

<sec id="section10-1479164112461041">
<title>Light microscopy</title>
<p>HSV segments were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Transverse 5-µm sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome. The amount of endothelial damage resulting from perfusion of HSV segments was assessed by computer-assisted image analysis. Using an Axioskop 2 Plus microscope and an AxioCamHRc camera (Carl Zeiss AG, Munich, Germany), images representing the entire cross section of each sample were digitalized and analyzed with AxioVision 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss AG, Munich, Germany). Two parameters were analyzed: luminal area (μm<sup>2</sup>) and percentage of luminal perimeter covered by endothelium (%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1479164112461041">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>HSV segments were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained using the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC) method. Briefly, 3-µm sections were attached to slides pre-treated with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase and biotin were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and Pierce solution, respectively. Antigen recovery was performed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) under humid heat for 35 min. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with normal serum. The primary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the following ratios: neuronal nitric oxide synthase [nNOS; A-11 sc-5302 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)] and iNOS [C-11 sc-7271 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)] 1:5, endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS; H-159 sc-8311 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)] 1:25, CD34 [ICO11 sc-7324 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)] 1:20 and nitrotyrosine [189542 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)] 1:10. The bound antibodies were visualized with 10 mg/mL diaminobenzene solution (Sigma–Aldrich), and the sections were stained with Harris haematoxylin. As negative controls, some sections were processed as described above but with the primary and the secondary antibodies omitted. The same equipment used for light microscopy was also used for immunohistochemical analyses. In each slide, two fields were randomly selected under 400× magnification. The numbers of positive and negative stained cells were counted in the endothelium and the whole vein wall. The results were expressed as percentages of positive cells.</p>

<sec id="section12-1479164112461041">
<title>Determination of tissue malondialdehyde and nitrite/nitrate</title>
<p>HSV segments were wrapped and promptly stored at −70°C. For analysis, the samples were homogenized, and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation (5000 × <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C). Protein concentration was determined using the Biuret reaction. Determination of tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product associated with oxidative stress, was performed using a spectrophotometric assay. The absorbance of the supernatant was monitored at 535 nm. The results were expressed as micromole per milligram protein.</p>
<p>Tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate (NO<sub>x</sub>) were assessed by an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. Briefly, samples were treated with ethanol (95%) at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. NO<sub>x</sub> levels were measured by injecting 5 µL of the supernatant into a glass purge vessel containing 0.8% vanadium in 1 N hydrochloric acid at 95°C, which reduces NO<sub>x</sub> to NO gas. A nitrogen stream was bubbled through the purge vessel, then through 1 N NaOH and then into a NO analyzer that detects NO released from NO<sub>x</sub> by chemiluminescence (Sievers, model 280 NO Analyzer; Boulder, CO, USA). NO<sub>x</sub> concentration was calculated by comparison with a standard curve of sodium nitrate (0.5, 1.5, 10 and 50 mM). NO<sub>x</sub> levels were expressed in micromoles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1479164112461041">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). As the non-parametric test considers measuring only the variability of results indirectly applied, the Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s post-test, were used for analysis of the morphological and immunohistochemical data. For analysis of variance of NO<sub>x</sub> and MDA levels, which are directly measured, the Bonferroni adjustment of multiple comparison test was performed. GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant.</p>

<title>The experimental model</title>
<p>It is essential to understand that the model compares the results of arterial conditions over the endothelium and venous wall (higher pressures and pulsatile flow), not the effects of pressures applied during surgical preparation as was done by a previous model in along the same research line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461041">13</xref></sup> Three investigative questions deserve to be clarified: (1) why the vein segments were perfused with crystalloid solution rather than blood, (2) why the perfusion pressures tested were much higher than physiological pressures and (3) why the veins were perfused for 3 h. The perfusion with blood was considered but due to the possibility of interference in the results due to circulating factors (vasoactive substances and cytokines), we decided to use crystalloid solution to perfuse the vein segments. Concerning the second question, originally, we planned to perfuse HSV with lower pressures (200 × 150 mmHg and 120 × 80 mmHg), but some facts motivated us to use higher pressure, including the difficulty to obtain vein segments with the adequate length for the desired analysis. Our previous studies with a non-pulsatile flow did not find alterations with reduced perfusion pressures (50 mmHg and 100 mmHg) and found alterations with higher perfusion pressures (200 mmHg and 300 mmHg). Therefore, considering it appropriate to compare the effects of pulsatile flow, we utilized higher pressures instead of lower pressures, even far from physiological conditions, to identify potential effects of cyclic strain due to pulsatile flow. Finally, according to some authors, 3 h was the minimum time to result in endothelial morphology alterations due to shear stress action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164112461041">4</xref></sup> Our previous study with a non-pulsatile flow perfused HSV segments during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref></sup> Otherwise, alterations in the eNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were observed in endothelial cells submitted to shear stress, in vitro, during 3 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112461041">14</xref></sup> In this study, light microscopy revealed endothelial lesions in all segments subjected to the higher pulsatile perfusion pressures, and in some segments subjected to the lower pressures, including samples from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Areas of endothelial denuding associated with peeling and luminal slits were present. Similar findings have been observed in previous investigations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461041">13</xref></sup> In addition, many authors described the presence of endothelial denudation and venous lumen dilation under distention pressure without flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164112461041">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461041">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112461041">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>The histological data</title>
<p>Unlike previous studies that reported increased luminal area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164112461041">9</xref></sup> and increased inner diameter of the saphenous vein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164112461041">10</xref></sup> the luminal area in the present study did not differ among experimental groups. The area and lumen diameter increased when the saphenous vein was distended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref></sup> In addition, the venous wall deforms when subjected to hydrostatic pressure alone or in combination with shear stress. The results of the present study suggest that the presence of cyclic stress due to pulsatile flow could exert a protective effect by preventing such dilation. As observed in previous studies, flow shear stress is a stimulus for endothelial eNOS expression, which may explain the levels of eNOS maintained even in the presence of visible morphological endothelial injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112461041">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164112461041">15</xref></sup> When we started our research programme on the pressure effects in HSV endothelial dysfunction, we were wondering how morphological endothelial injury would be possible without endothelial dysfunction. We observed this fact in studies of in vitro HSV vascular reactivity (‘organ chambers’). Thus, we assumed that the remnant cells were functionally able to, at least in the short term, maintain endothelial pharmacological functionality. We think this is an attractive idea because it goes against the possible fragility of the endothelial cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164112461041">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164112461041">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section21-1479164112461041">
<title>The immunohistochemical data</title>
<p>With respect to the immunohistochemical expression of NOS isoforms, positive staining associated with eNOS, iNOS and nNOS was observed in all vein layers and in all groups, confirming the findings of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164112461041">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461041">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164112461041">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164112461041">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, expression of eNOS in the endothelium was not decreased, confirming the findings of Dalio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref></sup> Shear stress in the presence of flow is a stimulus for eNOS endothelial expression, resulting in consequential synthesis and release of NO in the remaining endothelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112461041">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164112461041">15</xref></sup> In addition, expression of eNOS was not reduced in the venous walls of HSVs from non-diabetic patients. However, in diabetic patients, a significant decrease in eNOS expression was observed in the three venous wall layers after perfusion with the lower and higher pressures. These findings could explain the increased risk of occlusion of saphenous vein grafts observed in diabetics. Although diabetic patients do not show a decrease in endothelial expression of eNOS, as observed in this study, they may indicate alterations in NOS regulation and a consequent reduction in endothelial production of NO. Lower eNOS expression in the venous wall of HSVs from diabetic patients subjected to high perfusion pressures could explain the lower vasodilatation due to reduced NO production.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical staining of inducible NOS was higher in the tunica media, and no difference in expression in the endothelium and venous wall was observed among the treatment groups. Inducible NOS expression was observed even in non-perfused veins. This finding is consistent with data from previous studies showing that iNOS was expressed in saphenous veins harvested conventionally without perfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164112461041">19</xref></sup> Although iNOS expression was increased in the endothelium of the perfused groups, compared to controls, the difference was not significant. This difference could be due to the use of a perfusion time of 3 h, which may not be sufficient to cause an increase in iNOS expression.</p>
<p>Similar to iNOS, nNOS expression was not affected by perfusion pressures, consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164112461041">13</xref></sup> Although, not significant, the present study found evidence of slightly higher nNOS expression in endothelium undergoing perfusion, suggesting the existence of induction by shear stress and pulsatile flow that could be better observed after a longer perfusion time. Consistent with other studies, in all groups, higher nNOS expression was found in smooth muscle fibres of the middle layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164112461041">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, immunohistochemistry revealed CD34 expression in the three layers of the veins in all groups. Expression in the venous endothelium was significantly different between the non-diabetic control group and the non-diabetic group subjected to 300 × 250 mmHg perfusion pressures, with higher expression in the perfusion group. This difference was not observed in the diabetic group subjected to the same perfusion pressures or in groups undergoing 250 × 200 mmHg pressures. Despite the distinct morphological lesions described in this study, with areas of endothelial denudation, shear stress generated by flow could protect the remaining endothelium from the effects of hydrostatic pressure, as suggested by Dalio et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref></sup> This protective effect may occur in the presence of both continuous and pulsatile flows. The CD34 expression increased in non-diabetic patients with high pressure. On the other hand, we could not explain why the CD34 expression remained unchanged in non-diabetic patients with low pressure group, and in all groups of diabetic patients (perfused and control).</p>

<sec id="section22-1479164112461041">
<title>Tissue nitrite/nitrate</title>
<p>Tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate did not differ significantly among treatment groups, similar to findings from our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref></sup> Although, a significant reduction in eNOS staining was observed in the three venous wall layers under 300 × 250 and 250 × 200 mmHg perfusion pressures in diabetic patients, this reduction was not sufficient to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> tissue levels during the 3 h of perfusion. As eNOS’s endothelial expression did not differ among the study groups, it is reasonable to assume that NO production was not affected over the observation period. Although not significant, there was a trend towards increased NO<sub>x</sub> tissue levels in groups subjected to perfusion pressures and pulsatile flow compared with control groups. This observation could reflect an increase in tissue levels of NO due to stimulation by shear stress and cyclic stress caused by pulsatile flow, even in diabetic patients and in the presence of a morphologically injured endothelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164112461041">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164112461041">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Oxidative stress</title>
<p>Similar to other published studies, no immunohistochemical expression of nitrotyrosine in the venous wall was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref></sup> NO can react with the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164112461041">20</xref></sup> which can cause nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins. Therefore, the absence of nitrotyrosine staining provides indirect evidence that oxidative stress does not have a crucial role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164112461041">21</xref></sup> In addition, no differences in tissue MDA levels were observed among groups in this study, consistent with results from Dalio et al. and Viaro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref></sup> This result suggests that lipid peroxidation did not occur in the vein wall under conditions of higher pressure and pulsatile flow perfusion. Upregulation of reactive oxygen species was also not observed in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164112461041">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164112461041">12</xref></sup> suggesting that this detrimental mechanism is not acutely triggered under the present experimental conditions. Therefore, in addition to further studies, using the present pulsatile flow experimental system, we also need to consider other forces to which vein grafts can be subjected, including twisting and longitudinal stretching.</p>

<sec id="section24-1479164112461041">
<title>Clinical implications</title>
<p>Finally, a few words about possible clinical implications of studies of mechanical forces on HSV graft patency. As well known, HSV is prone to chronic degeneration (aneurysmal changes/degeneration in HSV grafts), which is a much rarer complication than occlusive complications in the early post-operative period. Discovering the factors, which predispose graft failure (such as reduced production of NO), may contribute to new therapies to improve graft patency. Maybe we can assume that even at higher pressures, the HSV preserves a functional reserve, suggesting a pivotal role of atherosclerosis risk factors on long-term venous graft patency.</p>
<sec id="section25-1479164112461041">
<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is that we evaluated only the distal portion of the HSV found close to the internal maleolus of the right leg. It could be argued that differences in endothelial function probably exist based on the area from which the vein was harvested. However, a recent publication failed to find functional or morphological differences between proximal and distal saphenous vein segments, suggesting that there is no advantage in using one of these preparations over the other as a CABG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164112461041">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The correlation between diabetics and non-diabetics is a matter for criticism since different ‘types’ of diabetic patients were enrolled (i.e. some of the patients were on insulin, some others on oral medications and some others on both). The profound impacts of insulin on endothelial function, of different degrees of insulin resistance and of some sulphonyl urea agents are well known. Therefore, the diabetic group would also be considered heterogeneous to be representative of a broad ‘diabetic condition’ from an ‘endothelial’ point of view.</p>
