<abstract>
<p>The role of the internet, and in particular e-health, in chronic illness is a burgeoning phenomenon but its use to date in cancer care is somewhat limited. In this study an iterative consultative process was undertaken with the aim to develop a cancer care website that was patient-led, facilitated cancer self-management and had the potential to improve communication between patients, family and friends and health care professionals. The process involved multiple demonstrations of an already established base platform (SeeCare<sup>©</sup>) to potential end users (patients, family members and friends and health professionals) to identify required functions of a cancer care specific platform. An exhaustive list of specifications was prioritised and operationalised resulting in a web platform for people affected by cancer that was ready for testing in the clinical setting: CanCare.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112460389" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), facilitated by the WWW, is becoming commonplace in chronic illness health care. Telemedicine, as defined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987112460389">World Health Organisation (1998)</xref> is the delivery of health care services, by a range of health care professionals, where distance is a critical factor. Telemedicine is an umbrella term for all ICT applications used in direct patient care and can facilitate timely communication between health care providers and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112460389">Eland-de Kok et al., 2011</xref>); and it has the potential to result in improved patient outcomes as well as a reduction in health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112460389">Davalos et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An example of telemedicine was tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of veterans with type 2 diabetes who had suboptimal glycaemic control. There was a significant improvement in blood glucose readings in the group using telemedicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112460389">Stone et al., 2010</xref>). This group monitored blood glucose, blood pressure and weight, recorded them daily and transmitted them electronically through a secure home telemonitoring device enabling timely self-management support from a nurse practitioner. In another RCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112460389">Lorig et al., 2006</xref>) patients with chronic illnesses, including heart and lung disease and type 2 diabetes, showed significant improvement in health status when using an internet-based self-management programme – an interactive course designed to improve self-efficacy. Self-management was enhanced through provision of information, for example to manage negative emotions and fatigue as well as development of action plans and ways to solve problems.</p>
<p>Self-management is a major component of the Chronic Care Model where the patients themselves become the principal caregivers with the support of health professionals to help them and their carers to acquire skills and confidence to manage chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112460389">Bodenheimer et al., 2002</xref>). With a growing trend in using ICT to facilitate chronic illness care and enhance self-management it can be argued that ICT and telemedicine will have a role to play in a myriad of illnesses where self-management is a vital component of patient care.</p>
<p>Cancer is increasingly recognised as a chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112460389">McCorkle et al., 2011</xref>). Currently in Australia the model of care for chronic illnesses mainly sits in the primary care setting. There is an emphasis on patient-centred care where consumers are active participants in managing their illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112460389">Bodenheimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987112460389">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987112460389">Zwar et al., 2006</xref>). Cancer care in contrast is primarily managed across acute care settings, commonly involves various treatment teams and is by and large clinician-centred. Patients receiving care in acute public hospitals will rarely see the same clinician at hospital visits and care fragmentation can often occur. There is limited and often delayed communication with the patient’s primary care physician. Traditional means of communication between clinicians via the postal system can impact on continuity of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112460389">Kripalani et al., 2007</xref>). The use of health ICT that allows communication to occur in real time has the potential to improve communication processes and can potentially improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Patients with a range of cancer diagnoses are known to actively pursue health and illness information online. Such practices assist patients to become involved in medical decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112460389">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Engagement in online support groups and communities is common practice for people affected by cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112460389">Hoybye et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112460389">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112460389">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>) as is blogging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112460389">Oransky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112460389">Kim and Chung, 2007</xref>) thereby making internet use very much a part of everyday life.</p>
<p>Many physicians are reluctant to communicate with their patients by email because of concerns about privacy, confidentiality and medico-legal issues. However, the use of secure web-based portals addresses such concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112460389">Katz and Moyer, 2004</xref>) and allows communication at times that are convenient to both the patient and the physician and supports the needs of our highly mobile society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112460389">Sands et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112460389">Kittler et al., 2004</xref>). Web-based portals also have the ability to address ‘unmet’ communication needs of patients, which not only improves patient satisfaction but enables a more effective service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112460389">Katz and Moyer, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The project presented here is a government funded partnership between health care researchers at a Specialist Cancer Centre and an ICT company based in Melbourne, Australia. The overall aim of the project was to develop and test a patient-led, cancer specific care and communication website that built on the already established care coordination system for chronic illness known as SeeCare (www.seecare.net.au). SeeCare is a patient-led website that uses Web 2.0 technology to allow users with chronic illnesses to self-manage their care. Friends, carers and health professionals are invited to support individuals through the website with the patient controlling access to their site. Individual users create their own profile page (similar to Facebook<sup>©</sup>). Patients can develop care plans that include actions and activities in order to have a visual diary of their illness care. This can be shared with others as permitted by each patient and patients can invite friends, carers and health professionals to support them in these actions and activities. SeeCare supports self-management through development of individual action plans and allows for timely communication between patients and health care providers.</p>
<p>This paper reports on the findings from year one of a small exploratory two year pilot project to develop the cancer specific version of SeeCare, known as CanCare. CanCare aims to facilitate self-management of symptoms and side-effects of cancer and its treatment, linking patients, carers and health professionals to enable real time communication. Patient users complete symptom scales related to symptoms and side-effects from cancer treatment and relevant health professionals (as permitted by patient users) can access this in real time. All users have access to up to date evidence-based information regarding symptoms and side-effects of cancer and its treatment as well as links to reputable cancer websites through the CanCare website.</p>
<p>Year one of this project consisted of three phases involving initial demonstrations of SeeCare, alpha testing of ‘mock ups’ of new and changed functions and then final changes to the actual site in readiness for ‘live’ testing of CanCare in year two. The aims and methods for phases one and two are presented together followed by results. The methods and results of phase three are presented together. This is followed by a discussion of all the findings and the implications for year two.</p>
<p>The Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, where the study was conducted, provided ethical approval for all three phases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112460389"><title>Overall aim of year one</title>
<p>The over arching aim was to establish the content specifications and functions of CanCare through targeted consultation with people affected by cancer and health professionals involved in cancer care. For the purpose of this paper, people affected by cancer include current patients, survivors and current or bereaved carers and are collectively referred to as patient end users. Health professional end users or participants are referred to as HP end users and include medical specialists, nurses, general practitioners (GPs) and allied health professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112460389"><title>Phases one and two</title>
<sec id="sec4-1744987112460389"><title>Aims</title>
<p>The aim of phases one and two was to determine the requirements and then develop a prototype of a patient-led, web-based platform (CanCare) that would facilitate self-management and improve communication between parties involved in cancer care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112460389" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>In order to engage with a broad spectrum of people affected by cancer representing various demographics patient end users were approached via advertisements in hospital and community based cancer consumer organisations (CanTeen, onTrac@petermac, Cancer Voices and the PeterMac Consumer Advisory Committee) as well as newspaper advertisements. This method of self-selection attracted ‘computer savvy’ users with an interest in health ICT. Additionally, a targeted approach to CanTeen, (an Australian organisation for young people living with cancer) and onTrac@petermac, (a Victorian adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer service) was made to engage with hypothesised frequent users and early adopters of new ICT. HP end users were targeted through primary care, community care and specialist centres in both metropolitan and regional areas, ensuring a broad demographic of health professionals involved in cancer care engaged in this project</p>
<p>Following recruitment, socio-demographic data, computer usage and information about confidence in using the internet were collected from patient and HP end users via semi-structured questionnaires developed by the research team. These data were collected before the consultation and/or demonstration commenced. A Nurse Researcher and Research Assistant demonstrated SeeCare to patient and HP end users either face-to-face individually or in groups or via a remote link (www.yugma.com) that allowed a demonstration of SeeCare to be seen on the participant’s own computer while discussing it on the telephone. When viewing SeeCare, patient and HP end users were asked to think about how the site could be used in a cancer setting to facilitate self-management and enhance communication between patients and their support team (carers, friends and health professionals). Feedback and suggestions for change or additional functions were documented and collated by the research team and rolling cycles of demonstrations ensured that subsequent participants were aware of previous suggestions and further feedback was invited. A predetermined sample size was not required as data were collected until saturation of ideas was reached.</p>
<p>Following the consultation phase a prototype of CanCare was developed in the form of ‘mock-ups’, which are a static screen version of what the revised website would look like. Use case scenarios, a technique for capturing the potential requirements of a new system or software change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112460389">Jacobson et al., 1992</xref>), were used to inform the requested changes. Utilising use case scenarios allowed for a deeper knowledge of the intended website functionalities, and a greater shared understanding between all the researchers. Each use case provides one or more scenarios or brief narrative to describe the hypothetical use of a system thereby conveying how the system should interact with the end user or another system to achieve a specific goal.</p>
<p>Rolling cycles of mock-up demonstrations were undertaken with patient and HP end users (alpha testing). Newly recruited end users completed socio-demographic and computer usage information prior to these demonstrations. Following mock-up demonstrations participants were asked to complete an online survey about the functions with specific questions about the ‘new’ functions and design of the website. Each question had a response category ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. There was also an opportunity for end users to make general comments in relation to each question. This survey was developed by the research team using ‘Survey Monkey’ and was based on similar questionnaires about website functionality and usability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112460389">McNamara and Kirakowski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112460389">Wang and Senecal, 2008</xref>). A link to the survey was emailed to participants once mock-up demonstrations were completed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112460389" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Many of the phase one patient end users also took part in phase two. Therefore, to avoid duplication, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987112460389">Table 1</xref> presents data on the method of participation of patient and HP end users in both phases. Likewise, demographic data and internet/computer usage for all end users in phases one and two are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112460389">Table 2</xref>. It is important to note that not all patient end users completed these data.

<sec id="sec7-1744987112460389"><title>Phase one</title>
<sec id="sec8-1744987112460389"><title>Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 30 patient end users completed one or more of the following activities: provided socio-demographic and computer usage information (<italic>n</italic> = 24); answered semi-structured questions about use of the internet, seeking out cancer related information and ideas for the CanCare website (<italic>n</italic> = 24); and watched a demonstration of the SeeCare website (<italic>n</italic> = 24).</p>
<p>Although not specifically asked about their cancer diagnosis almost all of the 22 patients/survivors openly discussed this information. Eleven patient end users were receiving treatment for their cancer at the time of participation. Of these, seven had advanced disease that was considered incurable: multiple myeloma (<italic>n</italic> = 3), breast cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 2), sarcoma (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and leukaemia (<italic>n</italic> = 1). In contrast four patient end users were receiving treatment for sarcoma (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and lymphoma (<italic>n</italic> = 2) with curative intent. Eleven patient end users described themselves as cancer survivors, that is they had completed curative treatment for their cancer (breast cancer <italic>n</italic> = 5, leukaemia <italic>n</italic> = 1, sarcoma <italic>n</italic> = 1, lymphoma <italic>n</italic> = 1). Three patient end users did not provide information about their cancer diagnosis or treatment.</p>
<p>Three patient end users were caring for family members receiving treatment for cancer, one of whom had an incurable cancer. Five were carers of patients who had died.</p>
<p>Sixty-eight HP end users working in a range of settings (primary care, community care and specialist centres) in both metropolitan and regional areas participated in SeeCare demonstrations during this phase. Five participated in individual demonstrations, four face-to-face and one remotely and the remainder in one of seven group demonstrations. The mean age of HP end users was 43.5 years; they were predominantly nurses (64%) and female (83%).</p>
<p>Most patient and HP end users had between one and three computers at home and felt confident in using the internet. Other demographic information along with current internet usage by patient and HP end users is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112460389">Table 2</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987112460389"><title>Internet usage and desired content and functions</title>
<p>Patient end users were asked about their internet usage. Most used it for email and social networking, online shopping and banking. Being affected by cancer prompted all but four patient end users to use the internet to seek general cancer information and more specific information about diagnoses, treatments and side-effects.</p>
<p>HP end users used the internet for email and social networking but not to the same degree as patient end users. Almost one-third used the internet for personal use for one to two hours per day. When asked if they advised patients to look at cancer related information on the internet, just over half advised use of reputable websites only. Commonly mentioned sites included the Leukaemia Foundation (www.leukaemia.org.au) and the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre (now amalgamated with Cancer Australia www.canceraustralia.gov.au).</p>
<p>When asked for their views on what should be included on the CanCare website, patient end users suggested blogs, links to cancer information but most importantly they wanted the website to be easy to use. All but one patient end user wanted to be able to access personal health information, and in particular to share this with persons of their choosing such as family, carers, friends, their general practitioner or other health professionals in different centres as well as their primary cancer treatment team. Patient end users wanted the ability to personalise their own web pages and be alerted to upcoming appointments. In general, online advertising was deemed acceptable as long as it was appropriate, for example healthy lifestyle behaviours but not how to lose weight in five days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987112460389"><title>SeeCare demonstration feedback</title>
<p>With each SeeCare demonstration, researchers documented responses and feedback from patient end users about desired requirements and functions of a cancer care website. These responses reflect the following areas: technical, clinical and practical.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1744987112460389"><title>Technical</title>
<p>Suggestions considered to be related to technical aspects of the website included the inclusion of a Skype/video link to facilitate communication with health professionals and Microsoft Outlook features to improve ease of use. Most consumers thought the platform appeared ‘very busy’ and old fashioned and preferred a more visually welcoming and modern style. Several patient end users expressed a wish to personalise the website to make it more inviting to use, for example use colours and logos from their football team.</p>
<p>Visibility of all appointments to all those involved in patient care with automatic uploading of appointments from hospital systems was deemed highly relevant by HP end users. The ability to view patient notes from other systems such as hospital based electronic records and community nursing electronic records was also raised as a function likely to improve communication and patient care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987112460389"><title>Clinical</title>
<p>Patient end users wanted access to their medical information through the website so it could be shared with others involved in their care, regardless of their location, and in real time. An extension to this was to include an ID card with details about the website, so that health professionals could access relevant information in a medical emergency. Other suggestions included the ability to access reliable (evidence-based) self care information and a facility to send an SMS message to a mobile phone when a new notification or alert was entered onto the website. The message would encourage the recipient to log on to the website.</p>
<p>For HP end users the benefits of sharing information between health professionals and the ability to communicate with all health professionals involved in patient care, in particular the GP, was highlighted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987112460389"><title>Practical</title>
<p>Practical suggestions included the ability to group support people so that groups rather than individuals could be notified of new information or situations. This would avoid the need to send the same notification to multiple users. For example grouping all community nurses so that information about changes to a wound dressing could be shared among involved nurses. Some patient end users felt it was very important to be supported to use the website as it would be difficult to navigate when unwell. Others suggested the inclusion of online forums and the development of support networks through the website.</p>
<p>HP end users were concerned the website would exclude patients from culturally and linguistically diverse groups as well as patients without access to the internet. There was also concern about the possibility of large numbers of friends registering to be involved in a patient’s care through the website resulting in the site becoming more like a Facebook or social networking tool with limited scope for comprehensive patient support. A suggestion to set up blogs as part of the website was not received favourably by HP end users as there was concern about monitoring and responding to postings of high risk behaviours such as illicit drug use. Such behaviours are not uncommon amongst adolescents and young adults with cancer (Morgan et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Overall, feedback was encouraging and HP end users appeared in favour of a system like this being developed. However, some HP end users were reticent about actual benefits and integration with existing hospital systems and were worried about the perceived increase in workload such a system could generate. Privacy issues and legal implications of communicating health related information over the internet were also of concern.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987112460389"><title>Phase two</title>
<p>Fourteen patient end users were shown the mock-ups, nine of whom had previously viewed SeeCare and five who had never seen SeeCare before. The five new patient end users were given a combined SeeCare/mock-up demonstration as well as completing demographic and internet usage questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112460389">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Twenty-three HP end users had a combined SeeCare/mock-up demonstration, all in a group setting, none of whom had previously seen SeeCare. A further four HP end users who participated in phase one had a mock-up demonstration, three in a group format and one carried out remotely. Demographic and internet usage details were also collected from this cohort and are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987112460389">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Feedback and suggestions for change during the demonstrations were documented and later collated by the researchers. Eleven end users completed the online survey. Frequency of responses was calculated but not all end users completed every question. The comments sections within the survey enabled end users to provide qualitative responses. As this survey was anonymous it was not possible to elicit whether respondents were patient or HP end users.</p>
<p>Results from the online survey showing the number of end users who agreed or strongly agreed are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987112460389">Table 3</xref>. The qualitative data elicited from the survey and the mock-up demonstration feedback displayed similar themes to the feedback received in phase one in terms of potential benefits and burdens. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>The site will rely on health professionals actually utilising it – thus a lot of its success will be largely dependent on the ‘buy in' from these people (survey response).

<sec id="sec15-1744987112460389"><title>Phase three</title>
<sec id="sec16-1744987112460389"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of phase three was to specify what changes should be made to SeeCare as per the recommendations from both patient and HP end users who were consulted in the first two phases. In addition functional requirements for utilities and infrastructure in support of the trial itself were identified. These include utilities for set-up and management of the trial. There was no further health professional or organisational involvement in this phase as the feedback from phases one and two had elicited the desired requirements. The health care researchers and ICT partner worked closely together in phase three to ensure the majority of these requirements were met within the project budget and timeframe as detailed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987112460389" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec18-1744987112460389"><title>Step one: Collation, analysis and categorisation</title>
<p>All phase one and two demonstration feedback responses were collated and analysed across three categories: technical, clinical and practical. The number of responses totalled 253, and ranged from very minor suggestions to very significant improvements of functional user requirements. The steps carried out in phase three are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987112460389">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1744987112460389" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The steps of phase three</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987112460389-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1744987112460389"><title>Step two: Benefit versus effort analysis</title>
<p>Given the wide range of potential changes identified by end users, a process for prioritising these was required. The initial prioritisation consisted of two types of assessment:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Perceived benefit: using ‘high’ or ‘low’ priority;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Perceived demand: using ‘essential’, ‘conditional’ and ‘optional’ ratings.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In determining the benefits, three additional considerations were also included:
<list id="list1-1744987112460389" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Functionality that could potentially encourage HP end users to engage in using CanCare was given a higher priority.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Functionality which was requested by patient end users but considered potentially controversial by HP end users was lowered in priority.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Functionality that was required in support of the trial was considered essential and was given a relatively higher priority.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Of note, specific functionality requested by patient end users (e.g. access to medical information) was removed from the scope of the project due to organisational and cultural constraints and, in particular, concerns expressed by HREC. It is possible that such constraints/restrictions affected the usefulness and appeal of the system.</p>
<p>Following the analysis of benefit, the IT partner grouped the improvements into technically related and interdependent functionality. Grouping the possible improvements allowed for identification of functional dependencies where one improvement may be dependant on another improvement.</p>
<p>Possible improvements were tagged as: Core Deliverables (essential project functionalities), Nice to Have (functionality which would be nice to include subject to available time and resources), Optional (low priority functionality), and Discard (functionality no longer considered worthwhile or relevant to the project). This resulted in an agreed overall scope for the system to be trialled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1744987112460389"><title>Step three: Use cases</title>
<p>Individual functionalities were further analysed as use case scenarios. The use case methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112460389">Jacobson et al., 1992</xref>) identified the types of users/roles interacting with the system in that scenario. It then proceeded sequentially along a four way progression: detailing the system interaction between the user, information to CanCare, information from CanCare, and control by the user of CanCare.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1744987112460389"><title>Step four: Holistic review</title>
<p>A review of all user requirements and the system as a whole was carried out and consequently more functionality was added to ensure the website was more complete and coherent for prospective clinical trial users in year two. At the conclusion of this phase a complete specification of user requirements for the trialled system were documented and agreed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1744987112460389"><title>Step five: Requirements for data collection and analytics</title>
<p>A list of website usage data and reporting requirements was compiled and finalised by the research team to facilitate tracking of user activities and collation of this information during the trial. The analytics utilities grouped and analysed the collected data. These requirements included identification and extraction of different types or patterns of access and dissemination of information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987112460389"><title>Step six: Updates following quality control and testing</title>
<p>Once the new functionalities were implemented into the system, quality control with testing by both the health care and ICT researchers utilising all new functions across the website was carried out. Additional improvements were logged using an open source reporting system, Mantis.</p>
<p>Additionally the website was populated with evidenced based self-care brochures, patient information about cancer and its treatment and side-effects and provision of links to reputable cancer related websites.</p>
<p>This process of developing the scope took longer than anticipated. However, the result was an agreed, well considered and properly specified scope for the trial.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1744987112460389" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper describes the processes used to engage patient and HP end users in the development of a patient-led self-management website for cancer care. To our knowledge this iterative process of demonstrating and documenting feedback with patient and HP end users and demonstrating proposed changes has not previously been described to this extent when reporting from a health ICT research setting. In total 35 patient end users and 91 HP end users viewed the base platform SeeCare and contributed to changes to existing functions and the creation of new functions that resulted in the development of the website CanCare. The aim of CanCare is to assist patients with cancer to self manage their care where appropriate and facilitate communication between patients and health care professionals.</p>
<p>When seeking patient end user engagement, the researchers were aware that recruitment processes would likely attract ‘computer savvy’ participants. Adolescents and young adults were aggressively targeted as this group are seen as early IT adopters and it was felt their comments would be informative and relevant. In looking at the patient end user group as a whole, there was an even spread between male and female, younger and older. A younger mean age was anticipated because of the recruitment approach utilised; however, the older demographic was encouraging given the increase in the incidence of cancer as people age. Thus the patient end users are likely to be representative of the population CanCare will be targeted to once fully developed and tested. Current trends in internet usage suggest that the 55–64 year age group have had the largest increase in the proportion of people accessing the internet (up from 63% to 71% in the last two years), although internet usage is highest in 18–24 year olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112460389">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>HP end users also represent well the health professionals working in cancer care with the majority of respondents being nurses and female and the average age of phase one and two HP end users being 43.9 years. The current Australian health care workforce has four times as many nurses as medical practitioners with the average age of nurses being 44.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112460389">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011</xref>). HP end users worked in both the acute care setting and primary/community care. Therefore, we are confident that feedback accurately reflects the potential for improvements in communication and sharing of information between health professionals, and health professionals and patients using Web 2.0 technology. Of note, the possibilities and opportunities provided by CanCare were viewed similarly by patient and HP end users.</p>
<p>However, HP end users were concerned about the extra work associated with providing patients with another means by which to contact them. This concern has also been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112460389">Bodenheimer and Grumbach (2003)</xref>, who describe an increase in communication workload for medical practitioners with the advent of email communication between patients and physicians. Duplication of data entry required if CanCare was not integrated with current hospital systems was also noted as a barrier to uptake by health professionals. HP end users were concerned about privacy issues, in particular around sharing of health information on a website that utilises Web 2.0 technologies. However, with the planned introduction of a Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) in Australia in 2012, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are working together to develop a national privacy regulation that focuses on the specific privacy needs of Australia’s health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112460389">Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>On a more positive note, the potential for improved communication between health professionals caring for patients was seen as a great improvement on current practice – where doctors receive paper communications often six weeks or more after a consultation. GPs highlighted the frustration at not receiving communication in a timely manner, which impacts on their ability to answer questions or give advice to their patients and to manage the side effects of cancer treatment.</p>
<sec id="sec25-1744987112460389"><title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>While the processes used to consult with end users were comprehensive, iterative and inclusive, several limitations must be noted. Firstly, demonstrations of the SeeCare website did not include ‘hands on’ use by end users. Suggestions for change and new functions may have differed if patient and HP end users had the opportunity to use SeeCare in real time and for their own purposes. All end users stressed the importance of a system that was easy to use and real time use may have highlighted functions that were later described as non-intuitive and clumsy (data will be reported elsewhere). Therefore, as well as finding out what end users wanted, one question asked should have been ‘Do patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for cancer treatment have the ability or capability to engage in ICT self-management projects?’</p>
<p>Furthermore, although suggested by end users, it was not feasible to integrate CanCare with existing hospital IT systems, which impacted on the ability to enhance communication between patients, carers and health professionals using CanCare in year two.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1744987112460389" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At the end of year one the CanCare prototype was ready for testing in year two with a group of patients undergoing chemotherapy for any type of cancer. The results of year two are described elsewhere.</p>
