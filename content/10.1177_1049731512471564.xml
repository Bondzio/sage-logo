<abstract>
<p>This article briefly chronicles the development of mixed methods research and its use in social work. We then move onto a discussion of terms and designs, reasons for (and for not) using mixed methods. Drawing upon exemplars, we address how to write up a mixed methods study when (1) the sample is single; single for one part, with a subset for the other; or, there is more than one sample; (2) the timing is concurrent or sequential; and (3) the priority or weighting is equal or weighted toward one method or the other (qualitative or quantitative). In addition we address the <italic>Discussion</italic> section of a mixed-methods article as an opportunity to integrate the qualitative and quantitative data for readers.</p>

<body>
<p>Social work researchers commonly practice four interrelated models of research: quantitative, qualitative, program evaluation, and single-subject design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512471564">Tripodi &amp; Potocky-Tripodi, 2007</xref>). While quantitative methods originally dominated social work doctoral programs, qualitative research courses, methods, and readings have grown in number and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512471564">Tripodi &amp; Lalayants, 2008</xref>). As more social work researchers are educated in qualitative methods, it follows that they would at times mix methods as they seek the best design to address complex social problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512471564">Menon and Cowger (2010</xref>) outline three advantages of integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in social work research including that it “(a) proffers increased validity due to the triangulation of methods, (b) provides an opportunity to take advantage of the strengths of each approach, and (c) allows congruence with the principles of social work to study things holistically …” (p. 612).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471564">Creswell and Plano Clark (2011</xref>) suggest that mixed methods research went through a formative stage in the 1970s; paradigm debate and procedural development phases through the 1980–1990s; next an advocacy and expansion period; and more recently is in a reflective period. Despite being a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, mixed methods research has developed into a “separate methodological orientation with its own worldview, vocabulary, and techniques” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512471564">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>, p. x). The onset of the <italic>Journal of Mixed Methods Research </italic>and the <italic>International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches </italic>in 2007, the increasing number of books and resources, including two chapters on mixed methods in the <italic>Sage Handbook on Qualitative Research </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512471564">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2011</xref>) and a relevant chapter in <italic>Program Evaluation: An Introduction</italic> (2010), acknowledge this trend, and serve to support researchers pursuing mixed methods designs to address their research questions.</p>
<p>Mixed methods research is becoming increasingly popular because it offers “a form of triangulation of method” whereby “the researcher can take advantage of the strengths and offset the weaknesses of each” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512471564">Royce, Thyer, &amp; Padgett, 2010</xref>, p. 99). In addition, mixed methods offer a unique capacity for synergy, breadth, and depth otherwise difficult to achieve with single methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512471564">Royce et al., 2010</xref>). Attending to both breadth and depth in a field like social work that is interested in documenting change and other measurable factors, but also in impacting quality of life and capturing people’s experiences provides an opportunity for generating a wider range of knowledge. Despite these advantages, conducting and thus writing a mixed methods study is a complicated endeavor. The vivid, narrative description and depth that is indicative of qualitative reports needs to flow and be well integrated with the numbers and tables that typically “tell the story” in quantitative reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512471564">Royce et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512471564">Bryman (2007</xref>) cites a number of challenges that frequently arise in integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. These revolve around varying skills of the researchers, the venue for publication or presentation, and structure of the research project including timelines. He asserts that more attention needs to be given to writing mixed methods research articles so that the two methodologies are genuinely integrated or “mutually illuminating” (p. 8). The <italic>Discussion</italic> section of a mixed methods report is often the place where the author assists the reader in making this integration. Bryman noted that researchers he interviewed were unable to cite exemplary mixed methods reports to emulate. To help address this need for guidance with writing the report, the second half of this article provides exemplars, illustrating the various ways mixed methods are combined including an exemplary <italic>Discussion</italic> section from a social work research report.</p>
<p>While the primary focus of this article is on writing the mixed methods report, because writing must flow logically from the research design, we start with an overview of the various mixed methods designs and the choices involved in preparing a mixed methods study. Following a brief discussion of terms and designs (<italic>what</italic> it is) and reasons for (and for not) using mixed methods (<italic>why</italic>), we address <italic>how</italic> to write a research report. Drawing upon exemplars from the social work-related literature, we illustrate how researchers thoughtfully utilize mixed methods research designs including the decisions made early on in their studies regarding <italic>what</italic> to mix and <italic>when</italic> and <italic>how</italic> to mix methods. As in qualitative and quantitative research, these decisions need to be guided by the research question(s) and purposes.</p>

<title>The What, Why, How, and When of Mixed Methods Research</title>
<sec id="section2-1049731512471564">
<title>What Mixed Methods Research Is</title>
<p>The influences of different disciplines and cultures, and the evolution of the process over time, may have contributed to the diversity of terms used to describe this research such as mixed methods, mixed model, mixed research, multimethod, multistrategy, and integrated methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512471564">Leech, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Combs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471564">Padgett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512471564">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>). Mixed methods research has been referred to as “an intuitive way of doing research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471564">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011</xref>, p. 1); pragmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512471564">Feilzer, 2010</xref>); and a practical approach that draws on the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative methods to more fully answer the research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512471564">Morgan, 1998</xref>). A critical question for mixed methods researchers is, what are you mixing? In addition to mixing methods, there are challenging decisions to make about whether you are mixing data and samples or keeping these separate. </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471564">Creswell and Plano Clark (2011</xref>) recommend a definition of mixed methods research that combines methods, philosophy, and research design orientation with the following core characteristics:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Collects and analyzes persuasively and rigorously both qualitative and quantitative data (based on research questions); </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Mixes (or integrates or links) the two forms of data concurrently by combining them (or merging them), sequentially by having one build on the other, or embedding one within the other;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Gives priority to one or to both forms of data (in terms of what the research emphasizes);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uses these procedures in a single study or in multiple phases of a program of study;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Frames these procedures within philosophical worldviews and theoretical lenses; and </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Combines the procedures into specific research designs that direct the plan for conducting the study (p. 5).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We address the timing and the priority or weighting of one over the other in greater detail below. But first, why would you want to use mixed methods?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049731512471564">
<title>Why: Reasons for Using Mixed Methods</title>
<p>One needs a good reason for using mixed methods, because doing so adds time, complexity of data collection, analysis, and writing, and requires knowledge of more than one research method. Given that most researchers tend to be trained more in one method than another, using mixed methods often requires additional training or forming a research team balanced in the two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512471564">Padgett, 2009</xref>). So why, in the face of these inherent challenges, is the use of mixed methods on the rise?</p>
<p>Mixed methods are useful when you have a need to both explore and explain, and when either qualitative or quantitative methods alone seems inadequate for the complexity of the research questions and topics that many social and health studies address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512471564">Creswell, 2009</xref>). Thus, mixed methods are used when the purpose of the research dictates it, not because it seems like a trendy thing to do or a way to combine two studies. It is a strategy that uses the strengths of one method to enhance the performance of another (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512471564">Morgan, 1998</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471564">Padgett (2008</xref>) identifies the following three basic reasons for carrying out mixed methods studies: (1) Triangulation—comparisons for corroboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512471564">Morse, 1991</xref>); (2) Complementarity—for enhancement or clarification because “qualitative and quantitative substudies represent different pieces of the puzzle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471564">Padgett, 2008</xref>, p. 222); and (3) Expansion—a broader theoretical understanding can come from juxtaposing these two perspectives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512471564">Green, Caracelli, &amp; Graham, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512471564">Leech and Onwuegbuzie (2010</xref>) argue that a good mixed methods researcher articulates the reasons for choosing to use mixed methods, provides the rationale for combining methods, and explains how doing so enhances the research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731512471564">
<title>How and When: Timing and Structure</title>
<p>One way to conceptualize mixed methods designs is to picture them along a continuum, some starting with qualitative and adding quantitative or vice versa in a sequential manner; others are described as balanced, concurrent, or simultaneous drawing more equally from each end of the continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471564">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471564">Padgett, 2008</xref>). In addition to the timing of which you conduct first, one method is often weighted more heavily or is more dominant than the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512471564">Padgett (2008</xref>, p. 223) provides the following visual to help illustrate these dynamics and research options with those in capital letters being more dominant:</p>
<p>These illustrate the sequential studies indicating which is dominant:<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1049731512471564">

<p>Another dimension involves whether the design is fixed or emergent. In a <italic>fixed</italic> design, the decisions about which qualitative and quantitative methods to use and in what order are made at the beginning of the study. An <italic>emergent</italic> mixed methods design offers the flexibility to add a second approach if once underway, one method seems inadequate for the research question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512471564">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2011</xref>). How your study is designed around the above dimensions plays an important role in how you later write up your report. While not all of these dimensions are necessarily written up in the research report such as whether the study is fixed or emergent, there are components that are critical to include in your report. These critical components of a mixed methods research report are addressed in the next section and are illustrated with exemplars from the literature. One might wonder when a study is a series of components, and when it might more realistically be considered separate studies. This will be determined by your research questions, perhaps the reality of time and financial support for a project, and the clarity and direction you and your research team articulate. While these decisions will have been made by the time you are writing your report, this may have implications earlier on with your Institutional Review Board (IRB). Consult the IRB early on if you have questions about this, as reviewers may interpret it differently and provide some guidance. Additionally, when writing a grant proposal, clarify for the funders, your rationale for using mixed methods, as opposed to separate studies. These initial clarifications of purpose make writing the report easier. </p>

<title>Mixed Methods Research Studies: Exemplars in Social Work-Related Literature</title>
<p>Social workers conduct and write up mixed methods research addressing complex social problems in the vast array of ways in which it can be implemented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512471564">Yamatani, Engel, and Spjeldnes (2009</xref>) acknowledge the use of mixed methods “because of the analytic complexity of this question” (p. 363) related to their research questions about child welfare workers’ caseloads. Given the diversity of approaches within mixed methods, it is critical that authors guide readers by clarifying terms used and informing them about the methodology in greater detail than is usually needed in a purely quantitative study. For example, saying you conducted a survey in mixed methods research does not tell your audience whether your survey was composed of close-ended questions and part of your quantitative evaluation, or open-ended and part of your qualitative evaluation, or both, and possibly the sole vehicle for your mixed methods study.</p>
<p>The primary ways in which mixed methods research reports are conceptualized and thus written are with consideration to a number of variables, most notably: the sample; the timing; and the priority of the study’s emphasis. Below, we include examples of ways to write up a mixed methods research study when (1) the sample is single; single for one part, with a subset for the other; or, there is more than one sample; (2) the timing is concurrent or sequential; and (3) the priority or weighting is equal or weighted towards one method or the other (qualitative or quantitative). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512471564">Table 1</xref> for an outline of these decisions in research design that also guide the writing of the report. In addition, we address the <italic>Discussion</italic> section of the article that provides an important opportunity to integrate the qualitative and quantitative data for readers.</p>

<title>Writing Up Your Sample in Mixed-Methods Research</title>
<p>Authors of mixed methods studies include their samples in a variety of places in their research reports. Sometimes each of their qualitative and quantitative samples are included in the same sections, but they can also be in different sections. As with all aspects of the mixed methods report, what is critical is to have a logical rationale for why the sample is written up and included where it is in the report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512471564">Leech &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2010</xref>). Below are examples of different types of samples commonly used in mixed methods research including the single sample, single sample with subset, and multiple samples; where this is located in the report; and, how they are written. </p>
<sec id="section7-1049731512471564">
<title>Single sample</title>
<p>When the qualitative and quantitative components of the research utilize the same sample, then the reporting of the sample is the same as it would be when using either one of these methodologies alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512471564">McWey, Bolen, Lehan, and Bojczyk (2009</xref>) utilize written questionnaires and oral interviews with 22 parents at risk of having their children placed in foster care. Since their sample is small they can provide detail about each participant, which they do with a chart noting marital status, income, highest grade completed, children’s ages, and reasons for child protective services involvement. Since many mixed-methods studies employ larger samples, such a detailed chart is not always realistic. In those cases, the samples need to be reported as composites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512471564">Reese, Chan, Chan, and Wiersgalla (2010</xref>) conducted a mixed methods survey of Hong Kong and U.S. student beliefs and preferences in end-of-life care. Because they have a sample of over 200, they present it as a composite in a table using percentages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049731512471564">
<title>Single sample with subset</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512471564">Abel and Campbell (2009</xref>) report on a mixed methods study of student-centered learning in two social work education classes. The quantitative evaluation is described in <italic>Study Sample</italic> section: “Fifty nine students took part in this study (Group 1 [n = 25]: Group 2 [n = 29])” (p. 9). The qualitative component of the study is described later in <italic>Data Collection</italic> section: “In addition to collecting survey data, the investigators collected data via focus groups. After collecting all completed surveys, the GTA (Graduate Teaching Assistant) asked for volunteers to participate in a focus group meeting to discuss the students’ perceptions of the ‘Advanced Direct Practice with Individuals’ class. The traditional course focus group was composed of 8 students; 15 students comprised the focus group from the transformed class” (p. 9). This detail helps identify the subset within the single sample.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512471564">Sano, Katras, Lee, Bauer, and Berry (2010</xref>) provide another example of an initial quantitative sample with a subset, in their longitudinal study of rural low-income mothers. They describe their sample in the <italic>Subsample</italic> section because it is a subsample of a larger study: “All 131 mothers with intermittent employment were included in the quantitative analysis. For the qualitative analysis, 25% of the intermittently employed mothers from each of the three sub-groups (n = 33) were randomly chosen in order to reduce the number of interviews to a reasonable number for qualitative analysis” (p. 344).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049731512471564">
<title>More than one sample</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512471564">Beecher (2009</xref>) describes a mixed methods study with a sample that includes both a subset and an additional sample. The subset and additional qualitative sample are described in <italic>Qualitative Data Collection</italic> section: “(a) 43 practitioners who completed the quantitative survey also responded to the open-ended question regarding any additional feedback; and (b) 8 purposefully selected mental health practitioners completed an electronic structured qualitative question guide” (p.269). Later, the quantitative sample is described as a part of the <italic>Findings</italic> section, in <italic>Participant Characteristics</italic> section: “The survey instrument was sent to 150 practitioners working with adults in a large, comprehensive U.S. mental health center located in the West. Eighty-eight responded (59%)” (p. 270). This detail helps identify the multiple samples.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512471564">Bronstein, Ball, Mellin, Wade-Mdivanian, and Anderson-Butcher (2011</xref>) describe their two samples completely separately because there was no overlap in their samples. They compare preparation and competencies of social workers practicing in schools that are employed by the schools and those employed by outside agencies. They used data from an online survey that was part of a larger study and describe their quantitative sample in the <italic>Methods</italic> section with <italic>Survey</italic> as a subsection: “A total of 606 participants completed the online survey; 30.6% of respondents (n = 186) indicated that they were social workers in school settings” (p. 85). In the <italic>Focus Group</italic> subsection, they describe the details of the recruitment and demographics of the 10 focus group participants, including that, “half of the participants were school-employed social workers and half were agency-employed school-based social workers” (p. 87).</p>

<sec id="section10-1049731512471564">
<title>Timing</title>
<p>Most often mixed-methods research studies in social work are concurrent, meaning that the qualitative and quantitative components are carried out in a parallel way in the same time frame. Less often they are sequential, meaning that one study is completed prior to the other one beginning. Just as with a single sample as compared with multiple samples, when writing up a concurrent study, there are more parts that can be written up together than is the case when writing up a sequential study when there are different components that need description. Below are a few examples of how concurrent mixed-methods studies are written up in social work-related research reports.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049731512471564">
<title>Concurrent</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512471564">Hodge and Roby (2010</xref>) interviewed sub-Saharan women living with HIV/AIDS in an effort to explore their coping strategies, with a focus on their spiritual coping strategies. Researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with women using a survey containing both open- and close-ended questions. Since it is an extremely short survey they could describe their administration of it very explicitly and did so as follows, clearly outlining the distinct qualitative and quantitative components:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Of the three items, the first two are qualitative. The first item asked, “How do you cope with your situation? How do you keep from getting (more) depressed, sad, or discouraged?” The two-part second item asked, “Do your spiritual or religious beliefs or activities help you cope? If respondents answered affirmatively, they were asked, “How? Can you give some examples?”</p>
<p>The third (quantitative) item consisted of a visual analog scale designed to assess the degree to which spiritual or religious beliefs or activities helped women cope with their situation. The scale ranged from 0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 10 = <italic>the most important</italic> factor that keeps me going (p. 30).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Authors often discuss the timing of their studies (concurrent vs. sequential) at the same time they discuss whether quantitative or qualitative was primary or whether they were both equal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512471564">Lietz (2010</xref>) wrote up her concurrent mixed methods study of critical thinking in child welfare supervision by referring to both its timing and its priority of method: “The study used the concurrent nested research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512471564">Creswell, 2009</xref>) which included 21 close-ended quantitative questions that were supplemented with 2 open-ended qualitative questions to draw out further description of the respondents’ experiences” (p. 71).</p>
<p>While the two examples above both used single methods (a face-to-face or online survey), concurrent studies can also use multiple methods. As long as they are administered in the same time frame and conceptualized as part of the same study, they are considered concurrent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049731512471564">
<title>Sequential</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512471564">Bronstein et al. (2011</xref>) used a sequential design where the qualitative and quantitative components were implemented as two distinct phases of the study. Because of this, the methods for each part of the study—<italic>Procedures</italic> and <italic>Sample</italic>, <italic>Measurement</italic> and <italic>Data Analysis</italic> were presented separately for the quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative and qualitative <italic>Results</italic> were also presented separately. These distinct parts followed an integrated literature review and explanation of the study and its research questions and preceded an integrated closing, which included a discussion, section on limitations, implications, and conclusion.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-1049731512471564">
<title>Priority of the Study’s Emphasis: Dominance or Weighting</title>
<p>As noted above, mixed-methods studies can either be more heavily quantitative with qualitative data supplementing the quantitative, more heavily qualitative with quantitative data supplementing the qualitative data, or they can give equal weight to both methods. Below, we provide examples of how to write up your report depending upon how your study is weighted. </p>
<sec id="section14-1049731512471564">
<title>Equal weight</title>
<p>Above, we described Beecher’s (2009) three different samples as part of his research about families with individuals with schizophrenia. He describes the equal weight he placed on both the qualitative and quantitative components of his study:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A concurrent triangulation mixed methods research design was used to more fully explore practitioner views toward families and barriers to collaboration. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed with equal priority, no advocacy lens was used, and analysis was separate but converged in the data interpretation stage (p. 268). </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512471564">McWey et al. (2009</xref>) described both the timing and the equal primacy of methods in the same paragraph in their study of parents at risk of involvement in the foster care system. They went beyond identifying the timing and primacy of method and assisted the reader in understanding how the methods served the research question: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p> … a mixed methods concurrent triangulation design was used … With this type of design, both quantitative and qualitative data are collected at the same time and given equal weight. Also with concurrent triangulation, the quantitative and qualitative data are analyzed separately, but are integrated when interpretations of the data are made (pp. 80-81). </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>McWey and colleagues clarify they used in-depth interviews to gather qualitative data and instruments were used to collect data on measurable constructs. Regarding analysis and rigor, they note: “The qualitative data were analyzed and then integrated with the quantitative scores as both a means of triangulation and an enhancement of the qualitative results … (pp. 80-81). This is a good example of providing additional explanation of sampling and data collection strategies to help the reader follow the details about the process and thus the advantages of the equal weight of the qualitative and quantitative design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049731512471564">
<title>Unequal weight (dominant or less dominant)</title>
<p> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512471564">Okamoto, Kulis, Helm, Edwards, and Giroux (2010</xref>) examined gender differences in drug-offer situations of native Hawaiian youths in rural communities. Below, they described their study, in which the quantitative is dominant:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512471564">Morgan (1998</xref>) would categorize our study as “qual-QUANT,” in which the qualitative component of the study was conducted first although it was considered secondary to the quantitative findings. Despite its ancillary nature, the qualitative data in this study were critical because they were used in two ways—first, to develop a quantitative survey and second, to elucidate the findings from the survey. In other words, the qualitative data were reanalyzed after the quantitative data were collected and analyzed to elucidate the quantitative findings (p. 294).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the description may not need to be as elaborate as the above, recognition of relative weight of the quantitative and qualitative components is important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512471564">Dossa and Capitman (2010</xref>) gave a more succinct but adequate explanation of methodological weight in their study of community-based disability prevention programs for older adults: “The design was primarily quantitative, with a concurrent supplementary qualitative component” (p. 238).</p>
<p>Sometimes researchers do not explicitly state that they are weighting one method over the other but this is implied in the way that they write up the report. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512471564">Meyer, McWey, McKendrick, and Henderson (2010</xref>) studied court documents to ascertain a link between termination of parental rights and substance use. While they did not directly state that their study was largely quantitative and indeed they stated that their method could be either, the way they wrote their report using numbers and terms such as inter-rater reliability implies a more quantitative focus:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Content analysis can be quantitative, qualitative, or both … We conducted a directed, mixed-methods content analysis of appellant court cases. Using a mixed-methods approach, quantitative tracking of the occurrence of themes and in-depth qualitative descriptions of such themes were explored … </p>
<p>three coders verified each others’ quantitative and qualitative coding. The Cohen’s Kappa inter-rater reliability coefficients ranged from 0.90 to 0.93 when comparing the coders to one another (i.e., comparing Reviewers 1 and 2, Reviewers 1 and 3, and Reviewers 2 and 3; p. 642).</p>

<title>The Discussion Section</title>
<p>While there are varying ways to write up the “insides” of the research report depending on the variables cited above, it often comes to the <italic>Discussion</italic> section as the place to do an integration of the qualitative and quantitative findings. Many researchers will also add sections on <italic>Implications</italic> and <italic>Conclusions</italic> as places to expand on the <italic>Findings</italic> and to take the integration further. Occasionally, one sees mixed methods research reports that drop off and end after the <italic>Findings</italic> and the reader is left to do the integration himself or herself. A good <italic>Discussion</italic> section leaves one understanding why the researcher took the time to do such a complicated study and can help to pull together findings, which may otherwise appear contradictory or unrelated. Below are two examples from a well-integrated <italic>Discussion</italic> section from a mixed methods study that pulls from the quantitative (service use records) and qualitative (interviews) data and examines the impact of medical and substance abuse service use among chronically homeless street dwellers:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Only 9 individuals of the cohort of 174 did not access any of these services, indicating that most high-risk street dwellers can be engaged in services and successfully referred from the streets to either health and/or substance abuse programs. However, referral data from respite and detoxification programs and information collected in interviews with providers and consumers indicate that high-risk street dwellers usually returned to the streets after treatment completion at either type of program. This finding points to a service gap between respite or detoxification care and the next step in the continuum of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512471564">Meschede, 2010</xref>, p. 165).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These summative and explanatory sentences help the reader make connections between the qualitative and quantitative findings illustrating that together these methods provide a more complete understanding of the phenomenon, especially as the authors continue on to integrate the findings:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In terms of the respite program, the only health-related service focusing on the housing needs of homeless patients, findings were inconsistent. Receiving care at a homeless respite facility predicted lower odds of attaining housing, whereas stays well in excess over the average 30 days predicted better access to housing. This finding was supported by interviews with respite care providers and high-risk cohort members who explained that moving into housing directly from respite care occurred only when exceptions to the normal length of stay were made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512471564">Meschede, 2010</xref>, p. 166).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While readers may make the same assessments as authors on their own after reading <italic>Findings</italic>, a well-integrated <italic>Discussion</italic> section assists readers of the mixed methods research report in maximizing their understanding of the interplay of different types of data, especially when <italic>Findings</italic> are complicated and/or contradictory. </p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From the outset of any study, it is important to have a rationale that demonstrates the logic between the purpose of the research and its design. Since mixed methods (and many qualitative studies) require a great deal of creative decision-making that goes beyond traditional quantitative study designs, a well-conceived explanation of one’s rationale for choosing certain methods, research designs, and steps for helping to assure rigor is required. Providing this rationale in your report is an excellent opportunity to educate readers about mixed methods research.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512471564">Giddings and Grant (2007</xref>) raise some important questions in their critique of mixed methods research to consider at the beginning of any research process when one might be considering using mixed methods. They argue it may serve as a “Trojan House for positivism” fearing it may signal a move away from “exploring more philosophical questions or undertaking modes of inquiry that challenge the status quo” (p. 52). Addressing the nursing profession, but equally relevant for social work, they warn readers that “mixed methods does not need to play this role” (p.59).</p>
<p>Regarding possible barriers to writing up mixed methods studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512471564">Bryman (2007</xref>) cautions researchers to “genuinely integrate” (p. 8) findings, maximizing the use of the multiple methods. Acknowledging that mixed methods researchers may not always intend to fully integrate, he encourages them to explore this in greater depth so as to make “the most of the data they collect” (p. 9).</p>
<p>In the 21st century, social workers address exceedingly complex issues in an increasingly complicated and diverse world. Utilizing and publishing mixed methods research that is accessible to practitioners serves to both honor and to address the complexity of many issues our constituents face. Additional methodological tools for answering the questions that plague clients enhance our opportunities to improve practice approaches, empower communities, and influence the policies that guide and impact our world. Developing, conducting, and writing up clear, strong mixed methods research reports that have the ability to make research findings more accessible can move the social work field forward. Ultimately, such studies serve to do what social work researchers come in to this field to do: improve lives for individuals, groups, families, organizations, and communities; and make the world a more just place for all. </p>
