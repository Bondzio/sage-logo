<p>In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.00, with the justification, “In the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full time should have to live in poverty.”</p>
<p>The impact of raising the minimum wage has been debated in a number of macroeconomic analyses with conflicting conclusions. This is an overview of the beneficiaries in the U.S. labor force if an increase is authorized.</p>
<p>The minimum wage was increased to the current $7.25 effective July 2009. That was the third of three increases authorized under President Bush. Previously, the law increased the minimum to $5.85 effective July 2007, and then to $6.55 in July 2008.</p>
<p>For someone working a 40-hour week, the proposal will increase from $290 to $360, for a difference of $3,640 if they work a full year.</p>
<p>In 2012, there were 75 million workers paid an hourly rate (that excludes those paid a salary and the self-employed). Of the total, 3.55 million or 4.7% were paid at or below the minimum wage. Currently the total U.S. civilian workforce is 155 million, with 12.8 million unemployed.</p>
<p>The totals include 1.984 million paid below the $7.25 minimum. The law allows wage rates below the minimum for (a) workers paid in tips, (b) full-time students, (c) student learners, (d) disabled workers, and (e) all workers under age 20 in the first 90 days. Workers earning tips could earn significantly more than the minimum.</p>
<p>The minimum wage does not apply to businesses with revenues below $500,000. (In the 2007 Census of U.S. businesses, the latest available, there were 6.5 million firms and 57% had revenue below that level. They employed roughly 10 million workers.)</p>
<p>Roughly half of the hourly wage workers, 38 million, are in service, sales and office occupations, and those occupations account for 3 million at or below minimum wage workers—or 85% of the total.</p>
<p>By industry, the U.S. hourly wage labor force includes12.4 million working in wholesale and retail businesses, 12.9 in education and health care, and 9.3 in leisure and hospitality (for a total of roughly 35 million or 25% of all employed workers). Those industries account for 2.7 million of the minimum wage workers—or 77% of the total. The food service industry accounts for 1.6 million minimum wage workers.</p>
<p>In 2011 (the latest year these data are available), there were 18.1 million part-time workers and 2.25 million were paid at or below minimum wage. That is 59% of the total.</p>
<p>Sorted by age, there were 14.4 million workers between 16 and 24; 49% were paid at or below the minimum wage. Sixth-two percent of the minimum wage workers in this age group were women.</p>
<p>Sorted by education, only 13% of all hourly wage workers had less than a high school diploma, but they accounted for 28% of the minimum wage workers. (Many presumably are still in school.) High school graduates with no college are 35% of all hourly and account for 31% of the minimum wage workers. Another 35% have some college but no degree, and 34% of the minimum wage total. Finally, there were 280,000 college graduates in minimum wage jobs—or 7% of the total.</p>
<p>To characterize a minimum wage worker, he or she is typically under age 24, is not a college graduate and works part-time in a service or retail job. That will help local economies but will have relatively little impact on poverty.</p>
<p>Realistically, if the minimum wage is increased to $9.00, employees now paid between $7.25 and $9.00 will receive a salary increase that will reflect current differentials. Those paid from $9.00 to possibly as high as $12.00 will also be granted an increase. The actual increases will depend on the employer and their ability to pay. Unfortunately, there are no credible data for the number of workers in these groups.</p>
<p>A Gallup survey shows 71% of Americans support the increase, including 54% of conservatives.</p>
