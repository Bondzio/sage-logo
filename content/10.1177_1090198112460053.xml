<p><italic>Introduction</italic>. Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience irreversible airflow obstruction, dyspnea, coughing, and fatigue. One of the goals of treating individuals with COPD is to improve their quality of life. The aim of this research was to evaluate the 2009 Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) as a method for surveillance of COPD by identifying factors associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among respondents with COPD as well as comment on differences between the COPD and non-COPD population in a state representative sample. <italic>Method</italic>. Data from 348 COPD respondents were obtained from the 2009 Texas BRFSS. The Andersen behavior model was used to categorize variables as predisposing characteristics, health behaviors, and health service utilization. Self-rated health (SRH) was the HRQoL indicator used in this analysis. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences between COPD and non-COPD respondents. The relation between SRH and risk factors were modeled using domain analysis and logistic regressions. All analyses incorporated the sample weights to be representative of the state population. <italic>Results</italic>. Adults with COPD reported significantly worse SRH than adults who did not have COPD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Among respondents with COPD, the predisposing characteristics associated with impaired HRQoL were obesity, education, and asthma; the health practices and service utilization factors associated with HRQoL included smoking, physical inactivity, having a health plan, and the inability to see a doctor because of costs. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The Texas COPD population experienced increased risk of impaired SRH compared with the non-COPD population. The findings from our population-level survey study are similar to results observed at the clinical level.</p>

<p>Disease surveillance is an essential public health function intended to guide the planning and monitoring of interventions to prevent disease occurrence and control their impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198112460053">Institute of Medicine, 2011</xref>). Although surveillance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has traditionally focused on risk factors (e.g., smoking) and measures of disease occurrence (e.g., prevalence, hospitalizations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112460053">Akinbami &amp; Liu, 2011</xref>), little is known about other potential measures of disease control, such as quality of life and functional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198112460053">Institute of Medicine, 2012</xref>). These measures are frequently used in clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions of patients with COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198112460053">Kaplan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198112460053">Verrill, Barton, Beasley, &amp; Lippard, 2005</xref>) but have not been widely used for public health surveillance.</p>
<p>COPD is characterized by irreversible airflow obstruction, shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. One of the primary goals of treating patients with chronic diseases is to improve their health-related quality of life (HRQoL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198112460053">Ruo et al., 2003</xref>), which is a multidimensional concept that refers to aspects of overall quality of life that can be clearly shown to affect physical or mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198112460053">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011</xref>). Depression, reduced physical activity levels, and diminished HRQoL are strongly associated with COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198112460053">Coultas, Edwards, Barnett, &amp; Wludyka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198112460053">Garcia-Aymerich, Lange, Benet, Schnohr, &amp; Anto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198112460053">Omachi et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is state-based system of telephone health surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112460053">Texas Department of State Health Services, 2011</xref>). In 2009, the Texas BRFSS included a question about physician-diagnosed COPD along with other questions on self-rated health (SRH), which provided the opportunity to examine the potential usefulness of BRFSS as a method for COPD surveillance using other health-related outcomes beyond disease occurrence. To evaluate BRFSS as a method for surveillance of COPD, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the relationships between self-reported physician-diagnosed COPD, SRH, and the influence of a number of moderating and mediating factors.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>For this study, data were obtained from the 2009 Texas BRFSS, a federally funded telephone survey conducted monthly in randomly selected adult Texans to collect data on lifestyle risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112460053">Texas Department of State Health Services, 2011</xref>). The public use data files were obtained through the Texas Department of State Health Services FTP (file transfer protocol) site after submitting a request for data access. This study met institutional review board approval. The system allows monitoring of risk factors to establish intervention priorities and to evaluate health promotion programs. The CDC provides a core questionnaire, and states can provide state-added optional questions. The 2009 Texas BRFSS survey included an item that identified our study population—namely, respondents who answered yes to the following question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or another health care professional that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also called COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis?” The sample of interest was adult Texas residents 18 years and older (<italic>N</italic> = 5,827), of whom 348 self-identified as having COPD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090198112460053">
<title>Outcome Variable</title>
<p>The outcome variable for this research was respondent’s SRH. The BRFSS had dichotomized SRH responses into “Fair or Poor” and “Excellent, Very Good, or Good.” Several studies have examined the validity of self-reported health outcomes and have found consistent results between them; a comparison of the CDC’s Healthy Days measures and the EuroQol-5D showed similar patterns across clinical factors in a study of the general US adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198112460053">Jia, Lubetkin, Moriarty, &amp; Zack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198112460053">Rabin &amp; de Charro, 2001</xref>). In addition, a validation study of HRQoL items from the BRFSS has found that the questions performed well in their ability to measure the physical and mental health constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112460053">Newschaffer, 1998</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1090198112460053">
<title>Explanatory Variables</title>
<p>Variables to be included in the analysis were chosen from domains of the Andersen behavioral model: predisposing characteristics and evaluated health need factors and use of health services and health practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198112460053">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112460053">Andersen, 1995</xref>). Previous research has used similar approaches to assess health status while controlling for chronic conditions and health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198112460053">Miravitlles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198112460053">Phillips, Hammock, &amp; Blanton, 2005</xref>). All variables selected had been previously categorized within the BRFSS data set.</p>

<sec id="section5-1090198112460053">
<title>Predisposing Characteristics and Evaluated Needs</title>
<p>The predisposing characteristics and evaluated needs variables and their classifications included the following: sex, age-group (18-44, 45-64, 65+ years), race (White, Black, Hispanic, and other), education (&lt;high school, high school graduate, some college, and college graduate), asthma status (never, former, current), and body mass index (BMI; normal 18.5-24.9, overweight 25-29.9, and obese ≥30). The remaining variables in this domain were categorized as “Yes” or “No”: resident of a U.S. Census–defined Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), and doctor-diagnosed cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or hypertension.</p>
<p>Asthma status was defined from affirmative responses to two questions, “Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had asthma?” and “Do you still have asthma?” CVD status was defined from affirmative answers to at least one of the following three questions, “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had a heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction?”; “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had angina or coronary heart disease?”; and “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had a stroke?” Cancer status was defined by an affirmative answer to the question: “Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you had cancer?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198112460053">
<title>Health Practice and Health Service Utilization</title>
<p>Health practice variables included the following: smoking status (never, former, and current) and physical activity level based on the 2008 guidelines for minimum aerobic physical activity (inactive, insufficient, and active). Smoking status was defined based on whether or not the respondent had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her entire life, and if he or she currently smokes cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all. The 2008 guidelines for minimum aerobic physical activity are divided into three categories: active: meets minimum guidelines, insufficient: participates in some moderate or vigorous physical activity, and inactive: no moderate or vigorous physical activity. These guidelines recommend moderate intensity physical activity for 150 minutes a week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity per week, or an equivalent combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112460053">CDC, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Health service utilization variables included the following: having a personal doctor (at least one, none), date of last checkup (&lt;12 months, 1-2 years ago, 2-5 years ago, &gt;5 years ago), needing to see a doctor but could not because of cost (yes, no), influenza vaccination (yes, no), pneumonia shot (yes, no), and having a health insurance plan (yes, no). Influenza vaccination status was determined based on the response to the question: had either a flu shot or a flu spray vaccine; similarly for the pneumonia shot: have you ever had a pneumonia shot?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1090198112460053">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Characteristics of the sample are provided as frequency and weighted percentages. We contrasted differences between respondents with and without COPD using chi-square tests. We modeled the bivariate relation between the outcome and each predictor variable using logistic regression. To examine the risk factors that influenced the outcomes, we used multivariable logistic regression to construct three models for the outcomes’ relation with the predictor variables while controlling for domains of the Andersen model. Model 1 included the predisposing characteristics and evaluated health need factors, Model 2 included the health practice and health service utilization variables, and Model 3 included all variables from both Models 1 and 2. We checked for multicollinearity among predictor variables in the third model, removing variables if their variance inflation factor exceeded 5. COPD status significantly interacted with pneumonia shot status, suggesting that the relation between pneumonia shot status and SRH was modified by whether or not a respondent had COPD. To compare the risk factors between respondents with and without COPD, we studied these groups separately. We used SAS Version 9.2 software in order to account for the BRFSS’s complex survey design in order to allow the results to be made generalizable to the 2009 Texas population. Statistical significance was set at the .05 level.</p>

<sec id="section9-1090198112460053">
<title>Description of the Sample</title>
<p>The distribution of several HRQOL, predisposing characteristics, and evaluated health needs variables differed according to the COPD status of Texas residents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198112460053">Table 1</xref>). Significantly more COPD respondents had “Fair/Poor” SRH than non-COPD respondents. Although COPD respondents were more often female (57.8%) than were non-COPD respondents (51.0%), this difference was not statistically significant. Almost three quarters (74.5%) of the COPD respondents but less than half (46.2%) of the non-COPD respondents were older than 45 years. There was no statistically significant difference between racial/ethnic distribution or residence in an MSA between respondents with and without COPD. COPD respondents were less likely to be college graduates than non-COPD respondents. Compared with the non-COPD respondents, COPD respondents were more often obese and more often currently had asthma, high blood pressure, and CVD.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198112460053">Table 2</xref> presents the unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) of Fair/Poor SRH for the COPD and non-COPD populations. Among COPD respondents, women had greater risk of impaired SRH (PR = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-2.03). College graduates had much lower risk of Fair/Poor SRH than those who were less than a high school graduate (PR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.01-0.92). Those who were obese reported 1.82 times the risk of impaired SRH than those with a normal BMI (PR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.30-2.34). Compared with those who never had asthma, current asthmatics had 2 times the risk of reporting impaired SRH (PR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.55-2.45). Those with CVD had almost 3 times the risk of reporting impaired SRH than those without CVD (PR = 2.66; 95% CI = 2.19-3.13). Those with cancer had a 60% increase in the risk of reporting impaired SRH than those without cancer (PR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.16-2.04). Those with high blood pressure had 1.76 times the risk of reporting Fair/Poor SRH than those without high blood pressure (PR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.33-2.19). Former smokers had 1.57 times the risk of having impaired SRH compared with never smokers (PR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.09-2.05). Compared with COPD respondents classified as active under the 2008 guidelines for minimal physical activity, those who were inactive had 2.84 times the risk of impaired SRH (PR = 2.84; 95% CI = 2.35-3.33). Those who had at least one personal physician had almost 2 times the risk of Fair/Poor health compared with those who had none (PR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.20-2.62). COPD respondents who had received the pneumonia shot had more than 2 times the risk of reporting impaired SRH than those who had not received this shot (PR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.67-2.53).</p>

<p>Among the non-COPD respondents, the direction and the size of the statistically significant prevalence ratios of reporting impaired SRH by subgroup of predisposing characteristics, evaluated health needs, health practices, and health service utilization resembled comparable or smaller prevalence ratios in the COPD respondents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198112460053">Table 2</xref>). The more numerous non-COPD respondents also reported increased risk of impaired SRH among Blacks and Hispanics versus Whites, 65+ versus 18- to 44-year-olds, those not living in an MSA versus those living in an MSA, and current cigarette smokers versus never smokers, After full adjustment, those reporting COPD had at least a 77% increase in risk of reporting Fair/Poor SRH (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.77-2.29; results not shown).</p>

The results presented are adjusted prevalence ratios. Compared with COPD respondents who had a normal BMI, those who were obese had significantly increased risk of reporting Fair/Poor SRH.

<p>Model 2 controlled for the health practice and health service utilization domains. Respondents who were current smokers had a 91% increase in risk of reporting impaired SRH compared with never smokers. Those who were physically inactive had 4.13 times the risk than active respondents to report Fair/Poor SRH. Having one or more doctors indicated at least a 96% increase in risk of impaired SRH. Those who needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost were 2.49 times more likely to report impaired SRH. Those who had received a pneumonia shot had more than 3 times the risk to report impaired SRH.</p>
<p>The full Model 3 controls for predisposing characteristics, evaluated health needs, health practices, and health service utilization. The predisposing characteristics and evaluated health needs of obesity, asthma, CVD, and cancer significantly predicted impaired SRH. Those who were obese had at least a 178% increase in risk to report impaired SRH than those with normal BMI (APR = 3.45; 95% CI = 2.78-4.12). Current asthmatics had a 75% increase in risk compared with respondents who never had asthma (APR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.19-2.29). People with CVD had at least a 156% increase in risk of reporting impaired SRH than those without CVD (APR = 3.24; 95% CI = 2.56-3.92). Respondents with cancer had 1.67 times the risk of having impaired SRH (APR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.10-2.24).</p>
<p>Compared with those who never smoked, current and former smokers had increased risk of reporting impaired SRH (APRs = 2.89 and 2.00, respectively). The physically inactive had significantly higher risk of impaired SRH than the physically active (APR = 2.96). Having one or more personal doctors also strongly increased the risk of reporting impaired SRH (APR = 4.84; 95% CI = 3.85-5.83).

<p>Among the non-COPD respondents, the direction and the size of the statistically significant adjusted prevalence ratios of reporting impaired SRH by subgroup of predisposing characteristics, evaluated health needs, health practices, and health service utilization were not as exaggerated as in the COPD respondents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198112460053">Table 3B</xref>). The more numerous non-COPD respondents reported increased risk of impaired SRH with increasing age, Blacks and Hispanics versus Whites, those reporting cancer, CVD, and high blood pressure versus those not reporting these conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Compared with the general population, the COPD population exhibited worse HRQoL outcomes. The distribution of chronic conditions differed between those reporting COPD and those not reporting COPD, which might have resulted from different age distributions since COPD is mostly observed in people older than 45 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112460053">Akinbami &amp; Liu, 2011</xref>). In the current analysis, controlling for age did not account for the relation between COPD and impaired SRH. Health behaviors such as smoking, physical activity, and vaccinations also differed between those reporting COPD and those not reporting COPD. This was not unexpected since COPD has been found to be associated with exposure to cigarette smoke and decreased physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198112460053">Rabe et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses found similar predictors of Fair/Poor SRH in the COPD population—obesity, current asthma, CVD, cancer, smoking status, physical activity level, having a personal doctor, and having received a pneumonia shot. The findings suggest that obesity, the presence of chronic conditions, smoking, and a physically inactive lifestyle are all risk factors for impaired HRQoL among those reporting COPD. Similar to the bivariate analysis, the magnitude of these significant risk factors in the adjusted Model 3 for the COPD population was much greater than that for the non-COPD population. The larger magnitude of prevalence ratios suggests that the effect of different risk factors has more of an influence on COPD respondents than on the general population.</p>
<p>Predictors associated with the use of health services require careful interpretation. In some cases, having at least one personal doctor showed a large increase in risk of reporting poor HRQoL; however, patients with a chronic condition such as COPD may have other comorbidities that require them to see multiple specialists. For those reporting COPD, the risk of reporting impaired SRH for those having at least one doctor (APR = 4.84) was higher than for those who had none. Additional information regarding the type of specialist that respondents were visiting was not available. Within the COPD population, those who had a pneumonia shot had at least 5 times the risk of having impaired HRQoL than those who did not. At face value, this would appear to suggest that vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia is a risk factor for impaired HRQoL among those with COPD; however, such vaccination is recommended for persons with COPD and may only indicate those with more severe or long-standing disease.</p>
<p>Needing to see a doctor but not being able to do so because of cost was also a significant predictor of poor HRQoL (APR = 3.55; 95% CI = 2.67-4.43). This suggests that improving access to care or increasing continuity of care may help improve HRQoL. In our previous research, pulmonary specialists were more concentrated around metropolitan areas, an issue for rural patients who have higher hospitalization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198112460053">Jackson, Suzuki, Coultas, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198112460053">Jackson, Suzuki, Lo, et al., 2011</xref>). Continuity of care has been associated with decreased avoidable hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112460053">Cheng, Chen, &amp; Hou, 2010</xref>). HRQoL in general may be affected by both availability and continuity of care. Increasing access to pulmonary specialists in more rural areas, as well as coordinating care with these specialists, may improve the health outcomes of COPD patients across Texas.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. The present study was a cross-sectional analysis, and because of this, causation cannot be inferred. COPD diagnosis was determined by self report, which might have been affected by misclassification of disease status. Spirometric measurement of the 1-second forced expiratory volume has been used for diagnostic purposes; however, spirometry equipment may not be widely used in clinical practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198112460053">Arne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112460053">Coultas &amp; Mapel, 2003</xref>). We had no biomarkers to verify the status or the severity of the disease. Progression of COPD has an impact on patient HRQoL, but in the current analysis we were unable to assess this. Other measures of disease complexity have incorporated the presence of other comorbid conditions to assess disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198112460053">Charlson, Pompei, Ales, &amp; MacKenzie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112460053">Mapel, Dutro, Marton, Woodruff, &amp; Make, 2011</xref>). In this analysis we attempted to control for disease severity by using selected available comorbid conditions; however, these proxy measures may not have been an accurate assessment. Additionally, these comorbid conditions did not comprise the spectrum of conditions used in the aforementioned papers. The BRFSS survey did not contain information pertaining to COPD-related medications. The HRQoL outcomes may have been improved for patients taking COPD medications. The small numbers of respondents with COPD may also have made it more difficult to detect statistical significant associations between COPD and impaired HRQoL. However, it should be noted that the findings of this analysis resemble those in other studies both in Texas and among COPD respondents, specifically the findings for worse SRH with decreased physical activity level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198112460053">Garcia-Aymerich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112460053">Kanervisto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112460053">Katz et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results from this population-level study are similar to findings observed at the clinical level. This suggests that the BRFSS may be useful for conducting surveillance for COPD. Multiple risk factors were associated with poor HRQoL among the COPD population in Texas. Risk factors such as physical activity and smoking status are modifiable at the individual level. Pulmonary rehabilitation and smoking cessation programs improve health outcomes for individuals with COPD by increasing physical activity and modifying health behaviors. Self-management programs targeting the modification of health risk behaviors including smoking, physical activity, and overweight/obesity may improve HRQoL. At the provider level, improving access and continuity of care may result in improved HRQoL for COPD patients; however, further investigation is still needed. Early detection of COPD may help attenuate the disease burden and promote healthy living. Future studies should be designed to examine the effects of continuity of care, physical activity, disease severity, and medication use on HRQoL in the COPD population.</p>
<p>By expanding surveillance, physicians, researchers, and policy makers will be better informed for planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating health policies, programs, and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198112460053">Institute of Medicine, 2012</xref>). By incorporating more questions specific to COPD and chronic conditions in the BRFSS, population-level assessments of the effectiveness of health systems and public health interventions may be more readily accomplished. Moreover, the growing use of electronic medical records and social media may provide new methods for collecting and using these data at the health system or population level.</p>
