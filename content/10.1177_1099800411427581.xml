<abstract>
<p>High levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) during pregnancy are a risk factor for preeclampsia. Ox-LDL levels might be affected by folate and total homocysteine (tHcy) levels because of their effects on oxygen free radicals. The relationships between ox-LDL and folate and tHcy during pregnancy, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether serum folate levels and plasma tHcy levels were associated with plasma ox-LDL levels in pregnant women. A sample of 137 healthy subjects with singleton pregnancies (age 30.3 ± 4.5 years) was recruited from a prenatal clinic in metropolitan Tokyo between June and October 2008. Their levels of plasma ox-LDL, plasma tHcy, and serum folate were measured, and lifestyle variables were obtained using a questionnaire. Dietary intake was assessed by means of a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire. A negative correlation between plasma ox-LDL levels and serum folate levels was found (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = −.218, <italic>p</italic> =.011). However, there was no association between plasma ox-LDL levels and plasma tHcy levels (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = .055, <italic>p</italic> = .525). The mean of the logarithmic ox-LDL levels was significantly lower among the participants taking folic acid–containing supplements regularly than among those who were not, after adjusting for confounding factors (<italic>p</italic> = .024). Serum folate levels and folic acid supplementation might be associated with plasma ox-LDL levels, independent of tHcy levels. The association observed between ox-LDL and folate can be used as evidence for dietary instruction by prenatal care providers.</p>

<body>
<p>Preeclampsia, which is characterized by new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, occurs in 2–5% of all pregnancies and is a major cause of maternal and fetal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411427581">Duley, 2003</xref>). The risk for preeclampsia is influenced by several factors, such as maternal age, parity, ethnicity, and angiogenic and nutritional factors. The prevalence of preeclampsia among the Asian population is lower than that among other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411427581">Caughey, Stotland, Washington, &amp; Escobar, 2005</xref>). However, the proportion of total births in Japan comprised primigravid females over 35 years of age doubled in last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411427581">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, 2011</xref>), and this may increase the prevalence of preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Although the etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, lipid-mediated oxidative stress is likely a key element in its pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411427581">Gratacos, 2000</xref>). Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Females with normal pregnancies experience increased oxidative stress because of the increased basal oxygen and energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411427581">Little &amp; Gladen, 1999</xref>). Females with preeclampsia experience excessive oxidative stress damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411427581">Gupta et al., 2009</xref>). The excessive oxidative stress induces an enhanced maternal inflammatory response, inappropriate endothelial cell activation, and endothelial cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411427581">Briones &amp; Touyz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411427581">Verhoye, Langlois, &amp; Asklepios Investigators, 2009</xref>). This impairment results in the clinical signs of preeclampsia. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is used as a marker for lipid peroxidation because LDL is susceptible to free radical oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411427581">Esterbauer, Gebicki, Puhl, &amp; Jürgens, 1992</xref>). Monitoring ox-LDL level may provide clinicians a better way to assess risk for preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Investigators have reported that increased ox-LDL levels are associated with increased total homocysteine (tHcy) levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099800411427581">Figure 1</xref>
. When homocysteine auto-oxidizes, it leads to the generation of oxygen free radicals, and it may contribute to increased levels of ox-LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411427581">Welch &amp; Loscalzo, 1998</xref>). Homocysteine is the demethylated derivative of methionine and an intermediate in the metabolism of methionine to cysteine. Plasma tHcy levels increase mainly because of deficiencies in coenzymes, such as folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Folate, especially, has a major effect on homocysteine metabolism because folate deficiency causes a reduction in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is required for the remethylation of homocysteine.</p>

<p>Folate, itself, may also modulate endothelial function by affecting lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411427581">Xu, Shatenstein, Luo, Wei, &amp; Fraser, 2009</xref>). In previous studies of nonpregnant participants, investigators have found that folic acid supplementation prolongs the lag time of LDL oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411427581">Bennett-Richards et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411427581">Nakano, Higgins, &amp; Powers, 2001</xref>). The relationship between folate and ox-LDL during pregnancy, however, has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to clarify whether serum folate levels and folic acid supplementation are associated with plasma ox-LDL levels via plasma tHcy levels in pregnant women. We hypothesized that high folate levels and folic acid supplementation would be associated with low ox-LDL levels.</p>

<title>Material and Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1099800411427581">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We conducted this cross-sectional study at a private obstetric hospital with approximately 2000 births per year in metropolitan Tokyo, Japan, between June and October 2008. We recruited healthy Japanese women with singleton pregnancies during the second (24–27 weeks of gestation) and third (34–38 weeks of gestation) trimesters. The exclusion criteria included diabetes or other chronic diseases, hypertension, or fetal growth retardation. All participants had an early ultrasound scan at 8–12 weeks of gestation to allow for accurate gestational dating. We provided participants with detailed information on the study protocol, and all gave their written informed consent. The Ethical Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, approved the study procedures and protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1099800411427581">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants completed the questionnaires while waiting for a pregnancy checkup. We resolved missing and unclear data by telephone interview. We reviewed participants' medical charts to obtain pregnancy information. In order to reduce subject burden, we drew nonfasting blood samples at the clinic during routine sampling associated with a normal pregnant woman health examination. We again reviewed medical records after delivery to obtain information on preeclampsia, defined in accord with the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria as high blood pressure (≥140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (≥300 mg/24 hr) after 20 weeks of gestation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1099800411427581">
<title>Blood Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm and stored at −80°C until analysis. We measured plasma ox-LDL using a sandwich ELISA method (ox-LDL ELISA kit, Immunodiagnostic AG, Bensheim, Germany). Briefly, standards, controls and samples containing ox-LDL were pipetted in duplicate into the wells of microplates coated with high-affinity antibodies. The plate wells were incubated on a plate shaker for 1 hr at room temperature. The plate wells were washed 5 times with 250 μl of diluted wash buffer. A peroxidase-conjugated antibody was then added to each microtiter well. The plates were incubated on a plate shaker for 1 hr at room temperature. The wells were washed as described above. A 100-μl aliquot of tetramethylbenzidine was added as a substrate for peroxidase and the plate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. An acidic stop solution was added to terminate the reaction. The intensity of the yellow color of the sample was directly proportional to the ox-LDL concentration. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation for oxidized LDL were less than 8%.</p>
<p>The plasma tHcy levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411427581">Araki &amp; Sako, 1987</xref>) with a YMC-Ultra HT Pro C18 column (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan). The serum folate levels were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, and the serum LDL cholesterol levels were determined by direct methods. These assays were conducted by SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1099800411427581">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>We used questionnaires to collect information about participant characteristics and lifestyle variables, including whether or not participants were using folic acid supplements or folic acid-containing multivitamins regularly, defined as four or more times per week.</p>
<p>We assessed dietary intake over the last month by means of a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire, which measures the daily intake of 150 foods and selected nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411427581">Sasaki, Yanagibori, &amp; Amano, 1998</xref>). We energy-adjusted the consumption of selected nutrients using the density method to separate any effect of the nutrient from the effect of total energy intake as well as to reduce extraneous variation in intake of the nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411427581">Willett, Giwe, &amp; Kushi, 1997</xref>). We excluded participants who reported an extremely unrealistic energy intake; that is, the reported energy intake was less than half the energy requirement for the lowest physical activity category or equal to or more than 1.5 times the energy requirement for moderate physical activity according to the “Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411427581">Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411427581">Sasaki, Katagiri, Tsuji, Shimoda, &amp; Amano, 2003</xref>). A few foods are supplemented with folic acid in Japan. Therefore, the dietary folate intake was calculated from folate content naturally included in the ingredients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1099800411427581">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We compared the parameters between participants in their second and third trimesters using Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for continuous data after testing normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test. We compared categorical data using the chi-square test. We used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to investigate whether there were associations between plasma ox-LDL levels, plasma tHcy levels, serum folate levels, and dietary folate intake.</p>
<p>We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to investigate whether folic acid supplementation was associated with the plasma ox-LDL level, plasma tHcy level, or serum folate level, adjusting for the covariates of age, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index. When serum folate level was a dependent variable, we added dietary folate intake as a covariate. When plasma tHcy level was a dependent variable, we added dietary intake of folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> as covariates. In addition, when plasma ox-LDL level was a dependent variable, we controlled dietary intake of vitamins C and E (α-tocopherol) as antioxidants that inhibit oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411427581">Alul et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411427581">Hodis et al., 2002</xref>). We adjusted the analyses for all participants for gestational age and conducted them after the logarithmic transformation of ox-LDL levels, tHcy levels, and folate levels. We compared the biological markers in the preeclampsia group with those in the nonpreeclampsia group using Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test.</p>
<p>We used SPSS for Windows software package, version 15.0 (SPSS Japan Inc.), for our analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided; we considered <italic>p</italic> values less than .05 to be statistically significant and those less than .10 to indicate a statistical trend.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We recruited 182 pregnant women; 150 (82.4%) of these gave their written informed consent, answered the questionnaires, and had their blood samples drawn. Of these 150, we excluded 13 from the analyses: 6 had missing data, 4 had pregnancy complications, and 3 had under- or overreported energy intake. Thus, we analyzed data from 137 healthy singleton pregnant women (mean age 30.3 ± 4.5 years), 67 in the second trimester, and 70 in the third trimester.</p>

 summarizes the characteristics of the subjects. Approximately 1 (20.4%) of 5 took folic acid supplements or folic acid–containing multivitamins regularly. There were no significant differences in plasma ox-LDL levels between participants in their second trimester and those in their third (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099800411427581">Table 2</xref>
). Plasma tHcy levels were significantly lower in participants in their second trimester than in those in their third. Among participants who did not take folic acid supplements or multivitamins, dietary folate intake had a positive correlation with serum folate levels (<italic>r<sub>s</sub>

<p>A total of 5 participants (3 in the second-trimester group and 2 in the third-trimester group) developed preeclampsia after the investigation. The plasma ox-LDL levels in the participants with preeclampsia were significantly higher than in the remaining participants (978 ± 1174 and 290 ± 300 ng/ml, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = .022). However, we observed no significant differences in the plasma tHcy levels or serum folate levels between the two groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to show that high serum folate levels and folic acid supplementation are associated with low plasma ox-LDL levels among pregnant women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411427581">Nakano, Higgins, and Powers (2001)</xref> found that folate increased the lag time for LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and suggested that the effect of folate on ox-LDL was due to its role as a free radical scavenger. Other investigators using in vitro studies found that tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which are reduced folate forms, exhibited high antioxidant activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411427581">Rezk, Haenen, van der Vijgh, &amp; Bast, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411427581">Ronco et al., 2005</xref>). Folic acid supplementation may reduce ox-LDL levels through such an antioxidant effect.</p>
<p>Contrary to our hypothesis, the plasma ox-LDL levels were not associated with the plasma tHcy levels. Increased tHcy levels are thought to cause acute endothelial dysfunction through increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411427581">Welch &amp; Loscalzo, 1998</xref>). In a previous study, homocysteine promoted the formation of free radicals and was positively associated with ox-LDL levels in nonpregnant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411427581">Koubaa et al., 2007</xref>). The relationship, however, remains controversial. In a recent study using an animal model, researchers found that hyperhomocysteinemia during pregnancy was not associated with the development of preeclampsia but that folate deficiency led to proteinuria, which is one symptom of preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411427581">Falcao, Bisotto, Gutkowska, &amp; Lavoie, 2009</xref>). They suggested that high tHcy levels might be a result of the subjects' condition rather than the cause of preeclampsia because renal dysfunction due to preeclampsia increases the tHcy levels. Therefore, homocysteine, itself, may not have a relationship with the oxidation of LDL, which is likely to be a predictor of preeclampsia, though high tHcy levels are an indication of folate deficiency or other B-complex vitamin deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411427581">Welch &amp; Loscalzo, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of the current study were consistent with those of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2a-1099800411427581">Genc et al., 2011</xref>) in which the plasma ox-LDL levels among the participants who developed preeclampsia after the investigation were higher than levels in those who did not. Meanwhile, neither the plasma tHcy levels nor the serum folate levels were associated with the incidence of preeclampsia in the present study. Future larger studies are needed to clarify whether homocysteine and folate are related to preeclampsia because the incidence of preeclampsia in the current study was small.</p>
<p>Since 2000, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has recommended that women take 440 µg/day of folic acid from 1 month before pregnancy through the first trimester in order to prevent neural-tube defects. The ministry does not yet recommend supplementation during the second and third trimesters, however, because the safety and efficacy of supplementation in these trimesters have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, the percentage of women taking folic acid supplements regularly was only 20.4% in the second and third trimesters, a rate lower than those in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411427581">Forster, Wills, Denning, &amp; Bolger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411427581">Hernandez-Diaz, Werler, Louik, &amp; Mitchell, 2002</xref>). In addition, the dietary folate intake of our participants was only approximately half as much as the recommended amount. Most of the participants had lower intake of total folate from both diet and supplements than the recommended amount. It is important to increase dietary folate intake throughout pregnancy in order to increase serum folate levels. Further studies with regard to the safety and efficacy of folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy are needed so that governmental recommendations and care providers may better address supplementation needs in the last two trimesters.</p>
<p>The current study had several limitations. First, the number of participants was small, and this may have reduced statistical power. Second, we were not able to establish a causal relationship because of the study’s cross-sectional design. Third, participants completed the questionnaire in the hospital, which might have caused some to look for the preferable or convenient answer. Fourth, we were not able to investigate pregnant women in the first trimester because the nausea and vomiting associated with early pregnancy made women less willing to participate in dietary research. In addition, it was difficult to secure a portion of the blood samples used for routine health exams for our study in these women because the quantity of blood used for these exams in the first trimester was more than in other trimesters. Further research including pregnant women in the first trimester is required. Finally, we could not measure the levels of vitamin C and vitamin E in blood because of financial limitations and an insufficient quantity of blood available for analysis.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study confirmed the hypothesis that high serum folate levels and folic acid supplementation are associated with low plasma ox-LDL level during pregnancy. The association observed between ox-LDL and folate could inform future dietary and supplement recommendations during pregnancy. Meanwhile, as our results did not demonstrate an association between ox-LDL and tHcy in healthy pregnant women, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for the associations among ox-LDL, folate, and tHcy.</p>
