<abstract>
<p>This article addresses an important, yet often underattended to, aspect of the strategy development process: fostering the use of strategic learning practices in the simultaneous practice of developing strategy and cultivating strategic mindset awareness. The need for addressing this aspect of the strategy development process is increasingly important because of the intensifying complexity of the task environment. Following a framing of this context in terms of a complex adaptive systems perspective, a conceptual model for addressing this strategic HRD challenge is presented. The model is based on two distinct, yet in terms of potential implications for HRD practice, interconnected streams of literature: strategic learning practices, and adult development theory (specifically, constructive developmental theory and developmental action inquiry). The implications for HRD practices seeking to address this need, along with implications for future research, are also discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Over many decades a rich strategy literature providing theoretical lenses, conceptual models, and research has grown extensively. Yet the challenges of <italic>thinking</italic> strategically have perhaps never been more pervasive. Although strategy and strategic intent have long been important for sustaining organizational performance and competitive advantage, as the business environment becomes more driven by the dynamic forces of technology and globalization the complexity of that environment has become intensified. One consequence of this intensification, we would argue, is that developing one’s capacity for being in relationship with the resulting uncertainty is a critical aspect for how one engages processes of strategy development. In addition, fostering this capacity throughout an organization is increasingly important as traditional hierarchical structures give way to more flattened and networked organizations. Once the purview of senior managers and business leaders, in many industries the need to adapt proactively to a rapidly changing business environment permeates throughout organizations. Consequently, the need to develop this capability has never been stronger, with human resource development and talent management professionals in organizations seeking effective ways of developing strategic learning mindsets.</p>
<p>That assumptions made about learning are an integral, and often tacit, part of strategic thinking paradigms has become increasingly evident. The robust debate that took place more than two decades ago between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312439055">Ansoff (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312439055">Mintzberg (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312439055">1994)</xref> made clear the different learning paradigms embedded in these two schools of thought. For the past couple of decades “learning” has emerged as an explicit concept in the discourse about strategy development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312439055">Beer &amp; Eisenstat, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312439055">deGeus, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312439055">Leavy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312439055">Lovallo &amp; Mendonca, 2007</xref>). Learning has become central to the strategy development process, with learning-focused practices such as analog reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312439055">Gavetti, Levinthal, &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312439055">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>), use of scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312439055">Chermack &amp; Swanson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312439055">Fahey &amp; Randall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312439055">Wack, 1985</xref>), and dialogic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312439055">Hardy, Palmer, &amp; Phillips, 2000</xref>) becoming prominent in the scholarly based practice literature along with traditional analysis tools such as SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) and PEST (political, economic, social, technological) analysis.</p>
<p>Intensifying this increasing interest in strategic learning is acknowledgment of the escalating pace of change and the intensifying complexity of the social-economic-political context driven by technology and globalization. Recognition of this intensifying pace of change and complexity has been noted in the management and related literatures since the middle of the 20th century. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312439055">1973, Donald Schön</xref> noted the loss of the stable state, arguing that society and all of its institutions are in continuous processes of transformation and that people cannot expect new stable states that will endure for their lifetimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534484312439055">Peter Vaill (1996)</xref> used the metaphor of “permanent white water” to describe the challenges facing executives confronted with environments of continuous change. Over a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312439055">Mark Taylor (2001</xref>, p. 3) captured the intensifying nature of this challenge when he wrote, “We are living in a moment of unprecedented complexity, when things are changing faster than our ability to comprehend them.” The increasingly complex socioeconomic context is one of porous and changing boundaries, confronting executives with environments ranging from relatively stable to extremely complex.</p>
<p>We begin with a discussion of the implications of complex adaptive systems for strategic learning. Following this discussion, we describe the role of insight as foundational to strategic learning, followed by a discussion of the core components of an integral framework for addressing the challenges of strategic thinking leading to new insights under conditions of complexity: competency in using strategic learning practices <italic>and</italic> capacity defined in terms of the complexity of one’s meaning-making mindset. The implications of mindsets for strategic learning are presented, followed by implications for practice and future research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534484312439055">
<title>Complexity as a Context of Strategic Learning Challenges</title>
<p>Like the strategy literature, there are multiple streams of complexity theory. This article draws on complex adaptive systems thinking as a frame for understanding the strategic context increasingly confronting organizations and governments alike. Through this lens organizations are embedded in a larger context in which various agents interact in dynamic ways marked by multiplicity, interdependence, ambiguity, and flux. Although nonlinearity is a key characteristic of complex adaptive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312439055">Boulton &amp; Allen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312439055">Cilliers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312439055">Stacey, 2003</xref>), feedback, specifically the existence of nonlinear feedback, is the critical element allowing for emergence, self-organization, adaptation, learning, and many other concepts synonymous with complexity thinking. “Once we have three or more <italic>interacting</italic> feedback loops (which may be made up from the interactions of many parts), accurately predicting the resulting behavior via standard analytical methods becomes problematic (at best) for most intents and purposes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richardson &amp; Tait, 2010</xref>, p. 29).</p>
<p>The result is a high level of uncertainty and ambiguity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312439055">Courtney, Kirkland, and Viguerie (1997)</xref> have described four distinct levels of uncertainty that capture at a high level the context of strategic challenges:</p>
<list id="list1-1534484312439055" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Level 1: A clear enough future. The residual uncertainty is irrelevant to making strategic decisions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level 2: Alternative futures. A future that can be described as having one of a few discrete scenarios. Although the exact outcomes cannot be identified, reasonable probabilities can be established.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level 3: A range of futures. Although a number of key variables describe the range of outcomes, the actual outcome cannot be determined with any certainty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level 4: True ambiguity. A number of dimensions of uncertainty interact, creating an environment that is virtually impossible to predict.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These are of course constructed categories, but Levels 3 and 4 capture the dynamics of complexity as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richardson and Tait (2010)</xref> and the experience of it as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312439055">Taylor (2001)</xref>. One implication is the inability to predict with any degree of certainty the surprises that emerge from the actions being taken. Under conditions of increasing complexity and the uncertainty it generates, strategy development and execution are less and less a part of a linear process of analysis, planning, action, and adaptation. Rather, strategy development and execution are parallel and intertwined processes of strategic action.</p>
<p>Although, admittedly, the pace of intensifying complexity varies by context, there is little doubt that increasingly individuals and organizations alike in developed and developing societies are confronted by the consequences of intensifying complexity driven by technology and globalization. One consequence of complexity is that experience is both an asset and liability; although it provides a basis for action, it potentially blocks awareness of the range of potential real-time responses and inhibits insight into possibilities. In short, the problem is anticipating a future response even while the conditions themselves are changing. Past derived knowledge through experience is not very useful when it comes to examining an emerging surprise in the world of taking practical action. The focus must be on the interaction between older patterns and emerging possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richardson &amp; Tait, 2010</xref>). Critical reflection must occur not only when current experiences provide disorienting dilemmas but also on future possible experiences. This, of course, is the essence of using scenarios to “learn from the future” but not predict it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312439055">Fahey &amp; Randall, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Under conditions corresponding to Levels 3 and 4 described earlier, the agency of strategic action involves <italic>learning through</italic> complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312439055">Nicolaides &amp; Yorks, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312439055">2009</xref>) in which the future is neither predicable nor predetermined, but with future outcomes influenced by the choices made in the present. In a world of intensifying complexity how one is in relationship with ambiguity is a critical factor, for ambiguity is what one confronts in making choices for which the impact cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. Indeed, the impact of actions will provoke new, unanticipated, emergent responses from the environment in real time. One’s degree of comfort implicitly shapes his or her ability to respond while navigating through the strategic challenges of uncertainty and ambiguity.</p>
<p>It is within the context of increasing uncertainty that this article addresses what is an important, yet often underattended to, aspect of the strategy development process: fostering the use of strategic learning practices in the simultaneous practice of developing strategy <italic>and</italic> cultivating strategic mindset awareness. Despite the richness of the strategy literature, the focus has been on conceptual frameworks and tools for analysis, with a growing emphasis on the learning process. Receiving less attention are the implications of the adult development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312439055">Fisher, Rooke, &amp; Torbert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312439055">Kegan, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312439055">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312439055">McCauley, Drath, Palus, O’Conner, &amp; Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312439055">Rooke &amp; Torbert, 2005</xref>) for adaptive and generative strategic learning outcomes from using the practices suggested by these frameworks, tools, and processes. By adaptive strategic learning we mean insights that hold possibilities for strategic action that are exploitative of evolving changes in the environment or take advantage of underrealized opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312439055">Heifetz &amp; Linsky, 2002</xref>). Generative strategic learning produces radical, discontinuous change in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312439055">Christensen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenge presented by complexity is not with the analytical tools but the tendency to revert to an “expert” mindset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richardson &amp; Tait, 2010</xref>) that focuses on finding answers in a context that is continually changing in unpredictable ways. To borrow a phrase from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312439055">Robert Kegan (1994)</xref>, the <italic>hidden curriculum</italic> of life is evolving toward more comprehensive complexity. One consequence of this evolution, to borrow another phrase from Kegan, is an increasingly larger proportion of people who are potentially <italic>in over their heads</italic>. In other words, an effective epistemic relationship with ambiguity requires a cognitive and affective relationship with the epistemic strengths and limitations of what will be described below as action logics—mindsets that frame one’s approaches for making meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312439055">Rooke &amp; Torbert, 2005</xref>). The implications are that addressing a question often heard by graduate students engaged in studying case studies of strategic innovations, “How do I learn to think like a strategist?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312439055">Friga, 2009</xref>), increasingly involves developing awareness of one’s mindset concurrently with developing competencies in using strategic learning practices.</p>

<title>A Conceptual Framework for an Integral Approach for Strategic Learning Through Competency and Capacity</title>
<p>Increasingly, strategic thinking theorists make a distinction between strategic learning and strategic planning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312439055">Beinhocker &amp; Kaplan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312439055">Govindarajan &amp; Trimble, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312439055">Leavy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312439055">Lovallo &amp; Mendonca, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312439055">Willie Pietersen (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312439055">2010)</xref> summarizes the distinction well: Strategic learning is outside-in, beginning with inclusiveness of diverse perspectives crossing and breaking boundaries and is about ideas; strategic planning is inside-out and is about structure, organizing, and numbers based on strategic decisions. “Both are critical, but mixing them can be toxic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312439055">Pietersen, 2009</xref>). The basis for this statement is that in traditional strategic planning there often no divergent thinking that challenges existing assumptions and mental models of the world, that is, no new insights into possible futures. Relating Pietersen’s argument to Courtney et al.’s, uncertainty framework above, as the context shifts from Level 1 (a clear enough future) toward Level 4 (true ambiguity), the more critical the distinction between strategic learning and planning becomes.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534484312439055">
<title>Insight: The Heart of Strategic Learning</title>
<p>Insight, we argue, is an essential foundation of strategic learning. Broadly defined strategic insight involves an increased awareness of new possibilities derived through engaging with diverse perspectives, assessing trends in divergent domains, making assumptions explicit, and challenging those assumptions. The basis for strategic insight is analysis of trends within critical domains in the task environment and synthesis of trends across the domains. Although defined somewhat differently by various authors, the critical domains are as listed below:</p>
<list id="list2-1534484312439055" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Customers</italic>, particularly in terms of what they either value or would most greatly value if made available;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Competitors in terms of the value they provide and trends in how they have evolved their strategic positioning over time;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One’s own positioning in terms of value being provided, current realities in terms of financial trends and returns, and core competencies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Industry dynamics; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Broader environment including demographics, technology, globalization, and political trends.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Developing the inclusive story line of trends within each domain requires obtaining diverse perspectives through engaging in authentic dialogue for open exchange and challenging one’s presumptions. Following this analysis, synthesis across the domains—particularly looking for connections between customer value preferences and the disruptive trends and possible realignments in the broader environment—is the determinant of insightful strategic learning. The above statements, of course, are not new or unique; they are part of the strategy literature. However, productively executing them is the challenge, one that requires challenging frames of reference embedded in institutional structures, logics, and frames of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312439055">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>) as well as organizational legacies to produce new insights.</p>
<p>Degree of insight varies along two dimensions. The first dimension is the range of divergent possibilities that emerge through asking provocative questions of the information and data available. Questioning is central to fostering insight as people work through the dilemmas or quandaries that confront them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312439055">Pietersen (2009)</xref> has commented, “If you are asking the right questions, you already have part of the answer.” The second is the extent to which the insights are transformative in nature in the sense of how adaptive (or generative) is the change in one’s perspective of the evolving and emerging possibilities.</p>
<p>Under conditions of rapid change and ambiguity, generating superior insight is in many ways the most critical competitive advantage an organization (or individual for that matter) can have. These arguments have been made throughout the literature of the past decade or so, giving increasing prominence to strategic learning practices such as scenario thinking, a key HRD practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312439055">Chermack &amp; Swanson, 2008</xref>). The framework presented below argues that the extent to which the insights that emerge during strategic conversations along the two dimensions described previously is a function of (a) competency in applying learning practices to analytical processes and conceptual frameworks along with (b) awareness of how one’s way of making meaning in terms of his or her developmental mindset is shaping these applications. Said another way, the outcome of strategic conversations is facilitated or constrained by the capacity of the individuals to engage in these conversations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534484312439055">Figure 1</xref> provides a conceptual model of the above argument that the richness of strategic insight that emerges from engaging strategic frameworks and analytical tools and learning practices consistent with the strategic thinking literature is a function of the capacity of the mindsets of the strategists.</p>

<p>The remainder of this article further develops the rationale for the conceptual model. First we focus on the competency dimension beginning with a discussion of the various strategic learning practices and tools that are typically advocated for conducting strategic analysis. For purposes of illustration, we highlight two specific learning tools from the strategy literature—analog reasoning and scenario learning—intersecting them with other practices and tools advocated in the organizational learning literature. We then focus on the capacity dimension with a discussion of the two adult development theories most relevant to this article: constructive developmental theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312439055">Kegan, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312439055">1994</xref>), and developmental action inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312439055">Rooke &amp; Torbert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312439055">Torbert, 2004</xref>). The article concludes with implications of the integral model for HRD practice and research.</p>

<title>Critical Competencies: Utilizing Strategic Learning Practices and Tools</title>
<p>As previously noted, increasingly strategic learning as distinct from strategic planning has been given more emphasis in the literature on strategic thinking. This emphasis on learning has emerged with different streams of literature providing tools and practices that not only focus on analytical processes such as SWOT and PEST but also draw attention to the learning practices of dialogic conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312439055">Eden &amp; Ackerman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312439055">Hardy et al., 2000</xref>), awareness of thinking processes, specifically using analogies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312439055">Gavetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312439055">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>); reasoning and testing assumptions based on experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312439055">Argyris, 1993</xref>); and using scenarios to both challenge assumptions and test emerging strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312439055">Chermack &amp; Swanson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312439055">Wack, 1985</xref>). Each of these practices has their advocates, with some positioning the practice at the center of the strategy-making process.</p>
<p>Competency involves both understanding the nuances of the practice, including strengths and limitations, and the skillful use of applying them in both thinking and real-time interaction with others. For example, although many managers can recite the manner in which constructive dialogue involves the effective use of questions for exploring advantages and downsides of ideas, when observing managers in real-time conversations they easily fall back into more argumentative and closed discussion habits (indeed, observe any number of faculty meetings for verification of this point). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312439055">Peter Senge (1990)</xref> observed, “The discipline of dialogue . . . involves learning how to recognize the patterns of interaction in teams that undermine learning. The patterns of defensiveness are often deeply engrained in how a team operates . . . unrecognized they undermine learning . . . recognized and surfaced creatively, they can . . . accelerate learning” (p. 10).”</p>
<p>In addition, our focus here is combination, purposefully applying the learning tools in interspersed sequences to drive the strategic thinking process. For example, (a) developing awareness and competencies in dialogic processes as foundational for use of the other practices; (b) cultivating awareness of appropriate use of analogies for both recognizing how experience is bounding the conversation and generative thinking; (c) interspersing scenario thinking tools as a way of highlighting critical uncertainties, stimulating additional insights, and possibilities; and (d) assessing potential options as the conversation moves from divergence to convergence through synthesis. Skillful use of interspersing and triangulating the practices in both designing formal strategic learning processes and in real-time conversation is also a competency. Indeed, each strategic learning conceptual framework (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312439055">Christensen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312439055">Kim &amp; Mauborgen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312439055">Porter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312439055">Prahalad &amp; Hamel, 1990</xref>) and analysis practice raises its own provocative questions.</p>
<p>The logic of the above sequence is that dialogic processes defined as seeking to suspend assumptions and engage in genuine team learning and thinking together, as opposed to arguing for preferred outcomes, are foundational for utilizing other strategic learning practices. Also, applying various learning tools frequently used in action learning and action science interventions such as open probing questioning, the Ladder of Inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312439055">Argyris, Putnam, &amp; Smith, 1985</xref>), and the Spectrum Policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312439055">Prince, 1970</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534484312439055">Figure 2</xref>) can provide some reference points for developing dialogic awareness.</p>

<p>We turn now to a summary of two learning practices specifically emphasized in the strategy literature: analogic reasoning, and scenarios that illustrate the issue of competency. More attention is provided to the former since it has received less attention in the HRD literature.</p>
<sec id="section5-1534484312439055">
<title>Analog reasoning</title>
<p>Analog reasoning, the process through which a person “faced with an unfamiliar problem or opportunity . . . think back to some similar situation they have seen or heard about, draw lessons from it, and apply these lessons to the current situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312439055">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>, p. 54), is the thinking process through which executives often generate ideas for strategic innovation. Properly used analogies can be a rich source of insight; however, analogies are dangerous when strategists act on “an analogy on the basis of superficial similarity” . . . rather than carefully assessing “deep causal trait” (p. 57). Gavetti and Rivkin offer a mapping process for testing analogies that involves (a) actively searching for differences, (b) testing similarities for superficiality, (c) surfacing the presumptions behind asserted crucial correspondences, and (d) modeling the landscape. Critical questions that lie behind the mapping are assessing what is known, what are the maybe’s, what is unclear, how can maybe’s be turned into known or unclear, and what emerges if we reframe the presumptions.</p>
<p>The foregoing assessment process parallels and grounds some of the learning metaphors from the adult learning and action science literature. It involves, for example, using the ladder of inference as a backdrop for the mapping of influential analogies, continually going back to the existing data, and asking what new data might change one’s presumptions. Explicit focus on mapping analogies has another potential benefit for addressing the strengths and limitations of experience under conditions of complexity and ambiguity. Analogies, whether consciously used or not, are a primary way in which informal and incidental learning from experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312439055">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990</xref>) become subsequently enacted. Our experience has taught us that many times managers subconsciously engage in analog reasoning when improvising from their experiences. Seeking to make these analogies explicit is way of both valuing experience and being aware of its potential barriers to new insight. Many times questioning by others during the strategic dialogues brings into awareness how one is drawing on one’s experience and provides a more systematic way of reflexively assessing it.</p>
<p>Although the mapping process linked with dialogic-based assessment processes described previously is a very powerful tool, it is easy to fall into the traps of buying into surface similarities, especially for confirmation of how an analogy was initially framed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312439055">Gavetti &amp; Rivkin, 2005</xref>). Our observation of executives and managers engaged in strategic conversations during meetings often reveals they engage in debate around such similarities utilizing simple close-ended questions and not testing assumptions, and in other words, having limited competencies in utilizing the tools and practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534484312439055">
<title>Scenario learning</title>
<p>Scenario learning is both a source of new insights and a process for moving toward convergence and making decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312439055">Fahey and Randall (1998</xref>, p. 5) “prefer scenario learning to the more common term scenario planning for a number of reasons.” Among them is the reality that to be truly effective in addressing conformation bias managers must be willing to “suspend their beliefs, assumptions and preconceptions.” Furthermore, the term “learning implies . . . dialogue. . . . Managers and others . . . must engage each other in a free-ranging exchange of ideas . . . ,” provoking “some degree of tension. . . . Such tension is the essence of collective learning.” Once again this emphasizes the importance of establishing dialogic practices as a foundation for utilizing more specific strategic learning practices. In particular, we agree with the use of the term “learning” under conditions of uncertainty—Levels 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312439055">Courtney et al., 1997</xref>). This is also consistent with the logic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312439055">Pietersen’s (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312439055">2010)</xref> distinction between strategic learning and strategic planning.</p>
<p>The use of simulations is very useful for modeling potential scenarios. However, the higher the level of uncertainty and complexity in the environment, the greater is the impact of incompressibility on the reliability of the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312439055">Cilliers, 2005</xref>). Incompressibility refers to the reality that in building representations of open systems, we are forced to leave things out, and since the effects of these omissions are nonlinear, we cannot predict their magnitude. As noted by complexity theorists Richardson and Tait, simulations are often the only way of getting a feel for the dynamics of a system. We would add they can raise interesting questions and suggest potential courses of action. However, the more complex the system, the more intractable is the possibility for prediction from simulation. “Often the only recourse we have is to sit back and watch” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richardson &amp; Tait, 2010</xref>, p. 30).</p>
<p>The idea of working with scenarios derives from the observation that given the impossibility of knowing precisely how the future will play out a good strategy is one that plays well across several possible futures or scenarios. The core idea is learning from plausible (even if seemingly unlikely) futures: In effect, vicariously “learning through.” In addition to providing insights into possible strategic options and facilitating the decision-making process, scenario learning can facilitate the lived experience of learning <italic>through</italic> by vicariously providing a basis for improvising through reflection-in-action during implementation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312439055">Ilbury and Sunter (2001)</xref> offer a framework for structuring such a dialogue, beginning with (a) the rules of the game—givens that are certain and over which one has no control, (b) key uncertainties, (c) scenarios based on the uncertainties, (d) options, and (e) decisions. Critically reflecting on the uncertainties, scenarios, and options is enriched by awareness of the analogies and experiences shaping the frames of references of those participating in the dialogue. Dialogues building on the insights from mapping analogies, especially the “maybe’s” and “unclears,” add value to assessing potential scenarios. Making these kinds of intersections among tools requires competency in practice for avoiding confirmation bias. We also note that as one arrives at the point of making strategic decisions tolerance for risk versus potential rewards becomes a consideration. Formal risk assessments represent the transition from learning to planning, with one’s ability to calculate risk decreasing as he or she enters into truly ambiguous situations.</p>

<title>Summary of the Implications of Competency</title>
<p>The above practices, when combined with analytical tools such as SWOT and PEST, and the afore-mentioned learning tools from organizational learning and action science, stimulate opportunities for testing presumptions as the discussion evolves from divergent perspectives toward convergence and decisions. Although every strategic organizational learning context is unique, the construction of a retreat for initiating a set of conversations can generally follow the use of the above practices in a sequence guiding the evolution of the process.</p>
<p>Although the value of creating learning processes using the above tools is widely accepted at this point, as previously argued, how they become manifest in practice is another question. Part of the answer involves how well the tools have been engaged in practice over time with effective facilitation from HRD professionals (in other words, building competencies). In addition, this article argues that effectiveness in utilizing the tools is at least partly dependent on a characteristic of the strategic learner that to date has received less attention in the strategy and strategic learning literature—the degree of complexity of their meaning-making mind set.</p>

<title>The Capacity Dimension: One’s Meaning-Making Mindset</title>
<p>Adult development theories describe how adults develop more comprehensive and complex ways of making sense of themselves and their experience. The two frameworks relevant to our current argument are Kegan’s constructive developmental theory and Torbert’s developmental action inquiry. Both describe a process of transitioning through a set of developmental phases that involve a more complex way of relating to and making meaning of one’s environment. Each developmental phase enhances the capacity for learning how to learn through the complexity of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312439055">Nicolaides &amp; Yorks, 2008</xref>). Kegan’s research provides a rich theoretical foundation for how ways of making meaning evolve. Torbert’s research provides a strong focus on the leadership and action implications for understanding how ways of making meaning shape reactions to the challenges presented in one’s context.</p>
<sec id="section9-1534484312439055">
<title>Constructive developmental theory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312439055">Kegan’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312439055">1994)</xref> constructive developmental theory is constructive in that it deals with a person’s constructions of his or her experience and is developmental in its concern with how those constructions potentially grow more complex over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312439055">McCauley et al., 2006</xref>). On the basis of cross-sectional longitudinal research utilizing a reliable interview instrument (Lahey et al., 1998), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312439055">Kegan (2000</xref>, pp. 62-63; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312439055">Drago-Severson, 2004</xref>, p. 23) describes four developmental phases in adulthood: instrumental, socializing, self-authorizing, and interindividual. Each phase constitutes a distinctly different and increasingly complex epistemological shift in how one makes meaning. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312439055">Kegan’s (2000</xref>, p. 60) words, “The basic principle of complexification of mind here is not the mere addition of new capacities (an aggregation model), nor the substitution of a new capacity for an old one (a replacement model), but the subordination of once-ruling capacities to the domination of more complex capacities, an evolutionary model that . . . distinguishes transformation from other kinds of change.” For example, the shift from the socialized mindset to the self-authorizing one involves going from being “made up” by uncritically internalized values and expectations of one’s surrounding family, friends, community, and culture, to developing an internal authority that makes choices about these based on one’s own self-authorizing belief system. Again in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312439055">Kegan (2000</xref>, p. 59), “One goes from being psychological ‘written by’ the socializing press to ‘writing upon’ it.” In other words, one goes from <italic>being</italic> in one’s relationships to <italic>having</italic> one’s relationships.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312439055">McCauley et al. (2006)</xref> describe the dynamic of the theory as concerning itself “with two primary aspects of development: (a) organizing principles that regulate how people make sense of themselves and the world (orders of development) and (b) how these regulative principles are constructed and re-constructed over time (developmental movement)” (p. 636). Developmental movement refers to the transition on the part of the individual to a more complex mindset. This developmental movement involves a process of a person’s taken-for-granted meaning-making organizing principles, which are embedded in the subjective self and cannot be reflected upon, becoming objective and, therefore, available for reflection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312439055">Kegan and Lahey (2001)</xref> describe the process as one of “outgrowing one system of meaning by integrating it (as a subsystem) into a new system of meaning” (p. 21).</p>
<p>We argue that a person’s way of making meaning will influence how he or she is in relationship with uncertainty and ambiguity. For example, the socialized knower strives to seek the “best” way of achieving goals and looks for guidance by experts. The self-authorizing knower follows his or her own principles, while seeking multiple ways of moving forward to realize goals. The boundaries shaping the strategic learning process are distinctively different.</p>

<title>Developmental action inquiry</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312439055">Torbert’s (2004)</xref> theory of developmental action inquiry parallels Kegan’s ways of making meaning, bringing together theories of organizational learning, Eriksonian psychology, and Loevinger’s stages of moral development extended by the research of Cook-Greuter. At the core of Tobert’s theoretical framework are seven-stage development phases, which are defined as action logics: opportunist, diplomat, expert, achiever, interdependent, strategist, and alchemist. Defined in terms of their subjective epistemological principles and focus (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312439055">Table 1</xref>), the opportunist is parallel to Kegan’s instrumentalist phase, the diplomatic and expert correspond to the socialized self, and the achiever and individualist correspond to Kegan’s self-authorizing phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312439055">McCauley et al., 2006</xref>). Torbert refers to these as conventional mindsets. Results derived from a couple of decades of research conducted by Torbert and others on managers and professionals, using the Leadership Development Profile sentence completion survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312439055">Cook-Greuter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312439055">Loevinger, 1976</xref>), classify 85% of the respondents into these four categories, with 68% categorized as having expert and achiever mindsets (experts, 38%; achievers, 30%). Individualist is a transitional mindset into what Torbert describes as postconventional mindsets. Individualists account for another 10% of the populations studied, followed by the strategist (4%) and alchemist (1%).</p>

<p>What is of interest here is that both constructive developmental theory and development action inquiry demonstrate an increasing capacity for engaging with the challenges that confront one in interactions with various challenges and dilemmas. Kegan’s work is grounded in understanding the processes through which these developmental transitions emerge and translate into behavior. Torbert has grounded his work initially in action science and how epistemological mindsets shape action, both in terms of leadership and innovation. His framework differentiates the action implications of ways of meaning-making mindsets. Of particular interest here is the largest number of managers and professionals falling in the expert action logic, reinforcing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312439055">Richards and Tait’s (2010)</xref> discussion of the limitations of the expert mindset under conditions of intensifying complexity.</p>

<title>The Implications of Capacity for Strategic Learning</title>
<p>Combining the implications of complex adaptive systems, constructive developmental theory, and developmental action inquiry suggests that how we utilize our experience in terms of the interaction between older patterns and emerging possibilities is shaped by the epistemological complexity of our mindsets. With a focus on the action implications of the mindsets with regard to leadership and how they approach inquiry and decision making when confronted with challenges, the action logic framework in particular provides an integrative and adaptive model for understanding the action of learning through ambiguity.</p>
<p>Strategic learning is a distinctive way of relating to one’s experience and the larger environment within which one is situated. This learning process differs from problem solving and involves more than a broadening of one’s perspective and the application of specific tools. There is a temporal dimension to the process, one that gets more complex as the environmental context becomes more complex. Learning through strategic thinking involves living in the tension of drawing on one’s expertise for judgment, while bracketing it when seeking emerging possibilities. This process is a journey <italic>through</italic> divergent to convergent thinking while living <italic>within</italic> the complexity of the moment. In other words, this is a way of being in relationship with self, context, and action. The challenges of strategic learning, such as reading the early signs of emerging disruptive trends, overcoming confirmation bias, and the intensifying impact of uncertainty and ambiguity, are the basis for arguing that increasingly strategic learning tools and a focus on developmental capacity should be linked in HRD practice. The sections that follow make explicit the argument underlying the conceptual model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534484312439055">Figure 1</xref> and the literature presented previously.</p>
<sec id="section12-1534484312439055">
<title>Action logics shape the approaches executive and managers take in addressing strategic challenges</title>
<p>Strategic analysis and learning practices are methods widely advocated in the literature for generating and testing new strategic perspectives. How these practices are aligned, engaged, and facilitated in various strategic conversations is important. However, the selection and use of practices and what skills and habits are relied upon are shaped by the action logics of the manager. In particular, the manager’s mindset shapes how he or she is in epistemological relationship with the strategic learning process: Is there a focus on getting the answer or initially getting new insights, that is, previously unseen implications of trends? Many managers are accustomed to and identified with the habit of instrumental learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312439055">Heifetz &amp; Linsky, 2002</xref>) that is essentially digestible as expert knowledge. Their focus is on applying this knowledge to establish control. Although there are many contexts in which this focus is very applicable and appropriate (TQM and six sigma, for example), it is very different from learning through strategic dilemmas embedded in relatively high levels of complexity and ambiguity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534484312439055">
<title>Action logics bind the capacity for enacting strategic learning competencies under conditions of increasing complexity</title>
<p>Insight involves increased awareness of new possibilities derived through asking provocative questions through engaging with diverse perspectives, assessing trends in divergent domains, and making explicit and challenging one’s taken-for-granted assumptions. Extending the logic of the assertion made previously, how one makes sense of the environment is a function of the extent of complexity of ones level of consciousness or action logic. Capacity is imbedded in the individual(s), more specifically in the relationship between their mindset and the level of ambiguity that confronts them. Organizations can provide processes and tools for enabling strategic thinking and discussion, but ultimately the products of these discussions are dependent on the individuals who are participating in the process. Action logics are mindsets that shape how one makes meaning of ambiguity and acts.</p>

<sec id="section14-1534484312439055">
<title>Intentionally engaging in first-person, second-person, and third-person inquiry is simultaneously self-developmental and influential in shaping strategic conversations</title>
<p>An essential feature of developing capacity is inquiry that fosters interdependence at both the individual and group levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312439055">McCauley et al., 2006</xref>). Torbert and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312439055">Fisher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312439055">Tolbert, 2004</xref>) describe three levels of inquiry necessary for beginning to even approach this possibility, each of which is imbued with its own complexity; first-person inquiry (awareness of one’s own intentions, strategies, and sensed performance), second-person inquiry (building inquiry into one’s interactions with others through mindful use of speech while utilizing strategic learning tools and frameworks), and third-person inquiry (awareness of the larger system and the assumptions it shapes through the data that it provides). Explicitly integrating these three levels of inquiry highlights awareness of how one is reacting to his or her experiences in an environment that is simultaneously intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social. This awareness fosters reflexivity while deepening the potential for dialogue for making meaning throughout the learning process and understanding how one’s actions influence the system.</p>

<sec id="section15-1534484312439055">
<title>As capacity grows it potentially has an exponential impact on insight</title>
<p>As argued earlier, in pursuit of insight, the trick is not in selecting one approach but in the systematic diversity created by triangulating conceptual frameworks and sequencing and creatively interspersing strategic learning and analysis tools. The quality of outcomes of strategic thinking is a function not only of the effective application of strategic analysis and learning practices (competencies) but also one’s way of making meaning (developmental capacity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312439055">Drago-Severson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312439055">Kegan, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312439055">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312439055">Nicolaides &amp; Yorks, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312439055">2008</xref>). The richness of payoff from such practices lies in the capacity of a learner to leverage the diversity of these practices, both in his or her own thinking and in dialogue with others. Our experience from preliminary research with classes and strategy development interventions such as those described below suggests that even raising awareness of how one is reacting to initial ambiguity and uncertainty can have an impact on the insights being generated.</p>

<title>Implications of the Conceptual Model for Practice and Research</title>
<p>Although the earlier argument is based on the intersections between the streams of literature, there is a need for submitting the above points to more systematic research. We now turn to those implications. As previously mentioned, the conceptual model is intended to provide (a) a perspective for guiding practice in developing enhanced capacity for engaging in strategic learning for developing insights that can be synthesized into generative strategies while continuing to learn through the dilemmas that emerge, and (b) direction for future research into understanding the strategic learning process. We use the terms <italic>guiding</italic> and <italic>direction</italic> intentionally because we see the HRD practice of strategic learning addressing a process that is itself complex depending on the institutional context mixed with the diversity of the participants, both in terms of lived experiences and range of mindset capacities represented in the dialogue. Testing and enhancing the model can be accomplished through learning from experience in applying it in case study–oriented action inquiries.</p>

<title>Implications for HRD Practice</title>
<p>The actual structuring of a strategic learning initiative is a design challenge reflecting the starting point of the intervention in terms of the organization’s positioning, the nature of the executive network, and the existing time line. From an HRD perspective there are implications for pedagogical designs in HRD graduate programs and the design and facilitation of strategy development conversations in organizations. Our initial experimentations began with a graduate class, “Strategy Development as a Learning Process” and subsequently extended to a course “Strategic Advocacy” in an Executive Master of Science in Technology Management program. Elements were also applied in a Chief Information Officer Institute during the generative stages of our thinking. More recently, the implications of the framework have been applied in an executive education program in the business school of a European University and in an HRD intervention in strategy development in a global corporation. Detailed discussions of these interventions are beyond the scope of this article and have been presented elsewhere. In what follows, we offer generalized illustrations of these kinds of initiatives.</p>
<p>The core elements of such interventions involve repeated cycles between enhancing awareness of how participants are in relationship to the ambiguous challenges of the strategic choices confronting them and the “external system” of relationships and dynamic trends that give shape to these challenges. Relevant strategic frameworks are presented, compared, and discussed with a recurring distinction being made between expert problem-solving thinking that has the “right answer” and challenges marked by uncertainty and complexity as well as unpredictable responses in the environment. The focus is on triangulating the various frameworks from the strategy development literature for purposes of raising divergent perspectives and generating provocative questions. Kegan’s ways of making meaning and Torbert’s action logics and action inquiry practices are also introduced for participants to organize their feedback and reflections on their dialogues.</p>
<p>Participants are placed into small inquiry groups to work on a strategic challenge. Team composition is organized to bring diverse viewpoints into their dialogues. Various learning practices (analog reasoning, for example) are introduced as the process unfolds. In each case, emphasis is on applying inquiry tools against misuse of the practice for validating preferred solutions and safeguarding against untested advocacy. Learning practices are sequenced to move the conversation from divergent to convergent thinking and decision making. Although these learning practices are framed in terms of strategy development, they are, we would argue, generic to learning through complex situations.</p>
<p>The interventions taken so far involve executives working on business unit strategic challenges within the context of their organization’s strategic initiatives. For example, in an HRD intervention, one set of executives and upper-level managers involved with international aspects of the business and another with developing a related, but distinct, product line that is being added to the business were working in teams applying the strategic learning tools while reflecting on the difference between an expert and a strategic mindset approach. The distinction between strategic learning and planning framed the initiative, with participants engaging in a discussion of the environmental trends that are affecting the business. These discussions took place within diverse groups, with thoughts posted for open-space conversations. Then they were placed in collaborative action inquiry groups to work on their strategic challenges. Practices such as dialogue, analog reasoning, scenarios, and double-loop learning were sequenced to move the conversation from divergent to convergent thinking and decision making. This meeting served a precursor to additional meetings involving the establishment of collaborative teams, with each team focusing on a specific aspect of the organizational context, including analysis of the customer value chain, trends in competitor actions, emergent technologies, and internal organizational realities.</p>
<p>Admittedly, our approach is applicable when participants hold the dual intention of generating value-added strategic insight into a business challenge while developing their meaning-making capacities, yet not applying a particular strategy framework as an analytical problem-solving tool. The synergy between these intentions is found in the focus on applying basic competencies for thinking about strategic challenges, integrating action inquiry practices with the practices of strategic thinking. Intended outcomes involve both an enhanced perspective on a real strategic challenge and next steps, experiencing a personally enhanced ability for fostering and leading strategic conversations, with a more developed mindfulness of the practices necessary for engaging in productive strategic conversation based on experience in applying strategic learning practices to actual strategic challenges. Elsewhere, we provide some preliminary examples of the impact of pedagogy on mindsets. For purposes of this article, we next turn our attention to implications for testing the model.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>The conceptual model presented and elaborated on in this article is the product of 5 years of inquiry gathering data and lesson’s learned from graduate, executive education class and organizational applications. However, the model requires extensive field testing, not only for validating the theoretical intersections being advocated but also for providing heuristic guidance for executive development practices and stimulating innovative strategic conversations in the context of complexity. By its nature, such research will be field based, involving activities ranging from comparative case studies, quasi-experimental designs, to action research initiatives. The themes presented above can be framed as propositions and translated into hypotheses. For example, using either the Lovinger (1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312439055">Cook-Greuter, 2004</xref>) or the Subject Object Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312439055">Lahey, Souvaine, Kegan, Goodman, &amp; Felix, 1988</xref>) with participants, then employing a sequence of strategic learning practices in a workshop format and comparing the insights and contributions produced by various mindsets. In addition, careful observation of how the various participants engage with various learning practices, some of which are more analytically concrete and focus exclusively on the external context and others involving more reflective practice. In any of these activities, results of the capacity assessment would be kept confidential until after the workshop. They could then be used as part of a postworkshop coaching initiative for purposes of continuing executive development. A similar design was utilized for a doctoral dissertation studying how developmental mindsets influenced participation and outcomes in an intensive group dynamics workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312439055">McCallum, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to expect a significant shift in mindset over the course of a workshop or a retreat. However, our experience shows that introducing a developmental action inquiry experience prior to use of the strategic learning tools raises awareness of participants’ regarding how their mindset is shaping their use of the tools and, by extension, influencing the range of insights they develop. When longitudinal learning interventions, such as action learning programs, are implemented, the opportunities for more intensive assessment by comparing designs across cohorts present themselves.</p>
<p>Interesting opportunities for quasi-experimental designs in MBA and EMBA programs also exist, especially for comparing two sections of a strategy course, one using a traditional pedagogy and the other explicitly interspersing the model throughout the course curriculum. Again we call attention to how a similar design was used in a dissertation comparing sections using case discussion with one using simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312439055">Scully, 2007</xref>). It goes without saying that such research needs to use robust case study and field methods including multiple researchers and devil’s advocates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is much to be gained in terms of executive development as well as contributions to our understanding of foundational streams informing the conceptual model presented in this article. Strategic insight is an underresearched area of the strategic thinking literature. A multidisciplinary approach has considerable potential for enriching HRD interventions focusing on executive development and strategic innovation. In addition, a focus on strategic learning has much to contribute to our understanding of how to foster enhanced adult capacity for meaning making, even as the adult development literature has much to contribute to the theory and practices of strategic learning.</p>
