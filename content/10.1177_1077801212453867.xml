<abstract>
<p>This study sought to identify factors that predicted outcomes for sexual assault cases involving female victims across several decision-making points and compare these findings to prior studies. The results indicate that there continues to be a high attrition rate in the handling of sexual assault cases. Only 9.7% of cases examined resulted in charges. In regards to processing decisions, most of the factors that predicted whether cases were founded, resulted in arrest, presented to the prosecution, or resulted in felony charges were extralegal factors. One factor appeared to influence several decision-making points: whether officers noted discrepancies in victim statements.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research has found that the attrition rate continues to be high for sexual assault cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier &amp; Haney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212453867">Gregory &amp; Lees, 1996</xref>); only 40% of cases reported to the police will result in an arrest and only about 50% of these cases result in felony charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453867">Chandler &amp; Torney, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1981</xref>). Research also indicates that sexual assault cases are treated differently than other violent crimes despite efforts to improve how these cases are processed through the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212453867">Myers &amp; LaFree, 1982</xref>). However, few studies have been devoted to examining why so few cases proceed through the criminal justice system. Moreover, those studies conducted have generally focused on prosecutorial decision-making and court outcomes and have failed to account for the high rates of attrition occurring at earlier decision-making points. In particular, research is needed at the police decision points given evidence that police officials are the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1989</xref>). The lack of research in this area has serious consequences for understanding how cases are processed by the legal system generally and by prosecutors specifically. One cannot fully appreciate the factors that influence prosecutorial decision making without understanding what types of cases get to that point in the processing continuum in the first place and what types of cases are weeded out at earlier points in the process. This study addresses this gap in the research by examining four case outcomes: police officer decision to found cases, officer decision to arrest, officer decision to present the case to the prosecution, and prosecutor decision to approve felony charges. Additionally, this study seeks to examine whether factors significant in previous studies are still relevant. Prior studies on sexual assault processing used data now over a decade old, and although these studies are important, analyses of more recent data are needed to assess whether prior findings are still relevant or if there have been changes in how criminal justice practitioners process sexual assault cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077801212453867">
<title>Police Discretion and Decision-Making</title>
<p>It is commonly understood that police officers have enormous amounts of discretion in their day-to-day work activities, and much of their decision-making is hidden from public scrutiny. For instance, when police officers see violations of criminal codes they can either choose to ignore the violation or effect an arrest. The decision not to arrest is typically undocumented as are some of the underlying reasons for deciding to arrest (e.g., racial bias). Similarly, in case reporting and investigation, officers can choose whether to take a case report, how much time and effort to dedicate to investigating the case, whether the incident meets the legal definition of a crime, and if an arrest should be made. Thus, the decisions police officers make in relation to sexual assault case processing can impact whether cases result in formal charges against suspects and whether victims have the opportunity for court resolution.</p>
<p>Although research on police decision-making in sexual assault cases is more limited than that examining prosecutorial decision-making (see below), the research that does exist indicates that police officers are often skeptical of claims of sexual assault. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212453867">Lord and Rassel’s (2000)</xref> examination of sexual assault processing in nine North Carolina counties found that police officers were highly suspicious of sexual assault allegations. Officers expressed concerns over proving consent and victim credibility. The authors also found that polygraphs of victims were still being used to determine victim truthfulness. Additionally, officers reported that prosecutorial charging practices influenced how they handled cases. For instance, although police officers believed intoxicated victims could be sexually assaulted, most believed prosecutors would not charge and prosecute suspects in these cases. Thus, officers did not pursue these cases because the desired outcome—charging and prosecution—was unlikely. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212453867">Schuller and Stewart (2000)</xref> reported that Canadian officers expressed similar concerns about victim credibility and whether officers believed suspects would be found guilty. In her analysis of officer perceptions of sexual assault cases reported to the New Zealand Police Department in 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212453867">Jordan (2004)</xref> found that certain factors were “red flags” that indicated to officers that the case may be false. These included delays in reporting and inconsistency in victim statements.</p>
<p>Not only does research indicate that officers are wary about sexual assault claims in general, but that concerns of victim truthfulness have been found to affect actual police determinations of case legitimacy. In other words, officers are not just skeptical, but they actually dismiss cases perceived to be not legitimate. After a victim reports her assault, police officers are charged with making a determination as to whether her case is legitimate. When cases are deemed as not legitimate by officers, the cases are officially unfounded and are no longer actively investigated. The unfounding of sexual assault cases can occur for one of three reasons: first, officers determine that the incident occurred outside the jurisdiction of the police agency; second, officers determine that the allegations were false; or third, officers determine that the allegations were baseless. Of particular concern are those determinations based on officer perceptions that the allegations were false or baseless, as these decisions may be predicated on officer skepticism of victim claims.</p>
<p>Research that has examined factors influencing officer founding decisions reveals that various factors, including victim moral character and truthfulness, impact officer determination of case legitimacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree (1989)</xref> in his analysis of 905 forcible sex cases reported to the Indianapolis Police Department in 1970, 1973, and 1975 found that police officers unfounded rape cases when there were questions regarding the victim’s moral character or conduct. He also found that victim unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation and prosecution increased the likelihood of the case being unfounded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801212453867">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453867">Kerstetter’s (1990)</xref> analysis of sexual assaults reported to the Chicago Police Department in 1989 showed similar findings. Specifically, the willingness of victims to cooperate with the investigation and prosecution of their cases decreased the likelihood of cases being founded, as did information related to the discrediting of the victim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453867">Kerstetter (1990)</xref> also found that the presence of a weapon and victim resistance increased the likelihood of cases being founded. These data all indicate that officers consider extralegal factors, such as victim moral character, when making case processing decisions. Moreover, they indicate that officers took cases more seriously with aggravating factors (i.e., the use of a weapon) and where victims actively resisted the suspect.</p>
<p>Research also indicates that similar factors influenced officer decisions to arrest. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree (1989)</xref> found that cases were most likely to result in an arrest when a weapon was used, the victim was willing to testify, the victim had not engaged in questionable behaviors, and the incident was reported promptly. He also found that cases were more likely to result in an arrest when the victim and suspect were acquaintances, a finding that likely reflects greater ease of identifying known suspects. For officers to make an arrest, they must know who the suspect is and where that person can be located. In acquaintance rape, the identity of the suspect is known. However, just because known offender cases were more apt to have suspects identified and arrested does not mean officers were more likely to pursue charges or that these cases were more likely to result in formal charges by the prosecutor. Overall, these findings indicate that a combination of factors influenced officer decisions including: incident characteristics reflecting aggravating circumstances (i.e., weapon presence) and extralegal factors (e.g., relationship between victim and suspect, victim willingness to prosecute, victim credibility, promptness of reporting). Additionally, in their analysis of criminal sexual assaults reported to a Midwestern city police department in 1991 by females 16 years and older (<italic>N</italic> = 569), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier and Haney (1996)</xref> found that police were more likely to question an identified suspect when there were witnesses present.</p>

<title>Prosecutorial Discretion and Decision-Making</title>
<p>Like police, prosecutors have immense discretion. As noted by Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212453867">Butler (2009)</xref>, “the head of the prosecution office is the most unregulated actor in the entire legal system. Basically, there are no rules. The lead prosecutor . . . can make whatever decision he wants about whether to prosecute and no judge or politician can overturn it” (p. 106). Thus, the decision to charge suspects in sexual assault cases is at the sole discretion of the prosecutor’s office. Not only does this have implications for the types of suspects that are subject to prosecution and punishment, but it also has implications for which victims and communities experience justice.</p>
<p>Research examining prosecutorial decision making in sexual assault cases shows that prosecutors discriminate in an effort to weed out those cases that they believe will not result in conviction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212453867">Frohmann, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn, Beichner, &amp; Davids-Frenzel, 2001</xref>). Those cases that do not meet a perceived set of standards may be considered a waste of time and other resources and, therefore, their progression through the system is halted. Available resources are then dedicated to those select few cases that remain. The primary concern prosecutors have when evaluating cases is the “convictability” of the case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453867">Frohmann (1997)</xref> has described this as the “downstream orientation” by which prosecutors attempt to predict the likelihood that a case will proceed through the criminal justice system. Moreover, research clearly indicates that the focus on case convictability results in prosecutors considering factors not legally relevant. In other words, they consider information that is irrelevant to whether the suspect committed the offense.</p>
<p>Several studies have been conducted that examine prosecutorial decision-making in sexual assault cases. These studies have found that a combination of victim, suspect, and case characteristics influence whether prosecutors are willing to charge suspects, and prosecutors often focus on victim, suspect, and case characteristics that should not matter when determining if the suspect committed the crime. For instance, research indicates that perceptions of victim credibility, often defined in the literature as whether the victim was engaged in risk-taking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212453867">Spears &amp; Spohn, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212453867">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Horney, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al., 2001</xref>), victim moral character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212453867">Spears &amp; Spohn, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212453867">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al., 2001</xref>), and whether the victim resisted her attacker (Spohn &amp; Holleran, 1993; Spohn &amp; Horney, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>), are considered in case processing decisions, despite the fact that the victim’s character or behavior prior to, during, or after the incident should not be considered relevant for determining whether the suspect committed the sexual assault. For example, in their analysis of cases handled by two prosecuting offices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner and Spohn (2005)</xref> found that for their Kansas City dataset, risk-taking behavior at the time of the sexual assault, including activities such as walking alone at night, going with the suspect to his residence, and being in an area where drugs are sold, decreased the likelihood that a case would be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Victim resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Horney, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>), weapon presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453867">Chandler &amp; Torney, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453867">Kerstetter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al., 2001</xref>), the availability of witnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212453867">Kingsnorth, MacIntosh, &amp; Wentworth, 1999</xref>), and timing of reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212453867">Kingsnorth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212453867">Spears &amp; Spohn, 1996</xref>) have also been found to impact prosecutorial decision making. Overall, these studies indicate that victims who resist their attacker, have witnesses to the incident, and do not delay reporting are significantly more likely to have prosecutors file felony charges.</p>
<p>Race has also been shown to influence prosecutorial decision-making in sexual assault cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453867">Chandler &amp; Torney, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Horney, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>), although the direction of the relationship across studies is inconsistent. For instance, in terms of victim race and case outcomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212453867">Spohn and Horney (1993)</xref> found that sexual assaults involving White victims were significantly more likely to result in charges being dismissed as compared to those involving Black victims, while cases involving White victims were significantly more likely to result in conviction than cases involving Black victims. Victim race was not a significant predictor for the other outcomes examined (i.e., charge reduced and suspect incarcerated). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn and Holleran (2001)</xref> found that stranger cases involving White victims were significantly more likely to result in charges (no victim race effect was found in the full model or the acquaintance and intimate partner models).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077801212453867">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453867">Chandler and Torney (1981)</xref> found that race of the victim was a significant factor in sexual assault processing, but specifically as it related to suspect race. These authors found that sexual assaults involving minority defendants and White victims were significantly more likely to result in charges than those involving White defendants and White victims, White defendants and minority victims, or minority defendants and minority victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree (1989)</xref> reported similar findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn and Spears (1996)</xref>, on the other hand, found that cases involving Black suspects and Black victims, and White suspects and White victims, were significantly less likely to be dismissed by the prosecution than cases involving Black suspects and White victims.</p>
<p>Research also indicates that cases involving nonstrangers are less likely to proceed through the criminal justice system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier &amp; Haney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212453867">Williams, 1981</xref>; but not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al., 2001</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier and Haney (1996)</xref> found that police officers were less likely to question suspects when the victim and suspect were acquaintances. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212453867">Williams (1981)</xref> discovered that cases in which the suspect and victim were prior acquaintances were less likely to result in convictions than cases involving strangers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>). However, not every study has found that the closer in relation victims are to suspects the less likely the case will be prosecuted. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al. (2001)</xref> found that cases involving suspects identified as intimate partners and acquaintances were more likely to be prosecuted than cases involving suspects who were strangers, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner and Spohn (2005)</xref> found that assaults perpetrated by acquaintances were more likely than those committed by strangers to be charged by prosecutors handling the Miami-Dade cases.</p>
<p>Overall, past research on sexual assault processing by police officers and prosecutors indicate that a combination of victim, suspect, and incident characteristics are considered when making processing decisions. Many of these factors reflect extralegal aspects of cases that are not legally relevant. In other words, these factors should not matter when determining whether a suspect committed the crime. However, all of the previous studies examined data collected over a decade ago. In recent years, criminal justice organizations have undergone efforts to improve how they interact with crime victims. Some organizations have implemented specialized units, instituted sensitivity training on sexual assaults, and collaborated with victim advocacy programs in an effort to improve outcomes for sexual assaults victims. Thus, it is probable that factors used to previously discredit victims, such as victim moral character and victim risk-taking behaviors, may be less important today than in the past. Additionally, many state legislators have broadened the definition of rape to include more than just the carnal knowledge of females forcibly and against their will, removed the consent requirement, and have expanded the definition of sexual assaults to include spouses. Finally, there have been increased efforts to address concerns over racial disparities and system discrimination against minority victims and suspects. Such efforts include programs aimed at collecting data on racial discrimination and decision-making (i.e., racial profiling in traffic stops) as well as sensitivity training for officers and prosecutors. Although their impact is yet unknown, these efforts may have resulted in officers and prosecutors being more sensitive to the issue of race, resulting in this variable no longer being a significant predictor of case outcomes.</p>

<title>Present Study</title>
<p>This study examined case processing decisions for a sample of criminal sexual assault cases reported to a large Midwestern police department in 2003. Four decision-making points were examined: (1) <italic>case founding</italic>, (2) <italic>arrest</italic>, (3) <italic>presentation to the prosecution</italic>, and (4) <italic>prosecutor approval of felony charges. Case founding</italic> refers to the initial determination by police officers that the reported incident actually constituted a criminal sexual assault as defined by state statute. This is the first step through which all cases must pass once an official police report has been completed. Cases in which officers do not believe a crime occurred are unfounded or reclassified (generally to a lesser offense, such as assault), while cases in which officers do believe a crime occurred are founded. Officers continue working on those cases that are founded. These cases may be suspended until further information develops. However, some cases will result in the identification and arrest of the suspects. <italic>Arrest</italic> occurs when the officer has enough probable cause to arrest and charge a suspect for a criminal sexual assault. In some cases an officer may have probable cause to arrest, but does not make an arrest due to victim preferences to not participate in the case. If the suspect has been identified and arrested, the next step in the process is to determine whether the case should be presented to the prosecution (<italic>presentation to the prosecution</italic>). Again, some cases may not be presented to the prosecution even after the suspect has been arrested because the victim refuses to participate in court proceedings. If the case is presented for felony review, prosecuting attorneys decide whether to approve felony criminal sexual assault charges (<italic>prosecutor approval of felony charges</italic>). If the prosecuting attorneys refuse to approve felony charges, the charges may be downgraded to a misdemeanor (e.g., simple assault; domestic battery) or the suspect may be released without charging (i.e., the suspect is not formally charged and is free to leave the police station).</p>
<p>Similar to other studies that have examined the processing of sexual assault cases, this study examined victim, suspect, and incident characteristics and the influence of these variables on police and prosecutor decision-making at each of the four processing points described above. The purpose of the study was twofold: (1) to examine which factors influenced case processing decisions at each of the four processing points to provide a more complete picture as to what factors influence case processing, and (2) to compare these findings to those from past studies to determine if there have been changes in what factors influence case processing decisions over the last few decades.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The final sample for this study consisted of 465 criminal sexual assault cases involving female victims aged 18 years and older. Excluded from this sample were cases in which the victim recanted (<italic>n</italic> = 21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077801212453867">3</xref></sup> This study’s sample was extracted from a database containing detailed information about 630 criminal sexual assault cases that occurred from January, 2003 to August, 2003 and were reported to a Midwestern police department. The 630 cases excluded male victims because males accounted for only a small percentage of criminal sexual assaults reported to this police department (approximately 9% of all criminal sexual assault cases) and because these types of cases are likely different than those involving females. The sample was also limited to females aged 18 years and older at the time of the incident because cases of underage victims may be handled differently. For instance, in this jurisdiction other agencies, such as child welfare, are contacted and may be involved in the investigations. Moreover, the state’s laws regarding access to juvenile records, regardless of whether the juvenile was a victim or offender, make retrieving such information more difficult. Access to police files was therefore limited to cases involving adults. Finally, the sample was further limited to cases in which only one suspect and one victim were present because cases involving multiple victims and/or multiple suspects are likely to be different (e.g., considered more serious) than those involving one suspect and one victim. The sample was also limited to instances in which the suspect was male because there was only one case in which the alleged suspect was female.</p>
<p>In this jurisdiction, individuals can be charged with criminal sexual assault if they sexually penetrate the victim by use of force or threat of force or the victim is unable to consent to penetration. The definition of criminal sexual assault is much broader than that used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program in that the definition includes male victims, has a much more expansive definition of penetration, and includes assaults in which the victim is unable to consent.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077801212453867">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from various paper and electronic files including the incident, arrest, and detective supplemental reports and an evidence-tracking database used to document and track all forensic evidence. Consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212453867">Martin (2005)</xref> identifies as one of the primary activities of police personnel, these sources of data reflect the activities and information that police officers document as part of their efforts to “build their case.” Although all of the information was documented in a manner that could be used in criminal court, it was still influenced by officer interpretations, attitudes, and beliefs about criminal sexual assaults, victims, and suspects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077801212453867">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Three types of independent variables were examined: victim, suspect, and incident characteristics. Victim and suspect characteristics included age at the time of the incident, race, and alcohol or drug use at the time of the incident. <italic>Victim age</italic> and <italic>suspect age</italic> were coded as continuous variables measured in years. This study utilized a three-category race/ethnicity variable to examine potential differences in the treatment of cases involving Hispanic victims and suspects. Most prior research examining sexual assault processing has generally used a two-category race variable (i.e., White and Black; except <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453867">Kingsnorth et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>victim race/ethnicity</italic> and <italic>suspect race/ethnicity</italic> were dummy coded for two variables: (1) Black (0 = no, 1 = yes) and (2) Hispanic (0 = no, 1 = yes) with White as the omitted reference category. The variable, <italic>victim character</italic>, was created to reflect whether the victim had questionable moral character or if the victim had been engaged in risk-taking behavior prior to the assault. Questionable moral character was defined as an individual who was identified as a known prostitute, drug, or alcohol abuser, had a prior arrest record, or was portrayed as someone who was promiscuous. Risk-taking behavior was defined as an individual who willingly entered a vehicle with persons unknown to them, was engaged in prostitution directly prior to the assault, was drinking at a bar or club prior to the incident, was drinking heavily prior to the incident, or willingly went with persons for the purposes of selling or using drugs. Although in past studies victim moral character and risk-taking behavior were categorized separately, they were combined in this study because they were highly correlated at the bivariate level, creating concerns about multicollinearity, and because the behaviors could be seen as both morally wrong and risky. For instance, being a prostitute can be perceived as morally reprehensible and also risky. The final variable, therefore, was dummy coded for questionable moral character or risk taking behavior (0 = no and 1 = yes).</p>
<p>Suspect prior arrest history was dummy coded for whether the suspect had an arrest history (0 = no and 1 = yes). Suspect arrest history was only examined in relation to two outcome variables: officer decision to present to the prosecution and prosecutor decision to approve felony charges. Arrest history was not examined in relation to the founding decision because knowing whether a suspect has an arrest history requires knowledge of who the alleged suspect was, something not always known at the founding decision point. Suspect prior history was also not examined in relation to the arrest decision because it was not clear based on the case files whether officers knew of the suspect’s prior arrest history before making the arrest decision. Although the files indicated whether a suspect had a prior arrest history, this information may have been the result of the definitive identification of a suspect following fingerprinting that occurs after arrest.</p>
<p>As noted, officer decisions are at times a byproduct of victim preferences regarding whether to continue participating in the criminal justice process. Although officers can choose to continue working on the case, arrest the suspect, and seek felony charges, anecdotal information suggests this rarely happens. Therefore, <italic>victim preference</italic> was coded for victim preference to not cooperate in the criminal justice process (0 = no and 1 = yes).</p>
<p>Incident characteristics included whether a rape kit was completed, the victim sustained physical injuries, the assault resulted in penetration, a weapon was used, witnesses to the incident were present, there were discrepancy in victim statements, and the victim reported actively resisting the assault. Incident characteristics also included the victim/suspect relationship and length of time between the incident and reporting to the police. The variable <italic>rape kit completed</italic> was coded for whether the victim submitted to a rape kit (0 = no, 1 = yes). The <italic>presence of injuries</italic> was dummy coded for presence of visible injuries (0 = no and 1 = yes). <italic>Witness presence</italic> was dummy coded for whether there were witnesses to the incident (0 = no and 1 = yes). <italic>Weapon presence</italic> was dummy coded for whether the victim saw or was told the suspect had a weapon (0 = no and 1 = yes). Weapons included a firearm, knife, or some other object, but not the suspect’s hands, fists, or feet. A three-category weapon variable was initially coded. However, review of the bivariate and multivariate outcomes revealed that no significant differences between weapon types (e.g., firearm vs. knife), but rather whether a weapon was present. Therefore, these categories were collapsed into a two-category variable (no weapon, weapon). <italic>Discrepancy in victim statements</italic> was coded for whether discrepancies were noted by police officers (0 = no and 1 = yes). Discrepancies in victim statements were only noted if the report indicated that the victim story changed after questioning by police officers. <italic>Resistance</italic> reported by the victim was dummy coded for the reporting of some type of resistance (0 = no and 1 = yes). Resistance was based on the whether the victim reported any type of resistance, including but not limited to fighting with the suspect, screaming, and attempting to flee during the attack. The <italic>victim/suspect relationship</italic> was dummy coded into two variables: (1) acquaintance/relative (0 = no and 1 = yes) and (2) intimate partner (0 = no and 1 = yes), with stranger as the omitted reference category. Intimate partner was defined as prior or current spouse, boyfriend, or sexual partner, but not formally described as a boyfriend. <italic>Reporting time</italic> was dummy coded for reports occurring beyond 6 hours (0 = no and 1 = yes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077801212453867">4</xref></sup> Univariate descriptive statistics for the independent variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212453867">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis for this study was conducted in two steps. First, bivariate analyses of the relationship between the three sets of independent variables (victim characteristics, suspect characteristics, and incident characteristics) and the four dependent variables (founded outcome, case cleared outcome, presented to prosecution outcome, and prosecution outcome) were conducted. Analyses of the relationship between the independent, categorical-level variables and the four dependent variables were conducted using the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test of independence to identify which independent variables were significantly related to the dependent variables at the bivariate level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212453867">Table 2</xref>). When the independent variable was continuous (e.g., victim age), one-way analysis of variance was conducted to examine between group mean differences. Bivariate analyses were also used to identify any potential issues with multicollinearity between the independent variables.</p>

<p>Next, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted in which the independent variables significant at the bivariate level were entered simultaneously into logistic regression models to identify which factors predicted whether cases were founded, resulted in arrest, presented to the prosecution, and whether prosecutors approved felony charges. Only those variables that were significant at the bivariate level were included in the final models to prevent overfitting of the data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used because the dependent variables were dichotomous; this technique was more flexible than other analyses; and the predictor variables can be a mixture of discrete, dichotomous, and continuous variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212453867">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Cases with missing data were excluded from the final models (Model 1, <italic>n</italic> = 22; Model 2, <italic>n</italic> = 2). Logistic regression model diagnostics were examined to ensure the models were appropriate. Finally, for each model the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was examined to ensure the model was appropriate.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The bivariate chi-square analyses revealed that different factors were significant at each decision point. Importantly, for two decision points—founding decision and decision to present to the prosecution—only one variable was significant. At the founding decision point, the only variable that was statistically significant was whether there was discrepancy noted in the victim’s statement. Cases in which there were discrepancies noted in the victim statements were significantly less likely to be founded by police officers than cases in which no discrepancies were noted (77.0% vs. 93.1%, respectively; χ<sup>2</sup> [1, <italic>N</italic> = 465] = 18.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For the decision to present to the prosecution, the only variable that was statistically significant was victim preference. Police officers were more likely to present cases to the prosecution for felony approval when the victim was willing to pursue the case as compared to when the victim was not willing to cooperate (96.5% vs. 16.7%, respectively; χ<sup>2</sup> [1, <italic>N</italic> = 145] = 94.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Multivariate logistic regression models were not performed for these two decision points because only one variable was found to be significant at the bivariate level.</p>
<p>For the remaining two decision points, arrest and prosecution approval of felony charges, multivariate logistic regression models were conducted. The first model—arrest—included the seven variables significantly related to the dependent variable at the bivariate level: suspect race/ethnicity, witness presence, rape kit completed, discrepancy noted, resistance noted, victim injury, and victim preference. Three of the seven variables were statistically significant—discrepancy, resistance, and victim preference (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212453867">Table 3</xref> for results and model fit statistics)—and in the same direction noted in the bivariate analysis. Cases in which discrepancies were noted were significantly more likely to result in the arrest of the suspect; the odds that a case resulted in an arrest increased twofold when there were discrepancies noted in the case file. Although the direction of this relationship was unexpected, this finding may be a byproduct of the investigation process. Qualitative review of the data indicates that there were many instances in which the suspect interviews resulted in police officers questioning the accuracy or completeness of victim statements. Victim resistance was also associated with the arrest decision. The odds that a case resulted in an arrest increased over twofold when the victim had reported that she resisted the attack. In other words, if the victim resisted, the suspect was more likely to be arrested. Finally, the odds that a case would result in an arrest decreased by 88% if the victim was uncooperative as compared to when the victim agreed to cooperate. Thus, officers were more likely to make arrests when victims were willing participants in the investigation. Cases in which victims would not return phone calls or stated explicitly they did not want to participate were thus less likely to end in the arrest of the suspect.</p>

<p>The next model—felony approval decision—included the six variables significantly related to the dependent variable at the bivariate level: victim character, weapon present, time reported, victim/suspect relationship, victim discrepancy, and victim injury (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801212453867">Table 4</xref> for results and model fit statistics). The analysis revealed that three variables were statistically significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level—victim/suspect relationship, victim discrepancy, and victim injury—and in the same direction noted in the bivariate analysis. In terms of victim/suspect relationship, the odds of cases being approved for felony charges by prosecutors decreased by 98% if the cases involved intimate partners as compared to cases involving strangers. Thus, prosecutors were less likely to approve felony charges when the cases involved intimate partners. Additionally, the odds of cases being approved for felony charges decreased by 90% if there were noted discrepancies in victim statements. Any discrepancies in victim statements meant a greater likelihood that felony charges would not be approved, indicating that prosecutors were cautious of cases in which the victims’ truthfulness could be questioned. Finally, if the victim was injured the odds that the prosecutor approved felony charges increased eightfold. In other words, prosecutors were much more likely to approve felony charges if the victim sustained injuries than if no injuries were present. Injuries to the victim likely signify the seriousness of the case and evidence the crime occurred.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, this study indicates that there continues to be a high attrition rate in the handling of sexual assault cases. This study examined decisions related to 465 sexual assault cases reported to a large Midwestern police department in 2003. Although a vast majority of cases were founded by officers (90.5%), only 35.2% of the founded cases resulted in an arrest. Thus, the arrest stage represented the first point in the process in which the progress of a large number of sexual assault cases was halted. The second point was the prosecutor’s decision to approve felony charges. Although the majority of those cases that resulted in arrest were presented to the prosecution for felony charges (79.5%), only 39.1% of those presented resulted in felony charges being approved by the prosecutor’s office. Taken as a whole, only 45 (9.7%) of the 465 cases analyzed for this study resulted in the prosecutor’s office approving felony charges. The extremely low number of cases that resulted in felony charges highlights the fact that many victims never get justice for their victimizations and that many offenders are not held accountable for their behaviors.</p>
<p>The overall attrition rate noted for this study (9.7%) is much higher than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier and Haney (1996)</xref>, the most recent study that examined case decision-making from police reporting to charging.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077801212453867">5</xref></sup> When examining each decision-making point, the largest differences occurred at the referral and charging stages. Similar to this study, the sample of cases analyzed by Frazier and Haney were drawn from reports made to a large police department in the Midwest. In that study, 569 cases were analyzed. Police were able to identify the assailants in 48% of the cases and had questioned the assailant in 32.9% (187) of the 569 cases. Of the 187 cases in which the suspect was questioned, 67.9% (127) of the cases were referred to the prosecutor. About 71% (91) of cases referred to the prosecutor were charged. Overall, this meant that 91 of the 569 cases, or 16.0% of cases, resulted in charges. In this study, 35.2% of cases resulted in an arrest. This figure was similar to the 32.9% of cases in which suspects were questioned in the Frazier and Haney sample. However, in this study a greater number of cases were referred to the prosecutor for felony charges (79.5% vs. 67.9%, respectively). This may indicate that officers handling cases in this study’s sample were more proactive in contacting the prosecutor’s office and were less likely to refer ideal cases. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that a large percentage of cases referred to the prosecutor’s office in the Frazier and Haney sample were charged (71.7%), while only 39.1% of cases referred to the prosecutor’s office in this study resulted in charges. However, the data may also suggest that although police were more willing to present the case to the prosecutor’s office, the prosecutor’s office overseeing cases in this study’s jurisdiction was even more conservative in charging cases.</p>
<p>In addition to a higher attrition rate, the present study also found different factors influencing decision-making than those identified in prior research. Past research indicates that police officers and prosecutors use both legal and extralegal factors when making decisions about sexual assault cases. In contrast, this study found that most of the factors that significantly predicted whether cases were founded, resulted in arrest, were presented to the prosecution, or resulted in felony charges were extralegal in nature. In other words, factors that mattered most were those that should not matter when determining if a crime occurred. For instance, only one factor was significantly related to police officer founding decisions: discrepancies in victim statements. Consistent with past research, concerns regarding victim truthfulness were significantly related to whether police officers unfounded cases. One task of police officers is to determine whether cases reported actually occurred. The purpose of this task is to weed out cases that are not actual crimes. Therefore, it is not surprising that a key consideration used by police officers to determine whether a crime occurred was the credibility of the victim, with cases involving discrepancies in victim accounts being more likely to result in officers questioning the legitimacy of victim claims. However, this may also indicate that officers unduly scrutinized victim statements because of the common belief that many rape victims lie about being assaulted.</p>
<p>This analysis did not find, however, that victim preference was associated with officer founding decisions, nor was the founding decision related to victim character, both findings reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453867">Kerstetter, 1990</xref>). When comparing these findings to prior research, it appears that although today police officers may be less willing to unfound sexual assault cases simply because victims were uncooperative with the investigation or because they uncover information related to the victims’ moral character or risk-taking activities, they continue to be skeptical of claims of sexual assault, particularly when they perceive victims as being untruthful or deceptive.</p>
<p>The results also indicated that three variables were significantly related to arrest decisions. One of these variables was consistent with past research: victim preference. When victims were willing to cooperate with the investigation, the case was more likely to result in arrest. This finding is consistent with that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree (1989)</xref> and others. Moreover, the finding that only victim preference was significantly related to police decision to present the case to the prosecution reinforces the importance of victim participation. It should not be concluded, however, that officers are simply doing what victims want. Although victim refusal to participate may be based on the victim’s own preference, research indicates that some police officers may stress negative consequences for the victim in criminal court proceedings in an attempt to dissuade victims from wanting to press charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212453867">Kerstetter &amp; Van Winkle, 1990</xref>). Other factors significant in past research, such as the presence of a weapon, the victim/suspect relationship, victim character, and the time between incident and reporting, were not significantly related to the arrest decision.</p>
<p>There were also two other notable findings for the arrest decision outcome. First, discrepancies in victim statements were associated with an increased likelihood of arrest. As noted, although the direction of this relationship was unexpected, this finding may be a byproduct of the investigation process. Qualitative review of the data indicates that there were many instances in which the suspect interviews resulted in police officers questioning the accuracy or completeness of victim statements. For instance, the victim may not have initially disclosed that she was drinking or using drugs at the time of the incident. However, this information was later revealed once the suspect indicated to police officers that the victim had been drinking or using drugs and the victim was later confronted. Victims are often unwilling to disclose information, such as alcohol and drug use or prostitution activities, because of concerns that police officers may not take their cases seriously or blame the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212453867">Jordan, 2004</xref>). Such concerns are not unfounded. Research clearly indicates that drinking or drug use prior to an assault is associated with victim self-blame and perceptions of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212453867">Littleton, Grills-Taquechel, &amp; Axsom, 2009</xref>) as well as blame from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212453867">Stormo, Lang, &amp; Stritzke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212453867">Wenger &amp; Bornstein, 2006</xref>). In fact, at least one study has found that police officers were less likely to view the victim as credible if she had been intoxicated at the time of assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212453867">Schuller &amp; Stewart, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, it appears that victims’ unwillingness to disclose information that they believe could be used by police officers or prosecutors to blame or discredit them may inadvertently result in victims losing credibility when the information is later disclosed, particularly when disclosure occurs during suspect interviews. Thus, it is probable that one reason why there is a positive relationship between victim discrepancy and likelihood of arrest is because of the order of occurrence in which discrepancies in the victim statements were noted. For instance, after the arrest and interview of the suspect, officers may conduct additional questioning of the victim if the suspect’s version of the incident is different from the victim’s account. During this subsequent interview, the victim may confirm some, but not necessarily all, of the suspect’s claims. In this situation, officers would have noted in the case file that the victim’s story changed.</p>
<p>Another reason that discrepancies in victim statements were associated with a greater likelihood of arrest could be that officers are willing to make an arrest despite concerns about victim truthfulness. The requirement for making an arrest is probable cause, a reasonable belief that the suspect committed the crime. Thus, officers may reasonably believe that they have the right person even if they do not completely believe everything the victim stated. Additionally, because this study noted discrepancies in victim statements, which could have occurred any time during the investigation, it is possible that although officers noted discrepancies in statements these officers eventually felt the victims were telling the truth.</p>
<p>Second, the results also indicated that victim resistance was associated with a greater likelihood of arrest. This finding suggests that officers took more seriously those cases in which the victim reported confrontation with the suspect. Victim resistance may imply to police officers that the victim did not consent to sexual contact. Although in the jurisdiction studied proving lack of consent is not legally required according to state statute for an incident to be considered sexual assault, officers may still believe proving lack of consent is important. Past research has shown that some officers still identify consent as a legal requirement although the consent requirement has been removed from the legal definition of sexual assault in certain jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212453867">Campbell &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>). Moreover, these cases may appear to officers to be more legitimate and more likely to withstand scrutiny from prosecutors. Thus, although laws have been revised to eliminate the consent requirement, evidence that proves the lack of consent may still be used by police officers when determining whether there is enough evidence for probable cause to arrest or to successfully charge suspects.</p>
<p>With regard to officer decisions to contact prosecutors for felony approval of charges, the analyses revealed that only one factor was significantly related to officer decision-making: victim willingness to cooperate with the investigation and prosecution. This finding is consistent with that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier and Haney (1996)</xref>. This finding is not surprising given that in cases involving one suspect and one victim (e.g., “he said, she said” cases), the victim is often the only available witness to the crime. In this study, only 16 cases of the 146 that were presented to the prosecution involved a third-party witness. Officers likely do not want to continue working on cases or present cases to the prosecution in which the only witness to the crime (i.e., the victim) decides not to participate. Court hearings to determine probable cause and decisions regarding guilt—reasonable doubt—are predicated on the ability to present enough evidence that a crime occurred and the alleged suspect committed that crime. Lack of witnesses to the crime affects officer and prosecutor ability to present evidence that a crime occurred.</p>
<p>The results of this study clearly indicate that officers considered victim preference when making decisions to arrest and refer cases to the prosecution. But what does this significance mean for sexual assault case outcomes? One could merely interpret the findings as suggesting that officers are considering victim preferences. However, such a conclusion ignores the fact that victims may be making choices based on their own stereotypes of what constitutes sexual assault. Research has found that for some victims their decisions to participate in the investigation and prosecution of their assaults are based on their own perceptions of whether their assaults reflect “real” rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212453867">Estrich, 1987</xref>). At least one study has found that victims are more likely to pursue charges if there was a weapon used, the victim sustained injuries, and the offender was a stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212453867">Alderden, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these factors suggest that some victims only continue to cooperate with the investigation in stereotypical rape scenarios—that is, cases involving strangers, weapons, and injury. Thus, legal and extralegal factors, the same types of factors that criminal justice practitioners may use to weed out cases, may also play a role in victim decision making—decisions that ultimately impact whether officers are willing to arrest and refer cases to the prosecution. Some research also indicates that victim decisions to pursue the case may be influenced by investigating officers. Based on interviews and observations of police officers handling sexual assault cases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212453867">Kerstetter and Van Winkle (1990)</xref> found that some officers stress negative consequences for the victim in criminal court proceedings in an attempt to dissuade victims from wanting to press charges. Officers may encourage victims to opt out of prosecuting suspects when officers do not believe seeking prosecution will be successful. Officer beliefs about whether the case will be successful were based on case characteristics that officers believed made prosecution difficult. Such factors included witness availability, presence of a weapon, victim resistance, and evidence. These findings are further supported through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212453867">Konradi’s (2007)</xref> interviews with sexual assault victims. She found that victims often felt that criminal justice practitioners were trying to persuade them to either pursue or not pursue their cases, although not all women were easily convinced.</p>
<p>Victim decisions to not participate may also reflect survival strategies. These victims may disengage from the process for different reasons. Such reasons include believing that their cases are not worthy of proceeding, continued involvement will not result in personal benefit, or the system will not protect them from their offenders, all of which past research indicates are reasons why women may not report their cases to authorities in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212453867">Patterson, Greeson, &amp; Campbell, 2009</xref>). Research also indicates that some victims have negative experiences when reporting their assaults to formal service agencies like the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453867">Ahrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212453867">Ullman, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212453867">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212453867">Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2001</xref>). Such negative reactions (e.g., being blamed or disbelieved) may make women less willing to continue participating in their cases. It should be noted that it is not being suggested that victim preferences should be ignored when making case decisions, particularly because these decisions may be made in an attempt at self-preservation. Rather, these findings indicate the complexity of case decision-making. Factors that were insignificant in police decisions in the analyses conducted here—such as victim/offender relationship, the use of a weapon, and victim injury—do not necessarily prove those factors do not matter. As the data indicate, these factors could matter as victims decide whether to continue with the case or when criminal justice practitioners encourage or discourage participation.</p>
<p>With regard to the decisions by the prosecutor to approve felony charges, the results indicate that factors that reflect the seriousness of the case (e.g., victim injury) and factors that reflect the truthfulness of the victim (e.g., discrepancy in victim statements) were positively associated with the decision to approve felony charges. This finding supports other research showing that prosecutorial concerns about the convictability of sexual assault cases may result in prosecutors focusing on the reliability and credibility of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453867">Frohmann, 1997</xref>). Additionally, victim character was marginally significant and in the direction expected: Cases involving victims portrayed as having questionable moral character or who had been engaged in risk-taking behaviors were less likely to result in felony charges. However, the fact that this variable was no longer significant once other factors were controlled for in the multivariate model suggests that this factor is less important than others.</p>
<p>Also consistent with past research was the finding that cases involving strangers were more likely to result in felony charges. This suggests that prosecutors continue to be wary of cases involving individuals close to victims because suspects may be able to provide alternative explanations to the assault (e.g., victim seeking revenge) or because prosecutors may be concerned about the victim’s willingness to cooperate with the case.</p>
<p>Finally, race and ethnicity of either the suspect or victim were not significant at any of the decision points examined. Unlike prior studies examining sexual assault decision-making, race/ethnicity did not play a role in practitioner decisions. This finding is encouraging given that racial and ethnic discrimination continue to plague the criminal justice system. However, the data also indicate that a greater proportion of black victims were reporting their victimizations to the police than their representation in the population would suggest. Black residents accounted for only 37% of the population in this jurisdiction in 2003. To ensure that no biases were present in the sample used for this study, the authors examined official data publicly available through the police department’s annual reports. Review of these reports indicated that the racial/ethnic composition of the sample used for this study was consistent with that reported in data publicly available. Black victims represented 68% of sexual assault victims reported to this police department in 2003. In fact, they were overrepresented as victims across all violent index crimes reported to police—murder, sexual assault, robbery, and assault—ranging between 57% and 72% of all victims.</p>
<p>There are different ways to interpret this finding. First, it is possible that White and Hispanic women were less likely than Black women to report their assaults to police in the jurisdiction studied. Past research on women’s disclosure practices indicate that there are several reasons why sexual assault victims may not disclose their victimization experiences. For instance, it is recognized that some women may not realize that they have been victimized and, therefore, do not report their sexual assaults to the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212453867">Koss, Dinero, Seibel, &amp; Cox, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212453867">Peacock, 1998</xref>). These women may not identify their experiences as sexual assaults if the perpetrator is someone known to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212453867">Koss et al., 1988</xref>) or is a romantic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212453867">Kohn, Jackson, Kully, Badger, &amp; Halvorsen, 2003</xref>). Women also may not define themselves as victims based on reactions of others when they disclosed their assaults. For instance, friends or family members may not view the incident as sexual assault, and this opinion may influence the victim’s own interpretation of the incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212453867">Konradi, 2007</xref>). Additionally, women who are in relationships with their abusers may not report their sexual assaults in order to preserve their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212453867">Heckert &amp; Gondolf, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212453867">Rennison (2002)</xref> indicated that 9.9% of attempted rape victims reported that they did not report their rapes to the police to protect the offender. There is also evidence suggesting that women may choose not to report their sexual assaults because victims believe the police are biased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212453867">Rennison (2002)</xref> found that 5.8% of rape victims who did not report their assaults to the police did not do so because they perceived the police as biased. However, these factors also likely impact Black women’s decisions to report to the police, too. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212453867">Garfield’s (2005)</xref> research examining black women’s experiences with violence indicates that some women may not identify themselves as victims. To some, victims may be persons who are helpless or exploited. Some Black women, however, may not see themselves as victims because they were able to “handle” the situation (therefore, not self-identifying with the helpless victim) or because they willingly entered relationships with their abusers. Moreover, research indicates that many Black women do not disclose their victimizations to others because of their dedication and desire to maintain their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212453867">Garfield, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212453867">Richie, 1996</xref>). Other research involving Black women and girls indicates that protection of Black men can at times result in Black women feeling unable to report their victimizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212453867">Richie, 1996</xref>). Finally, there continues to be a lot of distrust between the Black community and police, which may result in Black women being unwilling to report their victimizations.</p>
<p>Second, it is possible that Black women were more likely than White and Hispanic women to report their victimizations to police in the jurisdiction studied. If this is indeed true, it is unknown why it is occurring. Although the police department in this jurisdiction has a large number of Black officers (25.8% of all officers), it is unknown whether this would impact victim decisions to report. Moreover, there continues to be a lot of distrust between the Black community and the police agency in the jurisdiction studied here. It makes sense that this lack of trust would result in Black women being less likely to report their victimizations than White or Hispanic women.</p>
<p>Third, it is possible that Black women were experiencing higher rates of victimization in the jurisdiction studied. Victimization rates based on the National Crime Victimization Survey indicate that Blacks reported more rape or sexual assault victimization in 2008 than Whites and all other races combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212453867">Rand, 2009</xref>); however, the differences were not nearly as extreme as indicated in this study. It is also possible that the high rate of victimization noted across all the index crimes points to the conclusion that Blacks are at particular risk for violent victimization in this jurisdiction. It is possible that this higher rate of victimization is a byproduct of racial and economic segregation. Past studies of women’s victimization indicate that poverty is associated with increased likelihood of violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453867">Benson, Fox, DeMaris, &amp; Van Wyk, 2003</xref>). In this jurisdiction, neighborhoods are segregated, both racially and socioeconomically. Because extreme poverty in the jurisdiction studied is often occurring in predominately Black neighborhoods, women’s victimization may be an extension of poor economic conditions.</p>
<p>If indeed victimization rates for black women are as high as noted in this study, there are potentially serious implications for Black women living in this jurisdiction, because sexual victimization can have long-lasting, negative consequences. Specifically, many sexual assault victims experience distress following their assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212453867">Resick, 1987</xref>). The types of distress include elevated fear, anxiety, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212453867">George, Winfield, &amp; Blazer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212453867">Kilpatrick, Sanders, Veronen, Best, &amp; Von, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212453867">Resick, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453867">Ullman &amp; Brecklin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077801212453867">Wyatt, 1992</xref>). Many sexual assault victims have also been found to meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder following their victimizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453867">Freedy, Resnick, Kilpatrick, Dansky, &amp; Tidwell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212453867">Kilpatrick &amp; Acierno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212453867">Kilpatrick et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453867">Ullman &amp; Brecklin, 2002</xref>). Victims of sexual assault also report experiencing anger, lowered self-esteem, feelings of guilt, less interest in sexual relationships, and trouble sleeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212453867">George et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212453867">Sorenson &amp; Siegel, 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, without victimization surveys to conclusively determine the rate at which women experience sexual assault, it is difficult to conclude whether the higher rates of sexual assault involving Black persons reflected in the official police data reflect differences in incidence or reporting decisions. Future research is needed to examine this issue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to replicate and expand past research that has examined factors predictive of sexual assault outcomes. In particular, this study sought to determine whether past findings held consistent using more recent data. Like prior studies, this study focused on victim, suspect, and incident characteristics that have been found to be predictive of decisions made regarding whether cases move forward through the criminal justice system. Specifically, this study examined whether various factors were used to determine whether a sexual assault incident was deemed legitimate by police officers (i.e., whether the case was founded/unfounded), if the case resulted in an arrest, if the case was presented to the prosecution for charging, and if the prosecutor approved charges.</p>
<p>Similar to other studies examining predictors of sexual assault case outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453867">Beichner &amp; Spohn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453867">Chandler &amp; Torney, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453867">Frazier &amp; Haney, 1996</xref>; Horney &amp; Spohn, 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453867">Kerstetter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212453867">Kingsnorth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453867">LaFree, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453867">Spohn et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212453867">Spears &amp; Spohn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453867">Spohn &amp; Spears, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212453867">Williams, 1981</xref>), this study relied on secondary data sources. Although all of the data examined were collected and documented as part of the case building process and were documented with the consideration that such information could ultimately be submitted as evidence during court proceedings, the data reflect the documentation of information that was deemed important by the persons working the cases. Moreover, the information reflects practitioners’ recollections and interpretations of various case-specific elements, including the victim and suspect statements. Access to actual victim and suspect statements may provide a more accurate understanding of what information is documented as part of the case building process and the implications of selective documentation. This information would allow researchers to better understand how criminal justice practitioners ultimately construct sexual assault cases. Additionally, future research in this area must include prospective data collection to assess in greater detail how cases move through the system from sources other than those created by criminal justice practitioners. In-depth interviews with victims, suspects, officers, prosecutors, other criminal justice practitioners (e.g., judges, defense attorneys) or service providers (e.g., hospital staff and rape advocates) would also provide additional information as to how cases are constructed and case processing decisions are made.</p>
<p>Further research is also needed to better understand whether and how sexual assault cases and victims are unduly scrutinized as compared to other types of violent crimes, such as robbery, and what factors are particularly discriminating. Several factors found significant in this study could also be used by police officers and prosecutors when making processing decisions for robbery cases, including victim discrepancy and victim/suspect relationship. However, without data on how officers processed robbery cases it is unknown whether victim discrepancy, for instance, plays a more critical role in determining the legitimacy of sexual assault cases as compared to robbery cases. Future research is needed to address this issue.</p>

<p>It is unknown whether recanting by victims was truly a reflection of their perceptions of the incident or if this was influenced by others, including officers, friends, or family members.
