<abstract>
<p>Although the core symptoms of depression appear uniform across cultures, their presentations might vary from one culture to another. This interview study was part of a project to establish whether cognitive behavior therapy could be effective for the treatment of depression in a developing country. We interviewed outpatients from a university teaching hospital in Pakistan who were diagnosed as having depression. We tried to elicit their knowledge and perceptions of depression, its causes, and treatments, and their views about nonpharmacological treatments. We discovered that patients had very little knowledge of mental illnesses in general, and depression in particular. They believed that mental health problems were the result of stress or trauma, and that only medicines could help them. Patients had no knowledge of the roles of psychologists or psychotherapy. Their model of understanding mental illnesses appeared to represent a psychosocial understanding, with physical symptoms being their main concern.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that depressive illness has significant cultural variation in clinical presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312450212">Manson, 1995</xref>), although the core symptoms of depressive illness might be similar across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312450212">Sartorius, 1983</xref>). Culture is known to “shape psychosocial distress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312450212">Fechner, 2010</xref>, p. 406), and thereby impacts on the patient experience and any related physical illness. In developing countries, major depressive illness is projected to be the leading cause of disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312450212">Murray &amp; Lopez, 1997</xref>). Research so far seems to have been focused on presenting complaints, diagnosis, and prevalence of depressive illness in these cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312450212">Gupta, Singh, Verma, &amp; Garg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312450212">Kleinman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312450212">Nakane et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312450212">Noppon, Limsuwan, &amp; Kuesirikul, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312450212">Radford, Nakane, Ohta, Mann, &amp; Kalucy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312450212">Zheng, Wei, Goa, Zhang, &amp; Wong, 1988</xref>). Patients’ help-seeking behaviors are influenced by their knowledge of illness and their beliefs about its treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312450212">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312450212">Kleinman, 1992</xref>). To develop effective strategies for the treatment of depressive illness, it is important to understand a patient’s frame of reference. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312450212">Cooper et al.’s (2003)</xref> study in the United States revealed that African Americans and Hispanics were less likely than White persons to find antidepressant medication acceptable, whereas Hispanics were more likely to accept counseling. The authors also reported that although racial and ethnic differences in beliefs about treatment modalities were found, they did not explain differences in the acceptability of depressive illness treatment.</p>
<p>In a literature review, we could find reports on only a few qualitative studies of depressive illness conducted in the developing world that explored the depressed patients’ experience. The authors of one such study of depressed patients’ conceptualizations of illness and its impact on help seeking reported that somatization of emotional problems, variations in causal attribution between patients and their significant others, the nature of the available health care system, and the burden of infectious disease complicated access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312450212">Okello &amp; Neema, 2007</xref>). A study from Brazil focusing on depressed women showed that depressive illness was inextricably woven with their violent and downtrodden daily lives, as well as with other sources of suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312450212">Martin, de Jesus Mari, &amp; Quirino, 2007</xref>). The local community identified two types of depressive illness: “true” and “false,” suggesting a concept enmeshed with morality. Similarly, authors of a qualitative study in Dubai using focus groups reported that the key symptoms of depressive illness were social withdrawal, feeling afraid, irritability, loss of sleep, loss of appetite, sadness, crying, excessive thinking, feeling bored, and loss of interest in sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312450212">Sulaiman, Bhugra, &amp; de Silva, 2001</xref>). The causes of depressive illness were found to include stresses in the family and society, relationships, lack of support, marital conflicts, and problems with children. The most effective coping strategies identified were going to religious places and talking to religious professionals.</p>
<p>The term <italic>depressive illness</italic> is absent from the languages of many cultures, and is used rarely in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312450212">Hamdi, Amin, &amp; Abou-Saleh, 1997</xref>) or is construed differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312450212">Abusah, 1993</xref>). Bhugra and Mastrogianni noted the agreement among researchers that “each culture has its own emotional lexicon that encodes socially and morally significant values and its own idioms of distress—cultural ways of talking about distress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312450212">2004</xref>, p. 16). These observations are very important from the diagnostic and treatment point of view. In any case, the clinician’s ability to understand these local idioms is crucial not only for accurate diagnosis, but also for the building of a therapeutic alliance (Bhugra &amp; Mastrogianni). Understanding the culturally appropriate expressions of distress is even more important when providing psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Another cultural factor is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312450212">Pande’s (1968)</xref> argument that Asian societies are more relationship-centered when compared to those of the West, which are work- and activity-centered. This means that therapy might need to involve family members. In relationship-centered cultures, people might behave, think, and feel in communion with the family rather than as individuals. Similarly, they might focus on the needs, rules, aspirations, and dreams of the family rather than on their own. Another feature of most Asian cultures is the importance of social hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312450212">Laungani, 2004</xref>). These can be based on caste, sect, race, language, or even color, which certainly means conferring certain advantages and disadvantages to people from some groups. Hence, family engagement and the impact of social hierarchies might shape the processes and impact of access, recruitment, participant disclosure, and response to treatment. Establishing the cultural factors that influence the experiences of clients and therapists with respect to depressive disorders is therefore crucial to determining the best treatment strategies for a given population.</p>
<p>This study formed part of a larger program of research comprising two aims. The first was to develop culturally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for United Kingdom residents with varied cultural and ethnic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312450212">Rathod, Naeem, Phiri, &amp; Kingdon, 2008</xref>). The second aim was to establish whether CBT that was culturally sensitive could be effective, accessible, and acceptable in the developing world, using Pakistan as an exemplar. Pakistan was selected because of the existing links and background of the first author, a practicing psychiatrist and CBT therapist.</p>
<p>The Pakistan project comprised a two-stage, mixed method project. In the first stage, we sought to establish those factors that should be addressed to ensure that a culturally sensitive CBT therapy, training program, and manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312450212">Naeem, Waheed, Gobbi, Ayub, &amp; Kingdon, 2011</xref>) were developed. The second stage was a clinical trial to evaluate the introduction of CBT using the adapted training, therapy, and manual. Here, we report and debate the findings from interviews with patients in the first stage of the project. In the interviews we tried to elicit what patients thought about their illness, its causes, treatments, and in particular, their views of psychotherapy and nonmedical therapies. The interview data were augmented by field notes from the first author during his period as a both a clinician and observer in Pakistan, and subsequently during the clinical trial.</p>
<p>Although very high rates of depressive illness have been reported in Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312450212">Mirza &amp; Jenkins, 2004</xref>), very little is known about patients’ views of depressive illness and their knowledge about its treatment. A literature search revealed no qualitative studies from Pakistan of patients’ knowledge and perceptions of depressive illness. The first author’s previous work in Pakistan had revealed that only a small number of doctors and medical and nonmedical students in a university in Lahore had some knowledge of depressive illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312450212">Javed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450212">Naeem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312450212">Naeem et al., 2006</xref>). In such an absence of information, gathering insights from patients was crucial.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312450212" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We chose qualitative interviews informed by an ethnographic perspective because they are particularly useful when little is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312450212">Morse &amp; Field, 1998</xref>). It is difficult to obtain data in other ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450212">Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, 2007</xref>) when the focus is on meanings and understandings in a social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312450212">Gerrish &amp; Lacey, 2010</xref>), and when some clients might have poor or absent literacy skills. We considered that the program was not ethnography in the classic sense, in that it did not involve prolonged periods of participant observation and did not fulfill the criteria for ethnography with respect to the data analysis strategies and methods. However, an ethnographic perspective or lens helpfully informed the way we approached the empirical work throughout the entire program of research. This meant the study was characterized by a period of acclimatization in the clinical field, naturalistic observations, interviews, field notes, reflexive writings, analytic notes, and an ongoing iterative analysis between the data and fieldwork activities.</p>
<p>As we demonstrate, the clinical practitioner observations in Pakistan triangulate data obtained through the interviews with patients. Specifically, the ethnographic perspective enabled us to acquire an understanding of depressive illness from the patients’ points of view, attending to their specific cultural setting. This was crucial given that the patients were living in a different culture from that of the authors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450212">Hammersley and Atkinson’s (2007)</xref> central assumption of ethnography was applied here, namely in the context of the participants’ illness, culture, and situated knowledge. We needed to understand what the patients were doing and why so we could understand their behaviors in context. It was important to understand the meanings patients attributed to their illness and its cause: how they interpreted and evaluated the situations they faced, and in the subsequent clinical trial, how their identities were constructed by their illness. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312450212">Spradley (1980)</xref>, we wanted to understand how they “see their experience” of mental illness/depression, to learn from them rather than just study them. However, as clinical researchers, we were also interested in their thoughts, and thus we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312450212">Miller and Crabtree (2003)</xref> that we needed to be free to mix and match methods driven by our particular clinically based questions.</p>
<p>First, it was necessary to ascertain whether CBT required adaption for patients in Pakistan. We needed to understand whether patients’ knowledge and experiences of depression/mental illness were culturally different from the clinical and documented experiences of those with depression who had been treated in the West. We sought to explore how people diagnosed with depressive illness in Pakistan conceptualized their illness and what they knew about its causes, management, and treatments—especially their knowledge of nonpharmacological treatments. From this knowledge we could address the central question: What do patients know about (and if they do, what do they think about) nonpharmacological interventions for depressive illness—especially cognitive behavioral therapy?</p>
<p>In summary, the main aims of the patient interviews were to (a) ascertain patients’ knowledge concerning mental illnesses in general and depressive illness in particular; (b) establish their knowledge and expectations concerning the health care system; and (c) ascertain their perceptions of the treatments they had received, and especially any nonpharmacological treatments.</p>
<p>Initially we used informal, open-ended interviews to elicit as much narrative and descriptive information as possible from the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312450212">Kvale, 1996</xref>). In the ethnographic spirit, we had not intended to have a structured interview schedule, but rather to identify areas we intended to cover, with questions being flexibly adapted to the individual patient and information being gathered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312450212">Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, 2007</xref>). However, this proved problematic because the first four patients who volunteered had either no knowledge or very little knowledge about mental illness or its treatment. They responded with virtually nothing to say as a consequence. For example, when they were asked, “What do you think can cause depression?” they replied simply, “[I] do not know.” Despite further inquiry, only one patient added information, remarking that it could be “because of problems in life.”</p>
<p>We critically reflected on this apparent lack of response to ascertain whether it was the conduct of the interviews that had somehow inhibited the participants. However, following discussion, we were confident that the first author’s experience as a practicing clinical psychiatrist with advanced interview skills had not provoked the problem, despite the fact that he was unable to elicit nothing more than monosyllabic responses from these first patients. We were mindful that clinical discernment was necessary when interviewing the patients because of their active clinical depression; the interview needed to cause no harm.</p>
<p>We wondered whether the participants’ lack of dialogue was because of local cultural values. The first author’s field notes recorded that generally speaking, patients were not encouraged to ask questions or express themselves, and perhaps, therefore, they might not have had the confidence to express their views to someone perceived as being from another social stratum. Another perspective was that patients might not have had sufficient language to express themselves, as considered in these contemporaneous clinical field notes:
<disp-quote><p>I also noticed within the first few days that there are no local translations for simple questions, for example, “How is your mood? How is your energy? Do you enjoy anything these days?” So it is not possible to ask open ended questions, for most disorders.</p><p>There is no word in Urdu or any other local languages which describes “assertiveness.”</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In light of this experience, we decided to depart from the more classic ethnographic approach and try an informal, more structured and guiding style, using a range of prompts and encouraging talk, although trying to employ an open-ended style when possible. We used probes and asked questions that would elicit information concerning the patients’</p>

</list>
<p>It is important to note that although these cues were expressed in Urdu language, interviews typically began with an introduction of the study, an attempt to make patients comfortable, and reminding them that the interview was not going to affect their treatment in any way. As the findings demonstrate, although the patients did not provide expansive responses, they did respond to these more explicit cues, offering their understandings of their illnesses and modes of treatment.</p>
<p>Several strategies were employed for quality assurance by maintaining an audit trail to demonstrate rigor and credibility. First, field notes and a research diary were documented to note the research decisions and the emergence of ideas and theories. When possible, data were triangulated between the observational field notes and clinical experiences of the first author. Data were subsequently compared with the interviews with psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450212">Naeem, Gobbi, Ayub, &amp; Kingdon, 2010</xref>). It was not appropriate to engage in member checking with the patients because several were illiterate and we had to be mindful of their clinical conditions. Team meetings and communications were characterized by critical discussions to check for tacit bias, underlying assumptions, and data authenticity, and to ground findings in the data. Independent interrogation of the processes, data collection, and analysis provided good reliability and ensured credibility of the findings.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312450212">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The patients were drawn from those attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of a teaching hospital in Rahim Yar Khan City in the south of Punjab, Pakistan. The area of Rahim Yar Khan City was about 22 square kilometers, with a population of around 330,000 in January 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312450212">Wikipedia, n.d.</xref>). The city had a university campus, medical college, and numerous private- and public-sector colleges. Patients from adjacent districts of three neighboring provinces traveled to this teaching hospital. Although most medical colleges and hospitals had a psychiatry department, the basic health units, which provided primary care to rural populations, did not have mental health professionals attached to them. Most departments of psychiatry were without an attached psychology department because clinical psychology was an underdeveloped discipline in Pakistan. Although universities provided master’s programs in psychology, these did not award clinical degrees. Most people were trilingual in Urdu, Punjabi, and Saraiki languages. Although the majority of residents were Muslim, a significant minority of Christians and Hindus also lived in the area.</p>
<p>We originally anticipated that about 6 to 10 patients would be needed to generate sufficient information to inform the adaptation of the CBT manual. We approached patients purposively to (a) learn from those suffering with depression who might be able to provide relevant information, and (b) exclude those with mental health problems other than depression and/or who were vulnerable clinically. To enable us to understand their experiences of mental health services, we were interested in patients who had attended at least three outpatient appointments. We asked the psychiatrists running the outpatient clinic to approach and then refer patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (i.e., a diagnosis of depressive illness; being age 18 years and older; and absence of symptoms of psychosis, drug or alcohol abuse, and mental retardation). The psychiatrists referred the first eligible patient they saw with depressive illness on the first day of the referral process, and then every third patient afterwards. We gave the referred patients information regarding the study; those who consented were invited to participate, and none declined. We took consent in both verbal and written forms. The first author assessed the patients using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450212">World Health Organization’s (1993)</xref> <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Research Diagnostic Criteria</italic> to confirm their diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312450212">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews lasting between 30 and 60 minutes were conducted in the outpatient clinic over a period of 16 weeks between October 2007 and January 2008. We conducted interviews in Urdu, and tape recorded them. We also took notes of any crucial or interesting points raised. Each interview was subsequently transcribed and translated into English. Data collection and analysis were performed concurrently, and recruitment ceased when no new information relevant to the development of CBT emerged (after 9 participants). The transcripts were read repeatedly and generic analysis was undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312450212">Creswell, 2008</xref>). Generic analysis differs from ethnographic analysis in that in generic analysis, data are collected, analyzed for themes or perspectives, and key themes are reported. In ethnographic analysis, detailed descriptions of the setting or individuals are generated and the texts produced are handled according to whether the researcher is seeking a naturalistic or interpretive account. Field notes and detailed descriptions of the settings were produced to contextualize the interviews, provide analytic insights, and inform the development of the CBT manual and therapy strategies. Thus, Naeem noted,
<disp-quote><p>I was sitting with Dr. E, a psychiatrist who was conducting an outpatient clinic. He was seeing a young man with schizophrenia for a follow up appointment. His mother asked him to do a dam [reading some verses of Quran and blowing air on the person], which he did. He later explained this is a common practice. Some psychiatrists advise patients to say prayers or even write advice on the back of their prescriptions.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Interview data were coded and the main themes elicited with respect to the guiding questions. The data from each interview were compared and contrasted, and following coding, the codes were grouped as the main themes emerged. As implied by this design, the analysis was intended to be descriptive and involved minimal interpretation of the data. To ensure credibility in the analysis, two other United Kingdom-based team members independently coded the translated English transcripts and compared them with those identified by the first author. During this validation process, no alterations or additions to the main themes originally identified were considered necessary. In addition, Ayub checked the translation and conducted back translation with the Urdu transcripts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312450212">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>Each patient gave consent to participate, both in writing and verbally. For those patients who were not educated and had difficulty reading, understanding and consent were confirmed through the relative who was accompanying the patient. Approval was granted by the local ethics committee in Pakistan (Sheikh Zayed Medical College, Rahim Yar Khan). The larger program of research had been approved by the local United Kingdom National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. Confidentiality was assured for the patients, and they were informed that participation would not influence their treatment in any way. Sensitivity to the cultural beliefs and values of the patients was an intrinsic feature of the fieldwork. This was pragmatically achieved by the first author’s personal background and ability to understand the religious and culture norms from which the patients originated. In addition, each member of the research team had significant experience operating in cultures other than their own, and shared a common value commitment to being respectful and adaptable to local values and beliefs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312450212">
<title>Participants’ Characteristics</title>
<p>The backgrounds of the 9 participating patients revealed the diversity of the patient population. For example, patient ages ranged from 18 to 60 years, with 3 men in the sample. One patient had 14 years of education, and 3 patients had no formal schooling (all women, aged 22, 35, and 60 years). Among the educated patients, 2 had 5 years of education, whereas 3 had 10 or more years of education. Eight patients were married. Four lived in rural areas, whereas the others came from urban areas. Four were local residents, whereas the rest came from other cities; some had traveled a significant distance to the clinic. Their history of illness ranged between 25 days and 3 years, with 2 experiencing 6 and 10 years of illness, respectively. Six patients had one prior episode of the illness. Only 3 of these said they had been treated for depressive illness in the past, and all were treated by doctors in primary or secondary care. Each patient who met the criteria for depressive illness according to the <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312450212">World Health Organization, 1993</xref>) also suffered with significant anxiety symptoms.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732312450212">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Four main themes emerged from the data; namely issues related to (a) patient perceptions of depressive illness and its impact on their lives, and associated with this, (b) their model of causes of depressive illness, (c) their modes of referral for help, and (d) their knowledge and experience concerning treatment of depressive illness. General information regarding their knowledge and perceptions of mental illness and its treatments proved to be similar to their knowledge concerning depressive illness.</p>

<p>Patients mostly described physical symptoms as affecting their lives and leading them to seek treatment; for example, headache, pains in the body, sleep disturbances, vertigo, weakness, numbness of arms, breathlessness, palpitations, restlessness, and fatigue. Other complaints included crying, anger, and sadness. Only one patient described sadness as his or her primary concern, and only 3 patients did not complain of any sadness. Headache was the most common complaint, and most often the first one described, as typified by a patient who said, “I get headache and vertigo. I also feel weak. My arms feel numb. I feel tired, but I cannot sleep properly at night or during the day.”</p>
<p>When patients were asked what kind of illness they had, they did not use any specific name for the illness, and invariably described it as “some sort of physical illness.” They typically used expressions like “weakness of brain or illness of brain,” “physical illness,” “illness of suffocation,” “illness of poor sleep,” and “tension.” When asked specifically if they knew anything about depression, none of them recognized it as an illness. However, when patients were asked whether they had a physical illness or mental illness, most (6) replied that it was a mental illness. Only 1 patient thought he suffered from a physical illness; 2 believed they had both physical and mental illnesses. One patient remarked, “This is a mental illness which affects my thinking.” All patients admitted that the illness had affected their life; however, they kept performing their usual and specified life roles. They believed that their illness had affected their ability to work, but none of them reported stopping their usual duties or responsibilities. One woman remarked, “I feel weak all the time. It is difficult to do household chores. But I have to do it. If I do not look after my children and husband, who else will?”</p>

<title>A Psychosocial Model of Depressive Illness</title>
<p>When patients were asked about their knowledge and perceptions of mental illnesses in general, similar answers emerged. For example, whereas 3 patients reported that they did not know anything about mental illness, others defined them as illnesses because of “tensions and trauma,” “problems in the environment,” “thinking too much,” and “worries.” Once again, their definitions of mental illness were based on psychosocial causes, as comments from one patient illustrate: “Mental illnesses are the illnesses which are because of worries and trauma.”</p>
<p>The most striking thing about participant responses was the absence of names for mental illnesses. Most patients could name only one term, such as <italic>tension</italic>; other names offered included <italic>mental worry, illness of seizures</italic>, and <italic>worries</italic>. Only 1 patient used the term <italic>tension and depressive illness</italic>. When specifically asked if they had heard the term <italic>depressive illness</italic>, 8 participants said that they had not. When asked if there are different types of illnesses, all but 1 reported that they knew nothing about the types of mental illness. The only patient who described a classification of mental illness stated that there are two types of illnesses: neurotic illnesses and madness. Problems at work and home, thinking too much, and difficult circumstances were the commonly described causes of mental illnesses. One person said that trauma can cause mental illness. Another mentioned that mental illnesses can have genetic causes. Three of the patients did not know the reason for their illness; the rest described problems at home, at work, and social problems as the cause of the illness. Typical statements included: “It is . . . because of worries or because of thinking too much,” and “Mental illnesses are because of problems at home and at work. Problems which make you worry. Or other problems which make you worry.” One woman said she acquired her symptoms during the postnatal period, whereas another reported she had symptoms because of life events: “I have this illness because of the problems in my life. I think I had so many problems in my life that now I feel like this all the time.”</p>

<title>Referral to the Psychiatrist</title>
<p>In Pakistan, anyone can present themselves to any hospital, in any part of the country. Three patients referred themselves directly to a psychiatric service; 5 were referred by a relative. Only one of these relatives had experience of mental illness. None of the referrers had a link with the medical profession. The patient who had developed postpartum depression was referred by a gynecologist. Those who referred themselves to a psychiatric clinic could not offer an explanation as to why they had decided to go to that particular clinic. Probably the most confusing finding in the study was how these patients decided to go to psychiatric clinics, especially when their major complaints were those of physical symptoms and they attributed their illnesses to physical diseases. On further enquiry, one patient—who was referred by a relative—said, “Someone else with similar symptoms had benefited from the service and we thought I will also benefit from this treatment.”</p>

<sec id="section10-1049732312450212">
<title>Treatment of Depressive Illness and Mental Illness</title>
<p>The main aim of our inquiry was to ascertain patients’ ideas about the treatment of depressive illness. Seven of them believed that they could get better by taking medicine; one did not know what treatment would help him; and 2 said they should also get good tests for the brain. The following are examples of comments made by the participants about the use of medicine for treatment of depression:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant (P):</speaker>
<p>I should get good-quality medicines. I should get good tests of my brain.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by good-quality medicines?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>Good-quality medicines are the ones which are not necessarily expensive but can cure the illness.</p>
</speech>
<p>[A]nd whatever doctor tells me, or the tests he suggests or the good-quality medicines he prescribes. That will be the treatment. But I need some treatment that eradicates illness at its roots.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in the participants’ knowledge of nonmedical treatments. When asked about treatments apart from medical treatment, they all said they had not seen any other type of healer (faith healer, religious healer, practitioner of traditional Greek or Indian medicine, magician, or homeopath). Only one person acknowledged that she was using some other form of self-help treatment: “I have been prescribed medicines only by a doctor and that’s all. However, I read [a verse from Quran] and do dum [blowing air] on myself . . . and I say my prayers more regularly now.”</p>
<p>It is possible that participants felt they should not disclose their contact with healers outside the medical system rather than saying that they had no faith in alternative methods of healing. When asked directly about nonpharmacological treatments for depressive illness (e.g., counseling), only one patient admitted that he had heard about it. Like their understanding of depressive illness, apart from one patient, all the patients believed that mental illnesses are treated by medicines and can only be managed by doctors. The patient who had heard of psychotherapy had said previously that mental illnesses are treated only with medicines. Most patients were aware that psychiatrists are doctors. They were not aware of any other professionals involved in the care of the mentally ill (for example, psychologists); only one had heard of psychology as a profession. They all seemed to have strong faith in the abilities of doctors: “Only the doctor can give the best advice as to what type of treatment I should receive.”</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732312450212" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings primarily relate to the patients’ apparent lack of knowledge, and thus discourse, concerning the nature and causes of mental illness, and depressive illness in particular. It was noteworthy that initial attempts to use open-ended questions to elicit information and experiences from patients proved problematic. Patients appeared either reluctant to express their views or had no knowledge of mental health problems, and especially depression. They answered in monosyllables, usually just “Yes” or “No.” These findings are in line with our previous work in Pakistan, in which we surveyed medical and nonmedical university students, university teachers, and doctors from Lahore, Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450212">Naeem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312450212">Naeem, Gobbi, Ayub, &amp; Kingdon, 2009</xref>). More than half of the participants said they had not heard of an illness called depressive illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312450212">Naeem et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients seemed very careful when answering questions regarding treatment, and they were particularly guarded when talking about nonmedical treatments. We speculate that they might have been wary of saying something that they perceived might annoy their doctors, and/or they might have simply not had the language and experience necessary to be discursive about these topics. They might also have been reluctant to disclose any involvement with nonmedical healers. These findings reflect the challenges noted in cross-cultural work on depression discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312450212">Kokanovic et al. (2009)</xref>; namely that there might be difficulties in conceptualizing depression, struggles to find linguistic equivalents, and issues associated with translation and interpretation.</p>
<p>The second interview strategy, which involved a prepared list of more structured questions with cues and supplementary queries, was more successful and generated very useful information that helped us develop CBT for local use. For example, our acquired awareness of the patients’ language and discourse concerning their symptoms and attributions of the illness causation and treatment informed the way the manual and training for therapists were adapted.</p>
<p>It was clear that most patients in the study presented with somatic complaints. Somatic symptoms as presenting complaints have been frequently reported in the literature. Even core symptoms such as depressed mood or loss of interest might not be prominent in many cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312450212">Ustün, Ayuso-Mateos, Chatterji, Mathers, &amp; Murray, 2004</xref>). Although sadness of mood was described by a significant majority of patients, only 1 patient described it as the reason for presentation; headache seemed to be the main presenting complaint. Patients called their illness “illness of tension.” A few patients reported that it was a physical problem and possibly a brain disease. The word <italic>tension</italic> was commonly used by both Urdu and Punjabi speakers; even the less educated or uneducated participants employed this term. <italic>Mood</italic> was another commonly used word among both the educated and the uneducated, although <italic>mood</italic> was used in a slightly different way: “He has a mood” means he has a labile mood.</p>
<p>One patient called his illness the “illness of suffocation.” It was obvious that patients focused more on anxiety symptoms (and their associated somatic complaints) rather than the symptoms of depressive illness. When we interviewed using the more structured approach, although most of the patients stated that depression was a mental illness, they had not employed this word when the concept was being explored through open-ended questions. It is possible that they did not want to use the term <italic>mental illness</italic> because of the strong stigma attached. It is equally possible that they did not think they were suffering with a mental illness, and came merely to see the doctors with their physical complaints.</p>
<p>All patients reported that depressive illness was affecting their life, even though they carried on with their routine chores and ways of living. This could be because Pakistan is not a welfare state; patients would need to continue with their life and work roles simply to survive. Similarly, women had to perform the duties imposed on them through their roles within the family. One patient said she increased her prayers during her depressive episode. A combination of increased religious activities and continuation of daily routine might play a beneficial role in reducing the severity of depressive illness. During our informal discussions with clinicians, it appeared that patients mostly demand medicines that made them feel better quickly, so they could return to their respective routine.</p>
<p>Patients used the terms <italic>good medicines</italic> and <italic>good brain tests</italic>. That a patient would desire a brain test is understandable given the belief that the cause of their illness was physical. It was less apparent exactly what the patients meant by <italic>good medicines</italic>. This requires further investigation. One can speculate that they might be medicines that can cure the illness forever, or medicines that are not out of date or substandard. The latter point might be made because in Pakistan there are no checks on the quality of medicines, and newspapers often describe drug companies producing poor-quality medicines. The idea of cure, or illness being eradicated at its root, has important implications. This simply means a patient and his family might look for a cure until and unless he is educated about the possible nature of illness. Because of the high number of people attending outpatient clinics (50 to 150 patients per clinic per day), this might not be practical. This might explain why there are so many dropouts from psychiatric services in Pakistan. At least one person thought that there are two broad categories of mental illness, i.e., neurotic and psychotic.</p>
<p>There were many points of information that seemed paradoxical and were beyond the scope of this study to pursue. Although patients wanted medicines and brain tests, they described their depressive illness as being the result of psychosocial problems, mainly problems at work and at home, and because of some trauma or loss. In Pakistan people generally have many social and financial problems affecting their lives. Examples include unemployment, social inequality and injustice, numerous national traumas, and disasters. Thus, a psychosocial model of understanding of stress and depressive illness is comprehensible. This does not explain, however, why patients ask for medicines for problems they attribute to psychosocial stressors. Similarly, we were unable to ascertain how the process of referral works. Why did patients refer themselves (or why did relatives or friends refer them) to a psychiatric clinic, even though they had no previous knowledge of mental illness and did not know that their illness was a mental illness? It seems they were simply guided by the presence or absence of somatic complaints.</p>
<p>The interviews were expanded to include patients’ views on mental illness in general. Although this did not generate any additional information, it confirmed that the patients’ perceptions of mental illnesses extended to their perception of depressive illness. Patients believed that mental illnesses were the result of stress and trauma, and that the most common cause of mental illness is tension. Again, a psychosocial model of the understanding of mental illness appeared, and participants believed that mental illnesses could be treated only with medicine.</p>
<p>Information from the patient interviews was substantiated later when we asked psychologists about their experiences with patients. They reported that patients have poor follow-up rates, and stop coming as soon as they are symptom free; they believe that medicines can treat their illnesses; and they seem to know little or nothing about psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312450212">Naeem et al., 2010</xref>). It seemed that patients knew only about the doctor’s role in treating mental illness, and were completely unaware of psychologists. Doctors were described as the ultimate authority, and the only professionals who could give the right advice, perhaps reflecting the impact of social hierarchies. However, this leads to the questions of why patients did not continue treatment with psychiatrists, and why there were high dropout rates from psychiatric clinics.</p>
<p>It was difficult to gain a clear picture of how depressed patients perceived their illness. However, the finding that patients in Pakistan probably knew very little about their illness is important in itself. This can have an impact on their actions to seek help. This also means that patients need to be educated about the illness, and a shared understanding of symptoms should be developed. This poses challenges for practitioners, in that such knowledge transfer needs to be undertaken sensitively so as not to generate unhelpful repercussions on the patients’/family members’ existing world views and self-perceptions.</p>
<p>It is possible that depressed patients who experience somatic symptoms present to medical services, whereas those experiencing fewer or no somatic symptoms seek help from traditional healers. In this way, somatic symptoms not only serve the function of medicalizing mental illness (and thus reducing the attached stigma), but also lead their bearers to the medical system. Patients’ lack of awareness of nonpharmacological methods of treatment should be taken into consideration when referring them to psychologists. Sharing a formulation that uses a biopsychosocial model of illness might be useful when delivering psychological therapy to such patients. Patients’ concepts about mental illness were similar to their concepts about depressive illness.</p>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Although this study provided sufficient and appropriate information for us to adapt and successfully develop a CBT manual and therapy for local use, it raised several questions that require more in-depth and extensive research that were beyond the scope of this project. In particular, further exploration of patient views is necessary to explain some of their beliefs and practices. We are mindful that the patients who were interviewed were those who had already presented to psychiatrists for treatment. They might have had different views from other people who suffer from the same problem and had not sought assistance, or might have done so from other health professionals or those outside the traditional health system, such as faith healers. Similarly, the patients originated from a secondary care service in a medium-sized city in the south Punjab, and we do not know the extent to which patients in the community or those attending in other parts of the country might have different perspectives. As we have discussed, for pragmatic reasons and to accommodate those patients who had traveled a great distance to attend the clinic, patients were interviewed in a busy outpatient department. It is possible that this influenced the extent to which they were prepared to disclose information. Although the major limitation of this study could be considered its small sample size, the information elicited from patients subsequently proved to be more than sufficient to enable the training manual and therapy to be successfully designed and implemented.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that it is essential to elicit client knowledge and perspectives on illness and treatment before introducing therapies that are new to a given culture or context. Portraying the language and beliefs from the country of origin could also provide useful information to assist health care practitioners in other countries who might interact with first- or second-generation migrants who maintain their “home” beliefs and knowledge. Our study revealed four domains in which CBT required modification for local use in Pakistan. First, it had to take account of cultural considerations; for example, patients’ use of nontraditional healing methods and the important presence of family members. Second, the strategy for providing CBT needed to accommodate not only the capacity and organization of the health care system, but also how patients accessed care and were referred to psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners. Third, therapists needed to appreciate patients’ cognitions and beliefs, particularly with respect to their apparent predominantly psychosocial model of illness, their scant or absent knowledge and perceptions of depression, its treatment, and the role of psychiatrists and nonmedical therapists. Fourth, because patients believed that mental illnesses are caused by psychosocial stressors, and felt that their somatic symptoms needed investigating and should be treated with medicines, patients might be more inclined to accept therapy that includes medications.</p>
<p>The crucial links between patients’ knowledge, language, and discourse patterns means that therapists and researchers need familiarity with their conceptualizations of their illness and its treatment options. Introducing therapies and practices that are unfamiliar to the local cultural context, particularly if they are from a quite different cultural origin, could otherwise be fraught with difficulties. Our key finding with respect to patients’ understanding of CBT and other nonpharmacological interventions was essentially that patients appeared to know little. This means that introducing CBT required a culturally sensitive way of providing patients and their families (and indeed other health care professionals) with appropriate knowledge so they could make an informed treatment choice in a manner that would not cause inappropriate conflicts with their existing beliefs and cultural values.</p>
