<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813u"><title>Susan Reynolds, <italic>Before Eminent Domain: Toward a History of Expropriation of Land for the Common Good</italic>, University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill NC, 2010; viii + 175 pp.; 9780807833537, £35.50 (hbk)</title>
<p>In this brief volume Susan Reynolds examines the pre-history of a concept that has occupied the minds of some legal historians and modern legal academics, but – surprisingly, she implies – rarely political or economic historians of earlier ages. This is ‘eminent domain’, an American legal expression that emerged in the 1790s, drawing on the earlier writings of Grotius, and that Reynolds defines as ‘expropriation of land for the common good’. In tracing the genealogy of this idea, Reynolds sets herself two tasks in particular. One is elaborating the familiar trope of the medievalist: things began earlier than you think. In fact, Reynolds is not able to find any clear origins at all for the practice: its first appearances in the documentary record already exist in a context where the right itself is uncontested. Secondly, Reynolds wishes to divorce the idea of the arbiter of the common good from the state, which has come to embody it in much modern political discourse. She argues that the history of expropriation does not imply that people conceived the state to have a superior property right over the territory that it ruled. Given that she finds examples of the practice stretching back many centuries – long before the formulation of the idea of ‘state’ property as such – this observation is the inevitable consequence of the chronology she traces.</p>
<p>Reynolds takes a narrow definition of her subject; she only examines the expropriation of <italic>land</italic>, and she rules out property taken solely for redistributory purposes. This move has two consequences; firstly, she does not address in any detail what the ‘common good’ is or who defines it, despite the fact that presumably many expropriations have uneven distributory consequences whose justification must be debated. Eminent domain or compulsory purchase on behalf of the public is a familiar feature of the modern world, especially in regard to the construction of infrastructure, but nobody believes that such infrastructure is of equal benefit to all. Reynolds also wishes to avoid the topic of <italic>seizure </italic>that finds no formal place in the modern legal systems that she wishes to contextualize – although seizure, like compensation, might be a matter of perception. Secondly, the limitation to <italic>land</italic> rules out a broader consideration of how people value assets, both in regard to the fact that many property rights were attached to material or uses rather than solely space, and the fact that most people who own land also own other immoveable assets on that land for which they might feel entitled to compensation. This book does not consider at all, for example, the centuries-long processes of enclosure that were (highly variably) linked to the common good, of which there were many clear enough examples of expropriation with compensation; nor would one know from this work that public authorities were intimately involved in the setting of prices, regulation of markets, allocation of use-rights, enforcement of inheritance practices and levying of taxation. In narrowing the discussion to this degree one may feel that one is entering a conversation where one cannot hear what a majority of the interlocutors are saying.</p>
<p>What seems like analytical myopia might be justified by the fact of book’s breathtaking vision, covering a millennium of western European history. The strength of this gambit is that Reynolds identifies across a very broad front the early (high medieval) application of the principle from a range of bodies that were viewed as responsible for the common good – kings, certainly, but also municipalities providing fortifications, for example. The weakness of the approach is that Reynolds constantly apologizes for her own lack of local knowledge (this is relative, of course!) and the thinness of the material she can present. We end up with a paradox: the primary aim of the book seems to be to provide context and depth for people (legal academics) who write teleological and anachronistic history, but Reynolds ends up with a text that, albeit elegant and intriguing, itself lacks context and nuance, or can only address issues in an extremely compressed form.</p>
<p>Reynolds’ argument of the apparently early and wide legitimacy of such expropriations feeds into her important previous work that has shifted our notions of ‘feudal’ society away from a preoccupation with vertical relations between individuals to give much greater weight to horizontal ideas of community and how the responsibilities of rulers were imagined. Indeed, at the heart of this little work lies the paradox that if expropriation was mostly uncontroversial – only Grotius made much of it, and this aspect of his work was not much discussed – does this negatively reveal a high level of consent for action by ‘public’ bodies at various levels, and that provision of certain amenities (roads, fortifications) was viewed with almost universal approval? Implicitly, we thus misread attitudes towards government if we focus on certain kinds of issues (such as tax), not least because it was the issues, not the form of government, that was generally contentious.</p>
<p>Reynolds is certainly on to a good topic; the implications of this work deserve wide attention and study. She forcefully and apologetically repeats the point that is a first foray. Perhaps on that basis the argument would have been better presented in an agenda-setting (and cheaper) article than a slim hardback book.</p>
