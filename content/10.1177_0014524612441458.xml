<p>Until quite recently, ‘the Exile’ was an unchallenged fact of sixth-century Judean history. Now ‘exile’ has tended to be replaced by the more prosaic and precise ‘deportation’ (more strictly ‘deportations’). Ahn now introduces a third category that allows him a broader comparative scope: ‘forced migration’. Our ignorance of how the Judean migrants responded economically and socially in their new homeland remains profound, but ‘the Exile’ became a central episode in Judah’s collective memory and a major trope in the Hebrew Bible. The memory/trope was expressed in a variety of perception: for the Chronicler it was a temporary reprieve for the land; for the authors of Daniel it never ended. Ahn focuses on the responses of the first three generations of deported communities which, as he sees it, expressed their own increasingly positive perceptions of their migration. To illuminate each of these generational perspectives, he compares a range of more recent ‘forced migrations’ into the USA, Australia, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Germany, focussing especially on the economic causes and consequences of such resettlement. He takes the results as a template for the first, first-and a half, second and third generations of Judean immigrant communities in Babylonia.</p>
<p>The major part of the book then identifies biblical texts in which the voices of these generations speak. The first Babylonian generation is here represented by the communal lament (Psalm 137), the 1.5 generation by hope (Jeremiah 29), the second generation by the vision of a ‘new creation’ (Isaiah 43) and the third by the embrace of a new ‘home’ away from Judah (Numbers 32). At least to this reviewer, the attributions are less well-founded than such an ambitious thesis requires. There have always been doubts about the provenance of Psalm 137 (which refers to Babylon as ‘<italic>there</italic>’), while in Jeremiah’s ‘letter to the exiles’, the promises of return and threats against Babylon are probably secondary (and later); an earlier form, attributed to a protégé of the new non-Davidic régime, relays the message ‘don’t expect to come back!’ The ‘exilic’ dating of Second Isaiah is disputed less widely, but nonetheless with sound reasons; the reading of Numbers 32 is the most imaginative but also the most speculative. The discussion of these texts is in every case quite thorough and nuanced, but such uncertainties, while often recognized, are set aside. The Egyptian ‘forced migration’ in 582 (attested in 2 Kings and Jeremiah) might also have been more cautious: though widely rehearsed as a fact, it might well be a part of the ‘empty land’ fiction, conveniently disposing of remaining Judeans while according ‘exilic’ status to the Egyptian diaspora.</p>
<p>The contribution of this book lies for this reviewer not in recovering biblical history—forced migration served by forced exegesis—but in developing a theology of modern immigrant communities, to sit alongside liberation and postcolonial theologies.</p>

<p>This volume brings together nineteen of John Barclay’s essays which examine the fledgling Pauline communities and comparable aspects of Diaspora synagogues. An important aspect of this collection is the manner in which it assembles important data dealing with the fascinating yet complex topic of early Christian identity formation. Three of the nineteen essays are either new or have undergone major revision, the remaining sixteen have been published previously.</p>
<p>The volume is arranged into four sections. The introductory section contains a freshly written essay that outlines the insights of the collection as a whole. Barclay views the essays as responding to a set of four central research questions. These may be summarized as follows. First, how Pauline communities compare with those of Diaspora Judeans in the Mediterranean basin? Second, to what degree was the identity of Pauline communities compatible and overlapping with that of the Jewish groups? Third, what distinctive Christian practices emerged, or how were practices taken over from other groups invested with distinctively Christian meaning? Fourth, how did Christian assemblies negotiate the relationship with Roman power and religion, and what light can be shed on this question by comparison with the strategies employed by Josephus? This set of provides the agenda for the research that follows.</p>
<p>Section two consists of seven essays under the heading ‘Pauline Churches and Diaspora Jews’. Here topics covered include attitudes to torah observance, circumcision, group formation – with particular reference to money and meetings, and so on. Section three, ‘The Invention of Christian Identity in the Pauline Tradition’ examines distinctive practices in Pauline communities or those that are significant redeployed in light of core religious convictions. In the final section, the relationship with Rome is examined from a number of angles, such as strategies for dealing with imperial religion, which is understood as idolatry. Here insights from Josephus come to the fore as an important comparative tool.</p>
<p>This is a rich collection of essays assembled from disparate locations, some more accessible than others. Having these bound together in a single volume is highly advantageous, not only for ease of finding them, but more importantly because it allows one to better appreciate the wider gamut of Barclay’s research in this important area of Pauline scholarship. This collection will repay careful study.</p>

<p>As a newly appointed University Chaplain, I was granted an audience with the Vice Chancellor. To break the ice I remarked that I was pleased to meet the person at the centre of power. ‘Yes,’ replied the V-C, ‘and when you find him will you let me know who it is.’ The troubling thing is that I do not think he was being facetious! This book would describe his attitude as false humility. Whatever else it is, humility faces up to the truth; it is not about putting oneself down or exaggerating other’s gifts; it is not about timidity or limitation. Powerful people who refuse to own up to their power are avoiding the truth and so make themselves liable to misuse that power.</p>
<p>Stephen Cherry offers us an extended meditation on an often misunderstood and elusive virtue which yet lies at the heart of faith. Humility is that quality which, as the title of the book suggests, helps us to be earthed, rooted in the soil/dust of our created-ness; pointing us towards a sense of self at home in the damaged world we both inhabit and create. In this sense, humility is not something miserable or joyless but life-affirming; transforming if also challenging.</p>
<p>As befits the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Lent Book 2011, it is primarily a guide to personal examination. It has a freshness of approach drawing colourfully on the writer’s own experiences and offering wisdom from other sources too as well as practical suggestions. There is an especially enjoyable chapter on making Lent a ‘grumble-free’ zone.</p>
<p>It is a small book about an apparently small subject, yet its success is in showing how the learning and practice of humility is not only central to the Christian vocation but also to a good social theology. It is what we hold in common, our connectedness that creates us – connectedness to one another and to nature. True humility breaks out from the ‘apartheid of our minds’ and finds itself in the abundance of God expressed in Jesus. It springs out of love and longing; it is passionate. ‘Passionate humility knows something about the kingdom of God, and desires it deeply.’ (p. 47).</p>
<p>There are obvious pitfalls for anyone who dares to teach others about humility. Cherry avoids them, partly by making himself the butt of his own stories and partly too by the way he presents humility as a virtue worthy of study. There are, after all, occasions on which even the mighty are awed by circumstances or by the task ahead of them and profess a genuine humility.</p>
<p>As I was reading <italic>Barefoot Disciple</italic>, the News of the World phone hacking scandal erupted. It reached its climax in Rupert Murdoch’s ‘most humble day of my life.’ This book counsels me not to speculate on the quality of Murdoch’s humility – sometimes the experience of reaching rock bottom can set our lives on a new course. But this is the point. Passionate humility is not the emotion of a fleeting moment but the calling of a lifetime; and it promises not humiliation but liberation.</p>

<p>Philip Davies, who is now Research Professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Sheffield, has devoted his long scholarly career to Second Temple Judaism in its various forms. The origins of Judaism have been a particular preoccupation. This study brings together a number of published essays, along with some unpublished material, to address the question of origins.</p>
<p>After an Introduction, chapter 2 provides the background and sets the tone for answering the question. It emphasizes the pluralism of Judaism in the Second Temple period (Persian, Greek, and early Roman period to the fall of Jerusalem in 70). Some would even speak of ‘Judaisms’. He points to major developments that have changed study in the past few decades, including the re-evaluation of rabbinic literature (to emphasize its lateness), the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the diversity and importance of the ‘pseudepigrapha’ (those early Jewish writings that are not canonical or sectarian Qumran material).</p>
<p>He surveys some of the definitions of Judaism and looks at the place of ‘Scripture’, which is much more complicated than sometimes realized. He suggests that the emergence of Judaism ‘can be plotted by a series of probes that point to several related developments’ (p. 33). These are customs that became symbolic of a distinct way of life (a ‘Juda-ism’) that was defined in religious terms and included the centrality of the temple. Some of these religious terms competed with one another, since not all Jews embraced all of them. It was a ‘national ideology to which not all Jews subscribed equally’ (p. 33). Scripture is often over-emphasized, since it served a dogmatic function in only certain sorts of Judaism in pre-rabbinic times.</p>
<p>The following chapters then explore different aspects relating to Judaism of this time: Scripture, Law, Deuteronomy, the God of Cyrus and the God of Israel, Apocalyptic, Enoch and Genesis, Eating and Drinking in the Qumran Texts and in the Roman Empire. Although most of the essays were previously published, they have been revised (up to a point – my only regret is that the key chapter 2 was not more thoroughly updated and rewritten) and they definitely hang together as a unified volume. A short conclusion would have been desirable, but chapter 2 contains most of the main points developed further in the rest of the essays.</p>
<p>This is definitely a volume to be recommended not only to clergy and students but with much that university academics can learn from.</p>

<p>In addition to several scholarly tomes about Christians and Manichees in Roman North Africa, François Decret has also published a briefer, though not entirely reliable, introductory survey of <italic>Le christianisme en Afrique du Nord ancienne</italic> (Paris, 1996). An accurate and updated translation into English of this semi-popular book would surely be welcome to those who teach introductory courses in early Christianity to undergraduates in Britain and North America who either are not able or stubbornly refuse to read books in French. Unfortunately, the translation by Edward Smither does not fulfil this desideratum on any criterion. Its most pervasive failings are that Smither does not always render the original French precisely and that he too often robs Decret’s stylish writing of its elegance by abbreviating the original. As an example of the former failing, let me quote the statement that ‘Rome had fallen under Vandal control’ before 445 (p. 155), where Smither’s ‘Rome’ translates Decret’s ‘l’Afrique’ (p. 205). For the latter, compare three versions of the final sentence of the book:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Ainsi, au moment où prenait fin le califat omeyyade de Cordoue (1031), à Kairouan, les derniers chrétiens qui aient laissé un vestige connu dans l’histoire de la glorieuse Église d’Afrique disparaissent dans le grand courant de l’islam (Decret, p. 265)</p>
<p>When the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba came to an end in 1031, the last Christians at Kairouan — the last vestiges of the glorious African church — had disappeared into Islam (Smither, p. 201)</p>
<p>Thus, at the moment when the Ummayad caliphate of Cordoba was coming to an end, at Kairouan the last Christians who have left a known trace in the history of the glorious Church of Africa were disappearing in the powerful current of Islam (Barnes).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By way of contrast, however, Smither sometimes expands his original, so that Decret’s plain ‘dès après les édits de Théodose’ (p. 179) becomes ‘from the time that the <italic>Theodosian Code</italic> was reinstated’ (p. 135), whatever that is supposed to mean. Moreover, readers not familiar with Roman history may be puzzled by Smither’s peculiar rendition of some French proper names, for example, ‘Mauretania Caesarea’ and ‘Mauretania Sitifien’ for the Roman provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis and Sitifensis, and while ‘Célicoles’ might be legitimate French for the Latin <italic>caelicoli</italic> (‘sky-worshippers’), ‘celicoles’ not a translation of either the French or the Latin (pp. 150-151).</p>
<p>It is also unfortunate that Smither has not corrected Decret’s most serious factual mistakes. Decret attributed the <italic>Passion</italic> of the Donatist martyrs Maximianus and Isaac (<italic>CPL</italic><sup>3</sup> 721) to ‘le païen romain Macrobe’ (p. 153), apparently confusing the author of the <italic>Passion</italic>, who was a Donatist in Carthage, with his homonym Macrobius the author of the <italic>Saturnalia</italic>; Smither’s ‘the pagan writer Macrobius’ (p. 115) faithfully repeats Decret’s howler.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be noted that, although my review copy bears the imprint of James Clarke &amp; Co and the date of 2011, this parody of scholarship was first published in the United States in 2009 by ‘Cascade Books, a division of Wipf and Stock Publishers.’</p>

<p>In this work Terence Donaldson provides the reader with an introduction to the underlying assumptions and methodologies that often result in anti-Judaistic interpretations of New Testament (NT) texts rather than proposing a comprehensive hermeneutic for approaching those texts with regard to Jews and Judaism (p. 12). In his first chapter, Donaldson introduces the three primary authors with which he will interact (specifically the works of Jules Isaac, Gregory Baum and Rosemary Ruether, Jewish writers who have critiqued NT interpretations for their anti-Judaistic tendencies). Additionally, this first chapter introduces the broader questions regarding anti-Judaism in the NT, supersessionism and the so-called ‘parting of ways’ between Christianity and Judaism. Next the author focuses on those NT writings that have most often been interpreted in an anti-Judaistic manner, dedicating a chapter each to Matthew, Luke-Acts, John, and portions of Paul’s epistles. Each chapter contains a summary of the key texts, characters and motifs that have most often been interpreted as anti-Judaistic. Donaldson sees three hermeneutical issues as relating to understanding references to Jews and Judaism in the NT: 1) how each NT author communicates the self-identification of the group to which he and his readers belong, 2) locating the NT writings temporally with regard to the parting of ways between Christianity and Judaism and 3) the rhetorical features of an author’s references to Jews and Jewish religious practices. The book concludes with several practical guidelines for approaching the NT today in a manner that is sensitive to the complex nature of handling texts that, on the surface, seem to denigrate Jews and Judaism.</p>
<p>Providing several additional historical examples of how NT texts have been abused by interpreters (e.g., during the Holocaust or the persecutions of Jews by the church in the Middle Ages) would have strengthened the book, especially for an introduction. The notes and bibliography help overcome this weakness by leading the reader to works that provide such information.</p>
<p>The strength of the book is Donaldson’s fairness in discussing the issues surrounding this complex matter. While he advocates a reading of the NT that is not anti-Judaistic, he lays out the crucial issues in a manner that allows readers to begin to grapple with these problems for themselves. Donaldson’s thorough yet concise summaries of the matters that must be addressed when dealing with this topic provide an entry point to this complex matter. There are plenty of suggestions for further reading for those wishing to be sensitive in their own handling of the NT texts and/or aspiring to inter-faith dialogue.</p>

<p>This is the story of Norm, a recent university graduate, who travels to the Holy Land in pursuit of Jesus. His mind is filled with scholarly debates about Jesus and the Gospels, debates that have put question marks next to his faith and left the Gospel authors as artists rather than historians. Norm visits the major sites of the Gospels as he retraces the travels of Jesus from birth to death to resurrection. Along the path he encounters other questers and many locals. Throughout he puts the difficult questions and the Gospels to the test, often concluding with more questions.</p>
<p>Fisk has produced a novel and engaging book about the quest for the historical Jesus. The volume is not the standard academic tome of detailed arguments and excessive footnotes. Rather, it is a journal, a series of episodes strung together. Fisk’s creative and lively writing style draws the reader into the narrative and one quickly becomes not simply a character in a story but rather the main character, Norm. One feels his excitement as he comes to understand the Gospels for themselves as he retraces their story lines, as well as the struggle he faces between faith and criticism, between following Jesus and studying him. At the same time, Fisk introduces the reader to the major contributors to the quest for the historical Jesus and the relevant ancient texts. The book combines literary sources with archaeological studies in order to present the context within which Jesus lived. Fisk’s goal is not to produce another attempt at resolving the quest for Jesus, but rather to give a clear and interesting (and entertaining) review of the relevant material and views about Jesus.</p>
<p>Underlying all of Norm’s questions is one: Is it possible to maintain one’s faith in Jesus amidst the questions about the historicity of the Gospels? This is a question that many students face as they move into the academic debates. The answer given by Fisk focuses on the allusiveness of the Jesus described in the Gospels. Neither the academy nor the church can domesticate Jesus. Fisk challenges an attitude of naive faith while also highlighting the limitations of historical research and reconstruction.</p>
<p>This volume could be used in a class on the historical Jesus or the Gospels. It also could be given to pastors and educated laypersons who have struggled with the relationship between faith and the academy. However it may be used, Fisk is to be commended for writing it.</p>

<p>This book outlines an approach to discipleship formation that has evolved in a parish church. It assumes the Eucharist is the frame for Christian living and has ten sessions based on the shape of the Eucharistic liturgy from gathering to dismissal. There are two halves to each chapter – Robin Greenwood provides a theological overview and Sue Hart suggests practical ideas for activities that explore the theme. Instinctively, I wanted to like this book because of its Eucharistic focus for Christian formation, but I think it achieves some of its aims better than others.</p>
<p>Despite the suggestion that one way to use the book is for a group to read and discuss it, this is a book for leaders rather than participants, with helpful attention given to practical planning and preparation. While much of the faith development material is accessible to all readers, at other times biblical and theological words and concepts are mentioned but not explained. It can only scratch the surface of big issues – the task of explaining the different forms of literature in the Bible is delegated to a Vicar or Reader, the lectionary is described in fourteen words and contextual bible study mentioned but not worked out. When I remember long discussions in Confirmation groups about God and the Bible, or the time spent demonstrating how to use the lectionary as part of a habit of reading the bible, it becomes clear that this is an ideas book rather than a resource kit. The chapter on belief focuses on how we believe (especially post-Auschwitz) rather than what we believe, with a creative suggestion for a walk with cameras to find photos that explore ‘where is God in all this?’ plus follow up discussion and activities; but that is almost all there is about the creed. Meanwhile, I can already hear the questions coming in the next Confirmation group, ‘What does this mean?’ So I imagine this will work better as the basis for discipleship development for people who already have absorbed some Christian teaching, rather than as a Confirmation course for newer Christians who want to explore questions about Christian basics.</p>
<p>One book can’t do everything and the strength of this book is its modelling that we <italic>are</italic> church rather than we go to church. The emphasis is on the community of faith rather than the content of faith, and on learning by doing. It will work best when used as a resource for discipleship development in a church where there is regular, good input from the pulpit and an existing or emerging sense that being part of the Christian community is central to who we are. For Confirmation candidates, I will use it as a source of ideas alongside other resources for leaders, especially as the basis for exploration of the Eucharist, but I will look elsewhere for an introductory book to put in people’s hands.</p>

<p>The doctrine of reconciliation is a serious matter. To fail here, Karl Barth once said, is to fail everywhere. It is with appropriate seriousness, then, that Hans Vium Mikkelsen, Associate Professor at the Centre for Religious Education, Loegumkloster, Denmark, hosts a fruitful and constructive theological conversation on the topic of reconciliation. Although Barth is his primary interlocutor, Mikkelsen is also concerned both with Barth’s own highly critical conversation with the tradition and to bring Barth into conversation with a contingent of other significant theological voices. This conversational approach relieves Mikkelsen of the unprofitable task of defending Barth beyond criticism and also allows him the conceptual freedom to begin not with Barth’s own doctrinal commitments but with some of the pressing theological issues of today. In other words, Mikkelsen aims to do as Barth did and not merely repeat what has come before but reinterpret it for the needs of the day. Consequently, this book aims to establish through Barth an integrative connection between tradition and modernity, which Mikkelsen sees as ‘one of the central challenges’ for contemporary systematic theology; to appropriate Barth’s account of the relation between Scripture and revelation as an alternative to the two ‘pitfalls of theology today’, fundamentalism and relativism; and to utilise Barth’s dialectical account of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as an alternative to objective / subjective / classical typological approaches in current atonement theory.</p>
<p>The book falls into three parts. The first part, ‘Revelation’, deals with Barth’s dialectical theology of revelation, his concept of witness, and the objective and subjective aspects of revelation. The second part, ‘The Humanity of the Creature’, consists of an analysis of the human being in encounter and Barth’s anti-theodical handling of sin (through Buber and Brunner respectively). The third, final and longest part, ‘Christology and Atonement’, begins with Barth’s familiar Chalcedonian Christology and the contentious relation between the <italic>Logos asarkos</italic> and the <italic>Logos ensarkos</italic>, then moves into his theology of the covenant (in dialogue with the Danish Lutheran theologia Regin Prenter), his narrative of the judge judged in our place (through Girard’s theory of mimetic desire and the scapegoat), the double outcome of Barth’s crucial revision of the doctrine of election (through Luther, Calvin and the doctrine of <italic>apokatastasis</italic>); the punishment and wrath of God (in conversation with Anselm), the humanity of Jesus, and concludes with a discussion on the ‘Earthly’ Jesus and the formulation of a framework for a Christology from below (drawing on the work of Pannenberg).</p>
<p>Although the book sometimes retains the feel of a doctoral thesis (with frequent bullet point lists and a tendency towards the descriptive) and does not always advance much beyond existing works on the topic, Mikkelsen nevertheless argues his thesis well, covers the relevant parts of the <italic>Church Dogmatics</italic> appropriately and critically, and has a good grasp of both the secondary literature in German and English and of the world outside of Barth-studies.</p>

<p>This work presents eleven essays on significant subjects in natural theology. Contributions include Charles Taliaferro on objections to the project of natural theology, Alexander Pruss on the Leibnizian cosmological argument, four objections to cosmological arguments, the principle of sufficient reason, and nonlocal causal principles, William Lane Craig and James Sinclair on the <italic>Kalam</italic> cosmological argument, Robin Collins on a teleological argument from cosmological fine-tuning, J. P. Moreland with an argument from consciousness, Victor Reppert’s argument from reason, intentionality, mental causation, and the psychological relevance of logical laws, Mark Linville with a moral argument, Stewart Goetz with an argument from evil, Kai-Man Kwan’s argument from religious experience, Robert Maydole with an ontological argument, and Timothy and Lydia McGrew with an argument from the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>The description of arguments in this volume as ‘representative of the best work being done in the field today’ (p. xiii) is accurate. Argumentation is highly analytical, frequently dense, and unwaveringly rigorous. Contributors demonstrate familiarity with contemporary arguments and their modern and older proponents and engage those arguments at length, in addition to providing a positive program for the broader issue in question. Although a level of knowledge beyond that of the normal college educated individual is at times assumed (such as, for example, in Maydole’s heavy use of symbolic logic), generally essays provide lucid exposition of relevant topics so that partially uninformed readers can follow an argument. Exposition, though, is frequently compact and mentally demanding, especially for non-experts. The volume, though usually clear, is more concerned with rigorous and academically defensible argumentation than ease of the layman, and in that respect it excels considerably.</p>
<p>The book itself is quite large, owing to the thoroughness of individual treatments. Pruss, for example, spends more than thirty-four pages of his approximately seventy-seven page contribution on his discussion related to the principle of sufficient reason. This size is typical, with seven of the eleven principal essays being over fifty pages in length; were it not for the large page sizes, the page counts would have been even higher. As demonstrated by Pruss’ <italic>The Principal of Sufficient Reason: A Reassessment</italic> (Cambridge, 2006), his essay is at least partly a condensation, something that, even in its thoroughness, has bartered comprehensiveness for space. In this regard, Pruss is typical of other contributors who have written on their topic elsewhere at length.</p>
<p>In the end, the size and the rigorous and highly analytical approach of this work would probably be an obstacle for most of the non-philosophical public, and for professors looking for a course textbook on philosophy of religion. The first result goes with the nature of the work and of the public, and the second, though perhaps necessary given practical considerations, would be a loss for students. This book is one of the best one-volume treatments, both in quality and breadth, of natural theology and areas in philosophy of religion. The publisher and editors should be commended for spearheading such an important work.</p>
