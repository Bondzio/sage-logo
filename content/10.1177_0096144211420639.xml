<abstract>
<p>In this article, the author studies the local response to the nation-building process that constructs society, its space, and history, by focusing on the particular case of Greece in the nineteenth century. How local inhabitants actively participated in this process is discussed in the example of the Plaka district on the northern slope of the Athenian Acropolis. The author argues that mutual relations among modernization, Hellenization, and living tradition constructed modern Greece as a new nation in the nineteenth century. The official efforts toward Hellenization and modernization with the emphasis on classical antiquity gave rise to the emergence of alternative tendencies that were shaped by the local inhabitants according to the way they perceived society and experienced space. The author’s focus in this article, then, turns to nineteenth-century houses in Plaka as a <italic>folk</italic> expression of the official neoclassical style to discuss the local performance in the construction of a national identity.</p>

<p>In this article, I question how the local responds to the dominant processes that combine in the formation of a national identity, the society, and its space, and how it becomes both a part and a result of the nation-building process. This will entail an investigation of the processes embedded in the formation of a society and its history, and their reflections on spatial-architectural practices. In particular, I focus on the nation-building process undertaken in Greece in the nineteenth century and the active participation of its inhabitants in this process, as exemplified in the Plaka district on the northern slope of the Athenian Acropolis.</p>
<p>Understanding the multiple processes that combine in the building of a society, its history, and space by drawing on the tools of architecture is significant in a discussion of local performance in the construction of a national identity; and architecture can be considered not only a means but also a result of these processes. Henri Lefebvre’s approach to space, which relates it to the social making of history, is that “social can not have a concrete existence unless it is inscribed into the space.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420639">1</xref></sup> Space is embedded in social and social is embedded in space, and that is the making of history.</p>
<p>The efforts to construct Greece as a modern nation-state involved defining a national-<italic>yet</italic>-international style for its architecture, with the aim of creating a national version of the international (European) style that idealized classical antiquity. Here, <italic>international</italic> refers to the fulfillment of the expectations of Western powers in terms of the form modern Greece was to take, thus guaranteeing acceptance by the West. How can architecture be both international and national, or global and local, or modern and traditional? At the heart of the answer to this question is social thought and imagination, which combine in the building of a society and explain to us how space is perceived, experienced, and represented in a discourse, and thus becomes a representation. The dualities of international–national, global–local, and modern–traditional can be useful, in that they summarize stereotypes, but can also be dangerous, as they ignore how these stereotypes are perceived and used locally. As such, it is necessary to look beyond the simplistic clichés that have been constructed around these dualities to explore the potentials of different worlds that are shaped and imagined by inhabitants of society. The inhabitants, meaning those who occupy <italic>not only</italic> the physical space <italic>but also</italic> the image of this space, will always remain crucial in discussions on <italic>the</italic> identity or identit<italic>ies</italic> attached to architecture. These <italic>symbolic</italic> identities or meanings are a product of the social context and geography to which architecture belongs.</p>
<p>In this article, I argue that mutual relations among Hellenization, modernization, and living tradition resulted in the construction of Greece as a new modern nation in the nineteenth century. Hellenization and modernization were processes that emerged simultaneously, leading to the construction of the nation in terms of its space, society, and history and are evaluated in this article as both processes and projects that intertwined with each other in the construction of the Greek nation-state. They served in the building of a homogenous imagined community and territory by imposing an official language and architectural style as symbols of nationality, and by claiming the supremacy of the classical civilization. The nation-making project came into existence through the localization of foreign/Western features in the Hellenic past and through the idealization of familiar/Eastern with foreign/Western. It is in this sense that the nation-making process could generate both liberating and also colonizing results. Official efforts toward Hellenization and modernization cleared the way for the emergence of conflicting histor<italic>ies</italic> and identit<italic>ies</italic> since the ideals of the nationalist discourse and the reality of everyday life did not coincide with each other. As such, an understanding of Hellenization and modernization is essential if one is to understand the construction of Greece as a modern nation-state as well as the participation of the local inhabitants in the process. To this end, the houses in the Plaka district, as a <italic>folk</italic> expression of the official architectural style, are studied to illustrate how the struggle between official history and personal histories, and between the ideal and the real, materialized in spatial practices.</p>

<title>The Nineteenth Century Nation-Making Project (in General) and the Case of Greece (in Particular)</title>
<p>Before focusing on the particular case of Greece, it is necessary to place it in the context of nineteenth-century nationalism in Europe. As Eric Hobsbawm stated, nationalism did not yield a state-making project until 1830, when two great powers that were based on the national principal, namely Germany and Italy, emerged; and the first nation-states created through nationalism, including Belgium in the West and Greece, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria (the Ottoman successor states) in the Southeast, came into being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420639">2</xref></sup>The nineteenth century saw many wars of independence in Europe, the majority of which were fought by countries seeking independence from the Ottoman Empire. For example, following the emergence of nationalism in Bulgaria under influence from the West, the country struggled to liberate itself from five centuries of Ottoman domination and establish itself as an independent nation-state. “Nation-making” as a project was an essential aspect of the nineteenth century, with history, territory, ethnicity, and language all becoming significant aspects of national identity, in both a social and a spatial sense.</p>
<p>Each political discourse comes with its own modes of social relations that mark its existence in space by means of architecture, and so for the building of modern Greece as a new nation it became necessary to define the social and spatial practices that wrote its history and constructed its national identity. Thus, to understand the state-initiated projects of modernization and Hellenization of space and daily life in nineteenth-century Greece, one needs to look into how space was represented (i.e., the ideal space) in the Greek nationalist imagination. The constituents of the nationalist imagination, namely modernization, Hellenization, and living tradition, and their mutuality are significant, as they formed the paradoxical structure of the nation-building process in Greece.</p>
<p>Anthony Smith argues that nations are a product of modernity whose structures emerge through processes of modernization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420639">3</xref></sup> In the nineteenth century, the political idea of nationality was the basis of Westernization and modernization, which were usually associated with each other; and in the nation-making process, tensions arose out of the coexistence of concepts related to nationality, Westernization, and modernization. To state two particular aspects of nineteenth-century modernization, centralization imposed a singular national identity on society, and colonialism forced the national imagination into compliance with foreign models. The typical process of centralization turned into the construction of a nation in a way that would allow them to secure a place on the political map of the Western states. In adjusting to Western civilization, the common approach was to refigure the ancient past as a symbol of the emergent nation, and defining the nation’s territory. Colonialism, as the driving force behind nineteenth-century modernization, insisted on the narratives of linear spiritual and cultural continuity with the ancient past, and of racial and cultural hierarchies. The nation-making process in the nineteenth century shared similar issues witnessed in the colonization process, “such as the emphasis on roots and ancestry, their transformative civilizing/nationalizing mission.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420639">4</xref></sup> Nationalism and colonialism had developed as the dominant ideologies of nineteenth-century modernization, utilizing archeology as their main representational device in justifying ancestral origin, and thus in creating the monumental landscape of the new nation. It is necessary to point out here the paradox of the ancient becoming a symbol of the modern in shaping the nation-making process of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Concerning the particular case of Greece, Yannis Hamilakis states that “modern Greece was invented by a convergence of colonial and national processes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420639">5</xref></sup> Europe invented modern Greece through the device of Western Hellenism, suggesting both an ideological colonization, in the sense that the Hellenic national imagination adopted the European discourse on the supremacy of classical civilization, and also a direct form of colonization, in the sense that the Bavarians and other Western Europeans controlled the establishment of the political structures or institutions of modernity (such as the foundation of an archaeology department).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420639">6</xref></sup> Rather than being a military colonization, this was more a result and/or part of the ideological work of the project of European world hegemony,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420639">7</xref></sup> described by Michael Herzfeld as “crypto-colonialism” (a specific kind of colonialism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420639">8</xref></sup> “Nation” in the nineteenth century was meant to be independent and liberated, yet in the case of Greece, the nation became dependent in an ideological sense on Europe. The Greek nationalist discourse employed dominant European practices on culture that were related to classical antiquity to defend its “imagined” national <italic>specificity</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420639">9</xref></sup> however, their aggressive promotion in this regard, which claimed roots in the ancient culture, was initiated by European nationalism.</p>
<p>Ancestral origin and territory were at the heart of nineteenth-century debates into national identity. Smith stresses the intimate relation between history and territory in the shaping of the nationalist imagination and defines territory as a significant aspect of nineteenth-century nation-states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420639">10</xref></sup> However, Eleana Yalouri, in her book <italic>The Acropolis: Global Fame, Local Claim</italic>, in which she views the Acropolis as a “vehicle of agency” to understand the ways Greeks appreciate their national identity, highlights the differences between Greece and other Western nation-states of the period:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Since the establishment of the Greek state, Greece’s strong point, as opposed to other powerful Western nation-states, was not its territory. . . . Although the Greek nationalist “imagining” had territorial aspirations (. . . for example the concept of “Great Idea” . . . ), its strong point was its history. At the time of the establishment of the Greek state, its spatial borders were vague and negotiable. By contrast, classical antiquity provided a period in the history of the land which accommodated the new state, highly and widely appreciated by the West, therefore serving as a more solid point of reference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420639">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The obsession with finding <italic>the</italic> right origin of a nation in the distant past is at the heart of nationalist ideologies. <italic>The past</italic> is the nation’s golden age, in which it was liberated and was at its most “authentic,” untainted by foreign influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420639">12</xref></sup> Therefore, in nineteenth-century Europe, antiquity was “deemed to be canonical, because it stands at the inception of national time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420639">13</xref></sup> This belief in antiquity was demanded by the movement of historicist revivalism, namely neoclassicism, which was an influential movement in architecture, painting, and poetry that dated back to the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Then, it was <italic>the</italic> history, the classical Greek antiquity and its elements (such as the Acropolis and the Parthenon), that defined the imagined borders of the newly emerging Greek nation-state, and stimulated the intelligentsia’s visions of the reborn Greece. The Acropolis continues to legitimize and mark the national territorial space, while the territory and <italic>topos</italic> of the Greek nationalist imagination were marked with the cultural idea of Hellenism. This “imaginative territory” was defined by a formula that included “any land associated with Greek history or the Greek race.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420639">14</xref></sup> The ancient past was revived in the form of “neo-Hellenism,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420639">15</xref></sup> which adopted the principles and ideals of the classical Greek civilization, and then became the dominant ideology in the construction of modern Greece, its society and space. In parallel to Yalouri’s discussion that history was the strongest instrument of the nation-making project in Greece, in selecting the right city to be the capital of the new nation, “the choice was made not so much because of Athens’ geographical position, nor for any other practical reason. It was its name, linked with the glory of the classical world that was enough to justify such a choice.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420639">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Athens remained under Ottoman jurisdiction until the end of March 1833, when the Ottoman garrison surrendered the Acropolis to the Bavarians, and Athens was rebuilt as the capital of the new nation as a part of the nation-making process. Eleni Bastéa, who examines the modernity evoked by the physical urban planning of modern Athens after 1833 and the effects of these physical plans on the modernization of the citizens, emphasizes the fact that “[i]n the kingdom of Greece, . . . the drafting of a new plan for Athens in 1833 represented more than a physical urban plan; it symbolized the country’s rebirth, classical orientation, and modern national identity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420639">17</xref></sup> In accordance with the prevailing city planning principles of the time, Athens was adorned with neoclassical buildings as a symbol of both the progress toward Westernization as a part of Europe and the break from Ottoman rule. It was at this time that the Ottoman Empire too started to undertake urban transformations according to Western European principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420639">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Common to the successive administrations in Greece of Ioannis Kapodistrias (1828–1831), King Otto (1833–1862), and George I (1863–1913) was continuity in the physical urban plans, the formal solutions to architectural projects, and the implementation processes. “Straight streets, town squares and public spaces were proposed for existing towns, while the design of new ones was based on orthogonal grids of different degrees of complexity. . . . The grid plan had practical advantages with respect to surveying and establishing new settlements, but it also underscored the new state’s independence from Ottoman rule.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420639">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Athens, existing streets were slightly altered and widened, and the town’s extension was laid out on a regular grid. In fact, in nineteenth-century Europe a modern city suggested a regular, geometric grid pattern. For example, Baron Haussmann’s urban projects for Paris in the second half of the nineteenth century, which were intended to modernize Paris, created a rupture in the traditional city form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420639">20</xref></sup> He replanned Paris with long, straight, and wide boulevards flanked with cafes and shops, which determined a new type of urban life in Paris. The old Paris (the medieval city) was modernized by cutting through the existing dense and irregular narrow medieval streets with wide avenues and open spaces extending beyond the old city limits.</p>
<p>In a comparison with the other newly emerging nation-states, what was specific in the way Greece was constructed as a modern nation-state, and Athens as a modern capital city, was how the project and process of Hellenization and the existing Byzantine Orthodox tradition influenced the realization of the Greek nationalist imagination. Under the influence of the French Revolution, European intellectuals promoted a secular rather than religious (Christian) nation, with nationalism replacing religion as the leading power. However, in Greece, especially from the mid-nineteenth century onward, the nationalist imagination contained elements of both the Orthodox tradition and classical Greece.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420639">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Area</title>
<p>As a continuation of the argument that the mutual relations of Hellenization, modernization, and tradition governed the process of the construction of a Greek nation-state, my intention in this article is to show how the dominant European discourse on classical revivalism (i.e., neoclassicism) was localized, how the classical heritage (Hellenism) was used as a path to European identity, and how the local embraced the nationalist discourse that idealized Hellenism. Having been <italic>selected</italic> as the official national style, neoclassicism provided the spatial lexicon for the building of modern Greece. My intention here is not to list the architectural features that mark the neoclassical style but rather to study the social context that made neoclassical architecture <italic>the</italic> official style of the new nation. That said, it would be negligent to evaluate neoclassicism as only a result, for it concurrently shaped society and social life in the city by introducing new patterns of social activities housed in newly emerging buildings.</p>
<p>Architecture, in general, stands as a material expression of the processes that make a society and its history. The <italic>house</italic>, in particular, appears as a principal locus for the objectification of the collective identity due to its intimate relation with daily experiences, customs, and living traditions. As such, this will be the principal focus of an investigation into how foreign elements are assimilated locally. Plaka, on the northern side of the Acropolis, is a place where the projects and processes of Hellenization and modernization were well embedded in the living tradition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211420639">Figure 1</xref>). The houses built in Plaka after the War of Independence in the nineteenth century will be investigated as evidence of the local response to the ongoing process of building a new nation, as the Plaka district constitutes the most prominent visual evidence of how the local inhabitants adopted the official architectural style of the new nation into their houses.</p>

<sec id="section3-0096144211420639">
<title>Relationships among Hellenization, Modernization, and Tradition That Made the Greek Society</title>
<p>In nineteenth-century Greece, two main objectives were put forward by the central authority, bureaucrats, intellectuals, the Greek diaspora, and the church in the construction of a nation-state: political liberation from Ottoman domination, which had governed the geography for four centuries, and social-cultural Westernization/modernization. The intention of the first objective was to rid the country of all social and spatial codes and symbols resembling the Ottoman/East, while the aim of the second objective was to find a place for the country in the Western world. These complementary objectives emerged through state-initiated projects targeting the Hellenization and modernization of space and social life.</p>
<p>Hellenization was a project to find the right origin for the emergent Greek nation with the intention of constructing a national identity that was free from all attachments to the East and involved both forgetting (the Ottoman/East) and remembering (the classical past). Modernization, on the other hand, was a project to build the new nation as a Western society through the construction of new institutions.</p>
<p>These projects or processes cannot be considered apart, as each involves the other. The national goal was to embed Hellenism in modern Greece and make modern Greece Hellenic. This was meant to “transform the geographical space of the state into a national territory, ‘our own land.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420639">22</xref></sup> Hellenization, or in other words situating Hellenism in modern Greece, was a place-based strategy with a strong attachment to the classical past rather than the traditional way of life. Actually, the Hellenization project was an attempt to construct a local form of modernity; ideas and practices of Western modernization were appropriated through the use of Hellenism, which, however, represented a collective form of tradition created by the bourgeoisie and Europeans. On the other hand, modernization was a strategy for the invention of modern Greece through (European) nationalism, as the most powerful ideology of nineteenth-century modernity, and through archaeology, as a device of that modernity. It was a strategy used by the Greeks to negotiate their boundaries, their place among European nation-states, and their developing status in the civilized and modernized world of the West.</p>
<p>Which of these projects and processes, “Hellenization” or “modernization,” was most influential in the building of modern Greece? In fact, both reinforced each other in recreating society–space–history, but there was another element with a significant position, being living tradition, which prepared the grounds for the generation of alternatives. This was closely associated with the Church of Orthodox Christianity in Greece, which had survived the Byzantium tradition. The relations among Hellenization, modernization, and tradition were complex and paradoxical and had been shaped under the impacts of international (external) and local (internal) dynamics. During the process of building the modern Greece, each retained its force and salience, but one never concealed the other, as each, in fact, contained the other, and found its hallmark in the way the society expressed itself and represented its space.</p>
<p>“Hellenization” was a search for an appropriate origin that would satisfy the national (local) sentiment, while “modernization” was aimed at Westernizing or modernizing the national (local) identity. In both cases, local indicated a selected and constructed identity for the new imagined community. Paradoxically, despite the fact that the creation of the imagined Hellenic community depicted the living reality as its “other” (possibly as a negative other), it was the very product of this reality, whose constituents were customs and the mode of behavior and thinking absorbed within a tradition of Orthodox Christianity linking each individual to a collective religious identity.</p>
<p>To evaluate the position of the living tradition in the construction of the national identity, the relation between “neo-Hellenism” and the living tradition needs to be understood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420639">23</xref></sup> The revival of the ancient past in the form of neo-Hellenism meant more than just a return to the classical past but was rather a symbolic instrument to facilitate access to modern Europe; and neo-Hellenism emerged as a form of modernity with a strong emphasis on the Hellenic past. Concepts and practices of modernization were appropriated and re-embedded in the practices of the cultural idea of Hellenism, which gave rise to the emergence of the local form of modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420639">24</xref></sup> However, the idea of Hellenism was an imported view that was created and imposed by the bourgeoisie and Europeans, in that it represented the idealized classical Greek past. It is in this sense that it embodied a collective form of tradition reducing the living reality (experiences of the local people) to a collective predictability. However, the process/project of Hellenization with emphasis on the classical antiquity resulted in the emergence of alternative tendencies, as shaped and imagined by the local inhabitants according to the way they explained themselves and experienced and represented their spaces, with emphasis on traditional values (as exemplified in the case of Plaka).</p>
<p>The relations between the ancient (Hellenic) heritage and the living tradition became problematic at that time, when the ancient past was attached to ideologies of nationalism and idealized as the model for the creation of the new nation. So much was it idealized that any attempt to question it would be seen as sacrilegious; and this “pathological approach” to ancient heritage created problems of identity and obliged the Greek nation to confront its potential pasts: “Were the Modern Greeks to feel and act as heirs of the Byzantines or as heirs of the Hellenes? Alternatively, were they to assert their spiritual independence against both these Greek pasts?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420639">25</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Until 1821, we had no problem of dealing with our ancient heritage . . . we never felt the need to question our living tradition. . . . It was only after 1821, or perhaps a little earlier, that there appeared here cases of <italic>pathological nostalgia</italic> for the glory of ancient Greece, problems centering on ruins and statues, controversies and dialogues in which the main characters were “the ancient monuments and the contemporary sorrow. . . .” And, it was Europe that set us hunting in that direction; left to ourselves, we had managed to solve our problems of identity quite successfully over the nearly two thousand years of our history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420639">26</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, as indicated by Zissimos Lorenzatos (in 1980), when the country’s ancient heritage was manifested as a political ideology that then became a hegemonic social and political force, the nation’s identity started to appear as a significant problem of the political and cultural domains (such as literature, art, and architecture); and tensions between the “lived” and “imagined” and the “real” and “ideal” reached a point of self-estrangement.</p>
<p>The argument related to the mutual and complex relations among Hellenization, modernization, and tradition and the tension between the real and ideal are well exemplified in the Plaka area. The way in which existing classical monuments were appreciated and urban houses constructed as <italic>monuments of everyday life</italic> provides illustrative evidence of this argument.</p>

<title>A National Project: Localizing European Neoclassicism in the Hellenic Past</title>
<p>The objective of the Greek national project was to establish a new social order that had been borrowed from the West yet reformulated to accomplish the “idealized” Hellenic tradition. The aim was to construct a collective Hellenic national imagination, which was actually pseudo-nationalism in the sense that the dominant trend, which had been seen everywhere in Europe, was adjusted to be <italic>the</italic> national style of modern Greece. Classicism, as a symbol of an imaginary root or past, became a means of representation; yet each social formation and geography assimilated to it according to its own local knowledge and produced its own self-image. By utilizing the very tools of neoclassicism, each constituted an imagined community of its own, along with its suggested spatial practices. How the “ideal” was perceived by each society and became <italic>the symbol</italic> of that society was prominent in the discussion of how different meanings and symbols were assigned to the classical past for different reasons, and with different expectations. Related to this discussion, Bastéa states,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Neoclassical architecture . . . was at once the international <italic>and</italic> the national style in nineteenth-century Greece. . . . While the new public structures shared a common <italic>stylistic</italic> vocabulary with other European buildings, they carried specific <italic>symbolic</italic> meanings for the Greek population as function of local history and culture. Thus, while the formal characteristics of the archaeological museum were by no means unique to Athens, their symbolic significance became firmly rooted in the nation’s modern history. That was also the aim of the emerging architectural ideology in Greece: to develop a national mirror that reflected the international neoclassical style as a uniquely Greek creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420639">27</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The historical reference was selectively chosen for the reconstitution of the liberated Greek identity, with emphasis on the occidental character of “Greek(ness).” For the Eurocentric Greek intellectuals who had fought for political liberation from the Ottomans, the Ottomans or Turks were symbols of the East, of the Oriental. Accordingly, it became inescapable to perceive the Turkish as “other,” with its all-pejorative connotations, when promoting and constructing the Western character of the Greek identity. In the Greek language, East is known as <italic>Anatole</italic>, coming from the particular geography of Anatolia, and its multiple social symbols that exist in the collective memory. Political and cultural strategies insisted on the civilization of Greece by conquering the East through the light of the West. Here, the East became a provocative instrument or an image to be conquered; and in particular, the East became provocative when it referred to the cultural center of the “Great Idea,” namely Constantinople. To move the center from Constantinople to Athens, Athens had to be a European city, which would then be adorned with neoclassical buildings to house both public and residential functions.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>By the turn of the twentieth century, . . . its [the Great Idea] cultural epicenter was gradually shifted from Constantinople to Athens. The extraordinary investment represented in the building program, at both the civic and the residential level, coupled with the development of arts and letters in Athens, gradually strengthened the position of the capital among the Greeks, within and outside the national borders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420639">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Localizing contemporary European neoclassicism in the Hellenic past was a national project that intended both to liberate the country from European dependence by locating itself in the Hellenic heritage and also to gain the right to be treated as European equals. For example, the constitution of Katharevousa as a national (neoclassical) language was an attempt to fortify the Hellenic character; “it was an attempt to take internal and external control in a game where the definition of Greek culture was still largely in foreign hands.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420639">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>National concerns of the emergent Greek bourgeoisie necessitated a monumentalization of the elements of Hellenic culture, and the removal of all social and spatial codes, images, and symbols associated with the East. This bureaucratic management of identity through this monumentalization of the reality resulted in tensions between official history and personal histories, and the question of <italic>whose</italic> history would construct the identity became crucial. Herzfeld refers to the historical ideals of official discourse as “monumental time,” and the reality of everyday life practices as “social time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420639">30</xref></sup> Monumental time “encounters events as realizations of some supreme destiny, and reduces social experience to collective predictability. Its main focus is on the past—a past constituted by categories and stereotypes. . . . [I]t is the time frame of the nation state.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420639">31</xref></sup> However, social time “is the time that gives events their reality, because it encounters each as one of a kind.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420639">32</xref></sup> In the construction of the Greek national identity, these conflicting times emerged with conflicting identities; the idealism of the Greek nationalist imagination and the reality of the living tradition were in contrast to each other. Monumental time rephrased all the familiar expressions in the new vocabulary of neoclassicism. In other words, as stated by Arnold Toynbee, “[the West] has been new wine poured suddenly and clumsily into old bottles.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420639">33</xref></sup> These “old bottles,” or the notions and symbols of the living tradition, represented the negative <italic>other</italic>, in that they resembled the East. The meaning of the nation was sought in the classical past, not in the living tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420639">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The way intellectuals and bureaucrats perceived neoclassicism as the ideal of the new nation resulted in an “imagined” Hellenic community and pseudo nationalism with supporting architectural practices. Manos Biris remarks,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>In the last third of the nineteenth century, . . . urban architecture in Greece continued to be imbued with the powerful tradition of <italic>local neoclassicism</italic>. That tradition was the expression of a morphological system which had been <italic>established</italic> as early as 1840, with the architects of the Bavarian King Otto as its pioneers, on the basis of a dogmatic approach to the ancient Classical monuments of Athens, the new capital of the liberated nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211420639">35</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>How Europe imagined Greece also became significant in the construction of its history, its social space, and its capital city, Athens. Western <italic>philhellenes</italic> (friends of Greeks) helped to realize the dream of a new Greece with Athens as its capital, although these were men and institutions that had little connection with the contemporary Greek reality. As such, Biris’s remark indicates a dilemma in the nation-making process that had both liberating and colonizing results: “local neoclassicism,” known also as “Athenian neoclassicism,” in architecture was <italic>established</italic> by the Bavarians with reference to the classical monuments of Athens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420639">36</xref></sup> This establishment was a part of the nation-making project, which was seen as a return to the cultural leadership of Europe, and as an attempt to liberate and to become equal with the West.</p>
<p>In an article titled “Authenticity, Antiquity and Archaeology,” Smith discusses “how some aspects of archaeology contribute to the nationalist ideology through the processes of dating and authenticating the nation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211420639">37</xref></sup> Particularly, in the nineteenth century, the assumptions of archeology became a powerful instrument and provided an effective image for nationalism’s rediscovery and re-creation of the evolving nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211420639">38</xref></sup> Archeological sites and findings, as concrete expressions of a culture, reinforced the image of the culturally distinct and rooted nation; and according to Smith, nationalism can be seen as “a form of political archeology” that aims to determine the genealogy of the nation.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hamilakis argues that archaeology is developed “as a device of modernity to serve the needs of the most powerful ideology of that modernity (nationalism).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420639">39</xref></sup> In doing so, he draws a link among archaeology and nationalism, archaeological sites, and nationalist discourses and practices. The Archeological Society of Athens (ASA) was established in 1837 to contribute to the recovery, the restoration, and the completion of antiquities in Greece. The first president of ASA, Iakovos Rizos Neroulos, declared “[t]he <italic>raison d’être</italic> of Greek archeology” to be “the justification of Greek national identity,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420639">40</xref></sup> explaining why the preservation of antiquities was instituted from the very beginning of the new state. The Greek nationalist imagination needed material traces from the past to define its <italic>topos</italic>, and to negotiate its political position in Europe. It was the imported idea of Hellenism that defined the monumental landscape of the new Greek nation, its imaginative territory, and <italic>topos</italic>. For example, the Acropolis and the Parthenon, being <italic>the</italic> most powerful symbols and representations of the new independent nation, expressed the uniquely intimate bond uniting Greeks living outside (diaspora) and inside Greece under the collective identity and memory; and the sacred sites of European imagination became also <italic>the</italic> sites of the Greek nationalist imagination. Europe so idealized the monuments and sites from classical antiquity that they were expected to represent a past that never was, resulting in this <italic>invented Greece</italic> becoming alienated from its historical and social reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420639">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greece’s ancient heritage has continued to live through its architectural edifices and statutes throughout the centuries; however, in crossing over from one political dominion to another, their symbolic contents have been transformed into another form. For example, Dimitris Philippides says of the Parthenon, “The fact that [the Parthenon] has managed to survive and keep its repute high . . . is the result of its ability to absorb new utilitarian models. Its adaptability—for example its shift from the status of proof of ancient glory to tourist tout—is what has ensured it of the power of collectivity in society, and thus the ability to reach and move the masses.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420639">42</xref></sup> The Parthenon, originally built as a pagan temple, had in history been converted into a Byzantine church, and then into an Ottoman mosque. Today, despite viewpoints that regard it as “international,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420639">43</xref></sup> it is in fact <italic>the</italic> national symbol of Greece, with the national flag placed deep into the rock. Modernity has created its own secular, yet sacred, symbols, of which the national flag is the most prominent.</p>
<p>Up until the War of Independence, the symbolic content of classical monuments was imbued with religious rather than national connotations. Ordinary people perceived artifacts of the classical past differently; as religion was significant in their daily life, it was mainly the church that defined their responses to the remains of the classical past. For them, the classical past meant a different world, a different mythical era in terms of religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420639">44</xref></sup> Nationalist attachments to classical monuments were put forward mainly by educated Greeks, who were not few in number, but were in a minority when compared to the noneducated local population. It is argued by some academics that the local majority seemed to have no knowledge or idea of the classical past, and remnants of the classical past were even used as a raw building materials for modern purposes by the ordinary people. As stated by Hamilakis, “[T]here is no evidence to suggest that the people of Greece at the time saw in these material traces the works of their ancestors, and that they created an ancestral genealogical link between them and these ruins,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420639">45</xref></sup> and as such it was the educated minority who knew and thought in terms of classical culture under the influence of European nationalism. It would be fair to say that the surviving monuments kept the visual image of the ancient alive only in the minds of those locals who had a visual contact with them; and it was only after the penetration of travelers and artists with an increasing interest in the ancient that drawings and pictorial images of the giants started to be documented and spread throughout the country. Yet, in these drawings, the monuments were usually appreciated as the “ideal,” as the abstract model of perfection; and the locals usually preserved “a conception of a mythical, superior race of giants, called ‘<italic>Linides</italic>’ (a distortion of <italic>Ellines</italic>/Greeks).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420639">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>An understanding of the local imagination and the social-political context in which architectural consciousness developed and produced its buildings can be found in the local press, literature, and folksongs. For example, the Greek oral folk tradition is essential in understanding how the local populace conceived of the process of building Greece as a modern nation-state. Some scholarly studies have shown that in the folk songs known as <italic>kleftika</italic>, which are related to the War of Independence and dedicated to the <italic>klephts</italic>, bands of men who never recognized not only the Turkish but also any other foreign domination, the ancient is not mentioned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420639">47</xref></sup> Although they are dedicated to the national war heroes, kleftika “do not display a clear concept of national identity,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420639">48</xref></sup> and do not explicitly refer to the Hellenic character. To secure the national identity as it lies in the European perception, there emerged official and scholarly attempts to relate Greek folk culture in general, and kleftika in particular, to the nationalist ideology, to the Hellenic thesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420639">49</xref></sup> Folk culture was “oriented to the problems of national identity and legitimacy,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420639">50</xref></sup> and was reshaped by the nationalist imagination in such a way as to provide validation to the nation. As such, it became a present-day social construct, referring only to the past, and alienated from the everyday life practices.</p>
<p>The Greek diaspora, or the exiled Greeks, who had converted to a Western way of life, returned home to show those people who fought for the independence how to act in a civilized fashion worthy of a “true Greek.” They approached the creation of a new society as</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>a rebirth of “true” or classical Greekness in the land to which that heritage rightfully belonged, but Greeks themselves had few such thoughts. They had known no Renaissance; and the thread of their classical past had long been woven into the oriental web of Byzantium. Their recovery of political independence was, to most of them, far more a matter of restoring the power of that Greek Christian Empire than of rebuilding ancient Hellas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420639">51</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not a surprise, then, that the living tradition did not absorb immediately the new concepts of national loyalty and citizenship. So how were traditional values linked to the bourgeoisie concerns of nationalism? How was a new local invented for nationalistic reasons to create consensus around the collective identity? Hobsbawm suggests, “National myths do not arise spontaneously from people’s actual experiences. . . . They are not generally part of the historical memory or a living tradition, with the exception of some special cases in which . . . a national myth was a product of religion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211420639">52</xref></sup> Religious rhetoric helps to link tradition to nationalistic concerns by highlighting “the persistent analogy between family respectability and national pride.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420639">53</xref></sup> The Orthodox Church, which had grounded itself on the Byzantine tradition, had a central position in the construction of the new nation. The church absorbed the politics of nationalism through the light of its religious discourse; and the imposing and operational role of the church reinforced the appreciation of the Hellenic past by Greeks.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When scholars and artists turned towards antiquity, the people generally followed. They did so readily because the revival of ancient Greek influence in no way provoked the opposition of the Christian Church; on the contrary, the Church gradually assimilated it into the Christian tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211420639">54</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>March 25, 1838 (Annunciation Day in the Orthodox tradition), was announced by the administration as a national holiday to celebrate the birth of the Greek nation, providing a link between the coming of Christ and the birth of the nation. This was an indication of the power of the church in the national struggle for liberation, in that they had achieved a merging of Orthodox Christian religious motifs with the national narrative. Victor Roudometof discusses the use of religious symbols in the construction of the Greek national identity: “[T]he establishment of the March 25 national holiday was the outcome of a political struggle involving different and competing definitions of Greekness, alongside the articulation of a vision for the territorial expansion of the modern Greek state. The recasting of religious identity in nineteenth-century Greece transformed Eastern Orthodoxy into a facet of modern Greek identity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211420639">55</xref></sup> Actually, the fusion of Orthodoxy and the Hellenic national identity was a strategic effort imposed by intellectuals and bureaucrats to integrate the local people into the nation-making process.</p>

<title>An Alternative Neoclassicism: <italic>Folk</italic> Neoclassicism as Executed in the Plaka District</title>
<p>Today, with its urban pattern, archeological monuments, and nineteenth-century houses, the Plaka district is one of the most noteworthy and symbolic spaces of the nation, in its representation of cultural heritage, containing both visual and physical elements of various political and social dominations that had been constructed on the ruins of the previous one.

<p>The local Athens population was able to follow the physical and social transformations in the new capital, which was being expanded with the addition of the necessary institutions related to modernization. Moreover, as they both used and lived among prominent edifices of the classical past, the visual image of the past continued to survive in their minds. The Plaka district, located on the northern slope of the Acropolis, has been inhabited without interruption since the preclassical ages, and thus has maintained a central position in the social-spatial history of Athens. The local population of Plaka was the first to appreciate the new architecture of the institutions of modernization by participating in the rituals and ceremonies that were housed in these buildings.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[O]nce completed, most buildings enjoyed general public support. Greeks learned to observe and participate in state functions while standing on newly paved and tree-planted streets in the presence of the king, the Church, and the government. . . .

<p>The emergent Greek bourgeoisie dreamed of Athens as a purified city, a European capital that had been cleansed of its Eastern (Turkish) image, bringing to mind the constitution of Katharevousa as the purified official language.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Around the middle of the nineteenth century, the tormenting question was whether the capital city of Athens, as it developed, had managed to escape from its “Turkish” past and resemble the European cities, which it took as its model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211420639">59</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>After the end of the War of Independence, Plaka, which resembled a run-down Turkish town, was of course neither the locus nor the focus of intellectuals or officials. As part of the efforts to beautify Athens, it was decided that Plaka would be cleared of the remaining humble dwellings to allow further excavations and to return the existing antiquities to their former beauty and glory. In 1832, Stamatios Kleanthes and Eduard Schaubert explained the plan for the new Athens to the public, in which they drew special attention to monuments from the middle ages and the Turkish period. Concerning the Plaka area, they declared,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It would be especially desirable to have the north slope of the Acropolis [i.e., Plaka] cleared by degrees of accumulations which have gathered through the centuries. In this region one would come on incredibly rich discoveries, both in art treasures and inscriptions of historical importance. . . . One may expect, therefore, to find not only foundations but also considerable remains of ancient buildings, as was the case with the Tower of the Winds . . . ; the existing antiquities (the ruins of the Prytaneum, the Monument of Lysikrates, . . . the Gymnasium of Hadrian etc.) deserve to be freed from the earth that surrounds them and from the encroachment of miserable shacks or modern houses whose proximity only hinders and disturbs the impression which the buildings should make on the spectator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211420639">60</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The efforts to clear the nation of all traces of Ottoman domination and establish the new nation-state’s direct relations with its noble classical past were all part of “a strategy of self presentation” to the West. According to Roxani Caftanzoglou, it was this strategy that elevated the Acropolis to a pinnacle of importance and monumentalized the domestic spaces around it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211420639">61</xref></sup> This monumental approach, in reference to Herzfeld’s discussion, was so reductive that it excluded the real practices of social life and increased the tension between “historical ideals of the bureaucracy and the personal histories of social actors.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211420639">62</xref></sup> Actually, the work of Kleanthes and Schaubert was regarded by “the Athenian citizens, . . . [who] readily agreed to yield their landed property and their houses to make way for the founding of the new city and for the contemplated excavations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211420639">63</xref></sup> Their plan for Athens was ratified in July 1833, and the decree to rebuild Athens as the seat of government was signed in December 1833 just after the Athenians gave assurance that “their community could make available the necessary buildings for the installation of the authorities, and that . . . [they] agreed to [the] expropriation of the land lying to the north of the Acropolis.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211420639">64</xref></sup> Yet the excavations were not immediately realized, postponed for many decades. Moreover, with no proper preparation, “public services began to arrive and to install themselves in every roofed area, even in the churches.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211420639">65</xref></sup> This resulted in great public dissatisfaction, followed by resistance and strong reactions to the methods and extent of the urbanization efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211420639">66</xref></sup> By the 1830s, with the increasing need for accommodation, the inhabitants had started to return to Plaka and made hasty repairs to their former houses or built new properties.</p>
<p>At the same time as the emergence of the new neoclassical buildings of the government (such as the Palace of King Otto, the cathedral, the academy, and the museum), new houses were being built in Plaka that were a <italic>folk</italic> expression of the official neoclassical architecture. Excluding a handful of buildings (e.g., Kleanthes House designed by Kleanthes and Schaubert in 1833) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0096144211420639">Figure 8</xref>), the builders of the houses were ordinary laymen rather than official architects. They took the official neoclassical style as a “model” and then adjusted it to the way the “folk” expressed and represented society and its space. Understanding how “folk,” as a product of everyday life, becomes a part and result of nationalist imagination is crucial in discussions of how the local inhabitants of Plaka became a part of the nationalization process. Actually, this process of integration of the local into the dominant political system indicates the locals’ growing awareness to the political events of the time.</p>

<p>The neoclassical style in architecture as a visual expression of what it means to be a Western citizen provided a social “dress” that Greeks had to “wear” to gain European support. This approach to neoclassical architecture was valid particularly for officials and the wealthy Greeks of the diaspora. But was it valid also for local inhabitants of Athens, or for those of Plaka? Or how did they respond to the new movement in architecture? Concerning this question, Fatsea states,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[C]lassicism in its doctrinal form of “neo”-classicism seized primarily the soul, and secondarily only the mind, of Athenian inhabitants. For most of them whose life had already unfolded among antique structures, their fascination with the new movement lay more in its power to form familiar contexts alluding to embodied memories, than in its ability to tie the country most certainly to the West, as the intellectual leaders of the State anticipated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211420639">67</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Fatsea may be right in her argument, but there is one point that should be made clear. Neoclassicism turned into a national public event that was to be performed in every element of life, from social activities (ceremonies like national or religious holidays, recreational activities taking place in the National Park) to spatial-material practices (as observed in the architecture of buildings). These events were political in their effects and constituted the social-spatial history of Athens. As long as local inhabitants participated in the public events, either consciously or unconsciously, they became an actor in these events, and in turn an integral part of the dominant Eurocentric political considerations. For the Athenian inhabitants, being an actor in such public events would satisfy the sense of belonging to the place, to the community, and to the collective memory; and thus for the inhabitants neoclassicism was mainly an expression of being a part of the community and collective identity. However, this was the “imagined” community and identity that had been created according to the historical reference, and remodeled in light of Western thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211420639">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generally speaking, a neoclassical façade of an urban house in Athens allowed the household to display and fortify the Hellenic character of the householder’s identity. The façade acted as a visual announcement of the occupiers’ Hellenic identity to the public. Although the houses were all alike in terms of the articulation of architectural elements on the façade (such as window articulation, balconies, and symmetry of the façade), there were evident differences between the houses in Plaka and the elaborate private residences outside of the district in terms of their plan layouts and the appreciation of new foreign architectural elements in the plan. In research on domestic spaces in the Greek village of Eressos, Eleftherios Pavlides and Jana Hesser highlight two main factors that were influential in the introduction of new stylistic elements to the façade and the employment of neoclassical features in the construction or renovation of houses in the nineteenth century: “orientation to the West” and the construction of a national identity that called for the modernization of houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211420639">69</xref></sup> The Greek modernization project requested the use of the neoclassical style in the façade and also called for the equipping of the interior with furniture and appliances; however, this could happen only in the houses of the wealthy.</p>
<p>The majority of private residences outside Plaka belonged to wealthy Greeks of the diaspora and had been designed by officially appointed, and mainly foreign, architects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211420639">70</xref></sup> The mansions of Stathatos and Psychas on Sofias Avenue, and of Deligeorges on Akademias Street, for example, were designed by Ernst Ziller (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144211420639">Figure 6</xref>). A house proposal (1838) by the Athenian architect Lysandros Kaftantzoglou, who had received training in Italy, illustrates how the Western way of life was integrated into the plan organization of the private house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211420639">71</xref></sup> The house had a formal entrance that was emphasized with columns; and this opened onto a central interior hall that provided connections to the separate rooms. The plan was symmetrically organized, and divided by partition walls into rooms that were designed and furnished according to a specific function, such as the kitchen and bedrooms. The main staircase was properly placed in the house. The installed appliances (e.g., kitchen fittings and equipment) were symbols of modern and civilized Greek living (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0096144211420639">Figure 11</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast, in Plaka, the penetration of Western elements into the house was avoided as far as possible. The conflict between the idealism of the nationalist imagination and the reality of everyday life resulted in a conflict of identities, <italic>whether</italic> houses were European, featuring a neoclassical façade to display the European essence of Greekness, <italic>or</italic> Oriental. This crisis of identity finds its expression as “our national monument,” that is, the monumentalization of the private house, or “my house.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211420639">72</xref></sup> In Plaka, becoming “<italic>our</italic> national monument” required covering “<italic>my</italic> house” with a neoclassical façade. This was the idealization of an everyday life that was Eastern in character with Western features; in this way domestic space became monumentalized in the selected Hellenic past. On the other hand, “<italic>my</italic> house” meant a continuation of a traditional way of life inside the house and the shaping of the inside accordingly. Consequently, the Plaka houses manifested the tension between the conflicting identities, becoming simultaneously both “<italic>our</italic> national monument” and “<italic>my</italic> house.”</p>
<p>As such, the Plaka houses are folk expressions of nineteenth-century neoclassical architecture. The interior preserved its folk character in a way that suited the requirements of the everyday life of the household, where the traditional everyday life pattern continued. Even with the introduction of some neoclassical elements to the façade, the use of space in the new houses and the way they were equipped remained basically unaltered. In contrast to the well-to-do family houses, spaces could be used for multiple activities, with the same rooms being used for such activities as sleeping, eating, and entertaining. While the existence of specific rooms with appropriate furniture and appliances in the houses outside of Plaka suggested permanency, the use of spaces for a variety of activities in the houses inside of Plaka suggested flexibility and temporality. No specific room was reserved for a particular function, and it was available floor space on which activities took place. Spaces directly opened onto each other in the absence of a corridor, which was an organizational tool introduced by modernization. “[W]ithout diverting from the idea of the courtyard,” the Plaka houses acquired “façades having greater pretensions, such as symmetrical openings and balconies,” as an expression of neoclassical architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211420639">73</xref></sup> Architectural elements of existing tradition, such as a courtyard with habitable and auxiliary spaces located around it and wooden-framed glass panels along a (usually open) corridor with a view of the courtyard, continued to shape the interior plan. The courtyard was the central open space shaping the interior, and staircases were placed so as to connect the interior with the courtyard and to ease the everyday life of the household (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0096144211420639">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

<p>On this subject, Herzfeld states, “His house presented a respectable outer face to the world, a celebration of embourgeoisement in progress. What went on inside was the family’s business.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144211420639">74</xref></sup> Therefore, in Plaka, the neoclassical façade was a cover or shroud masking the folk interior. The façade became a two-dimensional surface, a plane attached to mask the interior, providing the household with the right look and satisfying the main condition of being a civilized Hellene. The façade was a result of an (official) attempt to create “a more collective sense of ‘tradition,’ one that is more aggressively bourgeois and ‘European.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144211420639">75</xref></sup> Used for the idealization of the familiar and “Oriental” with the formal and “Western,” the façade became a symbolic and political instrument that was utilized to become part of the collective activity, and at the same time to hide the true existing tradition behind. While the façade suits European standards as an “image,” the interior serves for the realities of everyday life. The identities of “<italic>our</italic> national monument” and “<italic>my</italic> house” simultaneously merge and struggle with each other in the house (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0096144211420639">Figure 13</xref>).</p>

<p>This may bring to mind discussions of the dual character of Greek identity and life, which indicate a complex juncture of the Western character that is Hellene and the Eastern character that is Oriental, <italic>Romios</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144211420639">76</xref></sup> However, it would be a reductionist attitude to understand and explain the neoclassical houses in Plaka only through the complex juncture of this duality in character. As illustrated above, there was a complex reality that was shaped by the struggle to construct a liberated modern Greece and an identity for its inhabitants.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The dominance of neoclassicism in Greece and the creation of a local variation of that style . . . no matter how romantic the essence of the movement might be in its deeper sense, there remains the fact that, when coinciding with the period of the re-birth of Greece, it led architects and ordinary laymen into the view that they could thus build up a new Greece worthy of its ancestor. It enabled them, also, to feel that this was for them a lawful aspiration which could they realize with elements from their own tradition available at their very feet. This may also afford an explanation of the creation of a popular form of neoclassical architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144211420639">77</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Neoclassical houses, whether built by official architects for the well-to-do families outside Plaka or by ordinary laymen inside Plaka, were both a part and a result of the national project that aimed at localizing the neoclassical movement of nineteenth-century Europe in the Hellenic past. Even though they criticized the politics of the government, the local inhabitants appreciated the new architecture of modern Athens as actors in the process of building a new Athens and Greece.</p>

<title>Shift <italic>from</italic> the National-<italic>yet</italic>-International Style of Greece <italic>to</italic> the Traditional-Local Style of Greece</title>
<p>Having been derived from the international movement of neoclassicism, “local neoclassicism,” or in other words “Athenian neoclassicism,” became the national style of the new modern Greece. Over the course of time this transformed itself into a “historical order,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144211420639">78</xref></sup> and is now <italic>the</italic> traditional style of Greece. How an architectural approach that is seen all over Europe can be accepted first as a national style and then as a traditional style raises the question of who ascribes meaning to the built environment. It is the activities of the imagination that attach architecture to the national and traditional. Affixing national terms to the international requires a search for an imagined and ideal community that has been constructed on the basis of a model selected from the golden age of the past. The term <italic>traditional</italic>, when applied to architecture, is highly questionable today, being considered only as a selling point in tourism-based strategies to attract mobile capital.</p>
<p>With the emergence of various nationalities in nineteenth-century Europe, the notion of local became central to the construction of nations; however, this was a <italic>new</italic> local that was <italic>invented</italic> on the basis of the selected glorious past. Today, this <italic>new</italic> local has become a representation of <italic>old</italic>, and is now substituted for tradition. Local, which is much more associated with tradition and the traditional way of life, becomes a political instrument in capital-based strategies. Despite the elimination of spatial barriers in the current age, what is explicit is the increasing importance of local and locus. As local/tradition is assumed to represent what is different, it becomes significant particularly in tourism investments.</p>
<p>Tradition is not an outcome but rather a process that is embedded in political, economic, cultural, and social relations. A rethinking of tradition in relation to the current shifts in political and social domains is essential if one is to understand its use as a discursive act. Tools of tradition have always been dynamic instruments of political discourses and are utilized for the legitimization not only of a collective memory and identity but also of interventions into physical-spatial structure.</p>
<p>A program related to the protection and rehabilitation of Plaka has been ongoing since 1973,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144211420639">79</xref></sup> with the main goal of “[r]e-establishing a balance between the historic elements of Plaka—its monuments, houses, streets and squares—and contemporary life, a balance that has always existed in the area, but was disturbed in the post-war decades.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144211420639">80</xref></sup> The resulting situation in Plaka can be considered as successful, in that it instilled in the public mind a belief that the domestic area is an urban fabric worthy of preservation, along with archeological sites and monuments of antiquity, and as such has become a living quarter of the city. Rather than being reserved only for tourists as a museum object, Plaka is a center of Athenian everyday life, where public events in the forms of rituals, ceremonies (during festivals such as Easter and the carnival), and the Greek way of socializing take place.</p>
<p>For the professionals working for the realization of the program, Plaka is a symbolic space, which “forms a monumental record of the cultural effort of the people who lived there from pre-historic times to the present day.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144211420639">81</xref></sup> For a private entrepreneur, Plaka is seen as a point of attraction for tourists that should be enhanced with the establishment of supporting social activities in the forms of cafes, taverns, and shops to attract capital. For a shop owner selling “exact copies” of museum pieces and the Parthenon, it is his or her livelihood. For tourists, Plaka is the place to see in Athens where one can find the traditional colors of Greece. Some of Plaka’s residents may be unhappy with the numbers of tourists making noise while climbing the Acropolis, yet they may be pleased with its panorama. For some residents, Plaka is the pedestrian approach of tourists to the Acropolis and the city’s archeological sites.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>In the opinion of the inhabitants, foreign tourists are drawn to Plaka mainly by the Acropolis and the archeological sites as well as by the picturesqueness of the streets and buildings, and only in rare cases by the night entertainment. According then to the estimates of the residents, <italic>the reduction of nightlife in Plaka might not diminish its attraction for the tourists; on the contrary, the modernization of its buildings might</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144211420639">82</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Today, Athenians appreciate the neoclassical houses in Plaka as their traditional buildings, which are in fact the visual manifestations of the public effort in the establishment of Greece as a modern nation-state in the nineteenth century. These so-called traditional buildings are well-preserved visual documents that illustrate how the local became both the subject and object of the dominant nationalization process and took part in shaping the physical environment of Athens by producing an alternative to the official neoclassical style (i.e., the folk neoclassicism). Athenians like to socialize in cafes and taverns contained in the neoclassical houses and on the streets of Plaka. As stated by Philippides, Plaka is where their relations with the monuments both start and end.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[T]he pilgrimage is an essential obligation for those who come from afar “to climb the Acropolis,” but it might equally well not have the same value for the Athenians. Their relationship with the monuments is different right from the outset; they know that the monuments are “there,” and . . . they are familiar with them from photographs. They see the monuments from a distance as they travel around the city, and they use them as a point of reference—but that is where all contact with them stops. Climbing the Acropolis as a pilgrimage is seen as something of secondary importance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144211420639">83</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The inevitable relation between Plaka and the Acropolis, which is not mono-causal, as each constitutes the other, finds its expression in the way they are represented in political discourse and become a representation of the nation. Speaking in reference to the foundation period of the Greek nation-state, the Acropolis stood for the established, determined, permanent political “center” and was a source of illumination, while Plaka, on the other hand, seemed to be a place of temporality and the undetermined and was always changing in a physical sense and open to coincidences. Being located at the “periphery” of the center, Plaka has been the place where problems emerging from the center–periphery relations are reflected onto its physical structure and symbolic content; and as mentioned earlier in the article, the city plan for the new Athens initiated immediately after the War of Independence suggested maintaining the area to the north of Acropolis as uninhabited to be able to expand the excavations and to celebrate the glory of the Acropolis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144211420639">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1860s, immigrants from Anafi Island came to the city and built the area known as Anafiotika on the northern slopes of the rock of the Acropolis, utilizing the island style with small white-washed houses: “[L]ack of space and inadequate means compelled them to construct a miniature housing settlement. They were all a guild of island master builders.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144211420639">85</xref></sup> These illegal buildings were highly criticized by intellectuals and the local press up until the mid-twentieth century; and critics generally called for the demolition of the quarter. After his visit to Athens for the Olympic games of 1896, in the magazine <italic>The Century</italic>, Bikélas offered his impressions and thoughts related to the Acropolis and its environment.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>On the other side of the rock [of the Acropolis] the remnants of the old Turkish town [i.e., Plaka] and more recent hovels [i.e., Anafiotika], piled one above another, rise with defacing effect to the very base of the Acropolis. These are condemned, and will have to be pulled down sooner or later. The plans are ready, and only await an administration, which shall have the money, the will and the power to carry them out. The steep base of the rock will then be cleared of the accumulated rubbish and of the unsightly dwellings, and more relics of antiquity will, it is hoped, be brought to light. Plantations will cover the cleared ground, and through them the road now leading to the gate of the Acropolis will be continued all round toward Hadrian’s arch. The Acropolis itself will thus gain in height and beauty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144211420639">86</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With the elevation of the Acropolis to the pinnacle of importance as a result and part of the efforts to obtain European support, the settlements around the Acropolis (both Plaka and Anafiotika) became the spaces of struggle. By arguing the fact that “local populations . . . do not necessarily comply with hegemonic constructions of space and the meanings assigned it,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144211420639">87</xref></sup> Caftanzoglou explains “how a hegemonic vision of time and space that accords priority to antiquity and the monumental has produced a counter-discourse, in the form of ‘small’ narratives that emphasize the local and the vernacular” in the particular case of Anafiotika.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144211420639">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Greek nationalist imagination in the nineteenth century excluded Anafiotika and Plaka and treated these settlements as “other.” Today, this “otherness” has changed in meaning and content and has turned into “a positive self-enhancing value.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144211420639">89</xref></sup> With a skillful manipulation of the notions of local, vernacular, and tradition, Plaka and Anafiotika are now listed in tourist guidebooks; their traditional aspects are emphasized as being in contrast with the rest of the city. Plaka is introduced to tourists as a place where one can find a lively atmosphere, small picturesque squares, and numerous cafes contained in the <italic>old</italic> houses of Athens. Anafiotika, on the other hand, is appreciated for its traditional island-style houses and picturesque appearance and is treated as “an object of urban nostalgia” in the center of Athens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144211420639">90</xref></sup> Almost one century after the decision to demolish Anafiotika, today the pedestrian road inside the quarter, which welcomes tourists with a sign showing the way to the Acropolis and directs them to the hill, is properly <italic>established</italic> so as to fortify the image of an island in the center of Athens: houses along the road are properly painted in pure white, the windows are blue, and flower pots are arranged to fit in with the established scenario (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0096144211420639">Figure 14</xref>). In the 1860s, Anafiotika was a place of “resistance,” which indicates that the places were constructed using local knowledge of building, and not controlled by the dominant architectural practices. In contrast, today’s Anafiotika is a place controlled by the dominant processes embedded in tourism-based policies to attract mobile capital.</p>

<p>The shift <italic>from</italic> the national style of the new modern Athens <italic>to</italic> the traditional style of old Athens brings the Plaka district to a level at which it gains a power in <italic>re</italic>figuring the symbolic content of the historical “center,” the Acropolis, in discursive representations.</p>
<p>To conclude, the construction of Greece as a modern nation-state with Athens as its capital city was carried out through urbanizing efforts that imposed the patterns, norms, and values of the new social order to convert the peasant into the bourgeoisie and the inhabitant into a citizen of a new nation-state. In the construction process, the universal patterns, norms, and values defined by modernity were highlighted, yet they were deployed to create the imagined national specificity, with an emphasis on Hellenism. The nation-making project put forward the ancient as the symbol of modern Greek citizenship, and this shaped the perceptions, actions, and thoughts of the local inhabitants when constructing their social life and space, and in their involvement in the construction of the nation. The construction process prepared the ground for the emergence of alternative neoclassical architecture in the Plaka district, where ordinary Greek people started to apply some features of the neoclassical style to the façades of their houses, yet continued their traditional everyday life inside the house. Today, these folk neoclassical houses in Plaka are regarded by Athenians as their traditional houses. Actually, the folk expression of the official neoclassical architecture in nineteenth-century Plaka indicates the penetration of the bourgeoisie in the creation of neo-Hellenism as the collective form of tradition and illustrates how the local inhabitants adopted the architectural style of the new nation into their houses.</p>

<p>There are numerous academic discussions on the origins of the modern Greek nation and neo-Hellenism that attempt to show an uninterrupted continuation of Hellenism throughout the ages up to the present day, taking different forms and following various interpretations. C. Th. Dimaras states, “After 1261 we can say that Byzantium and Greece were one. . . . [Around the fall of Constantinople] [t]he passage from Byzantium to Greece was accomplished. And as we see the birth of neo-Hellenism emerging out of Byzantium, so in neo-Hellenism we see a Byzantium, which continues to live.” See C. Th. Dimaras, <italic>A History of Modern Greek Literature</italic>, trans. Mary P. Gianos (1948; repr., London: University of London Press, 1974), xi. In addition to this discussion, Apostolos Vacalopoulos argues that modern Greek history begins with the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade (not with the War of Independence of 1821). He declares that despite the decay and final demise of the empire and the effects of the Frankish and Turkish domination of Greece, the period between 1204 (when Constantinople fell to the Western crusaders) and 1461 (when the last independent Greek political unit fell to the Ottomans) was a transitional period that served for the emergence and development of neo-Hellenism.

<p>The classical revival in architecture and city planning in nineteenth-century Greece, the constitution of Katharevousa as a national purified (neoclassical) language, and the archeological activities (as the apparatus of modernity) that addressed the production of the national monumental landscape offer illustrative evidence of the relations between neo-Hellenism and modernity. I further discuss these issues throughout the article.</p></fn>

<p>Here, it would be interesting to note the comment of prominent Greek poet George Seferis, who refers to a much later period to show how the perceptions of foreign and traditional continued to be shaped mainly by Europeans. In his essay “Dialogue on Poetry: What Is Meant by Hellenism?” Seferis argues that the appropriation of foreign elements was a strategic motivation, something external and superficial, which did not retrieve the living tradition. He criticizes the fact that Greek Hellenism was not created in reality but rather was only imagined: “[I]f, in the realm of the intellect, European Hellenism was created . . ., our own ‘Greek Hellenism,’ if I may be permitted so to call it, has not yet been created and has not yet recovered its tradition.” George Seferis, “Dialogue on Poetry: What Is Meant by Hellenism?” in <italic>On the Greek Style: Selected Essays on Poetry and Hellenism</italic>, trans.

<p>On this subject, Dimaras mentions that “[t]he assimilating force, which characterizes the Greek race allowed it to absorb foreign elements to such a degree that, even today, despite all available research there is no way of isolating the foreign elements and of distinguishing the original civilization” (Dimaras, <italic>History of Modern Greek Literature</italic>, 4). For him, “the ability for a true assimilation” is the ability “for the creation of a new and original element in the appropriation of the foreign contribution” (ibid., xiv). However, there is no “true assimilation” but truths brought about by assimilation. Today, the notion of assimilation is highly questionable since it results in sameness and homogenization or, in other words, since it conceals differences, conceals what Dimaras sees as the “essence” of Greekness. In an appeal to so-called “true assimilation,” Dimaras exalts the Greek ability in assimilation to the extent that, in his estimation, “what the Greeks accepted from the barbarians, they improved” (ibid., xiv). This is a strategic attempt: it devalues “East” but at the same time values its so-called improved version. In another sentence, Dimaras states, “East and West are united on Greek soil and at the same time in constant collision” (ibid., xiii). This is still a problem of those countries, namely, Greece and Turkey, that locate themselves at the meeting point of East and West. Each country approaches the East as a strategic symbol, the use of which is closely dependent on the figuration of the West in the social imagination. “East” is either something to be appreciated (e.g., in tourism-based investments) or something to be devalued (e.g., in the creation of a “modern” civilization).</p>

<p>The government was unable to implement the Kleanthes and Schaubert plan and asked architect Leo Von Klenze to study a new city plan for Athens. “In its general outline, the Klenze plan did not differ from that of Kleanthes-Schaubert but, in order to quieten the turmoil, as well as facilitate implementation of the plan, Klenze reduced the width of the streets and also the size of the squares. The Klenze plan received immediate approval, but the Athenians were still unsatisfied because . . . without proper preparation, new major problems sprang up.” Zivas, <italic>“Plaka,” the Old Town of Athens</italic>, 22-23.</p>

<p>Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of “habitus” can be relevant in understanding how ordinary Greek people internalized the dominant social-spatial practices of the nation-making project; how their actions, perceptions, and thoughts that constructed society, social space, and life were shaped; how their tastes were produced; how their social practices were determined. Bourdieu approaches habitus as an important factor that is central to generating and regulating social practices that make up social space and life, frames for positioning oneself in the world, and ways of inhabiting the world. He defines habitus as “a system of durable, transposable dispositions” (Pierre Bourdieu, <italic>The Logic of Practice</italic> [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1990], 53). It is formed by internalizing the dispositions (of the social context), socially constituted schemes (of perception, thought, and action). The relevance of “habitus” to this article is that habitus provides a framework that conceptualizes the uneven ways in which the dispositions, the schemes, are gained informally through social interactions, through processes of imitation and repetition. See Pierre Bourdieu, <italic>Pascalian Meditations</italic>, trans. R. Nice (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000). These schemes and dispositions are significant in the formation and maintenance of a political and social identity and collective behavior. According to Bourdieu, new social-spatial practices could be better understood in relation to the habitus of the newly emerging bourgeoisie. He declares that it is the new bourgeoisie that produces dispositions being compatible with the conditions (including tastes in art, architecture, literature, and etc.) in which it lives and that urges both a legitimization of these dispositions and also their dissemination into society. This argument is applicable to the Greek case, in which the new bourgeoisie-produced dispositions went well together with the new conditions emerging with the nation-making project and nineteenth-century neoclassicism. In this respect, understanding the social processes that formed the habitus of the new Greek bourgeoisie becomes significant. At this point, a consideration of the questions of how social symbols (e.g., ancient, paradoxically, as the symbol of being modern Greek) were utilized to convey the sense of place and to define the social status in the social order, and how these symbols were left to general use, will be illuminating.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that when Greece became an independent nation-state in 1833, there was no school of architecture in Greece to train architects. Architectural education was first introduced at the Technical School in Athens, which was founded in 1836. In the foundation years of the school, European architects were taught architecture (which continued until 1843); yet the graduates of the school could not be granted with “the title of architect but only that of foreman, who would supervise large scale public works.” Until 1917, when an independent school of architecture was established, architecture courses were taught as part of the curriculum of the School of Civil Engineering.

<p>This dual character of Greek life is introduced in different ways by various authors, such as the prominent Greek novelist Nikos Kazantzakis, Arnold Toynbee, and David Holden. For example, Kazantzakis calls “the double-born soul as the essence of Greek existence.” See Nikos Kazantzakis, <italic>Travels in Greece</italic>, trans. F. A. Reed (Oxford, UK: Bruno Cassirer, 1966); Toynbee, <italic>Western Question</italic>; and Holden, <italic>Greece without Columns</italic>. Although their discussions do not dwell specifically on nineteenth-century Plaka (the main focus in this article), they state that the dual character of the Greek identity is a modern fiction created to understand the “essence” of being Greek, and in that sense it is a product of a romantic attitude search of an imaginary essence. In opposition to the tendency that applies binary oppositions to discuss the problem of Greek identity (such as Hellene vs. <italic>Romios</italic>, West vs. East), see Dimitris Tziovas, who argues the problem in reference to the relation between native orality (demotic tradition) and alien textuality (literate tradition) and states that this relation “is not one of rigid opposition, but rather one of intrication and enfolding” (Dimitris Tziovas, “Residual Orality and Belated Textuality in Greek Literature and Culture,” <italic>Journal of Modern Greek Studies</italic> 7, no. 2 [October 1989]: 321).

The urban revival of Plaka started in 1978 with the definition of the boundary of the Plaka area, pedestrianization and regulation of traffic inside the area, replacement or improvement of the underground service networks, and street lighting, which were the immediate tasks of the program. The Plaka rehabilitation project was awarded the Europa Nostra in 1982. For more information, see Zivas, “The Saving of Plaka, Athens, Part 1,” <italic>Monumentum</italic> (1983), 3-21; and “Protection and Revival of Plaka, Athens: A Program at Work,” <italic>Ekistics</italic> 333 (November–December 1988), 329-336.</p>
