<p>Nearly a century ago Sir Edward Sullivan published photographic facsimiles of the Book of Kells with his detailed commentary. The enduring popularity of the treasured gospel book, the most famous of all manuscripts kept at Trinity College Library Dublin, motivated several editions and many printings of Sullivan’s book, including a limited edition (1920) with the first photographic colour plates of its folios. In 1974, Thames &amp; Hudson responded to the demand with a slip-cased large-format book presenting 126 colour plates and a commentary by the historian of medieval Irish art, Françoise Henry. Since Henry’s book, much has happened in the worlds of image reproduction and scholarship on early medieval manuscripts. In their new publication, Thames &amp; Hudson and Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Library, have produced for academics, students, and non-specialists an excellent introduction to the splendour of the Book of Kells and to recent thinking on its significance.</p>
<p>The Book of Kells is thought to have been made about the year 800 at one of St Columba’s monastic foundations, such as Iona. It has a mixed Old Latin and Vulgate text of the four gospels, assorted preliminary texts (Hebrew names, <italic>Breves causae, Argumenta</italic>) and canon tables. Its decoration is considered a high point of the art style called ‘Insular’ or ‘Hiberno-Saxon,’ a synthesis of the Mediterranean and Northern styles available to the early Christian Church in Ireland and the British Isles. The manuscript is notable for its decorated canon tables, single carpet page of astonishing intricacy, huge incipits populated with human and animal figures, the clever designs of its hundreds of minor initials, its two surviving evangelist portraits that are complex statements of gospel harmony and divine authorship, and four full-page depictions of Christ that defy conventional iconographic analysis. Less well-known features include many ingeniously devised relationships between the decoration and the gospel text.</p>
<p>Bernard Meehan’s book and the full-colour complete facsimile published by Faksimile Verlag in 1990 provide the fullest visual surveys of the manuscript, but Meehan’s is the more accessible. His commentary informs the reader from multiple approaches. The first chapter sketches the historical background of St Columba’s monastic foundations, making some interesting connections with Columban concerns before moving on to the later history of the Book of Kells. Chapter two gives a tour of the manuscript, illustrated with full-page colour plates highlighting folios from all the prefatory sections and each gospel. Meehan guides the reader’s eye through the labyrinths of ornament with extensive captions for each colour plate alongside his broader commentary text. Other chapters offer introductions to ‘Scribes and Artists’ and ‘Physical Features of the Book,’ providing insights gained from Meehan’s unique access to the manuscript and relating his conclusions to other scholars’ interpretations. An especially noteworthy section, ‘Pigments and Inks,’ summarizes analyses of the pigments, giving most attention to the micro-Raman spectroscopy project led by Susan Bioletti at Trinity College, 2004–6.</p>
<p>Sandwiched between the tour and the technical chapters, chapter three ‘Decoration’ presents the most extended discussions in the book. Meehan begins with a section relating individual visual motifs to the western European context while warning of the conjecture underlying our visions of artistic interactions between far-flung regions. He devotes most attention to describing individual ‘Symbols and Themes,’ pointing out tiny crosses, chalices, and trinities that emerge from the enlarged details. He coaxes a menagerie of animals from the interlace, interpreting their scriptural references. A section ‘Interplay of Symbols’ covers examples of the linking and interaction of figures and motifs across and between folios as they create a visual commentary on the text. The two extraordinary intra-textual full-page pictures are briefly covered in ‘Imaging the Gospels,’ with references to recent scholarship on them. At the other end of the scale, ‘Concealed Illustrations’ goes into some detail on the commentaries that Meehan sees expressed in small human and animal figures that contort into letter shapes or embody marginal and interlinear meditational signs to involve the eye and mind with the word of God.</p>
<p>Meehan makes no attempt to determine the number of artists at work but summarizes analyses by Henry and others, none of whom agreed on the question. His main focus is the significance of animal and human figures and shapes such as crosses. On occasion, his commitment to identifying the animals to link them to scriptural passages results in over-interpretation and furthermore may limit his discussion. Acknowledgement of the role of ambiguity in Insular art could have deflected this risk while enriching understanding of the art. Nonetheless the non-specialist reader will learn much by following Meehan’s safari because of his straightforward approach and avoidance of diversions into contextual factors such as the complex historical situation or largely undocumented liturgy of the early medieval church in Ireland. A growing body of scholarship now exists on nearly all aspects of the decoration and its meaning, much of which Meehan includes in his notes, and the serious reader should look up the references for alternative and still richer interpretations of iconography. For example, Pulliam has much to say about the animals, references to speaking and hearing, and interrelationships in the minor decoration. Throughout the book, Meehan presents many new and valuable observations on all aspects of the manuscript and responsibly introduces the current scholarship.</p>
<p>Meehan’s knowledgeable commentary is an engaging setting for the excellent colour reproductions. No other publication on the Book of Kells, except the 1990 facsimile, has anything approaching the number and quality of colour illustrations. It presents over 80 ‘actual size’ colour reproductions of full folios and many details with much more accurate colour and greater clarity than those of the Henry volume. The new book’s illustrations moreover provide clearer images than those now on Trinity College’s Digital Collections website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php">http://digitalcollections.tcd.ie/home/index.php</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The publisher and Bernard Meehan have produced a highly worthy inheritor of Sullivan and Henry. Looking through the beautiful reproductions of the folios of the Book of Kells, with Meehan’s commentary as a guide, will be a joy to anyone who wants to explore the meaning of the gospels.</p>
