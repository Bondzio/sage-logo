<p>This publication provides an excellent journalistic account of Beijing’s physical transformation during the period from 1949 to the late 1970s. Composed of 10 chapters, the book makes a valuable contribution to the English-speaking literature on the conservation of historical cities. It could be the first time that readers conversant with English are exposed to materials unearthed from archives that have been in limbo for decades. The author has chosen two key figures to unravel the struggles between conserving and ‘advancing’ the centuries-old city of Beijing: the revolutionary government that had just come to power versus Liang Sicheng, one of the leading first generation of Chinese architects fearlessly advocating the protection of old Beijing from redevelopment. The result, as the author presents his narratives in the forms of interviews and archival documents, sadly, is that the former triumphed and the latter lost the battle. Readers are recommended to read how the ruling party pushed forward its socialist ideology by all methods and the intellectuals who were in the vanguard of defending traditions and cultural relics were defeated and even humiliated in the political campaigns (anti-rightist movement in ch. 7 and Cultural Revolution in chs 9 and 10).</p>
<p>Since 1949, the old Beijing has been disappearing rapidly, replaced by a so-called modern Beijing. Three historical events are held accountable: liberation, the Cultural Revolution and the commoditisation of urban space ushered in by the economic reforms. Although the author does not venture into the era of the economic reforms, its impact on the urban physical structure and streetscapes could be more drastic than the previous two political events. Once in power, the socialist government was understandably very keen on building a new capital for the newly founded People’s Republic of China. Socialist ideology, as the author maintains, clearly dominated the debate on the mode of unfolding urbanisation. As the urban transition occurred later, Beijing was to be transformed from the feudalistic imperial city to a socialist capital for the masses.</p>
<p>Transforming Beijing from a consumption city to a production city succinctly revealed the priority and preference of the new government for the future of Beijing. Understanding the urge to build a new capital, the well-known ‘Liang–Chen proposal’ proposed to build a new city beside the existing city. Juxtaposition of a new city with the old one aimed to give historical buildings and urban fabrics a chance to survive. The ‘Liang–Chen proposal’ by Messrs Liang Sicheng and Chen Zhangxiang, one of the pioneer urban planners in China, is elaborated in depth in chs 3 and 4 as the key theme of the book. The gist of the proposal was to leave the old Beijing wholly intact and build a new Beijing in the western suburbs, so that the old city would be the “museum of China” (p.152). Liang made tremendous efforts to convince the ruling party leaders of the immeasurable value of the old Beijing city.</p>
<p>Facilitated by the Russian planning experts who strongly advocated building a new Beijing if it meant that old artifacts were to be erased, the Communist Party, the central government and Beijing municipal government seemed determined not to adopt the ‘Liang–Chen proposal’. Ruthless demolition of ancient city walls, archways, gates and monumental buildings ensued. The book has documented meticulously the records of destruction. Unfortunately, the destruction of ancient Beijing is not presented in the book in a chronological order and the records are scattered around in various chapters. Readers have to piece those fragments together to have a comprehensive view. Beijing’s ‘10 major buildings’ in the 1950s, symbolising the advent of a socialist capital, were constructed around the Tiananmen Square area to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the new country (see ch. 8). Being one of the 10, the Great Hall of the People has become a political icon of the People’s Republic.</p>
<p>Readers will find that the conservation of the old Beijing was not a matter of urban planning or architecture. Instead, it was full of politically motivated movements of witch-hunting. Intellectuals led by Liang and Chen were persecuted in incessant political campaigns during the period (see ch. 7). The mid 1950s’ anti-rightist movement was one of the most notorious ones. One of the greatest strengths of this book is the detailed discourse in this regard.</p>
<p>As the book states, the communists did not appreciate the traditional and cultural relics that belonged to the past dynasties, andd their destruction has taken place mainly since 1949. However, there is a further factor that the author has overlooked. It is the people’s welfare. The deterioration of the city actually began after the fall of Qing Dynasty in 1911, when the whole country was in a period of lasting political and economic turmoil. Beijing had become very poor by 1949. Shown by author’s photo (p. 449), many courtyard houses were extremely overcrowded without basic facilities and amenities for residents to make a decent living, even as late as 2002. This is the result of population increase and housing supply lagging behind. The old Beijing was overpopulated. Courtyard houses, meant for single households, were allocated to those without a home. Thus, many households shared a courtyard house.</p>
<p>The ‘Liang–Chen proposal’ suggested building a new Beijing, but it did not mean that the old Beijing did not need improvement. It might not be true that the proposal was only “doomed for political reason” (p. 14). Transforming Beijing from a consumption city to a production city was both an ideological pursuit and an economic imperative. It equally emphasised the development of an urban economy which could benefit the poor masses. There would be huge costs for upgrading numerous decaying building structures such as courtyard houses and installing necessary infrastructure like sewers and drainage which were miserably lacking. Building a new city and improving the old city concurrently could well have been beyond the means available, while China was suffering from the trade embargo led by the hostile US. If a choice had to be made, ordinary residents might prefer modern housing to ancient structures, as the author reports that the walls of many towns were demolished spontaneously by the “jubilant masses” (p.134).</p>
<p>Also, it may not be correct to blame only the Communist Party for the damage. The government was ‘chosen’ (although not elected) by the people. The people were revolutionary then. Conservation needs rules and rule-abiding citizens. As the stories told in chapter 6 “Perplexities of the wise” reveal, state bodies occupied courtyard houses without consulting the municipal urban planning commission. Large compounds (about 25 000 of those gated enclaves up to the 1980s; p. 264) were created spontaneously by colleges, army units and state-owned enterprises. The master plan seemed not to have been observed at all. Without an adequate legal system, even if the ‘Liang–Chen proposal’ had been adopted, the old Beijing would not have been preserved as the ‘museum of China’.</p>
<p>The book is not without its shortcomings. It appears somewhat disorganised and overwritten. This may result from a direct translation of its original version in Chinese. Lots of contextual nuances and cultural insinuations could have been lost during the translation, as I can gauge, although I have not read the Chinese version. I can imagine that long quotations from the historical documents should convey messages hidden between the lines, and the implicit can be more revealing than the explicit. Too many and overlong quotations in English are boring and distracting. There are many interesting anecdotal stories in the chapters, if readers know the history—but some are not relevant to the theme, such as those in ch. 3.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the book is mainly about political discourses underlining the transformation of Beijing. The physical change of the city over the period has not been presented comprehensively, thus making the book less appealing to urban planners, architects and urban conservationists.</p>
