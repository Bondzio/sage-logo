<abstract>
<p>Drawing from existing literature, the authors conceptualized a two-dimensional framework of African American students’ academic contingencies of self-worth. The results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses with a sample of African American college freshmen (<italic>N</italic> = 330) supported this prediction. Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies were characterized by students’ self-worth being more wholly reliant on academic performance. Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies represented linkages between self-worth and academics where self-worth is reinforced by positive achievement but not necessarily diminished by negative feedback in the educational setting. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were used to test relationships between academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions, race-related factors (identity and discrimination experiences), academic outcomes, and psychological outcomes. Findings showed that Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies predicted less positive beliefs about Blacks and worse psychological outcomes. Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies predicted more positive personal beliefs about Blacks and feeling more connected to Blacks. Implications for African American student motivation, achievement, and adjustment are discussed.</p>

<p>Over and above the stressors that all students face, racial prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination pose situational threats that can adversely influence African American students’ educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411414892">Chavous et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095798411414892">Sellers &amp; Shelton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Smalls, White, Chavous, &amp; Sellers, 2007</xref>). The prevalence of racial biases in education has led some scholars to suggest that many African American students perceive incompatibility between their personal identities and education, leading them to disconnect their personal assessments of worth from the educational domain. It is further posited that disconnecting one’s self-worth from scholastic achievement compromises academic motivation and leads to negative educational outcomes over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). At the same time, however, there is empirical evidence indicating that students who strongly connect their self-worth to academics are at academic and psychological risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Luhtanen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, Cooper, &amp; Bouvrette, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798411414892">Crocker, Quinn, Karpinski, &amp; Chase, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411414892">Crocker, Sommers, &amp; Luhtanen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411414892">Niiya, Crocker, &amp; Bartmess, 2004</xref>). From these two perspectives, African American students face risks if their self-worth is linked too weakly or too strongly to education.</p>
<p>In response to this seeming paradox, researchers have asserted the need to assess variation among African American students as well as social and cultural factors unique to African Americans in studying connections between their self-worth and academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798411414892">Cokley, Komarraju, King, Cunningham, &amp; Muhammad, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411414892">Graham, 1994</xref>). Such approaches can reveal complexity in attitudes and behaviors that comparative research tends to obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411414892">Chavous et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411414892">Graham, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411414892">Sellers, Rowley, Chavous, Shelton, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Smalls et al., 2007</xref>), making within-group investigations particularly amenable to informing conflicting theories. Accordingly, the current study integrated research on African American students’ race-related beliefs and experiences with psychological academic motivation and performance frameworks to assess within-group diversity in how African American students connect their self-worth to educational achievement. In doing so, this study speaks to inconsistencies in extant literature on the supposed advantage or disadvantage of African American students connecting their self-worth to the academic domain and can inform practical efforts to bolster African Americans’ academic motivation, achievement, and adjustment.</p>

<title>Academic Contingencies of Self-Worth and the “Paradox” of African American Students</title>
<p>The current research used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker and Wolfe’s (2001)</xref> contingencies of self-worth theory as a primary conceptual framework for examining connections between students’ self-worth and academic achievement. Drawing from achievement motivation scholarship such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798411414892">Covington’s (1984)</xref> self-worth theory, as well as from frameworks focused on the implications of self-esteem instability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798411414892">Harter &amp; Whitesell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798411414892">Kernis, Cornell, Sun, Berry, &amp; Harlow, 1993</xref>), Crocker and colleagues argued that individuals evaluate their self-worth in various domains organized along a continuum from internal to external. Internal contingencies of self-worth, such as virtue, are associated with stable self-perceptions and more positive well-being. Internal contingencies are thought to be beneficial because self-worth is based on sources that are controllable and presumably stable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798411414892">Kernis et al., 1993</xref>). In contrast, external contingencies of self-worth, which are relatively inconsistent and uncontrollable, pose psychosocial threats. According to this model, basing one’s self-worth on academics, an external domain, exposes students to risks, including heightened ego threat, unstable self-esteem, negative affect, and lower levels of psychological functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798411414892">Crocker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Luhtanen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798411414892">Crocker, Quinn, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798411414892">Niiya et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although contingencies of self-worth theory suggests that there are few benefits to strongly linking one’s self-worth to academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Luhtanen, 2003</xref>), related academic identification scholarship posits that African American students underperform relative to other groups of students because they do not link their self-worth to academic achievement strongly enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). Academic identification perspectives argue that experiencing racially threatening academic contexts lead many African American students, especially those whose self-worth is strongly contingent on educational performance to academically disidentify as a means to maintaining a positive sense of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798411414892">Osborne &amp; Walker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). It is also suggested that over time, disconnecting the self from academics compromises scholarly performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, academic contingencies of self-worth research and academic disidentification scholarship pose conflicting positions on the utility of students connecting their self-worth to the educational domain. Complicating matters further are equivocal empirical findings within and across academic contingencies and academic identification research literatures. Some research, for example, has shown racial differences in the correlation between self-esteem and grade performance, one common measure of academic identification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798411414892">Osborne &amp; Walker, 2006</xref>). In contrast, academic contingencies of self-worth research indicates that there are no significant group differences in Black, White, and Asian American college students’ reported academic contingencies of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095798411414892">Zeigler-Hill, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411414892">Graham, 1994</xref>). As such, theoretically and empirically, academic contingencies of self-worth and academic disidentification frameworks inconsistently forecast how racial stigma may shape African American students’ connections between their self-worth and academics.</p>

<sec id="section2-0095798411414892">
<title>Academic Contingencies and Racial Socialization, Identity, and Discrimination</title>
<p>Importantly, the academic contingencies of self-worth and academic identification theories both consider how racial stigma may act as a meaningful influence on African American students’ academic motivation, achievement, and adjustment. Neither theory, however, delineates how race-related factors other than racial stigma may influence the ways African American students connect their self-worth to academics. To consider a wider array of race-related influences would necessitate a conceptual framework that highlights a more comprehensive sociohistorical analysis of African Americans students’ relationship to racial bias generally, and to educational attainment more specifically. In the present study, we speak to the importance of representing a more inclusive set of race-related influences by considering how racial socialization, identity, and discrimination experiences may shape academic contingencies of self-worth among African American students. In this way, our approach speaks to the dearth of research on self-processes and education among African American students. The present study also shifts the prevalent focus in studies of Black student experiences from a deficit model explaining underachievement relative to Whites and Asians, to a strengths-based framework that has the potential to reveal pathways by which many African American students perform and adjust well in college.</p>
<p>African Americans’ distinctive sociocultural status in the United States places group members in a precarious position with respect to educational attainment. On one hand, many African American parents and community members emphasize educational attainment as a primary means to individual and collective mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798411414892">Galleta &amp; Cross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Smalls et al., 2007</xref>). African American parents and community members often additionally convey messages about the potential for racial bias and exclusion in society and in the academic domain more specifically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798411414892">Bowman &amp; Howard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411414892">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798411414892">Neblett, Phillip, Cogburn, &amp; Sellers, 2006</xref>). These two sets of messages—that academics are important and that the educational environment may be biased—likely influence African American students’ academic contingencies of self-worth. Socialization related to the importance of educational attainment may promote a type of academic contingency where students’ self-worth is wholly tied to academics (Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies). Racial socialization messages about potential racial biases in society and in educational contexts may additionally lead African American students to maintain a set of more tentative connections between their self-worth and education. These more tentative linkages could allow students to simultaneously reap the benefits of academic achievement as well as protect the self when racial stigma is salient or when academic outcomes are less optimal (Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies).</p>
<p>The proposed two-dimensional academic contingencies framework is also supported by research on African American racial identity and racial discrimination experiences. For instance, research has found that African American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798411414892">Galleta &amp; Cross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411414892">Graham, 1994</xref>), particularly those with stronger African American identification and racial pride (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411414892">Chavous et al., 2003</xref>), often place a high personal value on education. It is likely then that students who strongly identify with being African American and have higher awareness and pride around their racial heritage would be more likely to connect their self-worth to academic achievement. Students’ identity beliefs and discriminatory experiences related to racial bias, however, may lead them to additionally develop our proposed more cautious Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingency. We propose that Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies may allow students’ self-evaluations to benefit from positive achievement outcomes while remaining less vulnerable to negative evaluative outcomes and experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095798411414892">
<title>Rationale for Self-Worth Dependent and Enhancing Academic Contingencies Dimensions</title>
<p>In addition to being conceptually supported by research on African American racial socialization, identity, and discrimination, the two predicted academic contingencies dimensions are supported indirectly by previous contingencies of self-worth research. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, et al. (2003)</xref> confirmed a seven-factor structure of the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale in research that first validated the measure. Of importance to the current study are the researchers’ results showing that the internal reliability of the academic contingencies subscale was lower among Black students than among White and Asian American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, et al., 2003</xref>). The difference in internal reliabilities provides some indication that the scale items were answered differently for Black students relative to other groups in the sample. The authors’ exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, however, sought to confirm distinctions across items assessing seven contingencies of self-worth domains. Their focus was not on examining variation in the factor structures of items within particular domains. Thus, in the present study we extend findings from Crocker and colleagues’ prior research by examining whether African American students conceptualize academic contingencies of self-worth in ways that are consistent with our Self-Worth Dependent and Self-Worth Enhancing representations.</p>
<p>The proposed two dimensions are also corroborated by our face validity assessment of the items comprising the existing academic contingencies of Self-Worth Scale. One set of items appears to assess the extent to which students’ self-worth is dependent on achievement outcomes where self-worth increases in the context of positive performance and decreases in the context of negative performance (e.g., “When I do poorly on an exam or paper, my self-esteem suffers.”). A second set of items seems to measure whether students’ self-worth increases in response to positive achievement outcomes only (e.g., “My self-esteem gets a boost when I get a good grade on exam or paper.”). As such, superficially, the existing academic contingencies of self-worth items appear to reflect the two proposed dimensions. In sum, three rationales—support from scholarship on African Americans’ race-related beliefs and experiences, evidence from previous contingencies of self-worth research, and a face validity assessment of an existing academic contingencies of self-worth measure—substantiate the two predicted academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions.</p>
<p>Moreover, if our proposition is supported and African American college students conceptualize academic contingencies of self-worth along two distinct dimensions, the dimensions should be differentially associated with students’ academic and psychological outcomes as well as with their racial identity beliefs and racial discrimination experiences. For instance, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker and Wolfe (2001)</xref>, strong, holistic connections between one’s self-worth and education are academically and psychologically maladaptive. Consequently, higher Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, which most closely align with Crocker and colleagues’ conception of academic contingencies of self-worth, should be associated with negative psychological and performance outcomes. Additionally, because Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies may be related to students’ belief that their educational triumphs are essential for the racial group’s success and for their own mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Smalls et al., 2007</xref>), we also expect the dimension to be positively associated with strong racial group connectedness (racial centrality).</p>
<p>Contrastingly, stronger Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies should be associated with relatively positive academic and psychological outcomes. This is because Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies signify a connection where self-worth is boosted by positive feedback in academic settings, but not necessarily reduced by negative feedback. We suspect that such linkages may be driven by concurrent messages that educational attainment is important, yet racial barriers may need to be overcome in pursuing scholarly excellence. Awareness of barriers may lead students to connect to education enough to reap the benefits from positive academic outcomes, but not so holistically that students’ self-worth suffers in the face of negative academic feedback or racial experiences. Similar to the Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, this dimension will likely be associated with stronger connectedness to African Americans (racial centrality). Additionally, Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies may also relate to positive feelings about African Americans (private regard) and to more pessimistic views of societal regard of African Americans (public regard). Finally, previous research has shown that racial stigma negatively influences connections between African American students’ self-worth and their achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>). Thus, we also explored whether students’ interpersonal racial discrimination experiences, one type of racial stigma experience, related to their Self-Worth Dependent and Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0095798411414892">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 330 self-identified African American freshmen (244 females, 86 males) were recruited from three, large, public, predominately White institutions (PWIs) in the United States. The sample included 141 students from a university in a Midwestern suburb, 80 students from an institution in a Midwestern city, and 109 participants attended a university in the Southeastern region of the country. The participants ranged in age from 16 to 21 years (<italic>M</italic> = 18 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.37). A measure of mother’s highest educational attainment assessed students’ social class (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095798411414892">Starfield, Riley, Witt, &amp; Robertson, 2001</xref>). Approximately, 95% of mothers graduated from high school and 48% of mothers attained a college degree or more. For all analyses, we used a subsample of students who had complete data on all study variables (<italic>n</italic> = 310, 6% missing data, 228 females, 82 males). The excluded participants did not differ from included respondents in terms of gender, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 330) = 0.46, <italic>p</italic> = .52, or mother’s education, <italic>t</italic>(324) = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> = .49. Students who were missing data were equally represented at each of the institutions, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 330) = 1.47, <italic>p</italic> = .48.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0095798411414892">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The data were collected as part of a larger investigation of college adjustment among African American college freshmen transitioning to PWIs. Participants were recruited by telephone and e-mail via a list of African American students from each institution’s registrar’s office. The data in this study represent the initial wave of investigation, which occurred in the first 2 weeks of the freshman year. The survey was administered in research labs by African American researchers via paper-and-pencil methods in small groups (3-10 students). On average, the survey administration took 35 to 50 minutes. At the end of the administration, participants were compensated with $15.</p>

<title>Academic contingencies of self-worth</title>
<p>The academic contingencies of Self-Worth Scale is a subscale of the Contingencies of Self-Worth measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>), containing seven items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095798411414892">Table 1</xref>) on a response scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Scale items assess the degree to which individuals connect their self-worth to academic performance (e.g., “Doing well in school gives me a sense of self-respect,” “When I do poorly on an exam or paper, my self-esteem suffers.”). Higher scores indicate stronger connections between students’ self-worth and achievement. The internal reliability for the current sample (α = .68) was consistent with alphas obtained for Black students in the study that validated the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798411414892">Crocker, Luhtanen, et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychological outcomes</title>
<p>Three psychological outcomes were assessed—self-esteem, depressive symptoms and perceived stress. <italic>Self-esteem</italic> was assessed with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095798411414892">Rosenberg, 1979</xref>). The measure consists of 10 items (e.g., “I take a positive attitude toward myself.”), which use a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>disagree strongly</italic>) to 4 (<italic>agree strongly</italic>). In the current sample, the measure displayed strong internal reliability (α = .82). Higher scores indicate more positive self-esteem. Students’ <italic>depressive symptoms</italic> were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depressive Symptoms Scale (CES-D), a 20-item self-report measure designed for use in the general population and validated with multi-racial samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095798411414892">Radloff, 1977</xref>). Participants were asked to report the frequency of 20 events (e.g., “I feel hopeful about the future.”) over the past week. Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>rarely, none of the time, less than 1 day</italic>) to 4 (<italic>most of the time, 5-7 days</italic>). Higher scores reflect more severe depressive symptoms (α = .88). <italic>Perceived stress</italic> was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which has been validated with college samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798411414892">Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983</xref>). Participants reported the frequency of 14 experiences (e.g., “felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?”) in the past month (α = .86) on a response scale from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>often</italic>).</p>

<title>College academic preparation</title>
<p>Students’ self-reported college entry standardized test scores (either the Scholastic Aptitude Test [SAT] or the American College Testing [ACT] exam) were used as a measure of academic preparation on entering college. We converted the scales to be on the same metric (using conversion guides from the College Board; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.collegeboard.org">http://www.collegeboard.org</ext-link>; SAT-ACT concordance tables available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://professionals.collegeboard.com/data-reports-research/sat/sat-act">http://professionals.collegeboard.com/data-reports-research/sat/sat-act</ext-link>). We felt that this variable provided a consistent measure of college academic preparation, given the vast variation in participants’ high school grading systems and metrics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798411414892">Greer &amp; Chwalisz, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Racial identity</title>
<p>Students’ racial identity beliefs were assessed with two dimensions of the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity–Short (MIBI-S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095798411414892">Martin, Wout, Nguyen, Sellers &amp; Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411414892">Sellers et al., 1997</xref>), racial centrality and racial regard. Racial centrality assessed the importance of being Black to students’ overall identity (e.g., “I have a strong sense of belonging to Black people.”) with four question items. The private regard subscale, composed of eight items, assessed racial group pride (e.g., “I feel good about Black people.”) while the public regard subscale, measured with five items, captured students’ affective beliefs about society’s views of Blacks (e.g., “Overall, Blacks are considered good by others.”). Participants responded on a scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Higher scores indicate stronger race centrality and more positive regard. The scales’ internal consistencies in the present study, centrality (α = .81), private regard (α = .76), and public regard (α = .75), are similar to those found in previous research that validated the subscales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411414892">Sellers et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>The Racism and Life Experiences Scale (RaLES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095798411414892">Harrell, 1997</xref>) assessed racial discrimination experiences. Participants reported how often in the past year they experienced 18 incidences of unfair treatment (e.g., “How often in the past year have your ideas or opinions been minimized, ignored, or devalued?”). Responses ranged from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>once a week or more</italic>). Higher scores on the RaLES reflect more frequent racial discrimination experiences. The measure was internally reliability in the current sample (α = .90), consistent with previous research showing the scale to be both valid and reliable among African American college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095798411414892">Sellers &amp; Shelton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Smalls et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>This study investigated whether African American college students connected their self-worth to academics in ways that are consistent with our conceptualization of Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies. The analyses involved three phases. First, according to established scale validation procedures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095798411414892">Thompson, 2004</xref>), the sample was randomly divided in half. With the first half of the sample, principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the factor structure for academic contingencies of self-worth items. Second, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the second random half of the sample was used to validate the best-fitting model from the exploratory analysis. Third, correlation and ordinary least squares multiple regression analyses were performed to test whether academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions were differentially associated with students’ race-related beliefs and experiences, college academic preparation, and psychological outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section16-0095798411414892">
<title>Exploring Two Dimensions of Academic Contingencies for African American College Students</title>
<p>The first step was to explore the factor structure of the academic contingencies of Self-Worth Scale for the students in our sample. Approximately 50% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 142) was randomly selected and submitted to a PCA. The emergent components were allowed to correlate by using a direct oblim rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798411414892">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>), and the Kaiser Criterion (all factors with eigenvalues &gt;1.0) was used to decide the data’s most appropriate factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798411414892">Kaiser, 1960</xref>). Two components emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 (accounting for 36% and 23% of the variance, respectively). Items were assigned to components to the degree that they more heavily loaded on to a dimension and met the conventional .40 minimum loading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095798411414892">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>). Using this criterion, four items loaded onto the first component and three items loaded onto the second component (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095798411414892">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The content of each component was analyzed to determine whether the items loading onto each dimension represented our theoretical representation of Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies. The first component contained the items: “My self-esteem gets a boost when I get a good grade on an exam or paper,” “I feel better about myself when I know I’m doing well academically,” “Doing well in school gives me a sense of self-respect,” and “It is important to me to score very well on standardized tests of academic ability such as the SAT or ACT.” This set of items is consistent with our representation of Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies. The items reflect a connection between students’ self-worth and education such that performance “boosts” self-worth and provides students with a feeling of “self-respect,” yet the language among these items does not indicate that negative academic outcomes reduce students’ self-worth.</p>
<p>Three items loaded onto a second component: “Whether or not I am a good student is unrelated to my overall opinion of myself (reverse-scored),” “When I do poorly on an exam or paper, my self-esteem suffers,” and “My opinion of myself is not tied to how well I do in school (reverse-scored).” These items closely correspond to our representation of Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, whereby students’ “overall opinions” of themselves are defined by their academic performance. In the case of our depiction of Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, and consistent with prevailing contingencies of self-worth theory, such heavy reliance on scholarly achievements as a source of self-worth likely makes students vulnerable to self-worth instability, leading to compromised mental health and poorer academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798411414892">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798411414892">Harter &amp; Whitesell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798411414892">Kernis et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section17-0095798411414892">
<title>Cross-Validation of the Two-Dimensional Model</title>
<p>CFA, which allows researchers to specify a scale’s anticipated structure a priori, was performed to supplement the exploratory analyses. Using MPlus software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095798411414892">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2007</xref>), two alternative models were estimated with the second random half of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 170). First, we tested a model where all items load onto one factor as proposed by existing research. The second model corresponded to our suggested two-dimensional structure, which was preliminarily supported by the PCA. For each model, multiple model fit indices were evaluated, as each index has certain strengths and weaknesses. First, the likelihood ratio chi-square was observed, where a nonsignificant chi-square statistic indicates good fit to the data. The likelihood ratio chi-square is sensitive to sample size and to the size of the correlations in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411414892">Kline, 2005</xref>). As such, three additional fit indices were evaluated. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is a measure of “misfit” that does not approximate a central chi-square distribution, is robust against the influence of sample size, and takes into account model complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411414892">Kline, 2005</xref>). An RMSEA of .08 is considered acceptable, and good fit is indicated by RMSEA of less than .05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798411414892">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>). Finally, we observed the comparative fit index (CFI) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), where CFI values more than .90 and SRMR values less than .10 represent good fit (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798411414892">Kline, 2005</xref>). Results for a one-dimensional model indicated poor model fit, <sup>2</sup>(14, <italic>N</italic> = 170) = 116.16, <italic>p</italic> = .00, CFI = .69, SRMR = .10, RMSEA = .21 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095798411414892">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, results for a two-dimensional model indicated better fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(13, <italic>N</italic> = 170) = 28.47, <italic>p</italic> = .01, CFI = .95, SRMR = .06, RMSEA = .08 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095798411414892">Figure 2</xref>). A chi-square difference test comparing the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models showed a significant reduction in chi-square values, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 87.69, <italic>p</italic> =. 00, further supporting the two-dimensional model as the better solution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095798411414892">Widaman, 1985</xref>).</p>

<title>Regression models</title>
<p>Ordinary least squares multiple regression models were used to estimate the effects of academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions on three sets of outcomes variables: racial identity dimensions (centrality, private regard, public regard), racial discrimination experiences, and psychological outcomes (self-esteem, depressive symptoms, perceived stress). In each model, gender, mother’s educational attainment, and institution (dummy coded with the urban, Midwestern institution as the reference category) were entered as controls based on previous literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095798411414892">Starfield et al., 2001</xref>) and in light of the reported descriptive analyses. Control and predictor variables were simultaneously entered into the regression models.</p>
<p>First, we examined the relationship between academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions and race-related beliefs and experiences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095798411414892">Table 3</xref>). The overall racial centrality model was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 303) = 1.55, <italic>p</italic> = .16, <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01; however, stronger Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies scores were related to more racial centrality, β = .16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The overall private regard model was statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 303) = 3.77, <italic>p</italic> = .001, <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> = .05 and explained approximately 5% of the variance in private regard. Higher Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies scores predicted higher private regard (β <italic>=</italic> .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and higher Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies scores predicted lower private regard (β <italic>=</italic> −.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The overall public regard model was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 303) = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> = .21, <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01, yet Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies scores related to more negative public regard (β = −.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

<p>Taken together, our findings reveal two positively correlated, yet distinct academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions among the African American college students in our sample. Neither dimension was associated with students’ reported academic preparation or interpersonal racial discrimination experiences. As expected, the dimensions were differentially related to students’ racial identity beliefs and to their psychological outcomes. Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies predicted more positive private regard (personal affective beliefs about Blacks) and stronger racial centrality (connectedness to Blacks). Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies scores related to lower private regard, more negative public regard (beliefs about societal views of Blacks), lower self-esteem, more depressive symptoms, and more perceived stress. In sum, the findings partially supported our original predictions and offer clear directions for future inquiries.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Between-group comparisons and a near-exclusive focus on racial disparities between African Americans and other groups of students have made race stigma perspectives quite prevalent in explaining African Americans’ academic experiences and outcomes. Research on racial socialization, identity, and discrimination however, show that for many African American students, the importance and value placed on being African American can be a source of pride and can also protect students from negative outcomes in the face of racial and academic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411414892">Chavous et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798411414892">Neblett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798411414892">Sellers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798411414892">Small et al., 2007</xref>). The present study applied such findings from racial socialization, identity, and discrimination literatures to research on self-processes and academic motivation to propose and empirically support a two-dimensional model of academic contingencies of self-worth among African American college students. This objective was informed by our observation that distinct psychological theories are in conflict as to whether strong connections between students’ self-worth and education are advantageous or detrimental. Our research was also driven by recommendations from scholars advocating for the use of culturally informed, within-group assessments as a way to clarify the assumptions that drive studies of motivation and achievement among African American students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414892">Cokley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798411414892">Cokley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798411414892">Graham, 1994</xref>). Such propositions led to our prediction that African American students maintain both Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies.</p>
<sec id="section23-0095798411414892">
<title>Self-Worth Enhancing Academic Contingencies</title>
<p>Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies reflect the extent to which self-worth is boosted by educational achievement, but not necessarily diminished in the face of negative outcomes and experiences. We posited that rather than completely disconnecting the self from academics when faced with academic or racial difficulties, some African American students may opt to more cautiously connect their self-worth to the educational domain. Speculating further, we expected Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies to predict stronger connectedness to Blacks (racial centrality), more positive feelings about Blacks (private regard), and the belief that society holds more negative views of Blacks (public regard). Finally, we anticipated Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies to be associated with more positive college preparation and psychological outcomes on entering college.</p>
<p>The findings partially supported these predictions. As expected, stronger Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies related to more positive private regard. Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies did not predict stronger centrality or more negative public regard. In some ways however, our predictions positioned racial centrality and public regard as proxies for racial socialization messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798411414892">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, an important future direction would be to investigate whether racial socialization messages are directly related to Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies, rather than associated with this dimension via racial identity beliefs.</p>
<p>The findings did not support our expectation that Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies would be associated with more positive academic and psychological outcomes, as scores were unrelated to students’ college academic preparation, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. This may have been because we conceptualized Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies as being protective when students experience racial stigma and other negative circumstances in educational settings. It is thus possible that higher Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies are less directly predictive of academic achievement and adjustment and instead, buffer the negative experience of racial and academic adversities when they occur. Future research investigating whether Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies moderate the association between academic and racial difficulties and motivation, achievement, and adjustment could inform this hypothesis more directly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0095798411414892">
<title>Self-Worth Dependent Academic Contingencies</title>
<p>Whereas Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies reflect more tentative connections between students’ self-worth and education, Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies represent the extent to which students wholly based their self-worth on academics. This dimension aligned with Crocker and colleagues’ conceptualization of academic contingencies more broadly. Accordingly, we expected having stronger Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies would relate to lower college preparation and more negative psychological outcomes. Similar to the findings for Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies, Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies were not associated with college preparation. The findings may have differed however, if students’ high school grades were examined, which might prove to be a more explicit indicator of motivation and performance, relative to the standardized test scores used in this study. Consistent with expectations, stronger Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies scores predicted lower self-esteem, higher depressive symptomatology, and more perceived stress.</p>
<p>The findings for Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies are generally consistent with our expectations as well as with previous research by Crocker and colleagues. The results however, complicate previous academic identification research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798411414892">Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995</xref>), which maintains that strong connections between academics and self-worth are necessary for sustained academic motivation, engagement, and achievement. In the current study, stronger Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies predicted psychological costs, which may actually compromise academic outcomes across students’ educational trajectories. Future longitudinal studies should assess the association between Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, academic performance, and psychological outcomes to determine whether Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies indirectly diminish performance over time.</p>
<p>Finally, endorsing Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies related to lower private and public regard, such that students who viewed African Americans more negatively and perceived more societal bias against African Americans based their self-worth on academics more strongly. Considered along with the negative associations found between Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies and psychological outcomes, the results suggest that personally viewing one’s racial group less positively and in the context of racial stigma may place students at risk for developing connections between their self-worth and achievement that are psychologically taxing.</p>

<title>Considerations</title>
<p>This study provides initial support for a two-dimensional academic contingencies framework, yet in interpreting the present findings, a few considerations are worth noting. First, preliminary support for the two academic contingencies of self-worth dimensions was found using an existing measure, not a measure specifically designed to test nuances in how Black students connect their self-worth to education. Thus, although our results support our proposed framework, one must refrain from making definitive conclusions until our hypothesized model can be tested with measurement items purposely designed to reflect fine-grained distinctions between Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies of self-worth. Second, the sample was predominately female and all respondents attended large, public, predominately White institutions. This limitation speaks to our inability to firmly generalize our findings to African American male students and to African American students who attend other types of institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0095798411414892">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Consideration of this study’s limitations highlights clear steps for future research on academic contingencies of self-worth among African American students. Future psychometric studies, for example, should investigate the suggested dimensions with items specifically created for the purpose of highlighting complexity in the ways that African Americans students link their self-worth to the academic domain. Also, it will be important for future research to investigate the proposed dimensions with a more gender-balanced sample and with students attending different types of institutions (e.g., HBCUs, private PWIs, etc.). In the future, investigators may also want to extend the variable-centered approach that we used in the present study to conduct person-centered (e.g., cluster analytic) analyses that examine how variation in Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies, within students, helps explain outcomes. Finally, a key conceptual distinction between Self-Worth Enhancing and Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies pertains to how self-worth instability may shape responses to negative feedback. Our representation of Self-Worth Dependent academic contingencies suggests that students’ self-worth will fluctuate heavily in response to negative feedback, whereas our depiction of Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies implies that self-worth will be more robust to academic and racial obstacles. Future investigations ought to test this contention directly.</p>

<title>Contributions and Conclusions</title>
<p>Notwithstanding these considerations, this study makes important theoretical and practical contributions to the study of African American student motivation, achievement, and adjustment. Theoretically, our two-dimensional academic contingencies of self-worth framework is the novel by-product of synthesizing social psychological frameworks (e.g., academic contingencies of self-worth, academic identification) with research on African American racial socialization, identity, and discrimination. Whereas many previous studies have focused on the implications of weak or strong connections between students’ self-worth and academics, we suggested that different <italic>types</italic> of academic contingencies have unique implications for students’ educational outcomes. In many ways, the conception of academic contingencies types is analogous to recognizing that private and public regard are two dimensions of simultaneously held affective evaluations that students can concurrently vary in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and that individualism and collectivism signify two distinct, albeit related worldviews. Hence, our framework allowed us to conceptualize an approach for studying academic contingencies that recognizes how African American students may adapt to adversities in the educational context in ways other than completely disconnecting their self-worth from academics. Specifically, the Self-Worth Enhancing dimension of academic contingencies, which embodies a more tentative connection between students’ self-worth and academics, complements the traditionally conceived notion of academic contingencies as holistic linkages between the self and education. Practically, this study has the potential to inform programmatic efforts designed to improve African American student outcomes and to bolster students’ academic and psychological resilience—not by identifying deficits, but by reinforcing African American students’ sources of strength. If educational practitioners, for instance, can help African American students build support networks that reinforce Self-Worth Enhancing academic contingencies, students may be able to sustain academic identification and resist self-worth instability in the face of educational and racial struggles.</p>
<p>Historical and contemporary discrimination create a unique paradox for African American students—education is important in moving toward social and economic equality, but the educational system is not always equitable in its treatment of distinct racial group members. Our proposed academic contingencies dimensions highlight a novel approach for examining how African American students may respond to these conflicting messages. In doing so, the framework attempts to reconcile prevalent images of African American students as inherently at risk for academic underachievement with the fact that many African American students excel despite racial stigma. Although a preliminary step, we hope that future work taking such a strengths-based approach will build on the conceptual framework put forth in the current study.</p>
