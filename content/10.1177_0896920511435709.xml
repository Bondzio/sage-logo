<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sociological imagination as conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511435709">C Wright Mills (1959)</xref> is a powerful idea that has captured many generations of sociologists and scholars and researchers in other human sciences who are interested in the problematic social issues that people grapple with in their lives. Mills argued that those sociologists who are imaginatively aware ask three questions of their work. Firstly, what is the structure of society and what are its essential components? Secondly, where does society stand in human history? And thirdly, what varieties of men and women exist in this society? Mills especially saw the sociological imagination in terms of making connections between ‘personal troubles’ and ‘public issues’, which feminism took one step further in arguing that the personal is the political, and over time this argument has become commonplace in sociology.</p>
<p>At the turn of the millennium, Colin Barnes, Geof Mercer and Tom Shakespeare called for a new sociology of disability that took into account the complexity of disabled people’s lives and the moral dilemmas of the disablement process. They argued that differentiation and the blurring of social divisions in the 21st century made such a task formidable but imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511435709">1999</xref>: 226). While the personal troubles of disabled people are evident in the many biographies and research accounts of their lives and struggles, sociology has traditionally had a poor record of linking them effectively to public issues. This article investigates the historical marginalization of the concept of disability within sociology. We argue that despite attempts within medical sociology, the sociology of health and illness, and the sociology of the body to make the concept relevant to the larger discipline, disability remains marginal to the sociological imaginary and thus its agenda. One of the key questions we ask is why is this so?</p>
<p>Many disability studies scholars have a sociological background or employ sociological ideas in their work. However, within sociology generally, disability has been marginalized, if not excluded, and scholars still struggle for recognition in the discipline. While Mills’s notion has inspired many sociologists, it is sobering to realize in retrospect that the sociological imaginary has often reflected biases within western society generally and none more so than the public exclusion of disabled people. Yet, we must also acknowledge that disability studies has for the most part failed to effectively engage sociology in dialogue about what it can bring to sociological understanding. There are, however, a range of binaries that create conceptual dilemmas in sociology, such as normality/abnormality, sameness/difference, public/private, recognition/redistribution, agency/structure and individualism/collectivism, that can be better illuminated by focusing on disability. Critical disability studies (CDS), with its reimagining of disability within the dynamic changes societies are currently undergoing – most notably the differentiation and blurring of social divisions Barnes et al. referred to – may be in a better position to more effectively make the case for disability’s significance to the sociological imaginary. But facilitating dialogue on the concept of disability between CDS and sociology may require attention to developing explicit strategies of engagement.</p>

<title>The Marginalization of Disability within the Sociological Imaginary</title>
<p>Despite sociological concepts, theories and methods being employed in disability studies, there is still little acknowledgment in sociology of scholarly work on disability that engages fundamental issues and processes of social categorization, embodiment, identification and exclusion. We searched 22 mainstream sociology journals by keyword and title for articles on disability since 2000. Of these, 13 did not contain any articles. The Canadian Journal of Sociology and the Canadian Review of Sociology had four and three respectively, of which four were by the same author, Tanya Titchkosky, a well known Canadian disability studies scholar. <italic>Sociology</italic> had published seven articles and, not surprisingly, these were by well known disability scholars, while the International Journal of Sociology had six articles, with five published in 2011. New Zealand Sociology had published two articles and Journal of Sociology (Australia) had one. Reporting these numbers starkly reveals the marginalization of the topic in the larger discipline. As we will argue, sociology has not significantly challenged and, in fact, has tended to tacitly accept the dominant hegemony that views disability in medical terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511435709">Oliver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">Thomas, 2007</xref>). Three subgroups within sociology – the sociology of health and illness, medical sociology and the sociology of the body – have attempted to incorporate disability into their agendas but with limited success. These subgroups or branches of sociology will be examined later.</p>
<p>In one sense, investigating disability’s marginalized status in sociology is somewhat misleading in that there are many sociologists who study disability. Yet, for the majority of sociologists, disability tends to be viewed as a determined empirical fact, while what we are referring to is a shifting and dynamic concept of disability. This is not to deny that there is some connection between these two ways of perceiving disability, but our thesis is that sociology has for the most part neglected the theorization of disability. New forms of critical thinking about disability are emerging primarily from the humanities but there is also some work with a sociological edge. The former is particularly true in the USA where ‘(t)he strong US tradition in the humanities, literary studies, history, philosophy and the emerging cultural studies has greatly influenced the development of disability studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511435709">Meekosha, 2004</xref>: 726–727).</p>
<p>It is important, however, to recognize that disability studies has roots in both the sociological perspective of social interactionism in the USA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511435709">Goffman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511435709">Gussow and Tracy, 1968</xref>) and Marxist, critical sociology in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511435709">Barnes, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511435709">Oliver, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920511435709">1986</xref>). Both approaches were crucial in framing disability studies in sociological terms and continuities with these perspectives can be seen in many current concepts. The former approach, for example, led to the introduction of the concept of handicapism ‘that allows us to study our own prejudices and to understand the social experiences of those who are known as developmentally disabled, mentally retarded, deformed, deviant, abnormal and handicapped’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511435709">Bogdan et al., 1981</xref>: 238), which can be viewed as a forerunner to the variously used contemporary concepts of ableism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511435709">Campbell, 2009</xref>) and disablism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511435709">Miller et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>What is it about the sociological imaginary that has made sociologists reticent to engage in critically conceptualizing disability? In order to approach this question, we need to clarify our terms of reference. Mills’s notion of the sociological imagination represents his understanding of what the ideal process and product of sociology should be; as such, his work has served as a beacon for critically and politically engaged sociologists. Indeed, the text from which the concept stems is uniformly taught in undergraduate sociology classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435709">Agger, 1998</xref>). Having undergraduates read Mills’s book, however, appears to simply function as an obligatory nod to the critical and creative possibility of sociology – a possibility that is nevertheless quickly obscured for many students by mainstream sociology’s other more emphatic and scientistic concerns: government agendas, funding priorities and narrowly construed ‘evidence based’ research.</p>
<p>The sociological imagination, as Mills conceived it, thus constitutes only one aspect of and orientation within the larger ‘sociological imaginary’ – that is, the entire complex of sociological interests, values and meanings. Our critique is directed primarily at the ‘sociological imaginary’ in this larger sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511435709">1</xref></sup> Yet, while sometimes employing Mills’s work to aid in our critique of the sociological imaginary, we nevertheless also acknowledge the gaps that underlie his historically situated notion of the sociological imagination; and these gaps sometimes converge with limitations within the discipline as a whole.</p>
<p>It is important to raise the issue of the neglect of critical thinking within sociology generally. This neglect has influenced the marginalization of a host of identity categories, such as women, race and sexuality, as well as disability. Mills had already in the late 1950s critiqued the sociological trend of ‘aimless empiricism driven by a methodological agenda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435709">Agger, 1998</xref>: 23), which he saw as overtaking a more critical sociology focused on investigating social problems. Agger maintains that this trend led to the ascendancy of ‘hypersociology’, which obsessively fixates on methodology, science-like legitimacy and the obtaining of grants. This approach meshes well with the current neoliberal, evidence based funding climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511435709">Frohmader and Meekosha, forthcoming</xref>). Governments particularly favor this sort of research. One can see how socially marginalized populations such as disabled people became favorite objects of analysis within this kind of sociology and associated research in social policy, demography and social welfare. Findings from this kind of research are often related to evidence based practice and policy formulations and are often part of a compliant research agenda being pursued by academics anxious to bring corporate dollars home to public, underfunded universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511435709">Kenway and Fahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A critique of the assumptions underlying the empirical ‘fact of disability’ has been slow to develop in sociology, unlike in early disability studies where the ‘fact’ of disability was seen as a social and political construction – hence the spawning of various sociopolitical models (e.g. the social model, the minority group model and the independent living model). It is true that the sociological subspecialties of medical sociology and the sociology of health and illness developed an interest in disability, albeit within an overarching paradigm of health. In the sociology of health and illness, the focus has often been on individual illness narratives that usually neglect political perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511435709">Barnes and Mercer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">Thomas, 2007</xref>). Within medical sociology the interest has not so much been in investigating ‘the meaning of the concept of “disability” per se, but in exploring the social dimensions and consequences of disability and its causes – at societal and individual levels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">Thomas, 2007</xref>: 12). While exceptions to this state of affairs do exist, in the work of such scholars as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511435709">Mike Bury (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0896920511435709">Gareth Williams (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0896920511435709">Simon Williams (1999)</xref> who have all engaged in debates within disability studies at one time or another, interrogating the conceptual meaning of disability attracts minimal attention in medical sociology and the sociology of health and illness.</p>
<p>In terms of medical sociology, this may in part be due to the fact that this subdiscipline is inextricably intertwined with medicine. As Thomas states, ‘Medical sociology and medicine have shared an interest in categorizing and studying the “abnormal” represented by bodily impairment – the former engaging with it socially, the latter biologically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">2007</xref>: 46). Thus, for many researchers, the concept of disability has been informed by the perception of deviance, abnormality and the tragic symbolism that surrounds it in everyday discourse. Medical sociologists also still commonly subscribe to the lay meaning of disability or its reworked version. Thomas notes, ‘In Anglophone cultures, disability refers to “limited activity” – not being able “to do things”, and a “disabled person” is someone who has a medically certifiable “condition” that prevents him or her carrying out the full range of age-related activities considered normal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">2007</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>One might ask, why does sociology interrogate some commonsense assumptions but incorporate other assumptions uncritically within its own modus operandi? Perhaps incorporating a static and normalizing understanding of disability is one way that sociology can manage its potentially threatening and disturbing connotations. That is, by leaving a phenomenon as conceptually uncontested, an empirical fact or simply related to the normal, researchers can move on to less threatening issues. It also conveys the normativity of sociology, as invested in the taken for granted, able-bodied subject. But assuming disability as fact or emphasizing its relation to normative status denies sociology a role in developing a more liberating and anti-oppressive focus on disability.</p>
<p>There are two additional biases and assumptions within the sociological imaginary that have especially prevented the importance of the concept of disability gaining a place on the agenda: an inability to be critical and reflexive about the issues and people worthy of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511435709">Lemert, 1995</xref>), and an objectification and implicit protectionism of what are perceived as less agentic, ‘vulnerable subjects’. We discuss these in turn.</p>
<p>While we acknowledge the importance and inspiration of Mills’s work, we nevertheless suggest that the sociological imagination as Mills conceives it is not sufficiently reflexive and unable to radically interrogate its own categories of thought. Charles Lemert observes, referring to both Mills’s and Gouldner’s respective visions for an imaginative and reflexive sociology, that a shortcoming of their ideas is the classic sociological faux pas of believing that ‘the world works in a definite logical way’ and an inability to perceive change in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511435709">1995</xref>: 10). In this sense Mills’s work converged with the sociology of his day and much of the sociology that follows him, which has functioned via an assumed, deterministic logic. Similarly, while Mills briefly discussed human variation and how sociology should study variable biographies within historical contexts, investigating ‘their intersection with social structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511435709">1959</xref>: 134), he did not seriously consider the implications of studying a diversity of bodies such as those marked by race, gender, sexuality and/or disability. Indeed, his chapter on human variation for the most part is taken up with discussing the departmentalization and boundary crossing of the social sciences at the time.</p>
<p>These gaps have their roots in the ways in which the discipline of sociology developed historically. Lemert refers to the Janus faced nature of the discipline: ‘Sociology from the beginning was both a prophetic voice criticizing modern society and a believing adherent to the promise of modern culture. Sociology thus, in both its professional and popular forms, participated in that culture’s witting and unwitting exclusions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511435709">1995</xref>: xix). While race, gender and sexuality were core issues in early sociology, the discipline for the most part developed ‘among men of the metropolitan liberal bourgeoisie, who could live on their family capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511435709">Connell, 2007</xref>: 14). From the 1960s on, however, sociology came under increasing scrutiny and critiques from a host of excluded and marginalized groups in the global North. While the scholarship of feminists, queer theorists, postcolonialists, African Americanists, black feminists and other women of color, among other intellectual and social movements, grew more and more incessant, as Lemert observed in 1995, ‘Among the human sciences, few other fields so resist these writings as does sociology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511435709">1995</xref>: 208). Tellingly Lemert’s list of exclusions failed to include disability studies scholars despite the fact that the field had been in existence since the late 1970s and in 1995 was becoming a significant intellectual endeavor with sociological underpinnings. Thus, the marginalization of disability and disability studies has not only occurred within sociology but also within the discourse of marginality itself, as until recently it was routinely omitted from any list of marginalized identity categories.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sociological imaginary has never truly embraced the intellectual imaginations from societies outside the dominant global North, such as the rich imagination coming out of Asian social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511435709">Alatas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511435709">Bhambra, 2007</xref>). Subaltern studies have succeeded to some extent in giving marginalized populations ‘epistemic privilege’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511435709">Bhambra, 2007</xref>: 27). Yet, critical work from the position of subaltern studies has not led to acknowledgment of the subaltern status of disabled people, perhaps because there are many disabled people who ‘cannot speak’ or communicate in conventional ways and the politics of voice demands that even the most marginalized have voice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511435709">2</xref></sup> That certain kinds of people and issues can be left out of sociology’s agenda, and also critical discursive communities within sociology, constitutes a failure of the sociological imagination. Paradoxically, critical sociology, as we will discuss later, has been a primary influence both in the initial development of disability studies and also more recently in CDS.</p>
<p>While the marginalized discourses Lemert lists above still have a tenuous existence within the discipline, disability remains a largely ‘determined’ and unproblematized category. We would argue that despite their historical marginalization, the members of these other social categories have been considered inherently more agentic within sociological thought than the members of what are termed more ‘vulnerable populations’, such as disabled people. We contend that the sociological imaginary as historically constituted has played a part in the more general attribution of constrained agency to those ‘vulnerable’ persons with physical, cognitive, intellectual or behavioral impairments. We further maintain that it is an inability to question such attributions as vulnerable that, in part, has prevented sociology from seriously contending with disability in its thinking.</p>
<p>That the vulnerability of disabled people is in part a social construction has been addressed by some work in CDS (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511435709">Hollomotz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511435709">Hughes, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511435709">Hollomotz (2010)</xref> shows how vulnerability is partially constructed for people with learning disability with the limited support available to them to develop positive sexual relationships. This recent focus on vulnerability in CDS has been fueled by recent work in sociology to reconceptualize human rights discourse within a vulnerability frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511435709">Fineman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0896920511435709">Turner, 2006</xref>). Turner, an esteemed sociologist of the body, universalizes vulnerability over the life course in order to argue that resources should be provided for those persons who are currently impaired. However, despite his good intentions, this simply temporally restricts the framing of disabled people as vulnerable to the present. While noting the importance of registering how disability is constructed as vulnerable by late modernity’s obsession with the body beautiful, Turner does not recognize the possibility that a future orientation may not be necessary to reinforce the perception of disabled people as vulnerable by the public and lead to curtailment of their agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511435709">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511435709">Bill Hughes (2009)</xref> is perhaps the subtlest critic of the sociology of the body’s recent incursions into disability and vice versa. He presents a global critique of those perspectives within both sociology and disability studies that tend to emphasize the general fragility of the body. In respect to Turner’s move to a vulnerability frame, Hughes argues, ‘One can appreciate that the emphasis placed on the natural limits of the body is an attempt to ward off the crass relativism of strong forms of social constructionism, but … there is a mistake inherent in the argument that makes disabled people of us all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511435709">2009</xref>: 402). He similarly argues against attempts to universalize impairment by disability theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0896920511435709">Zola (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0896920511435709">Shakespeare and Watson (2002)</xref>. Hughes’s primary point is that the appeal to an essential vulnerability and the universalizing of impairment makes the category of disability with its exclusion, discrimination and oppression ‘superfluous’. This trend may work to both deny disabled people’s agency and minimize the oppression they experience. In addition to ‘wounded’ (vulnerability), Hughes is also critical of other, what he refers to as ‘tropes of bodily difference’, which have been theoretically deployed recently, such as ‘monstrous’ and ‘abject’, which he contends, like vulnerability, are generated from a non-disabled subject position that cannot resolve a repulsion for the other. He summarizes his position thus:<disp-quote>
<p>Disability has had little impact on sociological theories of the body and when sociology ventures into disability it has tended to conflate it with an ontology of human frailty or gloss it with tropes that may be instructive about the generic or gendered modernist structure of exclusion, but it tells us little about the specific forms of invalidation experienced by disabled people. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511435709">2009</xref>: 399)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The denial of reproductive rights and forced sterilization of disabled women is a case in point of the denial of their agency and a very specific sexual form of invalidation of disabled people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511435709">Frohmader and Meekosha, forthcoming</xref>). Their very citizenship is at stake; they are excluded from civil and political rights as a result of lack of access to buildings, written material and so on. Within their daily lives, disabled people also experience oppression and discrimination which has real effects on their sense of who they are and what they can do; and although many disabled people may need reasonable accommodations and assistance to operate in an able-bodied world, they also do have agency, as is demonstrated by the very existence of disability studies and the disabled rights movement.</p>
<sec id="section3-0896920511435709">
<title>The Significance of Disability for Sociology</title>
<p>There are estimated to be more than a billion disabled people around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0896920511435709">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>). The marginalization of poor people and of disabled people go hand in hand. Thus, it is incumbent on sociology as a discipline, with an interest in social exclusion and injustice, to take on board the growing area of disability scholarship. We live in an ableist society and mainstream sociology, alongside other formal and longstanding academic disciplines, has a certain vested interest in remaining ignorant of disability, while maintaining the privileges that come with normalcy. For example, lack of access to the built environment, conferences, universities and the printed text are not issues most sociologists are concerned about. Sociology is entrenched in ableist language, theories and practices. Bringing disability into sociology is not only about bringing other embodied experiences to the fore, but also about recognizing and deconstructing scholarly work that privileges certain bodies over others.</p>
<p>Public sociologists calling for increased legitimacy and power of the discipline by reviving a critical conscience could well seek to do research in the extremely fertile growth area of disability. As Burawoy observes, ‘sociology is not merely a mirror of civil society, it can also actively promote such civil society. Here surely lies its distinctively public purpose to represent humanity’s opposition to the unbridled tyranny of market and state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511435709">2003</xref>: 5). Disability activists on the ground have assisted in generating a robust disability literature. These organic intellectuals, in Gramsci’s terms, are concerned with emancipatory politics, increasing the visibility of social movements and making links between theory development and social change.</p>
<p>One of our arguments is that disability can enrich sociological thinking on a range of central binaries such as normality/abnormality, sameness/difference, public/private, recognition/redistribution, agency/structure, and individualism/collectivism. Interrogating these tensions is central to debates in both sociological thinking and CDS. Yet there is rarely a mention of disability in contemporary introductions to sociological theory texts and sociological primers, including those that include new theoretical perspectives on the body (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511435709">Dillon, 2010</xref>). While introductory overviews of sociology, such as Giddens’s encyclopedic sixth edition of Sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511435709">2009</xref>), generally include a short section discussing the development of disability studies, it is often within a chapter that subsumes disability either below or following on from a section on health and illness; or, as in Sociology in Today’s World (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511435709">Furze et al., 2011</xref>), ominously group it in a chapter with aging and death.</p>
<p>Inclusion of disability in the discussion of theoretical debates relating to traditional sociological concepts or more recent concepts deriving from analysis of late modernity remains virtually non-existent. For example, the public/private divide, most critically discussed by feminist sociologists, has more recently been further problematized by the proliferation of the media and the fragmentation of everyday life. For disabled people the blurring of public and private has long been a part of their everyday experience, for example in the caring relationship, but the sociological insight that could be gained by investigating disabled people’s relation to this fragile divide remains untapped. This example also illustrates the normative bias of sociology, as the blurring of the public/private divide has been almost exclusively discussed in relation to the non-disabled majority. This example of the normative bias of sociology and conceptual marginalization of disability could be repeated ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Disability studies theorists have increasingly been turning away from the study of disability to what Lennard Davis calls the hegemony of normalcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435709">Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511435709">Hughes, 1999</xref>). Davis accuses the left, and ipso facto critical sociologists, of being in collusion with the repression of disabled people:<disp-quote>
<p>For many years it has become a mark of commonplace courtesy and intellectual rigor to note occasions when racism, sexism, or class bias creep into discourse … Yet there is a strange and really unaccountable silence when the issue of disability is raised: the silence is stranger, too, since so much of the left criticism has devoted itself to the issue of the body, of the social construction of sexuality and gender. Alternative bodies people this discourse: gay, lesbian, hermaphrodite, criminal, medical, and so on. But lurking behind these images of transgression and deviance is a much more transgressive and deviant figure: the disabled body. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435709">1995</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The historic and contemporary condemnation of disabled people and the barriers that restrict them from participating in a range of sociocultural contexts on the basis of their supposed ‘abnormality’ and their ‘deviance’ remain marginal in the sociological imagination. The norm, the normal and the abnormal only came into the English language around 1840 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435709">Davis, 1995</xref>). They are taken for granted concepts in everyday discourse, yet remain unproblematized by many sociologists. Davis argues that ‘the notion of normalcy makes the idea of disability (as well as the ideas of race, class and gender) possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435709">1995</xref>: 158). The implications of the hegemony of normalcy are profound. They extend into the heart of the sociological project, critical sociology and the production of knowledge.</p>
<p>Moreover, social and economic relations are organized on the basis of ability – nowhere is this more obvious than in the school, the college, the university and the workplace. Sociologists have questioned ‘ability’ in terms of race and gender, debunking the myth that if racialized minorities perform lower in IQ tests it is because of innate biological lack of ability, rather than issues of access to quality education. However, no such arguments are made concerning disabled people’s lack of educational attainment. Following Adrienne Rich’s concept of ‘compulsory heterosexuality’, McRuer calls this type of exclusion ‘compulsory able-bodiedness’, which he argues, like compulsory heterosexuality ‘functions by covering over, with the appearance of choice, a system in which there actually is no choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920511435709">2006</xref>: 8).</p>

<title>Engaging Sociology: Why Disability Scholarship Needs Sociology</title>
<p>We have argued that disability has been a major lacuna in sociology; however, it should also be emphasized that disability studies has not effectively engaged with sociology to make disability a more central concern in the larger discipline. While there have been some attempts by disability studies scholars to get sociology to stand up and take notice, such as developing theme and interest groups in national sociological associations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511435709">4</xref></sup> these overtures have so far not been effective. In fact, it was not until the 1980s that a sustained critique of sociology from disability studies emerged in the USA. Irving Zola, a founding member of the Society of Disability Studies and a medical sociologist, followed Mills in a quest for ‘truth, reason and freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511435709">Williams, 1996</xref>). While his earlier work concentrated on health care, Zola made an initial move into disability studies via his own autobiographical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0896920511435709">1982</xref>). He thus attempted the intellectual journey from studies of health and medicine to understanding disability through his subjective and private experiences – a path that Mills would have approved of. In a presentation on 14 August 1990, when he received an award for distinguished scholarship in medical sociology, Zola reminded his audience of the ongoing struggle within sociology to prevent the discipline becoming ‘so analytic that it becomes too distant from those it is trying to study’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0896920511435709">1991</xref>: 2). Arthur Frank, also a sociologist, similarly took his colleagues to task for not seeking to understand that sociology is embodied. ‘What we need is the reframing of the traditional concerns of social theory – order, function, contingency, rationality and conflict could be mentioned – to understand these as categorical projections of embodiment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511435709">1990</xref>: 106). Both Zola and Frank primarily had the study of disability and chronic illness in mind for a critical sociology of embodiment.</p>
<p>Other disability studies scholars have also pointed out the inadequacy of the traditional conceptualization of disability within the larger discipline of sociology. For example, British sociologist Mike Oliver criticized sociology for ‘having done little except reproduce the medical approach to the issue’, but argued that sociology had a part to play in eradicating disability oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511435709">1990</xref>: xi, 131). In his work, Oliver employed a Marxist approach derived from sociology to analyze economic and political factors that led to the marginalization of disabled people. As noted in our introduction, at the turn of the millennium, Barnes, Mercer and Shakespeare were also proponents of the idea to bring a sociological imagination to disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511435709">1999</xref>). While they paid lip service to the blurring of boundaries and intersectionality, their more basic goal was to make the links between social structure and lived experience more apparent in a ‘new’ sociology of disability. These researchers argued that the way forward was to use the social model of disability as a guide in conjunction with an emancipatory paradigm of research. Barnes, Mercer and Shakespeare’s call for a new sociology of disability was thus in large part simply an argument for sociologists to take on a disability studies perspective circa the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Allan has argued, ‘The sociology of disability, as a field, has struggled to maintain both a presence and an authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511435709">2010</xref>: 604). A recent collection edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0896920511435709">Scambler and Scambler (2010)</xref> seems more interested in bridging the divide between medical sociologists/sociologists of health and illness and disability studies scholars working in the sociology of disability than in engaging sociology in a larger debate on the meaning of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511435709">5</xref></sup> Not that this tack is inherently wrong but such dialogue tends to restrict itself to maintaining and/or combining the epistemological and theoretical perspectives of these different approaches. Certainly, however, the recent ‘boundary crossings’ by some disability studies scholars and medical sociologists that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0896920511435709">Thomas (2010</xref>: 46) refers to will be fruitful for the future of the sociology of disability. For example, Shakespeare and Watson argue for a sociology of disability that ‘will incorporate medical, psychological, and political dimensions of disabled people’s experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511435709">2010</xref>: 58). The sociology of disability would then incorporate the space for disabled people to discuss their experience of impairment. Similarly, those who do not see themselves as disabled but identify with a diagnostic category would also be able to discuss their different forms of embodiment and their lived experience. The debate between medical sociologists and CDS scholars should not prevent a robust development of the sociology of disability. This is in line with the development of CDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511435709">Meekosha and Shuttleworth, 2009</xref>). Yet we would call for more explicit engagement with larger sociological debates and issues.</p>
<p>Disability studies has also been caught up in a major political project of sociopolitical change. The members of the community of scholars were, and still are, closely aligned with the disability social movement. Disabled academics and their allies have spent inestimable time and energy in developing strategic goals in consort with activist groups. Engaging with established disciplines has sometimes of necessity taken second place to developing an interdisciplinary framework that reflects and enables the development of the goals of national and international social movements of disabled people.</p>
<p>We would suggest that disability studies scholars contributing to the sociology of disability have thus never convincingly made the case to sociology as to why the larger discipline should be interested in disability as a concept. We argue that disability complicates sociological research, both methodologically and conceptually. Analyses of disabled people’s lives should open up sociological concepts in the process, showing the strength of disability to illuminate these ideas. We would add that many non-disabled sociologists find it hard to engage with ‘disabled people as sociologists’ and may therefore be more seduced by the traditional subgenres of medical sociology and the sociology of health and illness. Indeed, disabled and ally sociologists often still find themselves marginalized because of their political leanings.</p>
<p>A pertinent question at this point is why does disability scholarship need to be recognized by sociology as a major player? One might argue that the exciting interdisciplinary space that is being carved out by today’s disability scholars renders this recognition moot. Despite disability’s troubled relationship with the sociological imaginary, there are several reasons why we view the strengthening of a relationship with sociology to be important. The most obvious is that sociology has since its inception been the central discipline that studies society! As we have suggested, what has been included and excluded in sociology, and the social sciences more broadly, has mirrored inclusion and exclusion within western societies generally. Indeed, marginalization of disabled people in sociology has gone hand in hand with their everyday marginalization in these societies. Being provided a seat at the sociological table, especially for disabled scholars, would act as a symbolic gesture of inclusion, at least within the discipline. Disability studies scholars employ many fundamental sociological concepts implicitly or explicitly in their work (for example, those related to social structural analysis). Scholars investigating disability issues have for decades been in the demeaning position of employing sociological frameworks but have been ghettoized, as we have seen above, not finding their work mentioned in the larger sociological debates.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of lineage/heritage. The subversive history of imaginative deployment of critical reason for emancipatory purposes that has traditionally fueled critical sociology has also been significant for the critical study of disability. Marx’s theories of the capitalist relations of production and Habermas’s understanding of knowledge constitutive interests are obvious examples that oriented disability studies, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Frankfurt School’s analysis of the culture industry, capitalism applied to popular culture via various media including radio and film, has also been subjected to a disability discourse. While more recent critical social theorists have not been confined to the ranks of sociology, critical sociology has maintained its enthusiasm for debating critical theoretical perspectives on society. Thus, we recognize our common lineage/heritage with critical sociology and we desire to strengthen our relationship to this debate by continuing to critique sociologically relevant disability issues. We furthermore maintain that those scholars and researchers whose subject matter is disability must redouble their wooing of sociology, make explicit the ways in which disability can inform the discipline, and indeed strengthen their relationship by participating in the ongoing sociological debate over relevant concepts.</p>

<title>Reimagining the Sociological Framing of Disability</title>
<p>The current state of disability discourse is fertile ground for a renewed effort to engage sociology. Theorization of disability is presently a complex mix of perspectives that opens up the concept in new ways, in part trying to account for the hyper and rapid changes that late modern societies are experiencing and that disabled people, like anyone else, must negotiate. In fact, during the past decade a reimagining of the framing of disability has gradually been developing. Still in an embryonic stage, this reframing of disability owes much to the influx of humanities but also sociologically informed scholars. This reimagining of disability and society is indebted to Mills’s musings on the sociological imagination over half a century ago. Once again, disability scholars are attempting to make the private troubles of disabled people a public issue. That these troubles are now conceptualized to extend beyond material needs and accommodation and take up embodiment, the intra-psychic and the symbolic only makes his call more urgent today. The primary area in which this reframing of disability is emerging is CDS, whose development we briefly discuss in the next subsection.</p>
<sec id="section6-0896920511435709">
<title>Critical Disability Studies: The Sociological Imagination and Beyond</title>
<p>A dynamic discourse on disability is developing in CDS. The emergence of CDS came about due to the convergence of a number of factors. One of its major influences was the cultural turn that began to sweep over the social sciences in the 1980s and 1990s. Disability studies originally developed as the scholarly arm of the disabled people’s activist movement. Disability studies scholarship argued against individualizing and moralistic models of disability, such as the religious and medical models which focused on tragedy, cure and normalization, and argued for new sociopolitical models of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511435709">Albrecht, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511435709">Hahn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511435709">Oliver, 1990</xref>). British disability studies scholars drew primarily from neo-Marxist approaches and focused on disability as a social structural issue, seeing the category of disabled people as created by capitalist expansion and industrialization in the modern era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511435709">Barnes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511435709">Finkelstein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511435709">Oliver, 1990</xref>). In the USA, several sociopolitical models emerged, most notably the independent living model and the minority group model, which were consumer and civil rights perspectives respectively. US scholars were also influenced heavily by social interactionism and were more apt to refer to disability as a social construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511435709">Albrecht, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511435709">Bogdan et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511435709">Deegan and Brooks, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511435709">Hahn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0896920511435709">Zola, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The proponents of these models were heavily indebted to sociological thinking (e.g. Marx, Habermas, Goffman) as well as emancipatory politics. Increasingly during the 1990s, however, these sociopolitical models were criticized and found wanting as overarching theories of disability. There were calls for more nuanced analyses of disabled people’s experience that investigated culture, multiple identities, embodiment, impairment, representation and discourse (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511435709">Corker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511435709">Corker and French, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511435709">Crow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435709">Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511435709">Garland-Thomson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511435709">Linton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511435709">Meekosha, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511435709">Mitchell and Snyder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0896920511435709">Morris, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511435709">Paterson and Hughes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0896920511435709">Shakespeare, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511435709">Thomas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0896920511435709">Vernon, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The cultural turn had by the end of the 1990s become a significant trend within many disciplines and fields of study. In the USA, by the late 1990s, disability studies scholars working in the humanities were already having an effect on the type of issues being raised and the methods of critical analysis. An emphasis on the social construction of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511435709">Goffman, 1963</xref>) and the championing of a minority group approach to disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511435709">Hahn, 1985</xref>) were giving ground to a rhetorical and textual critique of the representation of disability in media, literature and culture (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511435709">Garland-Thomson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511435709">Linton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511435709">Longmore, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511435709">Mitchell and Snyder, 1997</xref>). In the UK, a distinction can also be made between trends in critical theorizing in the early 1990s and at the turn of the millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511435709">Corker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511435709">Corker and French, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511435709">Corker and Shakespeare, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511435709">Paterson and Hughes, 1999</xref>). As embodiment, multiple intersections and discursive aspects of disabled people’s lives were progressively interrogated, even dyed in the wool materialists such as Colin Barnes began granting more influence to the cultural sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511435709">Barnes and Mercer, 2003</xref>) or, as in the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0896920511435709">Carol Thomas (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0896920511435709">2007)</xref>, developed a more nuanced materialism in theorizing disability. Thus, CDS was born.</p>
<p>What is often lost is the fact that it was not simply the humanities that fed into the cultural turn, which in turn influenced new directions in disability studies leading to CDS. Sociology was also an important factor. Though during the first half of the 20th century culture was generally a marginal interest in sociology, there were intimations by some of the founders of sociology that it might someday become a primary focus of sociological analysis. Indeed, early on Weber himself had emphasized ‘that cultural beliefs and values matter in and of themselves [and] they shape social institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511435709">Dillon, 2010</xref>: 125–126). Culture managed to maintain a minor presence in sociology through the interaction of sociological and anthropological ideas, for example in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511435709">Marcel Mauss (1990 [1922])</xref> and later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511435709">Pierre Bourdieu (1977)</xref>. The mass media, aptly referred to as the culture industry, of course, was a favorite target of the Frankfurt School in the 1940s and 1950s, which theorized a cultural totalitarianism in the advancement of capitalism (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511435709">Horkheimer and Adorno, 1972</xref>). Drawing on the Frankfurt theorists’ critique of popular culture, the critical study of culture in sociology became a significant subspecialty in the1970s and 1980s. Cultural Studies has had a massive impact on humanities scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435709">Agger, 1998</xref>), which synergistically fueled the social sciences’ current romance with culture. Thus, sociology has to be considered a discipline that importantly contributed to CDS’s approach to culture, for example with the use of Stuart Hall’s diaspora discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511435709">Ewart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511435709">Jakubowicz and Meekosha, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511435709">Snyder and Mitchell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, in the new millennium, CDS opened up in a big way to an analysis of culture, albeit primarily popular culture emanating from the global North. An important critical analysis derived from post-structural thought is the interrogation of the binary and dualistic oppositions that structure meaning in cultural formations, such as mind versus body, independence versus dependence, individual versus society, impairment versus disability. These dualisms have structured important debates in the broader disability studies. CDS, however, problematizes these oppositions as unstable and typical of modernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511435709">Corker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0896920511435709">Shildrick, 2009</xref>). Such post-structural and postmodern insights emerging out of the cultural turn have also been incorporated into critical sociology’s arsenal of analytic strategies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435709">Agger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511435709">Denzin and Giardina, 2008</xref>), and we would urge sociologists to reflect on what disability might contribute to the problematic of these oppositions. This turn toward culture has sometimes meant that traditional topics of inquiry, such as equality, the role of the state, employment and political-economy, have lost their preeminence. However, these topics relating to the social and material structures of societies are still relevant to and in fact crucial for the analysis of disability. CDS must continue to analyze the social structures that confine and oppress disabled people in tandem with its highlighting of cultural issues.</p>
<p>As different from disability studies, CDS also creatively connects with the critical agendas of a host of other identities, and engages in a radical interrogation of impairment and disability ‘as phenomena enacted at the levels of psyche, culture and society’ in late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511435709">Goodley, 2011</xref>). In many ways CDS offers an understanding of disability more attuned to the changing complexities and intersections of the new millennium, which should engage critical sociologists interested in the social and cultural dynamics currently affecting marginalized populations.</p>

<title>Strategies of Engagement: Imagining Disability in Sociology</title>
<p>While we believe that CDS is better positioned than disability studies was to elucidate the relevance of disability analysis to sociological insight, our optimism is tempered by the history of failed dialogue between the two camps. We suggest that there are a couple of strategies that scholars at the intersection of CDS and sociology might employ to facilitate productive discussion. We previously noted that Mills’s sociological imagination had insufficient reflexivity to interrogate its own categories of thought, which rendered it unable to perceive any lacuna in understanding. Within sociology today, as shown throughout this article, disability is in fact often still a theoretically static, even assumed, category and continues to be marginal to many of the debates within the discipline.</p>
<p>Thus, CDS scholars interested in a dialogue with sociology might do well to shed light on this lacuna by</p>
<list id="list1-0896920511435709" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>deploying a critique of the sociological imaginary and imagination for their continued inability to be radically reflexive and creative in thinking about inclusion; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inserting a multifaceted concept of disability in the larger debates on sociological concepts and tensions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Especially with the recent ascendance of the imagination as a critical distinguishing aspect of human psychic and social being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511435709">Adams, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435709">Arnason, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511435709">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435709">Castoriadis, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511435709">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511435709">Kenway and Fahey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511435709">Ricoeur, 1994</xref>), sociology needs to be rethought in more reflexive, inclusive and – dare we say – more creative terms. In his theorization of the imaginary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435709">Cornelius Castoriadis (1987)</xref> addresses the institutionalization of perspectives in philosophy and the human sciences and how creative thinking in both individuals and societies is subject to becoming determined. He urges scholars and communities to recognize the ability to break the grip of determinism and strive for a continually reflexive and creative relation to our work in the struggle for academic and social transformation. Castoriadis’s perspective hinges on his understanding of the pre-linguistic capacity of the imaginary for self-creation, which renders the possibility of radical social change. As Klooger emphasizes, for Castoriadis, ‘creation means that there is no <italic>coming from</italic> or <italic>out of</italic> in any of the accepted senses of these terms [which] would seem to rule out any relation between past, present and future … In fact, Castoriadis’ description discounts only one type of relation … that of determination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511435709">2009</xref>: 39–40).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435709">Castoriadis (1987)</xref>, the ‘imaginary’ cannot be reduced to symbolism. As he emphasizes, ‘symbolism assumes the capacity of positing a permanent connection between two terms in such a way that one “represents” the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435709">1987</xref>: 127). McNay notes that ‘while the symbolic is the realm of instituted meaning, the social imaginary exceeds it in that it is the realm of the instituted and instituting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511435709">2000</xref>: 145). Thus, as she explains, ‘The imaginary is that which defines social identity, that which gives a specific orientation to every institutional system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511435709">2000</xref>: 145). A society’s ‘social imaginary’ can be best apprehended via its particular constellation of ‘social imaginary significations’ (e.g. democracy, communism, Christianity, Buddhism) which, while orienting societies, can yet combine and manifest in novel ways opening up the possibility of creative social change. Castoriadis’s understanding of the creative capacity of the imaginary not only challenges the determinism inherent in functional and structural accounts of society, but his sociocentric perspective also counters those post-structuralist perspectives that narrowly focus on the discursive and linguistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511435709">McNay, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511435709">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, some scholars sympathetic to Castoriadis’s insights have criticized him for neglecting to account for the interpretive moment in creation and the contexts in which social creation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511435709">Adams, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511435709">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435709">Arnason, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511435709">2001</xref>). Focused as he was on rupturing deterministic thinking, he left the elucidation of non-determinant relations within the social imaginary mostly implicit in his work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511435709">Adams, 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511435709">Arnason’s (2001)</xref> highlighting of the interplay between institutional contexts within societies and intercultural encounters between societies provides space to productively theorize the interpretive moment of social creation, or what Adams terms more precisely ‘contextual creation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511435709">2005</xref>: 36). This conceptual move points to an especially provocative but grounded line of enquiry with which to critically imagine non-normative ways of conceiving difference and including marginalized groups such as disabled people.</p>
<p>Some critical sociologists are also employing these ideas on the creative capacity of the imaginary in an effort to transgress the current, dogmatic parameters of human science scholarship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511435709">Kenway and Fahey (2009)</xref> locate a transgressive imagination in the work of several scholars who continually reimagine their understanding in light of changing sociohistorical and intercultural circumstances. Explicitly highlighting the role of a reflexive and creative imagination in transgressing the ‘normative sociological imaginary’ will work to challenge and subvert the discipline’s assumptions regarding a range of marginalized issues, including disability. Such an effort to expand the sociological imaginary also foregrounds the need to move beyond the center’s imaginary and tap into the diverse imaginaries of the global South, which present very different ways of conceptualizing impairment and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511435709">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>We would also argue for scholars in CDS to engage sociology more specifically with a multifaceted understanding of disability that can account for the complex social dynamics inherent in late modern societies. In our view, one-dimensional analyses work against engagement with current trends in critical sociology that argue for such complexity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435709">Agger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511435709">Denzin and Giardina, 2008</xref>). For example, Siebers critiques the constructionist focus on performativity and indeterminacy in CDS because it ‘privileges a disembodied ideal of freedom, suggesting that emancipation from social codes and norms may be achieved by imagining the body as subversive text’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511435709">2006</xref>: 13–14). Siebers is suggesting here that the imagination is one-sidedly employed by some radical constructionists to transcend corporeality and the ‘very real’ difficulties that might ensue for disabled people from their impairments. We agree with Siebers that discussion of impairments should be factored into a more complex analysis of disability. Indeed, for disabled people, a primary context of understanding is their particular embodiment including any ‘limitations’. This example shows how tensions and disagreements between disability analysts not only illustrate but also expand on larger debates within the human sciences including sociology. In short, Siebers’s argument is part of the larger post-positive critique against one-sided accounts of untethered and fluid identities that efface the ‘real effects’ of social location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511435709">Alcoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511435709">Moya and Hames-Garcia, 2000</xref>). At the same time, however, highlighting disability adds to the complexity of this debate by calling attention to the material limitations of corporeality.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Transforming the Sociological Imaginary for Disability Enquiry in Late Modernity</title>
<p>We have argued in this article that sociology has traditionally marginalized the concept of disability and continues to ignore its relevance to some of the significant conceptual debates in the discipline. In our argument it has been necessary to question the ‘facts’ about disability put forward by mainstream sociology, such as the association between disability, aging and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511435709">Furze et al., 2011</xref>) in order to problematize the concept of disability and the lived experience of disabled people. We have further argued that the methods and concepts of sociology located within a predominantly non-reflexive and creatively limited imaginary, manifesting as lacuna in what and whom sociology focuses on, have thus far restricted the sociological imagination in its engagement with disability studies. Sociology in its current Eurocentric/Northern and able-bodied form has excluded those on the margins, both in a geopolitical sense and in an embodied sense. We have sought to deconstruct sociology’s normalizing and universalizing tendencies and argue that they are part and parcel of the same assumptions in which some voices are privileged and others are silenced.</p>
<p>But the answer is not simply to add examples of disabled people’s lives in our texts or notions stemming from postcolonial discourse. We need to question the hierarchies of knowledge within the larger discipline, which relegate those who have undergone a process of colonization or those deemed less agentic to marginalized status. The increasing visibility of disability in the global South along with national and international disability movements means that a reinterpretation of the history of the discipline is called for, as well as new ways of engaging with, critiquing and creatively imagining sociological understanding of disability. We have suggested several strategies that those at the intersection of CDS and sociology might consider in order to challenge the larger discipline, but these strategies are by no means exhaustive. Suffice to say that CDS scholars need to critically engage with sociology until the processes that have ignored the lived histories and experiences of disabled people are made transparent. In this way, Mills’s call for an imaginative sociology that can critically link individual biographies and personal troubles to public issues will finally become relevant for the study of disability in sociology.</p>

<p>Castoriadis believes that political critique and the notion of autonomy emerged within the Greek polis and again in the Western European Enlightenment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511435709">1993</xref>). Our reference to his work in the context of expanding the sociological imagination and in engaging with imaginaries from the global South on impairment and disability is not, however, antithetical to Castoriadis’s more significant desire – that is, to break the grip of determinism, recognize our collective ability to choose the future and thus our ability to transform societies. Not surprisingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435709">Arnason (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511435709">2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511435709">Adams (2005)</xref> disagree with him on Western European ownership of political critique, arguing that in diverse cultures the forms of critique may differ from that which emerged in Western Europe.</p></fn>
