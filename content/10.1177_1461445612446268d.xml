<p>The evaluation of academic knowledge in research articles has in recent years attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612446268">Giannoni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612446268">Hyland and Tse, 2009</xref>). While most studies have provided us with an analysis of the grammar of such evaluation, very few, if any, have informed us about the underlying values such evaluation encodes. In perhaps the most comprehensive book to date on evaluative language of academic knowledge, Giannoni builds upon such previous studies by shifting the focus onto the values that are embedded in evaluations. The aim of the book, as Giannoni himself explains, is ‘to extend our understanding of what values are most prominent in English disciplinary discourse and what linguistic resources are most likely to be used to signal such values’ (p. 13).</p>
<p>Chapter 1 sets the scene for the research presented in the volume. Then in Chapter 2, readers are presented with an extensive overview of the historical and philosophical roots of academia and the disciplines. In addition, as the focus of the research in the volume is on research articles, the author also reviews studies on research genres in general and the genre of research articles in particular.</p>
<p>The next two chapters provide readers with information on the methodology adopted for the research. In Chapter 3, Giannoni gives detailed information on the disciplinary fields the study examines, and the source journals and text selection for the purposes of this study. Further information on the corpus data, selection of the candidate items and the linguistic analysis is provided in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>The results are reported in Chapters 5 to 8 according to the four main semantic categories of candidate items identified: goodness, size, novelty and relevancy. Goodness is defined as ‘a value that points to qualities that are viewed as positive (or conversely, as negative) without need to further specify their nature’ (p. 89). The top ranking candidate items in this category include <italic>well, positive, right, good</italic> and <italic>negative</italic>. The second category, size, is determined ‘both by the indeterminacy of claims made along the large–small axis and by the frequency of its markers’ (p. 123). This category includes such candidate items as <italic>large, small, larger, greater</italic> and <italic>little</italic>. The third category, novelty, is ‘time-bounded’ and ‘expresses both continuity and discontinuity with the past’ (p. 147). The candidate items in this category include, but are not limited to, <italic>new, modern, recent, older</italic> and <italic>novel</italic>. The last category, relevancy, ‘signals aspects of research deserving special attention on the interlocutor’s part’ (p. 175). Some of the candidate items the relevancy category includes are <italic>important, significant, major, key</italic> and <italic>importance</italic>. Each chapter includes not only overall results regarding each of these items in these categories, but also their distribution across disciplines.</p>
<p>Giannoni provides readers with a comparative assessment of the main results in Chapter 9 and the volume concludes with Chapter 10, in which readers are presented with a discussion of the limitations of the research as well as its implications for future research.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to the readers of <italic>Discourse Studies</italic>, Giannoni’s book explores the main facets of academic value in a corpus of research articles from different disciplinary areas including anthropology, biology, computer science, economics, history, engineering, mathematics, medicine, physics and sociology. In addition, the volume provides readers with corpus-based insights as to how academic writers produce and value new knowledge in their respective fields. In this way this volume makes a highly useful contribution to our knowledge of values encoded in academic writing in some under-researched content-areas.</p>
<p>This outstanding volume will be useful to a wide audience, including discourse analysts, corpus researchers and writing teacher trainers who may wish to have some evidence-based insights into the use of evaluative expressions encoding preferred values within various content-areas.</p>
<p>Given its specific focus, the volume could be used as a textbook for graduate level courses on discourse analysis and applied corpus research in teacher development programs worldwide. However, Giannoni’s highly specific focus on academic values in the disciplines also poses a limitation in terms of the intended audience. While this book would be useful for such methods courses and postgraduate researchers, if the book is to be used in an undergraduate class on corpus linguistics or discourse studies, it may prove somewhat challenging. In addition, some readers may have liked to see more focus on teaching implications based on Giannoni’s corpus-based findings. If you are looking for such teaching implications, the volume does not provide them. For instance, if the distribution of some semantic categories and their items differs across disciplines, what teaching implications could such findings have for teachers of English for Specific Purposes in general and English for Academic Purposes in particular? Despite this limitation, <italic>Mapping Academic Values in the Disciplines: A Corpus-based Approach</italic> is a welcome addition to the areas of applied corpus studies, discourse studies and second language writing.</p>
