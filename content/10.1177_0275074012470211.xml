<p>Today’s public management literature is generally focused on the application of market mechanisms that rely heavily on appraisals of efficiency and effectiveness, including customer focus, benchmarking, systems of user-pay, competition, and result-oriented budgets. Pollitt notes that while urban planning and geography scholars may be more attuned to the role of “place” in everyday life, public service management literature has largely ignored this specific feature. In <italic>New Perspectives</italic>, Pollitt attempts to synthesize these theories and concepts of place with the phases and cycles of the policy process, models of management, and the consequences of using particular organizational structures and technical tools in specific political and cultural context. Thus, one of the primary contributions of <italic>New Perspectives</italic> is the bridging of divergent literature groups including public management, place, and technological change.</p>
<p>Pollitt provides a useful addition to the public management literature that accounts for the role of public services as place makers. His principal focus is on the spatial and “palatial” dimensions of public service organizations, how these have changed, and how they are continuing to change. He argues “that public services are basic to the legitimacy and stability of modern government” and “that these core public services are almost bound to have a major influence in shaping places” (pp. 10-11). Pollitt’s book centers on three focal questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0275074012470211" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How and why does the provision of public services shape places?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conversely, how do the characteristics of particular places influence how public services are provided?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do the location/sites of public-service provision influence citizens’ wider attitudes toward, and engagements with, the state?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Though <italic>New Perspectives</italic> does not answer how face-to-face interactions between citizens and public servants influences civic engagement or public trust, address the effects that electronic contacts with the government has on the citizen-user’s attitudes to government, or assess what the “joined-up government” alternative would look like (nor does Pollitt try), it does provide a useful framework to embrace both place and technological change and integrate these with the established literature groups of politics, policy making, and public administration.</p>
<p>The balance (and majority) of the book presents a single perspective, Governments as Placemakers (GAP), and then moves from the conceptual to the actual, detailing in great depth four cases that illustrate GAP throughout the world. The examples include capital flight (the United Kingdom and Ireland, Australia, and Brazil), hospital closure and relocations (Brighton, Hove, and Lewes), official identities and civil registrations (births, marriages, and deaths), and the police (England and Belgium).</p>
<p>Pollitt presents GAP in eight modalities beginning with the four most direct actions, then three less direct actions, and finally concluding with the influences governments may exert over the formation of virtual spaces:</p>
<list id="list2-0275074012470211" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>Government establishes a state by claiming jurisdiction within a bordered territory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments shape places by putting their own “things” into them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments shape places by directly regulating what others can and cannot put into them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments also shape places by infrastructural investments, which, though they may not be within a particular place, significantly affect its further development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments negotiate and bargain with other placemakers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments indirectly affect places by a wide array of policies that are not overtly spatial in character but nevertheless have important spatial effects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments endow, or attempt to endow, particular places with affect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Governments may have considerable influence both over their citizen’s access to the Internet/cyberspace and over the rules and procedures governing such spaces.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Although Pollitt does not try to argue the GAP perspective is a new theory or try and advance it as a specific set of hypothesis, he does state, “It is a kind of checklist combined with a suggestive but not exhaustive set of summaries of some typical dynamic processes and effects” (p. 99). To illustrate how a scholar may do this, he uses his four GAP examples.</p>
<p>Pollitt notes that in the effort toward large-scale public service decentralization, both the United Kingdom and Ireland are clear examples of GAP Modality B—the government putting its own things into particular localities. Additionally, the efforts had a high symbolic value (Modality G) and ultimately struggled in implementation because of Modality C, that is, the direct planning mechanisms were the responsibility of subnational authorities that competed for central government favors. The small percentage of successful decentralized public services required some infrastructural investments (Modality D) and the successful integration of Modality H, “the virtual.” When discussing the creation of Canberra and Brasilia, Pollitt notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Both governments were very high on modality B . . . they were very high on modality C . . . they rated equally highly on modality D and E . . . and they were engaged in modality G. (pp. 135-136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While discussing hospital reconfiguration, Pollitt again highlights Modality B, but this time instead of the government putting their things in places they are taking them away. This in turn highlights Modality F, addressing spatial disadvantages. Furthermore, Pollitt posits hospitals have symbolic and affective functions, Modality G, and are involved with direct regulation, Modality C.</p>
<p>From here <italic>New Perspectives</italic> takes us from the formative impacts of moving government agencies to the more subtle yet arguably more pervasive impacts of public services such as civil registration and police protection. Pollitt focuses less on the GAP modalities and more on the issues of technology and the erosion of place-based services. He discusses the potential effects on “trust, both in government in general and in particular public services . . . and a more general loss of government’s material, ‘human’ face” (pp. 170-171). And, though Pollitt notes that policing has the most intense and diverse impact on specific localities, he cautions that the role of “place” in police work is changing. “The traditional debates between freedom and security, transparency and privacy, and democracy and efficiency are being played out anew in cyberspace” (p. 191).</p>
<p>The fundamental premise behind <italic>New Perspectives</italic> is a focus on the “rest” of the daily agendas of practicing managers who are
<disp-quote>
<p>equally occupied with other issues, many of which have a distinct locally embedded component . . . fix the car parking on a crowded site, maintain old and leaking buildings, rebuild one floor of a 1960s tower block so that it will accommodate the latest scanner, debate with doctors who want to move the whole operation to a new, greenfield-site hospital out of town and respond to articulate groups of local residents who are opposed to moving the local accident and emergency department to a bigger hospital. . . . These highly specific, place-based issues demand a good deal of managers’ time and skills, but lack the glamour that apparently attaches to the latest management technique. (p. 158)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pollitt challenges the public management subfield of public administration to remember public-service users (whether viewed as customers or citizens) cannot be “placeless.” Often they interact with government in places that hold sentimental or historical value; places that are appreciated for being familiar and convenient. Citizens care (and if they do not, they should) about exactly with whom they are dealing. Furthermore, he reminds us that these sentiments are rarely rational or interested in minimizing demands on the system in the name of the greater good. Though most of Pollitt’s discussion involves international examples that may be challenging for American Public Administration students to fully grasp, these are important reminders. By combining theories and concepts from a range of disciplines and focusing them on government as placemakers, <italic>New Perspectives</italic> adds a new and valuable dimension to what can sometimes be a too sterile, impersonal, and utterly overly rational literature on the practice of public administration.</p>
