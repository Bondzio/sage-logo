<p>As I began considering material for this review, I was struck by a series of stories that appeared in the Indian press in August 2010: a Dalit woman beaten to death on accusation of being a witch; a Dalit woman paraded naked to punish her brother-in-law for allegedly having an affair; a Dalit-Brahmin couple threatened with death for their inter-caste marriage; and a series of stories about Dalit lynchings (various Indian newspapers). Most disturbing was the fact that such stories outweighed almost any other kinds of news concerning Dalits. Have we really come so far only to find that we have travelled no distance at all?</p>
<p>The two volumes under review offer important insights into the lived realities of Dalits in contemporary India, though they each approach the issue from different angles. While Pawar’s autobiography is at times unnervingly optimistic in tone, Ravikumar is withering in his criticism and his assessment of the Dalit condition. The two books thus travel different, if parallel, roads that nonetheless bring us to the same destination. Ravikumar’s work reveals the numerous ways in which Dalits have been and continue to be mistreated; Pawar reveals in vivid detail the resilience it takes to live through and thrive in the face of such oppression. The fact that both books are translations from regional Indian languages (Marathi and Tamil) adds another dimension to the notion of marginality that intertwines the two narratives.</p>
<p><italic>Venomous Touch</italic> is comprised of a series of brief, previously published talks, essays, and reports, all written in a journalistic style. Several chapters are spent establishing connections with, and drawing parallels to, the African American experience. Perhaps the most telling of these occurs when Ravikumar quotes from Frederick Douglass’ famous 1852 speech, ‘What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?’, when the renowned abolitionist used his considerable rhetorical and oratorical abilities to scathingly condemn an American national identity theoretically built around the principles of freedom and justice, but in actuality on the backs of slave labour (pp.121–122). Like Douglass in this speech, Ravikumar is angry and unforgiving in his condemnation of all people and institutions that help to support the edifice of caste: Hindus and Hinduism, the Indian State, the BJP and the Congress Party, non-Dalit lower castes, and so on.</p>
<p>But this is an anger deeply steeped in the political, and Ravikumar writes not for personal catharsis but rather, like Douglass, to bring about clear and definable changes. This is best illustrated over the course of several chapters in which J. Jayalalitha, the erstwhile Brahmin Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and her AIADMK political party are the focus of Ravikumar’s ire. In one, he blasts the party for its proposals to integrate schools in the state (pp. 34–58), and in the other he caricaturises Jayalalitha as a Machiavellian (or more appropriately Chanakyan) villain who maintains a system that is inherently violent, but who manipulates people and controls the rules to ensure that the violence is always kept at ‘acceptable levels’ (pp. 93–95). Jayalalitha’s ruthlessness is brought home several chapters later when she is castigated for having babies imprisoned (pp. 220–222). This is a portrayal in which redemption hardly seems possible. Yet, in another chapter Ravikumar calls Jayalalitha ‘laudable’ for her outreach to the caste victims of election violence. He notes that ‘There is no second opinion that the chief minister’s visit, her distributing relief to the victims and consoling them, restored the people’s faith in the present government….Disturbingly, neither the former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi nor his ministers ever took such steps…. Considered against this backdrop, the present chief minister’s act would seem an uncommon one (pp. 223–227).’ Thus, despite chapters of tough-as-nails prose, Ravikumar does not see the world in primordial, unchanging categories. What matters to him are actions, and actions in the cause of justice, which he sees through the lens of a Dalit-imbricated Marxism (p. 241).</p>
<p><italic>Venomous Touch</italic> has a few drawbacks. First and foremost, the rationale for the arrangement of chapters is unclear. While one might follow a certain trajectory of argument from start to finish, the fact that the pieces are not laid out in chronological order makes such assessments difficult. In two of the chapters I quote above on Jayalalitha’s response to a region wracked by casteist election violence, the positive assessment follows the critique, giving the illusion that Jayalalitha has heard the criticism and responded positively to it, and creating an arc of redemption in the narrative. But in actuality, Ravikumar’s views on Jayalalitha’s praiseworthy visit were originally published in 2002, while his observations of her jailing of babies took place in 2003; that is, he originally praised her before he subjected her to further criticism. This looseness with dating is further in evidence throughout the book, as when the citation for Douglass’ 1852 speech lists it as 1841 (p. 123) though it is correctly dated in the main text (p. 121).</p>
<p>The sense of surreality that this kind of editing generates is furthered by some of Ravikumar’s own claims, as with some of his sweeping statements linking Dalit and African American experiences. For instance, he notes the disproportionate number of death-penalty cases involving black men and women in the US and then states that: ‘No doubt, a similar kind of study, if conducted in India, would show that the maximum number of death penalties is awarded to dalits (p. 116)’.</p>
<p>Casting such speculative aspersions is unfortunate since it opens space for critics to complain of a recklessness with the facts. It is even more unfortunate since it is simply unnecessary. <italic>Venomous Touch</italic> is filled with blood curdling, stomach turning examples of the humiliations and travesties to which Dalits are subjected, as in this description of a brutal attack on a group of dalits who had dared to contest (and win) a local panchayat (village council) election: ‘Then a gang of about forty to fifty…boarded the bus and butchered [the dalits]…. The attackers hacked off Murugesan’s [the Panchayat President-elect] head. Chellatturai, who received serious injuries, had his jaw slit open with a knife. The gang poured the blood dripping from Murugesan’s severed head into Chellaturai’s wounded mouth [p. 179]’. Worse was the seemingly nonchalant response of the Indian justice system, and the people at large, to such a massacre, and Ravikumar rails against this with a mix of despair and righteous indignation.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to think of Dalit oppression only in such barbaric and horrific terms, for they are but the sad culmination of the sadistic and heartless conditions that comprise the mundane everyday for so many Dalits throughout India. While Ravikumar writes effectively about this as well, Urmila Pawar’s story is more compelling, written as it is in the first-person voice of agifted writer.</p>
<p>Pawar’s memoir recounts her journey from a small hamlet on the West Indian coast to Mumbai where she has become renowned as a Dalit and women’s activist and as a Marathi writer. The story is replete with instances of everyday violence. In one example, a young Pawar accompanies some Muslim tenants staying in her mother’s home as they go to give some relatives some food; she is rewarded by being chastised by the relatives for being a Mahar and forced to stay outside of their home during the visit. Further, the relatives poisoned the minds of the tenants who, though they had been Pawar’s fast friends to that point, left without wanting her to touch their things and without wishing to speak with her any further (pp. 102–105).</p>
<p>In another particularly gruesome instance, Pawar broadly lambasts the treatment of women:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If a woman was suspected to have erred, she was brought before the Panchayat for justice and punishment…. One day some women from the village came, reporting that a widow was found to be pregnant. The whole village knew who the man was…[but] she was judged before nine villages and punished in keeping with the verdict. She was made to stand leaning forward, and women kicked her from behind until the child was aborted…. In another incident, when an eight-months’ pregnant woman openly accused her husband of illicit relations…the villagers gave her the same punishment. Women…kicked her till the baby died inside her and the woman died in pain in a week’s time (p.156).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is exhausting and discouraging to simply read such accounts, let alone to have to live through them. And Urmila Pawar had to face terrible personal tragedy as well, including the untimely death of her son (p. 297) and husband (p. 317). This is what makes Pawar’s drive for betterment—of herself, of her community, of society—all the more striking. She notes: ‘My head would be swimming in the clouds of lofty ideas such as making dalit women speak and write about their lives, which could be published (p. 278)’. This energy and determination led Pawar to create a new organization, Samwadini, meaning ‘a woman who aims at communication with everyone (p. 275)’, and through this she arranged for the Dalit Women’s SahityaSammelana (literary gathering) in 1987, probably the first of its kind in all of India (p. 278).</p>
<p>Pawar’s tenacious resourcefulness makes her account the perfect complement to Ravikumar’s observations, for it leaves readers with the scope to imagine a better future. It is, of course, up to readers to take up the cause. Both books need to be widely read.</p>
