<abstract>
<p>Precarious work, characterized by the uncertainty and unpredictability of employment, is well established in Thailand. This article examines the expansion of new forms of precarious work in Thailand with particular attention to the post–Asian economic crisis period. This is done through an examination of the currently available data. The post-1997 period has seen economic liberalization deepen, and this has delivered policies and practices that have weakened unions, kept wages low, and expanded the use of contract and agency-supplied labor. At the same time, there have been gains for in terms of state-based social protection. In two case studies, the article demonstrates that for workers in the manufacturing sector, there has been an increase in labor subcontracting or outsourcing and other forms of less secure work as employers seek to reduce costs and limit collective organization by workers.</p>

<p>In 2011, the World Bank promoted Thailand from the category of a lower-middle-income economy to that of an upper-middle-income economy. This latter category ranks Thailand with countries such as Chile, China, Malaysia, and South Africa, where average incomes range from about US$4,000 to US$12,000. In making the announcement, a bank senior economist proclaimed the upgrade as “recognition of Thailand’s economic achievements in the past decade in which GNI per capita has almost doubled, while poverty has been significantly reduced” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764212466244">World Bank, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Ironically, workers in Thailand, despite some welfare advances, were left behind in all of these economic achievements. Thai workers have long suffered overly long workdays, poor and unsafe workplace conditions, relatively low wages, and bouts of repression targeting unions and collective bargaining (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212466244">Brown, 2004</xref>). These poor circumstances have been exacerbated as employers sought to make their workforces more “flexible” by the expanded use of contracted and migrant workers. The result has been that work has become increasingly precarious. The expansion of precarious forms of employment, which has been little noticed, was dramatically revealed in 2011 when floods inundated many of the large industrial estates near Bangkok. When firms closed at the estates, it became clear that the use of contracted, agency-supplied, and migrant workers had become important, underpinning the operation of the export manufacturing sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466244">“Sanyo Pulls the Plug,” 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In examining the expansion of precarious work in Thailand, following a brief orientation to the country’s social and economic situation, the article analyzes the available information on precarious work, defining it and assessing its extent. This is followed by sections that profile precarious work and the issues faced by particular groups of workers. To illustrate the struggles that have emerged over the expansion of precarious work, the article includes two case studies, followed by a discussion of developments associated with the expansion of state-initiated social security.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>At the heart of mainland Southeast Asia, and one of the main beneficiaries of the export of manufacturing production from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan since the mid-1970s, Thailand’s economic performance has been enviable. The country experienced uninterrupted growth in per capita GDP from 1957 until 1997.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212466244">1</xref></sup> Since the mid-1980s, and despite the sharp downturn caused by the Asian economic crisis of 1997–1998, economic growth has been maintained (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>). The impacts of this growth have been extensive. As the urbanized and industrialized sectors expanded, Thailand’s population became better educated, healthier, and wealthier. However, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>, these benefits have not been equally shared, and Thailand has high levels of inequality. Economic liberalization saw Thailand become deeply embedded in broader processes of global investment and production, especially since the Asian economic crisis.</p>

<p>Thailand’s official registration of households overestimates the rural population. In 2010, another government estimate of urban population was 46%.</p>

<p>Noticeable among the changes has been the increased significance of the industrial and services sectors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>). In the early 1950s, Thailand was an exporter of primary commodities, with the vast majority of the population engaged in agricultural pursuits. Manufactured goods now account for approximately 80% of exports. This development owes much to the collaboration of Thailand’s domestic capitalist class with foreign investors, particularly from the United States, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as production globalized and investors sought ever cheaper production sites. Reflecting the waves of relocating investment, at various times Thailand has been a leading producer of garments, automobiles and auto parts, hard disk drives, and other electronic components. These waves of investment have tended to concentrate at industrial estates in areas around Bangkok and extending north and east of the capital.</p>
<p>As might be expected in an economy that has undergone significant structural change, employment in industry and services has expanded substantially (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>). The total workforce expanded from about 23 million in 1980 to more than 39 million in 2010, employment in services expanded from 4.3 million to 15.1 million, with a more modest increase from 2.3 million to 7.1 million in industry over the same period. Women’s participation in the workforce also changed, and by the early 1990s women composed just less than half of the workforce in the manufacturing sector and just more than half of that in the service sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212466244">Somsak, 1995</xref>, p. 79). Despite these changes, agriculture continued to employ more than 40% of the economically active population in 2010. With the exception of highly commercialized agricultural provinces of the south, poverty is highest and incomes lowest in rural areas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212466244">Hewison, 2012</xref>). In other words, employment remains substantial in agriculture, where wages are lowest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212466244">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Defining Precarious Work</title>
<p>As the data to be presented in this article indicate, in Thailand, despite advances in social security, there has been an expansion of the kind of work described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212466244">Vosko (2010</xref>, p. 2) as “precarious employment.” For Vosko, this is “work for remuneration characterized by uncertainty, low income, and limited social benefits and statutory entitlements.” As indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212466244">Kalleberg and Hewison (2013)</xref>, the expansion of precarious employment worldwide is associated with broad changes in regulation, investment, and production under the influence of the “neoliberal revolution.”</p>
<p><italic>Precarious work</italic> and <italic>precarious employment</italic> are not terms commonly found in the government, academic, and labor literatures on Thailand. Rather, there are a number of terms, many of them not mutually exclusive, used to describe employment that is not considered “regular.” In the labor literature there is a normative view that regular employment involves work in firms with a monthly wage and employer-supplied benefits that might include legally required benefits and additional benefits such as housing, food, and other allowances as well as bonuses and paid overtime. In reality, employment in such circumstances has never been widespread.</p>
<p>Following standard practice, the National Statistical Office (NSO), which conducts regular labor force surveys, considers “employed persons” to be those who are 15 years of age and over (until 2001, 13 years and over), who during the survey week “worked for at least one hour for wages/salaries, profits, dividends or any other kind of payment, in cash, in kind” or who did not work in that week but still received a regular salary from an employer and were to return to that employer or unpaid family workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212466244">NSO, 2005</xref>, p. 2). Obviously, such a broad definition provides little direction on the extent of precarious work.</p>
<p>Related to this official discourse and the strictures established by International Labour Organization membership, reporting and research, the designation most commonly used to describe precarious employment has been “informal employment,” which is, naturally enough, described as being in the “informal sector.” These terms are widely used by academics and NGOs, and in broad terms the “informal sector” is seen to include a large range of occupations and work situations: the self-employed, street vendors, contract farmers, taxi drivers, piece-rate home workers, workers in hairdressing industry, and those in construction and the fishing and seafood industry. As the supply of “flexible labor” to factories has expanded, the terms <italic>dispatched, outsourced</italic>, and <italic>agency</italic> employment also have been applied to “nonstandard” employment arrangements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212466244">Voravidh &amp; Napaporn, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the most significant changes to the terms used came following the 1990 introduction of a social security scheme, initially a compulsory social insurance scheme that covered employees in private enterprises with more than 10 employees and employees in the public sector. In 2001, all private firms with employees were included (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212466244">Amara, Rakawin, &amp; Naruemol, 2002</xref>). As this scheme expanded to include more categories of workers, “informal employment” officially came to be defined as comprising “employed persons who have not been protected under social security” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212466244">NSO, 2011b</xref>, p. 2). Prior to this, in official surveys and data, workers in the informal sector were considered to be own-account workers, private employees and unpaid family workers in business establishments with fewer than 10 employees. With the expansion of the social security system, “informal employment” is now rendered as “employment outside the [social security] system,” or in Thai, <italic>raeng ngan nok rabop</italic>. As the NSO (2010, p. i) now defines it, “Workers outside the system are defined as employed persons who do not have coverage [by the social security system] or social benefits from their employment.” This is the definition it uses for its surveys of the labor force, meaning that all statistics now reflect this official approach.</p>
<p>In using this terminology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466244">Bundit, Voravidh, &amp; Suntaree (2008</xref>, pp. 195-196) indicate that the significant element of this definition is its identification of two groups of workers who are “outside the system”: (a) home workers, contract workers, and seasonal agricultural laborers; and (b) the self-employed, ranging from farmers and street vendors to professionals such as pharmacists, lawyers, doctors, and dentists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002764212466244">
<title>The Extent of Precarious Work</title>
<p>In the remainder of this article, acknowledging that precarious employment has long been a feature of Thailand’s labor force, we argue that new processes are at work. It is ironic that although Thailand established a national social security scheme two decades ago and universal health care in 2001, most Thai workers remain in precarious employment. We argue that the expansion of forms of precarious work contributes to this failure to fully embed social welfare provisions and is a factor in the wage stagnation that has lasted for more than a decade and has contributed to the decline of (already weak) unions.</p>
<p>The majority of workers in Thailand have long labored in workplaces that provide few nonwage benefits, where trade unions have been weak and repressed, where occupational health and safety problems are widespread and labor laws flouted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212466244">Brown, Bundit, &amp; Hewison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212466244">Hewison &amp; Chiu, 2009</xref>). Recent data show that more than a third of workers continue to work more than 50 hours a week, which is longer than the legal maximum. Meanwhile, wages have remained low and static, despite productivity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212466244">Sethaput &amp; Akarapat, 2009</xref>, pp. 3-4). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212466244">Chairat (2010</xref>, p. 11) has shown, the minimum wage <italic>declined</italic> in real terms between 2000 and 2008, whereas private-sector wages rose by just 1.7% per year and public-sector wages by 1.9% over the same period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212466244">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Related to this, since 1960, capital’s share of GDP has increased markedly whereas labor’s share has declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212466244">Mounier &amp; Voravidh, 2010</xref>). Part of this is the result of the declining significance of agriculture, but productivity increases have accrued almost entirely to capital through increased profits. Since 2000, profit rates have increased from about 5% to almost 11%. In other words, there has been a redistribution of income to capital. In 2001, the World Bank had already concluded that the major source of inequality in Thailand was to be found in profits;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764212466244">3</xref></sup> that conclusion would still be a valid view a decade later.</p>
<p>Such negative conditions for labor mean that, even as industrial and service sector work opportunities expand, the jobs created have been characterized by low wages, limited benefits, and increased uncertainty.</p>
<p>As noted above, with rather blunt definitions, the government has produced data on work that it identifies as formal and informal for many years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764212466244">4</xref></sup> Such definitions tend to blind us to different forms of precarious employment: labor contracted through an agency and employed for a fixed term and paid either an hourly or task-based rate, workers hired on temporary contracts directly by the firm and renewed at employers’ discretion, work outsourced to subcontracting firms or home-based workers, agency-supplied workers, and migrant workers. All of these forms are characterized by low wages, few benefits, and uncertainty, and many are considered outside the coverage of the labor law, meaning that the right to establish a union is lost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764212466244">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212466244">Figure 1</xref>, in the period from 1980 to 2000, the broad definitions see a rise in the percentage of workers considered to have formal employment. However, since 2000, the trend has been for increasing informal employment in percentage terms. In terms of absolute numbers, informal sector employment has increased from about 17.3 million in 1980 to 24.1 million in 2010 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764212466244">Figure 2</xref>). Formal sector employment has increased from 5.2 million to 14.6 million between 1980 and 2010. The data available on sectoral employment are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212466244">Table 2</xref>, indicating the declining trend for formal employment. It is noticeable that approximately two thirds of informal employment is in the agricultural sector and informal employment in that sector is increasing.</p>

<p>In essence, the decline in informal sector employment up to 2000 is accounted for by three changes: first, declines in the number of persons employed in agriculture (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>) where own-account employees and the self-employed and unpaid family employment predominated; second, the change in calculating employment from age 13 to 15 has had an impact, as most of this younger age group was in the unpaid family employment category (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466244">Table 1</xref>); and third, the change of definition related to the social security system means that the definition related to coverage by the system alters the data significantly. The percentage of workers covered by the fund has increased from just more than 19% in 1997 to more than 25% in 2010. This would mean that the percentage in the informal sector (“outside the system”) has declined from just more than 80% to 74% over that period. Clearly, the recent change to the definition of formality–informality as inside–outside the social security system makes a considerable difference in the data.</p>

<title>Profile of Precarious Workers</title>
<p>The impact and persistence of precarious work affect both male and female workers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764212466244">Figure 2</xref>). A 2007 NSO survey of informal employment revealed that almost 38% of employed men had formal employment, whereas just fewer than 37% of women had formal employment. Of interest, it is only in the 45 to 49 and 50 to 54 age groups that the number of women with informal employment exceeds that of men. In formal employment, men outnumber women in all age groups. The same 2007 survey indicated that nearly 72% of those with informal employment had elementary education or lower, whereas fewer than 36% of those at these education levels held formal jobs.</p>
<p>Informal work is a feature of employment in all age groups, with informal employment dipping to 50% or less for only those aged 20 to 24 and 25 to 29 years. After that, the percentage of informal employment steadily climbs and is more than 90% for those aged 60 and older. That the rate is lower for the 20 to 34 age groups may suggest that this lower rate of informality may continue to decline as these groups age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0002764212466244">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Approximately 60.4% of all informal employment is in the agricultural sector. Wholesale and retail trade and the hotel and restaurant sectors employ the next highest numbers of informal workers. The highest proportion of informal employment is in agriculture, where more than 93% of those working in the sector have informal employment. Other high levels of informal employment are found in the fishing industry (78.9% of workers), hotels and restaurants (73.5%), and wholesale and retail trade (66.3%). Informal employment in construction was 47.8% and 22.1% in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>This sectoral variation also sees spatial differences, with the NSO (2010, pp. 17, 24) indicating that the highest rates of workers “outside the system” were in the poorest parts of the country, usually where agricultural pursuits continued to be predominant and, hence, wages were lowest. It is unsurprising to note that informal employment was highest in the populous northeastern region (78.6%) and the north (73.8%). The south had just less than 60% informal employment, whereas the central region (49.1%) and Bangkok (33%) were lowest.</p>
<p>Data provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212466244">NSO (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212466244">2011a)</xref> indicate that, in every sector of the economy surveyed in 2009 and 2010, the wages of workers considered formal were substantially higher than those of workers deemed informal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212466244">Table 3</xref>). The ratios of informal to formal salaries in 2010 range from 28% to 70%, meaning that workers in the formal sector enjoy salaries that are substantially higher than those of informal workers in the same industry. Arguably, the expansion of precarious employment has contributed to the stagnation of wages until 2012.</p>

<title>Problems and Issues for Particular Groups of Precarious Workers</title>
<p>Since the Asian economic crisis, the employment of part-time, home-based, agency-supplied, and migrant workers has become more widespread. This has been especially noticeable in the manufacturing and service sectors, especially in Bangkok and in surrounding provinces.</p>
<sec id="section6-0002764212466244">
<title>Part-Time Workers</title>
<p>Very little is known about part-time work in Thailand. The only significant study we have found is by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212466244">Kusol and Sirinand (2005)</xref>. This study argues that regional and global trade agreements liberalizing trade and investment have been driving Thai-based firms to change capital-intensity and management patterns by adopting new forms of employment, including home-based and part-time work. The report notes the expansion of part-time work following the Asian crisis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212466244">Kusol and Sirinand (2005)</xref> found that most part-time workers were women and that part-time work averaged about 4 to 6 hours per day. Although this survey found that part-time workers tended to receive the legal minimum wage pro rata for hours worked, part-time jobs were casualized and thus provided little job security, few welfare benefits and limited training and promotion opportunities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0002764212466244">
<title>Migrant Workers</title>
<p>It is generally accepted that migrant workers experience some of the most difficult employment conditions. The vast majority of these workers are employed in precarious circumstances, being illegal or on short-term work permits and usually employed in sectors that are dirty, dangerous, or degrading.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of migrant workers in Thailand have tended to hover around 1 to 2.5 million since the late 1990s. The majority of these workers enter Thailand from Burma, with others from Cambodia and Laos. Estimates of the number of Burmese migrant workers in Thailand ranged from 1.5 million, as estimated in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212466244">Macan-Markar, 2008</xref>), to more than 1.9 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212466244">Fogarty, 2007</xref>). Migrants are readily exploited and abused as workers, causing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764212466244">Walia (2007)</xref> to observe that “migrant workers represent the perfect workforce in this era of evolving global capital-labor and class relations: commodified and exploitable; flexible and expendable.”</p>
<p>Migrant workers exist in a state of constant exploitation and oppression; there is almost no workplace protection and workers have few rights, their employment is seldom formalized, they work long hours, perform overtime on demand, can be “shed” at any time, and receive the lowest wages. In addition, they have no job security and limited capacity to organize about conditions, wages, and other benefits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212466244">Arnold &amp; Hewison, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0002764212466244">
<title>Contracted and Agency-Supplied Workers</title>
<p>Those studying agency-supplied labor subcontracting or, as it is known in Thailand, outsourced labor, tend to affirm that although this form of employment is not new (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212466244">Paitoon, 2001</xref>), the economic conditions following the Asian crisis provided increased incentives for companies to seek increased employment flexibility and thus cut costs. In turn, employers have expanded the use of agency-supplied workers because they are largely unorganized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466244">Bundit, Voravith, &amp; Suntaree, 2008</xref>, p. 195). In interviews, union sources stated that there has been a significant increase in the number of companies registered as employment agencies and note that international employment firms have entered the market. Home-based work has also become a significant element of the push for enhanced flexibility. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212466244">Foundation for Labour and Employment Promotion (2010)</xref> describes home-based workers as “generally poor and . . . face[d] with unfair wages and remuneration resulting in long hours of working but insufficient to their cost of living” (p. 2).</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, outsourcing is concentrated in the garments, auto parts, electronics, computer, electrical appliances, wood products and furniture, paper products, publishing and printing, rubber, metal products, leather products, and plastic products industries. It is surprising that the exact number of these workers is not easily estimated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212466244">HomeNet Thailand (2003)</xref> refers to the fact that no substantive official figures are available and concludes that the “invisibility of these workers in the national statistics has critically affected the policy making process to include them in the national policy” (p. 318). The best estimates tend to be for home-based workers, where more than 440,000 persons were identified in this category in 2007, although some estimates are 5 times higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212466244">Boonsom &amp; Poonsap, 2009</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>The outsourcing system has been shown to increase insecurity and violate labor rights in several ways. Employers tend to use short-term contracts of 3 to 11 months for agency-sourced workers. Of course, it is the essence of subcontracting that a firm’s workforce can be “flexible,” allowing firms to respond rapidly to production demand and deadlines. In addition, these workers allow employers to easily shed workers as production becomes more globally footloose, without the impediments of the severance compensation for regular employees. Often, outsourced workers have ambiguous and unenforceable contracts.</p>
<p>Those employers making use of agency-sourced workers do not pay any benefits to these workers. They contend that the firms supplying the workers are responsible for benefits. In reality, both sets of employers tend to ignore their obligations, meaning that outsourced employees are usually unprotected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466244">Bundit et al., 2008</xref>). In summary, outsourced workers have no job security and have limited coverage under most labor legislation or, if they do, are entangled in complicated legal webs that obfuscate both the nature of their employment and their lawful employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212466244">Amara et al., 2002</xref>, p. 332). For employers, however, the relationships are clear. Those using the labor may ask the agency to lay off or withdraw a worker at any time and for any reason. Contracted workers are flexible for employers because they are kept in a precarious situation and are regularly prevented from organizing and collective bargaining.</p>
<p>The case studies of precarious work that follow examine the use of agency-sourced and contract workers in the manufacturing sector.</p>

<title>Agencies, Labor, and Precarious Work</title>
<p>In this section, we briefly examine two cases of well-known and long-established companies, both engaged in manufacturing and associated transport activities. These cases are chosen to illustrate broad points regarding flexibilization, precarious employment, wages, and collective bargaining. Each case indicates how major manufacturing companies, in these cases both with majority international ownership, seek to “increase flexibility” by reducing costs through lower wages and by limiting the collective organizing capacity of their workers. In each case these factors account for the introduction of flexibilization through the employment of agency-supplied workers and sustained efforts to replace regular workers.</p>
<sec id="section10-0002764212466244">
<title>Thai Industrial Gases</title>
<p>The Thai Industrial Gases Public Company Limited (TIG) was first established in 1970 and is currently a member of Germany’s Linde Group. TIG is Thailand’s leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial, medical, and specialized gases and related gas equipment. The parent Linde Group has some 50,000 employees in more than 100 countries, with 10 subsidiaries in Thailand, of which TIG is the largest. In the 2010 financial year the Linde Group had sales of almost 12.9 billion euros.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002764212466244">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, seeking to increase the flexibility of its unionized workforce in its distribution department, TIG hired 19 truck drivers on short-term contracts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764212466244">8</xref></sup> TIG made several changes to the working arrangements for these new employees. It extended the period of probationary employment by 6 months to a full year, while making this a fixed-term contract and without recruiting its workers to be permanent. In addition, TIG outsourced some aspects of its gas distribution to truck drivers from an outside company. In mid-2007, just prior to the end of their one year of probation, TIG transferred the 19 truck drivers to an employment agency.</p>
<p>The agency was a subsidiary of the multinational employment and recruitment agency Adecco. Adecco is one of the world’s largest recruitment and human resource supply companies. In Thailand, it lists 10 “branches,” each of which is actually a separately registered company, often a joint venture between a Thai-registered company and the Adecco headquarters, apparently all reporting to Adecco Consulting (Thailand) and Adecco’s head office in Switzerland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002764212466244">9</xref></sup> When they became Adecco employees, the workers continued to do the same jobs as before at TIG, driving TIG delivery trucks on routes that extended through Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Ministry of Commerce regulations suggested that Adecco’s activities with TIG were unusual as Adecco is meant to supply trained workers to a principal company. In this case, however, Adecco received the transferred workers, who were already working for the principal company, TIG, which proceeded to contract them from Adecco. In this situation, Adecco provided no training and simply took over employment of the workers and immediately sent them back to TIG as Adecco employees with poorer conditions than the regular workers (e.g., no access to termination or severance payments). Many of the involved workers felt that they had no choice but to accept the more precarious employment with Adecco.</p>
<p>With disparities between the workers employed by Adecco and those directly employed by TIG being obvious and despite doubts about the agency-employed workers being legally able to join a union, in 2008 the Adecco-employed drivers decided to join the TIG union. Almost immediately, all of the drivers were transferred to yet another employment agency. This was ESTEEM Corporation Recruitment, which had been established only in September 2007, and at the time of the transfer it seemed to have no facilities, not even an office.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002764212466244">10</xref></sup> Workers claimed that they were pressured to sign with ESTEEM or faced dismissal, and about half went over to ESTEEM.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, observing ESTEEM’s parlous state and receiving no stated reason for transferring the workers from Adecco to ESTEEM, the TIG union proposed to management that TIG recruit these agency workers directly and permanently. With support from TIG union members and from workers in Korea and Europe, the union campaigned for the whole month of March 2008 at seven TIG work sites. The union succeeded in having the agency workers recognized, and although the workers’ contracts remained with ESTEEM, there was agreement on union recognition for agency workers, and, subsequently, a 3-year collective agreement (2008–2011) was negotiated for the regularization of agency workers.</p>
<p>When, in 2010, TIG offered the nine ESTEEM agency workers direct employment, the employment contracts were considered inferior to the one that TIG had used for permanent workers before this dispute. For example, the TIG contract provided no specific trip allowances or accommodation for overnight travel. Most important, these contracts stated that employees could not claim any benefits or payment beyond those provided by their contract. Remarkably, the new contract conditions also required that employees not publish any articles, speak in public, or give any media interview considered detrimental to the company’s image.</p>
<p>The case indicates that in the search for cost savings, TIG utilized short-term contracts with reduced benefits. As part of this, the firm moved workers to employment agencies and between different agencies to achieve company aims. The agencies willingly supported TIG, even when it appeared that state regulations were not being met.</p>
<p>Although unions and workers opposed these company efforts, those employed by Adecco and ESTEEM reported feelings of fear and uncertainty. In terms of employment tenure, workers understood that they were on tenuous contracts and worried especially whether older workers would have short-term contracts renewed. Workers also explained that on-the-job injuries and illnesses were the responsibility of the agency, that they had limited death or accident insurance, and that they would be laid off if injured. Workers knew that their pay and benefits were less than those of regular employees and also complained of limited voice. For example, agency workers felt unable to complain about long hours or job assignment changes. The precariousness of their agency employment extended beyond the workplace, for example, the lack of a contract extending beyond a year meant that when seeking loans, banks were usually unwilling to extend credit.</p>

<title>Goodyear (Thailand)</title>
<p>Goodyear (Thailand) was established in 1968 as a joint venture between the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company headquartered in the United States and Thai partners from the Srifuengfung family. The company in Thailand manufactures and distributes tires for automobiles, trucks, and aircraft, employing approximately 1,000 workers. The American parent company continues to hold about two-thirds of the shares in the Thai company and remains a profitable enterprise listed at the Stock Exchange of Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0002764212466244">11</xref></sup> In 2010, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber had global sales of almost US$19 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212466244">Goodyear, 2011</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Goodyear (Thailand) employs workers on a regular, long-term basis; on short, fixed-term contracts; and also on hourly rates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0002764212466244">12</xref></sup> Two unions—the Tire &amp; Rubber Worker Union and the Supervisor Goodyear Union—operate at the company. In 2000, 18 fixed-term contract workers joined the former union. When the union came to negotiate a new 3-year collective agreement, the company questioned whether contract workers could be members of the union, included in the agreement, or receive the same benefits as regular workers. Between 2003 and 2004, the company had not issued new contracts to these workers, and when they did, in late 2004, a worker who refused to sign a contract that reduced benefits was fired. The union then went to the labor court and lodged complaints on unfair dismissal and regarding the collective bargaining rights of members who were contract workers. The company’s response was to dismiss the union president in March 2005, claiming he had defamed the company. Following an international campaign, he was reinstated in September 2005.</p>
<p>Then, in November 2005, the company dismissed all of its short-term contract employees, although it immediately rehired six workers who were not members of the union as agency-supplied labor. In addition, the company replaced all fired workers with other agency-supplied labor. The dismissed workers immediately filed a case claiming unfair dismissal. The Industrial Relations Committee (IRC) ruled in April 2006 that the workers should be reinstated but the company ignored the ruling and instead filed a law suit against the IRC.</p>
<p>In August 2006, Goodyear (Thailand) again fired the president of the Tire &amp; Rubber Worker Union. Meanwhile, in October 2006, the labor court ruled in favor of the short-term contract worker originally fired in late 2004 and ordered the company to pay compensation and damages for unfair dismissal. A month later, the court found in favor of the remaining short-term contract workers fired in November 2005 and also ordered the company to pay compensation and damages for unfair dismissal.</p>
<p>Notably, none of this changed the employment practices at Goodyear (Thailand), which continued to employ agency-supplied and short-term contract workers who were not unionized. Troubled industrial relations continued, revolving around the company’s increased use of agency supplied and contracted workers and Goodyear’s refusal to consult with the unions on any matters associated with contract labor. In March 2007, following a fire at the main plant, some of the problems faced by the workers were illustrated. When the plant was shut down for 6 months, all workers on the production line were suspended. Although regular workers received half pay, contracted and agency workers were laid off without compensation.</p>
<p>In November 2008, as disputation continued between the company and unions, citing an economic downturn, Goodyear (Thailand) gave notice that it would lay off 53 union members. A month later, the company announced that a further 74 permanent workers would be laid off. Workers claimed that none of these firings were conducted in consultation with the unions, as required under the collective agreement. These actions caused the unions to return to court, and again they received a favorable ruling that the company immediately appealed. In addition, workers protested a company policy that meant it claimed the right to dismiss any employee who had relatives working for any company Goodyear (Thailand) considered a competitor.</p>
<p>In 2009, the unions claimed that 120 workers had been hired on 11-month contracts and all were receiving lower pay and fewer benefits than regular employees. This hiring was in response to an amendment to the Labor Protection Act in 2008 (see below) that required that agency-supplied workers receive the same pay and benefits as permanent workers when doing the same jobs. The company’s response was to move the agency workers back to Goodyear (Thailand) employment on 11-month contracts, thus avoiding providing benefits required under the law for workers who completed a year with a company. According to workers, the Goodyear contract reduced their wage from 270 to 212 baht per day. These workers also stated that they did not receive copies of their new company contract as required by law. In total, there were more than 160 workers on short contracts. Most had previously worked at the tire plant prior to 2009, some for up to a decade, employed through a labor agency or on short-term contracts. The unions observed that Thailand’s labor law required that, where there is a collective agreement, workers on individual contracts could not be hired unless wages and benefits met or exceeded those of the collective agreement.</p>
<p>There was no adequate resolution to the dispute and the unions announced a strike in November 2010 following a breakdown of negotiations on a new collective agreement. That breakdown came as the union demanded that the law requiring equal treatment of workers doing the same job and changes on shift length and social benefits. The strike followed 21 rounds of negotiation over 4 months between the union and management and meetings with government mediators. The company responded by locking out all 620 workers who were members of the unions pending an agreement. During the period of negotiation and dispute, the company repeatedly pressured workers to sign individual contracts and to reject the union proposal. The company’s principal demand was that the union agrees to separate the company’s work rules from the collective agreement, with the aim of increasing management flexibility on layoffs. A week after the lockout began, an agreement was reached that provided workers with limited increases to benefits while the company succeeded in splitting work rules from the collective agreement.</p>
<p>In this case it is clear that the company considered that increased flexibility required an attack on unionization and collective agreements. The company readily used contracts and agency suppliers in its efforts to reduce the influence of unions.</p>
<p>These case studies show how major and foreign-invested companies seek to reduce their costs and enhance their “flexibility” by expanding the use of workers on short contracts or supplied by agencies. In essence, this innovation makes wages lower and reduces costs associated with nonwage benefits. At the same time, however, both cases show that the companies were willing to challenge the legal right of workers to engage in effective collective bargaining.</p>

<title>Precarious Work, Law, and Social Protection</title>
<p>As explained above, when discussing the inside-the-system/formal and outside-the-system/informal dichotomy in terms of defining informal work, Thailand has made several advances in social protection that potentially have significant impacts for all workers and could potentially impact the welfare of workers in precarious work. In this section, the focus is on law and social welfare innovations.</p>
<sec id="section13-0002764212466244">
<title>Law and Social Protection</title>
<p>Since 1990, three laws that relate to the expansion of precarious work have been passed or revised. Each targets the use of labor contracting. These are the 1994 amendment to the Social Security Act (1990), the 1994 Workmen’s Compensation Act, and the 2008 amendment of the Labor Protection Act (1998).</p>
<p>The Social Security Act (discussed below) was amended in 1994 to ensure that contracted workers received the same rights as permanent employees. Section 35 of the amended act required that when principal employers subcontracted workers to any entity other than employment service business, then the principal was considered the employer and required to make payments under the act. Section 52 was also amended to ensure that the law applied to all labor subcontractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212466244">Thailand Law Forum, 2010</xref>). Likewise, Sections 10 and 11 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1994 (providing injury, sickness, invalidity, and death benefits) sought to ensure that subcontracted workers were covered by the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212466244">Social Security Office, 2007</xref>). In doing so, these sections allowed for joint responsibility amongst multiple employers and enabled employers who were subcontractors to seek recompense from the principal employer.</p>
<p>The Labour Protection Act was amended in 2008 to acknowledge the expansion of flexible employment. It cut through layers of employment contracting to make the place of work of the employee the “business operator,” the “employer of the people coming to do such work,” and responsible under the act for conditions that were the same as those employees operating under a collective agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466244">International Law Office, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As was shown in the case studies, employers have been able to circumvent these laws and make work increasingly precarious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0002764212466244">
<title>Social Welfare Provisions</title>
<p>There are three schemes in this category: (a) the Worker’s Compensation Fund (WCF), (b) the Social Security Scheme (SSS), and (c) state-funded universal health care (often referred to as the “30 baht scheme” (about 65–70 U.S. cents when introduced) based on the amount patients contribute for medical visits).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0002764212466244">13</xref></sup> The WCF and SSS are both administered by the Social Security Office whereas universal health care is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Health.</p>
<sec id="section15-0002764212466244">
<title>Worker’s Compensation Fund</title>
<p>First established in 1972, the WCF provides employees with security for work-related death, disability, and illness. Initially, the WCF covered only enterprises with 20 or more employees in Bangkok. Coverage was expanded to include firms with 10 or more employees in 1993 and then to cover the whole country in 1998. This change was significant as it technically covered almost 90% of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212466244">Brown et al., 2002</xref>, p. 5). In 2002, a further expansion took place when all firms with one or more employees were included. In 2010, 332,579 employers were registered to pay contributions to the WCF and 8,177,618 employees were covered for work-related injuries and illnesses. Only employers contribute to the WCF, and the rate is calculated based on a formula that includes total payroll and an “experience factor” related to workplace injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466244">Social Security Office, 2010</xref>, pp. 26-29).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0002764212466244">
<title>The Social Security Scheme</title>
<p>The SSS was introduced on September 3, 1990, and began operating in March 1991. Its broad objective was to reduce the inequities in health care access. More specifically, it aimed to provide protection and financial security to private, formal sector employees who died in work-related events or who were injured, sick, or disabled. Benefits include maternity, child allowance, old age pensions, and unemployment benefits. Initially, the SSS covered firms with 20 or more workers, but within 2 years this was expanded to firms with 10 or more workers. In 2002, all firms were included. The SSS is compulsory and receives contributions from employers, employees, and the government, each paying a fixed percentage of the employee’s wages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466244">Social Security Office, 2010</xref>, pp. 6, 9-10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764212466244">Yip, Siripen, Jiruth, Wattana, &amp; Sathirakorn, 2001</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>In 2010, 395,924 enterprises were registered with the SSO, with almost 70.4% being firms with fewer than 10 employees. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0002764212466244">Figure 4</xref>, a total of 9.7 million were insured under the scheme in 2010, although this represented just less than 25.5% of the total workforce.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0002764212466244" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0002764212466244-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>There was little difference between male and female rates of membership, and it is noteworthy that almost 56.8% of the insured were younger than 35 years old. In 2010, contributions were set at 5% of wages for employer and employee, with the state providing 2.75%. By the end of that year, the Social Security Fund stood at just less than 7.5% of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466244">Social Security Office, 2010</xref>, pp. 9-18).</p>
<p>It is clear that the SSS has been unable to extend its coverage much beyond 25%, and membership growth has stagnated since about 2006. Although workers who fall outside registered firms—such as vendors, the self-employed, and so on—are able to gain voluntary coverage under the scheme, this option is unaffordable and inconvenient for precarious workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466244">Social Security Office, 2010</xref>, p. 14). Consequently, in 2010, there were just 747,089 voluntary members. They pay fixed rates of either 280 baht per month or 432 baht per month (the latter attracting a state payment of 120 baht).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0002764212466244">
<title>Universal health care</title>
<p>Prior to 2001, Thailand had several state-funded or subsidized schemes that attended to the health of some of its population, including schemes that were meant to assist the poor. These included two health care cards, one for free treatment for the elderly and very poor and another for reduced cost treatment for those with low incomes, in addition to the SSS discussed above (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466244">Mathana &amp; Hewison, 2002</xref>, pp. 134-136).</p>
<p>These schemes had limited coverage and were seen as inadequate until the 1997 Constitution decreed “that equal access to basic health services should be guaranteed” to citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212466244">Tewarit &amp; Lagrada, 2008</xref>, p. 2028). The negative impacts of the Asian economic crisis led to the political space created for the rise of a new political party led by Thaksin Shinawatra, which, as one of its most popular programs, promised universal health care provision for the payment of just 30 baht per visit. Between April and September 2001 the scheme was quickly piloted and in October 2001 was expanded nationwide. By 2004, 95.5% of the population was covered by the 30 baht scheme, the SSS, WCF, or the generous Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212466244">Hughes &amp; Songkramchai, 2007</xref>, p. 1001).</p>
<p>Overall, the 30 baht scheme and its companion programs demonstrated a decrease in household payments for health care, particularly among the poor, and reduced the occurrences of the impoverishing health payments that had plagued Thailand’s rural poor and working class before 2001 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212466244">Tewarit &amp; Lagrada, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In general terms, these three schemes reduce the insecurity of all workers, and with the exception of migrant workers, even the most precarious of employees gain the benefits of universal health care. That all firms, including the smallest, are meant to be included in the SSS and WCF means that insecurity is reduced. The problem is that most informal employees are not members of either scheme.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Precarious work, characterized by the uncertainty and unpredictability of employment, has long been a feature of work in Thailand. Even so, there have been new forms of precarious work, especially in the post–Asian economic crisis period, that have expanded and been embedded in Thailand’s labor regime. Although there have been major advances in the institution of social safety nets that include universal health provision and a national social security system, precarious work continues to expand. Although the vast majority of workers in precarious circumstances continue to be in the agriculture and fishing sectors, “informal” employment appears to be increasing in absolute terms in almost all sectors of employment. Insecure employment is common for both men and women, and it tends to be more likely among age groups above 30 years of age. Workers in poor provinces and with low education are more likely to be in the “informal” workforce. Informal employees are also more likely to work long hours and to be injured on the job. Most significant, their wages are always lower than those of formal workers in their industrial sector.</p>
<p>Although the percentage of workers “outside the system” is lowest in the manufacturing sector, we chose to examine two cases from that sector. The intention was to demonstrate that flexible employment involving contract and agency workers is not just a strategy to reduce costs, but a powerful means to limit the capacity of workers to collectively organize to improve their conditions or even, where unions exist, to seek protection for these workers.</p>
<p>Precarious work is likely to continue to be a feature of the Thai labor regime. In terms of moving workers “into the system” and hence having them defined as “formal” employees, the agricultural sector remains a significant challenge, and it is difficult to foresee circumstances where the state will be able to subsidize the inclusion of workers in this sector, as has happened with universal health care. In this sense, the movement of workers to the social security system is likely to continue to be slow. At the same time, employers will continue to seek increased “flexibility” in ways that will also reduce worker agency.</p>

<p>In April 2012, the Yingluck Shinawatra government began rolling out a minimum wage policy that raised the legal minimum wage to 300 baht a day. The policy meant significant increases for most workers. Prior to the increase, the minimum wage, which varied by province, was between 159 and 215 baht per day (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212466244">“Thailand—Minimum Wage,” 2011</xref>).</p>
