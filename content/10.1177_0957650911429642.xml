<abstract>
<p>Whole-passage simulations were conducted to simulate the stall inception process in a subsonic compressor rotor. The predicted results agreed well with available steady-state and time-resolving experimental data. The detailed flowfield analyses further demonstrated that the test rotor was of spike-type stall inception. The self-sustained unsteady cycle of tip separation vortex (TSV) was the underlying flow mechanism for the occurrence of the so-called ‘tip clearance spillage flow’ and ‘tip clearance backflow’. Furthermore, the correlation between the self-sustained cycles of TSV in the preceding and native passages was the flow mechanism for emergence of spike. For the test rotor, the distinctive flowfield feature during the development of spike was the involvement of ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650911429642"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The useful operating range of gas turbine engines is limited by the stable operation range of compressor. This instability can be characterized by either stall or surge. Efforts on understanding the onset of rotating stall/surge have been ongoing research subject because they can aid the design of better control method to stabilize the system and enhance engine performance.</p>
<p>It is well accepted that tip clearance flow is of great impact on stability for tip critical compressors, but how it links with stall inception is still an open issue because these kinds of measurements are quiet difficult. Therefore, there are rarely detailed data necessary to understand the physical process of onset of rotating stall. The rapid advance of computational fluid dynamics technology provides an alternative way to analyse the aerodynamic problems because flow structure can be examined in detail where measurement is difficult or impossible. During the past two decades, the steady-flow computational simulation showed the capability for prediction of flow up to the point of compressor stall. Meanwhile, attempts to study stall inception process <italic>via</italic> unsteady simulations have achieved many valuable findings.</p>
<p>Exploring the unsteady behaviour of tip clearance flow at near-stall conditions has been one research branch. Furukawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650911429642">1</xref></bold>] numerically investigated unsteady behaviours in a low-speed compressor rotor, which tip flowfield had been extensively measured by Inoue <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650911429642">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650911429642">5</xref></bold>] at design and near-stall conditions. Inoue <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650911429642">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650911429642">5</xref></bold>] found the interaction between tip leakage flow and incoming flow forced tip leakage flow to roll up into a slender vortex at design point, which could be clearly seen as coiling of secondary vectors near the casing. However, the abnormal flow phenomena were observed at near-stall condition: the coiling of secondary vectors near the casing disappeared, while the low-energy fluid was spread out to about 60 per cent of span. Using available experimental data to validate their simulation results, Furukawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650911429642">1</xref></bold>] proposed a reasonable interpretation of the abnormal phenomena at near-stall condition from a viewpoint of ‘vortex breakdown’. Analysing the simulated flowfield in detail, they also deemed that the breakdown of tip leakage vortex (TLV) was responsible for the unsteadiness of flowfields near the casing. However, experimental and numerical investigations conducted by März <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650911429642">6</xref></bold>] revealed that a vortex structure formed near the leading edge plane, which was the result of interactions among the classical tip clearance flow, axially reverse end-wall flow, and incoming flow. The formation and movement of this vortex seemed to be the main causes of unsteadiness when the test low-speed compressor was operated at near-stall conditions.</p>
<p>Efforts on understanding the onset of rotating stall/surge have been the other research branches. Hoying <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650911429642">7</xref></bold>] first successfully simulated the short-length scale (or spike) rotating stall inception for the low-speed version of <italic>E</italic><sup>3</sup> compressor. They found that the stall inception is a result of the motion of tip clearance vortex moving upstream of the blade passage when the vortex trajectory was aligned with the blade leading edge plane. Though the single- and multi-passage simulations are systematic, Vo and Greitzer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911429642">8</xref></bold>] further proposed two conditions necessary for the formation of spike disturbance: one is that the spillage of tip clearance flow to the adjacent blade passage ahead of the rotor leading edge and below the blade tip; the other is the initiation of backflow stemming from the leakage fluid in adjacent passages at the trailing edge plane. Hereafter, the two necessary conditions will be referred as ‘tip clearance spillage flow’ and ‘tip clearance backflow’. It should be noted that the sequence of these two threshold events may alter, but both must be present for compressors exhibiting spike disturbances. Hah <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650911429642">9</xref></bold>] conducted full-annulus computations to investigate the short-length scale stall inception in a transonic axial compressor rotor, and their observations were consistent with the two conditions proposed by Vo and Greitzer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650911429642">8</xref></bold>]. Furthermore, Chen and Michael [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650911429642">10</xref></bold>] carried out the full-annulus calculations using high-performance parallel computing to study the pre-stall behaviour of a transonic axial compressor stage. Their simulations demonstrated the development of the rotating stall from the growth of rotating instabilities, i.e. a rotating long-length disturbance followed by a spike-type breakdown. Further flowfield analysis indicated that the spike instabilities occurred when the trajectory of tip clearance flow is vertical to the axial direction.</p>
<p>It is no doubt that the instantaneous complicated flow structures near casing at near-stall conditions are closely related to the onset of rotating stall for tip critical compressors. However, no attempts were made to explore the causal link between them. Based on a high-speed small-scale axial compressor rotor, which had been experimentally observed to exhibit the spike-type stall inception, the current study aimed at uncovering the linkage between the unsteadiness of tip clearance flow at near-stall conditions and spike-type stall inception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650911429642"><title>2 TEST COMPRESSOR ROTOR</title>
<p>The present investigations were performed on a subsonic high-speed small-scale axial-flow compressor test rig in Northwestern Polytechnical University, People’s Republic of China. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429642">Figure 1</xref> shows a cross-sectional diagram of this stand. The test rig was designed to be prone to rotor tip critical with its original aim to be suitable for conducting casing treatment investigations. The rotor was isolated from the stator to avoid interaction effects generated by the presence of a downstream stator blade row, and the rotational speed of this rig can be up to 15 200 r/min. The hub/tip ratio of the rotor is 0.6, with the blade tip diameter of 298 mm. The rotor blade has Russia K70 series profile sections. The blade tip section of the rotor has the solidity of 0.961 and chord length of 30 mm. The nominal tip clearance is 0.3 mm (1.0 per cent tip chord or 0.52 per cent blade height), and it can be varied by exchanging casing segments with the rotor diameter remaining constant. Details of design specifications of the rotor were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650911429642">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec3-0957650911429642"><title>3 RELEVANT EXPERIMENTAL AND NUMERICAL WORK</title>
<p>Time-resolving pressure measurement of the test rotor near stall was reported by Lu [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650911429642">11</xref></bold>]. The experiments were performed at corrected rotor speed of 8130 r/min with the clean-inlet condition. The equivalent tip Mach number was about 0.41, and Reynolds number based on rotor tip chord and rotor tip speed was 275 000. First, the operating point of test rotor was pushed to the stall point according to the prescribed location of throttle valve, and the conventional steady-state measurements were conducted at this stage. Then, the stall inception process was initiated using a fine adjustment of throttle value at stall point. High-response pressure transducers at eight locations equally spaced around the annulus ahead of rotor were arranged to detect pressure fluctuations during instability onset. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911429642">Figure 2</xref> shows the stalling pattern of the test rotor with the measured tip clearance size being 0.86 per cent blade height. It can be seen that, when the flowfield was transitioned into unstable state, a spike was first emerged from tip flowfield, and then quickly transitioned into rotating stall cell within about three rotor revolutions.
<fig id="fig2-0957650911429642" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Typical stalling patterns of test rotor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429642-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to understand the fundamental flow mechanisms that lead to spike stall inception, a series of computational investigations, which corresponded to the test condition of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429642">Fig. 2</xref> had been laid out. Wu and Chu [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911429642">12</xref></bold>] conducted steady single-passage simulations for the test rotor. After validating simulation results with available experimental data, the numerically obtained flowfields were analysed to identify the behaviour of tip leakage flow. It was found that the breakdown of leakage vortex occurred inside the rotor passage at near-stall conditions, and a low-velocity region developed along the vortex core. Based on these observations, Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911429642">13</xref></bold>] further carried out single-passage unsteady computations to assess the unsteady behaviour of tip clearance flow at near-stall conditions, and the result was outlined here for completeness. Two typical near-stall conditions mentioned in the following analyses were denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911429642">Fig. 8</xref>.</p>
<p>A monitor point, which was put on the rotor suction surface 30 per cent axial chord downstream of the leading edge and 3 mm inboard of the blade tip, observed an almost periodic static pressure variation at near-stall conditions. The period of static pressure fluctuation at the monitor point was about 50 time steps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911429642">Figure 3</xref> reproduces the instantaneous flowfields near rotor tip during one period of static pressure fluctuations (<italic>T</italic> = 50 time steps) at a near-stall point NSP1. It could be seen that TLV takes on the bubble-type breakdown as steady flow simulations in the previous study of Wu and Chu [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650911429642">12</xref></bold>]. Apart from the breakdown of TLV, the most prominent feature in the figure was that there was another vortex marked by an ellipse. This vortex, denoted as tip separation vortex (TSV), had different strengths during one unsteady cycle of static pressure fluctuations. It has weak strength when first appearing, gradually reached its maximum strength at around instant 30/50<italic>T</italic>, and rapidly decayed in the rear part of the passage. The cyclic formation and movement of TSV resulted in periodic variation in static pressure at the monitor point. Therefore, the unsteady cycle of static pressure fluctuations at monitor point was consistent with the active period of TSV, which was hereafter called self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV.
<fig id="fig3-0957650911429642" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Instantaneous flowfield during one period of static pressure fluctuations for NSP1: (a) <italic>t</italic> = 10/50<italic>T</italic>, (b) <italic>t</italic> = 20/50<italic>T</italic>, (c) <italic>t</italic> = 30/50<italic>T</italic>, (d) <italic>t</italic> = 40/50<italic>T</italic>, and (f) <italic>t</italic> = 50/50<italic>T</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429642-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It was the interaction among tip leakage flow, broken-down TLV, and incoming flow led to the formation of TSV, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911429642">Fig. 4</xref>. Once TSV appeared, its rearward movement and associated variation in strength led to the dynamic variation of interface between incoming flow and tip clearance flow (black dash line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650911429642">Fig. 3</xref>), especially near the pressure side of the passage. This interface reached its utmost position at around <italic>t</italic> = 30/50<italic>T</italic> during one self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV.
<fig id="fig4-0957650911429642" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Sketch of the origin of TSV: (a) NSP1 and (b) UEP</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429642-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As the operating point approached the stall point (UEP), the strength of TSV increased during one self-sustained unsteady cycle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911429642">Figure 5</xref> compares the total pressure loss distributions on a longitudinal section through the vortex core of TSV (blue dash line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911429642">Fig. 4</xref>) at <italic>t</italic> = 30/50<italic>T</italic> for NSP1 and UEP. The stronger TSV at UEP induced the higher total pressure loss, thus producing the larger blockage effect on incoming flow, which led to the incoming/tip clearance flow interface near the pressure side of passage aligned with the leading edge plane during one self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650911429642">Fig. 4(b)</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-0957650911429642" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>A total pressure loss distributions through TSV core: (a) NSP1 and (b) UEP</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429642-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the above analyses, it could be seen that TSV played a decisive role on stall inception compared with TLV, but how it linked with stall inception could not be solved using single-passage simulation with periodic assumption along circumferential direction. This was because non-axisymmetric flow features between blades were the main sources of spike disturbance, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911429642">Fig. 2</xref>, this study thus used a full-annulus model to remove the constraint of periodic assumption in the previous single-passage model.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0957650911429642"><title>4 NUMERICAL METHODOLOGY</title>
<sec id="sec5-0957650911429642"><title>4.1 Numerical schemes</title>
<p>Numerical simulations were performed by flow solver EURANUS. It computed the conservative Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations without <italic>ad hoc</italic> modelling of any flow phenomena other than models required for turbulence. The parallel version of this solver was implemented in a scalable form for using message passing interface system. The parallel implementation employed domain decomposition and supports general multi-block grids with arbitrary grid-block connectivity.</p>
<p>The equations were discretized in space using a cell-centred finite volume formulation. With a view to sharply capture the TLV near the end-wall, a 2nd-order upwind scheme based on a flux difference splitting formulation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650911429642">14</xref></bold>] with the Van Albada limiter being implemented was chosen to evaluate the inviscid fluxes. The viscous fluxes were determined in a central differencing manner with Gauss’s theorem. For steady simulations, the equations were solved using an explicit four-stage Runge–Kutta method with local time step to obtain steady-state solutions. For unsteady simulations, equations were solved using the implicit dual time-stepping method proposed by Jameson [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650911429642">15</xref></bold>], which consists in adding to the time-dependent equations pseudo-time derivative terms. One equation turbulence model of Spalart–Allmaras [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650911429642">16</xref></bold>] was employed to estimate the eddy viscosity. Local time stepping, implicit residual smoothing, and multi-grid techniques were used to reduce the computation cost.</p>
<p>Physical time step for unsteady simulations was determined by rotational speed, and it took a rotor blade 20 time steps to passing through one pitch. Within each physical time step, 50 pseudo-time iterations with a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number of 2–3 were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0957650911429642"><title>4.2 Gridding</title>
<p>In the proper sense, this study was the extension of numerical investigations conducted by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650911429642">13</xref></bold>], and the same single-passage grid should be adopted. However, limited by computation resources, another relatively coarse single-passage grid with true tip gap was built, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650911429642">Fig. 6</xref>. To reduce the grid skewness, O4H topology was chosen to model the main flow region, and butterfly topology was used to model the true tip gap. This grid consisted of 57 points along the annulus height, including 17 points along the radial height of the tip gap, thus having locally fine grid spacing near casing. The minimum grid spacing on the solid wall was 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to evaluate the viscous fluxes at the wall by applying the no-slip and adiabatic conditions. This minimum grid spacing gave <italic>y<sup>+</sup></italic><sup> </sup>≤ 3 at the walls. The full-annulus grid was generated by rotating and replicating the single-passage grid around the annulus. There were 30 blade passages for the entire grid with a total of 6 140 610 grid points, and the grid was partitioned into 210 blocks.
<fig id="fig6-0957650911429642" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Computational mesh</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650911429642-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For the convenience of the forthcoming analysis, the blades and passages were numbered as follows: the blade with <italic>x</italic> ordinate passing through its gravity centre was named as Blade 1, then Blade 2, and so on, along the opposite rotational direction of the rotor; the passage between Blades 1 and 2 was named as Passage 1, then followed by Passage 2 between Blades 2 and 3, etc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0957650911429642"><title>4.3 Boundary condition</title>
<p>No-slip and no-heat transfer conditions were imposed at solid boundaries. For steady calculations, the flow angle, total pressure, and total temperature were specified to be uniform across the whole inlet domain according to the experimental data. The static pressure was set at the mid-span, and the radial equilibrium equation was used to obtain the radial profile. For time-accurate simulation, the choice of exit boundary was same as that used in steady calculation. To accomplish the flow being transitioned from stable to unstable state, a temporary full-span (radially uniform) total pressure disturbance, which rotated with the blade, was introduced at the inlet domain of Passage 3 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911429642">Fig. 6</xref>. The total pressure exerted on inlet domain of Passage 3 was lower than its surroundings by 1000 Pa. This inlet disturbance was removed when it reached the leading edge plane of the rotor.

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0957650911429642"><title>5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Full-annulus steady simulations were first carried out from choke point to last stable point. Then, the time-accurate simulation, where the initial solution was from the last steady stable point, was carried out by introduction of inlet artificial distortion described above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911429642">Figure 7</xref> shows the time histories of inlet/outlet mass flowrate for time-accurate simulation.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0957650911429642"><title>5.1 Comparison with steady experimental data</title>
<p>To validate the simulation results, the predicted results were first compared with available measured data. The comparison between the predicted and measured rotor performance was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650911429642">Fig. 8</xref>, where the time-averaged data from single-passage unsteady simulations were also presented for reference. The overall shape from full-annulus steady simulations matches the experiment’s well. The deviation in total pressure ratio was significantly large at the choked end, but the predicted values fell into error band when approaching the stall end. The flowrate difference between the measured stall and the last stable points from full-annulus steady simulation was about 0.1 kg/s, which fell into the error band of mass flow measurements. This meant the full-annulus steady simulation predicted the real stall point reasonably well.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650911429642">Figure 9</xref> compares the calculated spanwise profiles of total pressure and flow angle at the last stable point from full-annulus simulation with those at measured stall point. Generally, the numerical results reproduced the measured radial profiles of total pressure and flow angle well. Especially, the predicted values agreed much better with the measured data from casing to 90 per cent span. The discrepancy between the predicted and measured profiles from hub to 90 per cent span was probably due to the difference between numerical and experimental inlet boundary conditions. In experiments, the air flowed into the compressor through a radial–axial inlet duct, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650911429642">Fig. 1</xref>. This led to the non-uniform distributions of inlet flow parameters along spanwise direction. The relatively larger flow angles compared to those from calculation indicated that initial negative swirl were exerted on the blade elements near hub, thus making them produce the lower experimental flow angle and total pressure at outlet plane. The flow redistribution due to the non-uniform inlet flow angle apparently contributed to the slightly high experimental outlet flow angle and total pressure around mid-span.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650911429642">Fig. 7</xref>, after the inlet distortion was removed from flowfield, the mass flow remained a nearly constant value in the range <italic>t</italic> = 200–470 with the self-adjustment of flowfield. Then, it slowly decreased, followed by a sharp decrease in mass flowrate; hence, the probable period of spike emergence was in the range <italic>t</italic> = 200–470. To obtain comparable results with that from experiment, the annulus static pressure distributions, which axial location was same as that in measurement, were first examined during this period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650911429642">Figure 10</xref> presents the static pressure distribution on flow annulus ahead of the rotor at four representative instants. A spot with extremely high pressure first appeared on the flow annulus at <italic>t</italic> = 290, and then it spread along the circumference opposite to the rotational direction of rotor. About an interval of 60 time steps, this spot rotated over a tip pitch, that is to say, the propagation speed of this spot is about 33.3 per cent rotor speed. If viewed from absolute frame, the high-pressure spot propagated at about 66.7 per cent rotor speed with the same rotational direction of rotor. This phenomenon was well coincident with the experimental observation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650911429642">Fig. 2</xref>.

<p>The above consistencies between simulations with experiments indicated that simulation could reasonably capture the flow mechanisms of spike-type inception although the relatively coarse grid was adopted in the current investigation. Thus, the instantaneous flowfields in the range <italic>t</italic> = 200–500 were investigated to uncover the flow mechanism of spike emergence.</p>

<p>Thirty numerical probes aligned with the leading edge of each blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650911429642">Fig. 6</xref>) were arranged to monitor the time variation of static pressure ahead of rotor tip. These probes were uniformly distributed around the circumference at the location identical to that in measurement at about 99 per cent span. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650911429642">Figure 11</xref> shows the time variations of static pressure at the probe locations in the range <italic>t</italic> = 200–500. There was a pin appearing on the pressure traces of probe 9 through probe 12, which corresponded to the high-pressure spots on flow annulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650911429642">Fig. 10</xref>). The pressure signals detected by the numerical probes were further analysed by FFT method, and sample frequency–spectrum plots were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911429642">Fig. 12</xref>. The common feature in all frequency–spectrum plots was that there was a peak at the frequency of 2/5 blade passing frequency (BPF), which coincides with the active frequency of TSV. This implied that TSV could exist in each blade-tip passage, but its active energy varied with the blade-tip loading, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650911429642">Fig. 12</xref>.

It was clearly seen that TSV did exist in the deteriorating passages 6–8. As described in section 3, once TSV appeared, its rearward movement would lead to self-sustained flow oscillations with a period approximate to 50 time steps. As a result, the positions of TSVs in deteriorating passages 6–8 at instant <italic>t</italic> = 250 were almost same as those at <italic>t</italic> = 200, but their strength varied significantly due to the dynamic adjustment of near-tip loading.

<p>When TSVs in current self-sustained unsteady cycle moved downstream, the blockage effects arising from them would destroyed the normal diffusion process in near-tip passages, thus influencing the static pressure distribution on blade-tip section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650911429642">Figure 14</xref> presents the static pressure distribution on blade-tip section at the same instants as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Fig. 13</xref>. The diagonally inward spiral motion of TSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650911429642">Fig. 5</xref>) induced a relatively low-pressure region with closely spaced isolines across over Passage 7, and the spot with extremely low pressure was the footprint of the front end of TSV. When TSV in Passage 7 gradually moved away from the leading edge of Blade 8, a small high-pressure spot (red colour) appeared at <italic>t</italic> = 220 due to the blockage effect arising from TSV. This high-pressure spot enlarged with the rearward movement of TSV, and it finally merged into the high-pressure region located near the outlet of rotor passage accompanied by the disappearance of low pressure region induced by the front end of TSV at <italic>t</italic> = 250. At the same time, another high-pressure spot appeared in the middle of leading edge plane of Passage 7 due to the activity of TSV in the next unsteady cycle. TSVs in Passages 6 and 8 also exerted the influence on blade-tip sections during the same period. However, what extent it affected the static pressure distribution depended on its strength. The stronger TSV was, the more severely it affected the static pressure distribution on blade-tip section. <italic>Via</italic> comparing static pressure distributions on blade-tip section, it could be inferred that TSVs in Passages 6–8 approximated to its maximum strength at instant <italic>t</italic> = 210. Moreover, TSV in Passage 7 was the strongest compared to those in the other deteriorating passages at the same instant during the current self-sustained unsteady cycle, so that it was capable of rolling up the fluid from TLV in Passage 6 to bypass it at instant <italic>t</italic> = 240 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Fig. 13</xref>(e)). With decaying of TSV, the bypassing fluid from TLV in Passage 6 was turned into the so-called ‘tip clearance backflow’ at instant <italic>t</italic> = 250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Fig. 13</xref>(f)).

<p>TSV in Passage 7 first rolled towards the pressure side of passage along the interface between incoming and tip clearance flow, and then convected downstream along the pressure side of the passage. This process in turn led to a gradual increase in tip incidence angle of Blade 8. TSV in Passage 8 became strongest during the next self-sustained unsteady cycle, which was clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Figs 13</xref>(e) to (f) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650911429642">14</xref>(e) to (f). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Figure 15</xref> shows the instantaneous tip leakage streamlines in the range <italic>t</italic> = 260–290. The movement of TSV in Passage 8 towards the pressure side of passage also accomplished the flow blockage transfer, accordingly improving the flow in Passage 7. The fluid from TLV in Passage 7 gradually turned into flow that impinged on the pressure side of Passage 7 with the dissipation of TSV in the next unsteady cycle. After the rear end of TSV in Passage 8 left the bounding of suction surface, part of the fluid from TLV in Passage 7 was rolled up and bypassed the TSV in Passage 8 at instant <italic>t</italic> = 280 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Fig. 15</xref>(c)), while almost all of them bypassed TSV at instant <italic>t</italic> = 290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Fig. 15</xref>(d)).

<p>If <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Fig. 15</xref>(d) was compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Fig. 13</xref>(e), it was clearly seen that there was a drastic change in flowrate of bypassing fluid from TLV, as well as the location that bypassing flow occurred. This implied that the strength of TSV in Passage 8 drastically increased compared to that in Passage 7. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0957650911429642">Figure 16</xref> compares the limiting streamline on suction side of Blade 7 at instant <italic>t</italic> = 210 with that of Blade 8 at instant <italic>t</italic> = 270. A shift of the attachment line of TLV towards hub indicated that the occurrence of ‘tip clearance backflow’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">Figs 13</xref>(f) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">15</xref>(a) and (b)) led to a rapid increase in tip incidence angle of Blade 8, thus producing the stronger TSV in Passage 8, which was strong enough to roll up the low energy fluid from suction boundary into the TSV. A separation focus, which appeared on the suction side of Blade 8 near trailing edge, could be seen as the footprint of rear end of TSV in Passage 8. Therefore, under the action of strong rolling-up force of TSV at <italic>t</italic> = 290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Fig. 15</xref>(d)), almost all fluids from TLV in Passage 7 was rolled up and bypassed the TSV in Passage 8.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0957650911429642">Figure 17</xref> illustrates the leakage streamlines at four representative instants, which the bypassing fluid from TLV in adjacent passages was mostly converted into ‘tip clearance spillage flow’. At <italic>t</italic> = 295, part of the bypassing fluid was turned into the ‘tip clearance spillage flow’, thus forming ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’, which route was sketched by a black dot line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0957650911429642">Fig. 17</xref>(a). As time passed by, the similar flow phenomena, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">Fig. 15</xref>, represented themselves in Passages 8 and 9, Passages 9 and 10, and Passages 10 and 11, till <italic>t</italic> = 470. These processes brought the continuous movement of high-pressure spot on flow annulus ahead of rotor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650911429642">Fig. 10</xref>).

<p>As deduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0957650911429642">Fig. 17</xref>, the strength of TSV associated with the propagation of high-pressure spot became stronger and stronger, so that the more and more bypassing fluid from TLV in adjacent passage was converted into ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’. However, the ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’ was confined to the preceding passage before <italic>t</italic> = 470. That is, the propagation of high-pressure spot concerned the tip clearance behaviour in three adjacent passages. At <italic>t</italic> = 475, not only all fluids from TLV in Passage 10, but also part of fluid from TLV in Passage 9 (red dot line), formed ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’.</p>
<p>The interface between incoming and tip clearance flow, and radial extent of spillage flow varied dynamically according to the position and strength of TSV. That is, when the high-pressure spot ahead of rotor rotated over a tip pitch, there was an utmost position of the interface away from the leading edge in deteriorating passages as well as a maximum radial extent of spillage flow, which occurred at the same instants in 17. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0957650911429642">18</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0957650911429642">19</xref> show the entropy distributions on a surface of revolution at blade tip and on the flow annulus ahead of the rotor at 16 per cent tip axial chord, respectively, at two representative instants. The utmost position of the interface between incoming and tip clearance flow was pushed further away from the leading edge as TSV in deteriorating passages became stronger and stronger. Meanwhile, the maximum radial extent of tip spillage flow also covered the more and more outer span, but it is still within 30 per cent outer span at <italic>t</italic> = 475.

<p>It is well accepted that spike can be viewed as embryonic stall cells, and it differs from stall cells in that the circumferential and radial extent of spike was 2–3 tip pitch and less than 30 per cent span. Consequently, it could be concluded that the high-pressure spot in the range <italic>t</italic> = 290–470 was the spike detected by measurement due to the fact that its propagation concerned tip clearance flow behaviour in three adjacent passages, and its radial extent was less than 30 per cent span.</p>
<p>As shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650911429642">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650911429642">15</xref>, the emergence of spike concerned the process that TSV in Passage 7 convected downstream along the pressure side of the passage, i.e. the rear part of self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV in Passage 7, and the process that TSV in Passage 8 propagated towards pressure side of the passage along the interface between incoming and tip clearance flows, i.e. the fore part of self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV in Passage 8. That is, the correlation between the self-sustained unsteady cycles of TSV in Passages 7 and 8 was the flow mechanism for emergence of spike. Furthermore, the continuous movement of high-pressure spot on flow annulus ahead of rotor or propagation of spike when it emerged from flowfield also depended on the correlation between the self-sustained unsteady cycles of TSV in two adjacent passages, i.e. Passages 8 and 9, Passages 9 and 10, and Passages 10 and 11.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, it could be seen that the self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV was responsible for the occurrence of the so-called ‘tip clearance spillage flow’ and ‘tip clearance backflow’, which dynamically appeared according to the position of TSV; the correlation between the self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSVs in the preceding and native deteriorating passages was the flow mechanism for emergence and propagation of spike. For the test rotor, another distinctive flowfield feature during the development of spike was that the bypassing fluid from TLV in the preceding passage converted into ‘tip clearance spillage flow’, thus forming ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0957650911429642"><title>6 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Based on the available experimental data and previous single-passage simulation results, whole-passage simulations were laid out to investigate the flow mechanism of stall inception in an axial-flow compressor rotor, and the following conclusions were drawn.
<list id="list1-0957650911429642" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The predicted steady-state total performance of the compressor rotor matched the experiment’s well. Spanwise distributions of aerodynamic parameters at last stable point also agreed well with the experimental data at stall point. During the transition process of the flowfield from stable to unstable state, a high-pressure spot appeared on the flow annulus at the same axial location as that in measurement, which spread at about 33.3 per cent rotor speed in relative frame during a certain period. This propagation speed was equal to that of spike observed in experiment if viewed from the absolute frame. These data implied that simulation could reasonably capture the flow mechanisms of spike-type inception.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The further flowfield analyses demonstrated that the high-pressure spot with the propagation speed approximate to 33.3 per cent rotor speed was classified into spike due to the fact that its propagation concerned tip clearance flow behaviour in three adjacent passages, and its radial extent was less than 30 per cent span.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The self-sustained unsteady cycle of TSV in deteriorating passage was responsible for so-called ‘tip clearance spillage flow’ and ‘tip clearance backflow’. Furthermore, the correlation between the self-sustained cycles of TSV in the preceding and native deteriorating passages was the flow mechanism for emergence and propagation of spike. The distinctive flowfield feature during the development of spike for the test rotor was the involvement of ‘tip clearance back-spillage flow’.</p></list-item>
