<abstract>
<p>Previous research has suggested that aggressive individuals exhibit a bias to perceive nonangry expressions as angry. Another line of thinking, however, posits that aggression is a learned response to hostile environments and should be linked to social-cognitive skills suited to such environments. If so, aggressive individuals may exhibit greater perceptual sensitivity to subtle facial cues of anger. Three studies were conducted to test this proposal. In them, participants’ ability to discriminate between subtly different intensities of facial anger was tested. Aggressive participants generally displayed greater perceptual sensitivity to subtle cues of facial anger. This pattern could not be explained in terms of response bias and was specific to angry expressions. The results thus support the idea that aggression is associated with social-cognitive skills rather than bias and ineptitude.</p>

<body>
<p>Imagine you are having a debate with a rather aggressive colleague. The discussion has been mostly civil thus far, but then your colleague makes a subtly rude comment. After noticing your facial expression, your colleague immediately accuses you of becoming angry. You feign ignorance and claim you were not angry at all. Privately, you suspect that your colleague is biased to perceive completely neutral facial expressions as angry. Yet, is it possible that your aggressive colleague was actually correct? Is it possible that he correctly perceived a subtle tinge of anger in your expression, even if you were not fully aware of it yourself?</p>
<p>This scenario contrasts two different views of aggression and facial expression perception. The first perspective suggests that aggressive individuals are biased to perceive anger in others’ facial expressions. By contrast, the second perspective suggests that aggressive individuals are actually highly accurate and capable of identifying even minute expressions of anger. Below, we review research consistent with both perspectives. To resolve inconsistencies in the literature, we suggest that signal detection paradigms are needed. Three studies are presented using such paradigms. Our results consistency favored the idea that aggressive individuals are perceptually sensitive to facial anger, rather than biased.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167211430233">
<title>The Bias Perspective</title>
<p>Researchers have long argued that aggressive individuals exhibit biased perceptions of the social world. Beginning with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211430233">Dodge (1980)</xref>, studies have indicated that aggressive individuals tend to interpret the ambiguous actions of others in a hostile manner. The empirical support for this <italic>hostile attribution bias</italic> is robust. Although originally documented among subclinical aggressive children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211430233">Dodge, 1980</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167211430233">Orobio de Castro, Veerman, Koops, Bosch, &amp; Monshouwer, 2002</xref>, for a meta-analytic review), this effect has been demonstrated with juvenile offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211430233">Dodge, Price, Bachorowski, &amp; Newman, 1990</xref>), subclinical aggressive adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211430233">Dill, Anderson, Anderson, &amp; Deuser, 1997</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167211430233">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167211430233">2010</xref>, for relevant reviews), and adult criminal offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211430233">James &amp; Seagor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167211430233">Walter, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211430233">Crick and Dodge’s (1994)</xref> social information processing theory, the hostile attribution bias may be due to earlier failures to properly encode social cues. Angry facial expressions are highly relevant in this regard, as they are one of the most well-established nonverbal signals of hostile intent. Both explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211430233">Knutson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167211430233">Yik &amp; Russell, 1999</xref>) and implicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211430233">Adams, Ambady, Macrae, &amp; Kleck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167211430233">Wilkowski &amp; Meier, 2010</xref>) sources of data indicate that people interpret angry expressions as signals of hostile intent.</p>
<p>Building on this perspective, a number of studies have investigated the possibility that aggressive individuals are biased to perceive nonangry facial expressions as angry. Most of these studies focused on misperceptions of expressions other than anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211430233">Barth &amp; Bastiani, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211430233">Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211430233">Knyazaev, Bocharov, Slobodskaya, &amp; Ryabichenko, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211430233">Larkin, Martin, &amp; McClain, 2002</xref>), although one study also included expressions displaying a mixture of anger and other emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211430233">Schultz, Izard, &amp; Bear, 2004</xref>). The results have largely supported the claim that aggressive individuals display a biased tendency to perceive these expressions as angry.</p>
<p>Three of these studies also explored the ability to accurately perceive angry expressions as angry. These results have been less consistent, with one study suggesting that aggressive individuals are more accurate in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211430233">Barth &amp; Bastiani, 1997</xref>) and two other studies showing no significant relation along these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211430233">Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211430233">Larkin et al., 2002</xref>). However, these studies concentrated on participants’ perceptions of full, prototypical anger expressions. As reviewed in greater detail below, there is reason to believe that this may be a relatively insensitive measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167211430233">
<title>The Sensitivity Perspective</title>
<p>In contrast to the above-presented perspective, several theorists have argued that aggression is not invariably associated with cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211430233">Cillessen &amp; Mayeax, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211430233">Sutton, Smith, &amp; Swettenham, 1999a</xref>). These theorists contend that at least some aggressive individuals exhibit unique cognitive skills that support their aggressive social style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211430233">Sutton, Smith, &amp; Swettenham, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167211430233">Vaughn, Vollenwider, Bost, Azria-Evans, &amp; Snider, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, there are several compelling reasons to believe that aggressive individuals have more exposure to and thus more practice interacting with aggressive environments. Aggressive individuals are often the product of aggressive environments. They frequently emerge from homes characterized by harsh or abusive parenting styles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211430233">Deuter-Deckard &amp; Dodge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211430233">Patterson, DeBaryshe, &amp; Ramsey, 1989</xref>, for relevant reviews). Similarly, they are more likely to be characterized by a history of exposure to violent media (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>, for a review). Finally, aggressive individuals also create their own aggressive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson, Buckley, &amp; Carnegey, 2008</xref>). By engaging in unprovoked aggression, these individuals anger those around them and evoke retaliation against themselves.</p>
<p>Basic psychophysics research indicates that practice trying to perceive a stimulus leads to increased perceptual sensitivity to it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211430233">Goldstone, 1998</xref>, for a review). For example, a recent investigation gave participants practice trying to discriminate subliminally presented stimuli that were initially perceived at chance levels of accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211430233">Schwiedrzik, Singer, &amp; Melloni, 2009</xref>). With adequate practice, these individuals’ perceptual sensitivity to such stimuli increased and surpassed chance accuracy. Importantly, this study found that bias was completely unaffected by practice.</p>
<p>The domain of aggressive stimuli is no different in this regard. Research indicates that individuals immersed in hostile environments become more perceptually sensitive to angry expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167211430233">Pollak &amp; Kistler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211430233">Pollak, Messner, Kistler, &amp; Cohn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167211430233">Pollak &amp; Sinha, 2002</xref>). These studies specifically compared abused and nonabused children using a paradigm that is arguably more sophisticated than the studies reviewed above. Participants were shown a series of graded facial expressions (e.g., from 0% angry/100% neutral to 100% angry/0% neutral) and asked to identify each expression. Across studies, abused children were able to accurately perceive angry expressions at lower intensities than nonabused children.</p>
<p>Several details concerning these findings are highly relevant here. First, this difference in perceptual sensitivity was confined to moderate-intensity anger expressions. By the time full, prototypical anger is displayed, no differences were apparent between abused and nonabused children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211430233">Pollak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167211430233">Pollak &amp; Kistler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167211430233">Pollak &amp; Sinha, 2002</xref>). Second, these studies applied signal detection theory algorithms to separate perceptual sensitivity from bias. The results clearly indicate that abused children were more sensitive to facial signals of anger rather than more biased. The current investigation applied a similar paradigm to test the hypothesis that aggressive individuals are more perceptually sensitive to facial anger rather than more biased.</p>

<title>Separating Bias From Accuracy</title>
<p>Previous studies on aggression and facial expression perception have treated perceptions of angry and nonangry facial expressions as completely separate dependent measures. They have specifically focused on the “accurate” perception of angry expressions as angry and the “biased” perception of nonangry faces as angry. As psychophysics researchers long ago noted, such measures of bias and accuracy are not entirely separate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>, for an accessible introduction to this theory). The “accurate” perception of a presented stimulus can sometimes be due to a bias to indicate a stimulus is present, regardless of whether it is truly present or not. For example, if participants are rewarded every time they accurately identify a stimulus, they will begin to show an overall response bias toward indicating the stimulus is present (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211430233">Levine, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>More relevant to current concerns, the “biased” tendency to indicate that a stimulus is present under degraded conditions can represent increased perceptual sensitivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211430233">Hecht, Shlaer, &amp; Pirenne, 1941</xref>). This is especially true in the context of facial expressions. As the intensity of an expression can vary continuously, some individuals may be able to accurately identify an expression even at moderate or low intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211430233">Pollak, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current investigation, we employed methods developed by signal detection theorists to better separate accuracy from bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). We modeled our studies after classic psychophysical investigations on perceptual thresholds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211430233">Hecht et al., 1941</xref>). In these studies, the intensity of a signal (e.g., the loudness of a sound) is varied, and the participants is asked to indicate when he or she can detect the presented stimulus. On each trial, there are four possible outcomes. First, the participant can successfully identify a stimulus that is present (i.e., a hit). Second, the participant can fail to identify a stimulus that was present (i.e., a miss). Third, the participant can correctly indicate that no stimulus was present (i.e., a correct rejection). Finally, the participant can falsely indicate that a stimulus was present when it was not (i.e., a false alarm).</p>
<p>Within such tasks, a bias toward indicating a stimulus is present is reflected by an increase in both hits and false alarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). This pattern indicates that the participant has an overall tendency to indicate the stimulus is present regardless of whether it is truly present or not. The signal detection index of <italic>beta</italic> formally quantifies such biases. By contrast, perceptual sensitivity is reflected by an increase in the number of hits but not false alarms. Such a pattern indicates that the participant is correctly detecting an increase in stimulus intensity, rather than simply displaying an overall bias to indicate the signal is present. The signal detection index of <italic>d prime</italic> formally quantifies perceptual sensitivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146167211430233">
<title>The Current Studies</title>
<p>In our studies, we varied the intensity of facial signals of anger by presenting participants with a series of facial expressions displaying a mixture of two emotions. The critical faces contained different levels of anger (Study 1: 0% and 50% anger; Studies 2 and 3: 40%, 50%, and 60% anger). We predicted that aggressive individuals would be more sensitive to subtle increases in facial anger. We furthermore predicted that this relation could not be explained in terms of bias and that it would be unique to angry expressions.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is useful to elaborate on the precise personality measures and facial expression stimuli used in these studies. Regarding personality measures, we focused on the construct of <italic>physical aggression</italic> rather than the related constructs of verbal aggression, hostile interpersonal attitudes, or trait anger. The reason for this is simple: Past research has most clearly connected experience with aggressive environments to physical aggression itself. Harsh parenting styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211430233">Deuter-Deckard &amp; Dodge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211430233">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>) and violent media exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>) both causally increase physical aggression. Similarly, acts of physical aggression have been found to evoke retaliatory responses from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, there is a clear basis in the literature for predicting the physically aggressive individuals will have developed greater perceptual expertise with angry expressions.</p>
<p>By contrast, the evidence that exposure to aggressive environments is linked with the related personality constructs of verbal aggression, hostility, or trait anger is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, we included measures of these related constructs in the current studies to help explore the generality of effects. We return to these related aspects of personality at the conclusion of the studies.</p>
<p>In regard to facial expression stimuli, we opted for stimuli that provided a great deal of experimental control to properly execute a signal detection paradigm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillon &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). Given that real-world facial expressions are extraordinarily complex stimuli involving simultaneous movements of many facial muscles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211430233">Smith &amp; Scott, 1997</xref>), we employed computer-generated expressions. These expressions were created using the software package, FaceGen Modeller 3.3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211430233">Singular Inversions, 2004</xref>), which allows one to adjust expressions to precisely match an intended intensity (e.g., 50% anger). Stimuli created using this program have been used in multiple investigations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211430233">Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211430233">Schulte-Ruther, Markowitsch, &amp; Fink, &amp; Piefke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167211430233">Todorov, Baron, &amp; Oosterhof, 2008</xref>), and participants can recognize such expressions with comparable accuracy to posed facial expressions from standardized stimulus sets (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211430233">Schulte-Ruther et al., 2007</xref>; see also our own pretest reported below). Thus, stimuli created using this program are both valid and provide adequate experimental control for current purposes.</p>

<sec id="section5-0146167211430233">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In our first study, participants were presented with a series of faces displaying an even mixture of two facial expressions. These included all possible combinations of anger, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality. For each expression, participants were asked to indicate which of the five relevant expressions was displayed. We predicted that physically aggressive individuals would be more capable of discriminating between faces displaying 50% anger and faces displaying no anger whatsoever (i.e., faces displaying a mixture of two other emotions). Furthermore, we predicted that this difference could not be explained in terms of a response bias, and that it would not generalize to perceptions of other expressions.</p>

<p>Twenty exemplars of each combination were generated, resulting in a grand total of 200 facial expressions. Because the features that define facial masculinity are naturally confounded with the features defining facial anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167211430233">Becker, Kenrick, Neuberg, Blackwell, &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>), faces were constrained to be gender neutral in appearance. Gender neutrality is objectively defined within this program as the midpoint of parameters that distinguish male from female faces within the database of scanned faces. To control for cross-racial disparities in facial recognition accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211430233">Elfenbein &amp; Ambady, 2003</xref>), faces were constrained to match the racial makeup of the vast majority of our subject pool (i.e., non-Hispanic Caucasian).</p>

To avoid making one expression systematically more prominent than others (e.g., by always assigning it to the 1 button), expressions were randomly assigned to different buttons on a trial-by-trial basis. For example, participants may press the 3 button for anger on one trial, but the 5 button for anger on the next trial. On each trial, response mappings were prominently displayed to both the right and left of the face.</p>
<p>Once participants completed the facial expression perception task, they next completed the Aggression Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211430233">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>). Of foremost interest was the Physical Aggression subscale of this instrument. This scale involves nine statements (e.g., “Once in awhile, I can’t control the urge to hit another person”) indicative of tendencies toward physical aggression. Participants indicate how accurately each statement describes them using a 1 (<italic>very inaccurate</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very accurate</italic>) response scale.</p>
<p>The Physical Aggression scale has been repeatedly validated for its ability to predict aggression in both laboratory and field settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211430233">Bettencourt, Talley, Benjamin, &amp; Valentine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211430233">Bushman &amp; Anderson, 1998</xref>, for relevant meta-analytic reviews). Moreover, it exhibits excellent convergent validity with other self-report measures of aggression and discriminate validity with related constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211430233">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211430233">Martin, Watson, &amp; Wan, 2000</xref>). Finally, this scale exhibited excellent internal validity in the current study (α = .87).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants arrived at the laboratory and provided informed consent. They then completed the facial expression perception task followed by the Aggression Questionnaire. Tasks were always completed in this order because it is well established that increasing the salience of a personality trait will have effects on subsequent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167211430233">Carver, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211430233">Harmon-Jones, Lueck, Fearn, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2006</xref>). By contrast, we could locate no evidence suggesting that the completion of a facial expression perception task (or any similar task) can alter one’s responses to a personality questionnaire in a fashion that would confound our results. In fact, evidence indicates that one’s responses to the aggression questionnaire are highly stable over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211430233">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Anger perceptions</title>
<p>Our first analysis focused on the percentage of trials in which participants perceived anger in an expression. This analysis was conducted using the general linear model (GLM), which allows for the combination of discrete within-subject variables and continuous between-subject variables. Blend (50% anger vs. 0% anger) was entered as a discrete within-subject factor, and participants’ standardized physical aggression scores were entered as a continuous between-subject factor. Because physical aggression was higher among males (<italic>M</italic> = 2.70) than females (<italic>M</italic> = 1.83), <italic>t</italic>(52) = 4.21, <italic>p</italic> = .0001, gender was entered as a control variable. For all significant effects involving physical aggression, estimated means were calculated for participants low (mean − 1 <italic>SD</italic>) and high (mean + 1 <italic>SD</italic>) in physical aggression, as per the well-validated procedures introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211430233">Aiken and West (1991)</xref>. Simple slope analyses were also conducted in all studies of this investigation to decompose significant interactions involving physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211430233">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Supporting the validity of our manipulation, there was a main effect of blend, such that participants perceived anger more frequently for the 50% anger expressions (<italic>M</italic> = 47.4%) than for the 0% anger expressions (<italic>M</italic> = 2.8%), <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 327, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Furthermore, there was a main effect of physical aggression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 4.99, <italic>p</italic> = .029, such that participants high in physical aggression indicated faces were angry on a higher percentage of trials (<italic>M</italic> = 11.0%) than did participants low in physical aggression (<italic>M</italic> = 9.6%).</p>
<p>However, both of these main effects were qualified by the predicted Blend × Physical Aggression interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 6.21, <italic>p</italic> = .016, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .11. Estimated means for this interaction are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167211430233">Figure 2</xref>. Although individuals low in physical aggression significantly differentiated between the 0% and 50% anger expressions, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 94.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, individuals high in physical aggression more strongly differentiated between these two blends, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 195.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001.</p>

<title>Perceptions of other emotions</title>
<p>To ascertain whether the above effects were specific to perceptions of anger, parallel analyses were conducted for the perception of all other expressions present in this study (i.e., fear, sadness, and happiness). In these analyses, facial expressions were divided between those containing 50% and 0% of the relevant target emotion. Validating our stimuli, all analyses yielded a highly significant main effect of blend, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .0001, such that the target expression was always perceived on a higher proportion of trials for the 50% blends than the 0% blends. More importantly, though, there were no significant effects involving physical aggression across all analyses, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0146167211430233">
<title>Signal detection analyses</title>
<p>Our first analysis suggested that participants high in physical aggression were more sensitive to subtle facial cues of anger, in that they more clearly discriminated between 0% and 50% anger expressions. To more definitively determine whether these effects are due to sensitivity or bias, the signal detection indices of <italic>d’</italic> and Beta were next calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). The sensitivity index, <italic>d′</italic>, reflects a person’s sensitivity to the difference between the 0% and 50% conditions. The bias index, Beta, reflects a person’s bias to indicate a face is displaying a given emotion regardless of its actual expression. These two indices were calculated for all expressions examined in the current study using an Excel worksheet modeled after Table 1.1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan and Creelman’s (2005</xref>, p. 21) user guide.</p>
<p>At the zero-order level, anger <italic>d′</italic> exhibited a marginal positive relation with physical aggression, <italic>r</italic> = .23, <italic>p</italic> = .09, and Happy <italic>d′</italic> exhibited a marginal negative relation with physical aggression, <italic>r</italic> = –.23, <italic>p</italic> = .09. Neither anger Beta (<italic>r</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .96) nor any remaining signal detection index approached a significant relation with physical aggression, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .18. These findings suggest that physical aggression is related to sensitivity to angry facial cues, rather than bias.</p>
<p>Sensitivity scores tended to be positively correlated with each other, all <italic>r</italic>s &gt; .32, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .02, as might be expected from an emotional intelligence perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167211430233">Mayer, Roberts, &amp; Barsade, 2008</xref>). It is possible that a stronger relation between physical aggression and anger sensitivity would be observed when controlling for such overlapping abilities. This proved to be the case. In a multiple regression, all signal detection indices were simultaneously entered as predictors of physical aggression. Gender was added as a control variable. Anger <italic>d′</italic> emerged as a significant and positive predictor of physical aggression, β = .52, <italic>p</italic> = .002. No other signal detection index significantly predicted physical aggression in this analysis, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10. Further analyses also indicated that gender did not significantly moderate the central finding of interest, <italic>p</italic> = .65.</p>

<sec id="section16-0146167211430233">
<title>Follow-up analysis</title>
<p>Finally, we sought to determine if the above-documented effects were specific to mixtures of anger with certain others expressions or if they were broadly applicable to all mixtures containing anger. In these analyses, we had no a priori hypotheses, but we nonetheless deemed it important to determine any boundary conditions to these effects. Our initial GLM analysis was repeated, this time with secondary expression (fear vs. sadness vs. happiness vs. neutrality) entered as an additional factor in the design.</p>
<p>This analysis yielded a significant Physical Aggression × Anger Blend × Secondary Expression interaction, <italic>F</italic>(3, 153) = 5.55, <italic>p</italic> = .001. To decompose this interaction, we conducted separate GLM analyses for each secondary expression. The Physical Aggression × Anger Blend interaction was significant for two secondary expressions, namely, happiness, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 23.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and neutrality, <italic>F</italic>(1, 51) = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> = .03. In both cases, participants high in physical aggression differentiated between the 0% and 50% anger blends (anger/happy blends: <italic>F</italic> = 138.22; anger/neutral blends: <italic>F</italic> = 145.39, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .0001) more strongly than did participants low in physical aggression (anger/happy blends: <italic>F</italic> = 16.15; anger/neutral blends: <italic>F</italic> = 68.64, all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .0001). For the anger/fear and the anger/sadness blends, the Physical Aggression × Anger Blend interaction was not significant, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .15. Thus, physical aggression was most clearly related to detecting subtle changes in anger when mixed with happiness or emotional neutrality.</p>

<sec id="section17-0146167211430233">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 1 indicated that aggressive individuals are more perceptually sensitive to angry expressions, rather than more biased. Aggressive participants showed a stronger differentiation of 50% and 0% anger, and signal detection analyses confirmed that this was due to perceptual sensitivity rather than bias. Moreover, this results could not be explained in terms of more general-purpose perceptual abilities, as physical aggression was unrelated to the perception of other expressions.</p>
<p>Follow-up analysis also specified the boundary conditions for this effect. The effect emerged for mixtures of anger with happiness or neutrality but not with sadness or fear. It is possible that this is due to the context in which anger perception abilities are learned. Anger is one of the most frequently suppressed facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211430233">Gross, Richards, &amp; John, 2006</xref>). Expressive suppression is frequently accomplished by masking anger with a fake non-Duchenne smile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211430233">Ekman, Friesen, &amp; O’Sullivan, 1988</xref>) or by simply inhibiting the expression altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211430233">Gross &amp; Levenson, 1993</xref>). Aggressive individuals thus may have more practice detecting facial anger against a background of feigned happiness or neutrality. Although the current investigation was not designed to directly test this idea, it does provide a cogent explanation that can be tested in future research.</p>

<sec id="section18-0146167211430233">
<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Given the novel nature of the Study 1 findings, we sought to conceptually replicate them in Study 2. In this study, our first goal was to focus on anger/happiness blends specifically. These blends are particularly interesting from an interpersonal perspective, as they contrast expressions of hostile intent (anger) with expressions typically associated with affiliative intent (happiness). Our second goal in conducting this study was to focus on more fine-grained differences in perceptual sensitivity. As such, participants were presented with faces displaying different degrees of ambiguity, namely, 40%, 50%, or 60% anger. The remaining percentage of each facial expression displayed happiness. We considered this a more difficult perceptual task that would more rigorously test participants’ perceptual abilities. We predicted that participants high in physical aggression would be more perceptually sensitive to this difference and that this relation could not be explained in terms of bias.</p>

There was also a marginal main effect of physical aggression, <italic>F</italic>(1, 76) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .069, such that participants high in physical aggression perceived facial expressions to be angry on a higher proportion of trials (<italic>M</italic> = 41.5%) than did participants low in physical aggression (<italic>M</italic> = 36.3%).</p>

<title>Signal detection analyses</title>
<p>The above analysis suggests that physical aggression is related to sensitivity rather than bias, in that aggressive individuals were more sensitive to slight changes in the percentage of anger displayed. To more definitively establish that physical aggression is related to sensitivity rather than bias, we next calculated the sensitivity index, <italic>d′</italic>, and the bias index, Beta. Signal detection algorithms are frequently applied in studies using graded stimuli (e.g., sounds varying in volume level; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>). When this is done, <italic>d′</italic> represents perceptual sensitivity to <italic>changes</italic> in stimulus intensity (i.e., from low-intensity to high-intensity stimuli). To calculate <italic>d′</italic> in this manner, low-intensity stimuli are treated as signal-absent trials are in more standard signal detection analyses. We applied this approach to calculate total sensitivity and bias from the 40% anger blend to the 60% anger blends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 2 provided further evidence that aggressive individuals are more perceptually sensitive to facial anger rather than more biased. In this study, participants were presented with faces displaying subtly different mixtures of anger and happiness. Aggressive participants were more capable of detecting these subtle differences. Furthermore, there was no evidence that such individuals displayed a stimulus-independent bias toward perceiving expressions as angry.</p>
<p>Although Study 2 displayed several strengths, a critic could still argue that these effects are due to an increased ability to detect subtle facial cues of happiness, rather than anger. After all, facial happiness was inversely related to facial anger in this study’s stimuli. Although the results of Study 1 did not support this alternative interpretation, we nonetheless considered it prudent to conduct a third study to better support this claim.</p>

<p>Beyond this, Study 3 was designed to provide separate sensitivity and bias indices for the perception of facial happiness.

This interaction appeared to indicate that the block type main effect was more robust for the more intense blends (60% blends: <italic>M</italic> Diff = 23.5%; 50% blends: <italic>M</italic> Diff = 15.9%; 40% blends: <italic>M</italic> Diff = 5.1%).</p>
<p>More importantly, though, the predicted Blend × Block Type × Physical Aggression interaction was significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 162) = 4.13, <italic>p</italic> = .018, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .048. The estimated means for this effect are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0146167211430233">Figure 6</xref> (top panel: anger/neutral block; bottom panel: happy/neutral block). To decompose this interaction, we next analyzed each block in separate GLM analyses. Within the analysis of happy/neutral block, there were no significant effects involving physical aggression, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .17. Within the analysis of the angry/neutral block, however, there was a significant Blend × Physical Aggression interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 162) = 4.42, <italic>p</italic> = .013. Although participants low in physical aggression successfully differentiated between the blends of anger, <italic>F</italic>(2, 162) = 25.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, participants high in physical aggression differentiated between these blends more strongly, <italic>F</italic>(2, 162) = 61.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Thus, individuals high in physical aggression more strongly differentiated between different degrees of facial anger but not facial happiness.</p>

<title>Signal detection analysis</title>
<p>The above analysis suggests that individuals high in physical aggression are more perceptually sensitive to facial anger. Moreover, it suggests that these effects cannot be explained in terms of response bias or perceptual sensitivity to happy expressions. To more definitively support these conclusions, we next calculated the <italic>d′</italic> sensitivity and Beta bias indices for both angry and happy expressions separately considered. As in Study 2, these estimates reflected total perceptual sensitivity to changes in the intensity of an expression (i.e., from the 40% to the 60% emotion blends; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the zero-order level, physical aggression was positively correlated with anger <italic>d′, r</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .007, but not anger Beta, happy <italic>d’</italic>, or happy Beta, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .40. To test the unique relation between physical aggression and anger <italic>d’</italic>, we next conducted a multiple regression. All signal detection indices were simultaneously entered as predictors of physical aggression, and gender was entered as a control variable. Anger <italic>d′</italic> significantly predicted physical aggression, β = .28, <italic>p</italic> = .009, but no other signal detection index emerged as a significant predictor, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .12. Additional analyses also indicated that neither gender, <italic>p</italic> = .62, nor counterbalancing factors, <italic>p</italic> = .94, significantly moderated the central finding of interest.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 3 provided further evidence that aggressive individuals are more perceptually sensitive to facial anger. In this study, participants completed separate tasks requiring them to discriminate between different mixtures of facial anger and facial happiness. Aggressive individuals were more capable of discriminating different degrees of facial anger. Moreover, they did not demonstrate an overall bias toward the perception of facial anger or increased perceptual sensitivity to facial happiness. Thus, this study clearly links physical aggression with perceptual sensitivity to facial anger.</p>

<title>Related Aspects of Personality</title>
<p>Before proceeding to the General Discussion, it is important to consider whether the effects documented above are specific to physical aggression or generalize to related aspects of personality. The Aggression Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211430233">Buss &amp; Perry, 1992</xref>) used in the current investigation also contains subscales measuring individual differences in verbal aggression, hostile interpersonal attitudes, and angry emotions. Psychometric research has also confirmed that there are separable affective (i.e., anger), behavioral (i.e., aggression), and cognitive (i.e., hostility) components of trait aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211430233">Martin et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our literature review, it was apparent that individuals high in physical aggression have had greater exposure to hostile environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211430233">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, there was a strong empirical foundation for predicting that such individuals have developed superior expertise in the perception of angry expressions. The related personality constructs of verbal aggression, hostility, and trait anger, by contrast, have been less heavily researched in this regard, and thus the empirical basis for a parallel prediction with these traits was more questionable. Nonetheless, we measured these aspects of personality across all studies (all αs &gt; .77) to explore the potential generality of these effects.</p>
<p>Here, we report the results of analyses focusing on these related aspects of personality. In the interests of brevity, we concentrate on the most definitive analysis reported above for physical aggression, namely, the signal detection regression analyses. In these analyses, all signal detection indices available within a given study were simultaneously entered as predictors of the relevant personality construct in a multiple regression analyses. Gender was added as a covariate when available. These analyses were conducted separately for verbal aggression, hostility, and trait anger.</p>
<p>In Study 1, anger <italic>d′</italic> significantly predicted verbal aggression (β = .40, <italic>p</italic> = .03), hostility (β = .46, <italic>p</italic> = .01), and trait anger (β = .59, <italic>p</italic> = .01). Neither anger Beta nor any other signal detection index consistently and significantly predicted these personality constructs. In Study 2, however, anger <italic>d′</italic> was unrelated to verbal aggression (β = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .94), hostility (β = .12, <italic>p</italic> = .33), and trait anger (β = .05, <italic>p</italic> = .70). Anger Beta was similarly unrelated to these personality constructs. In Study 3, anger <italic>d′</italic> was positively related to verbal aggression (β = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .051), hostility (β = .22, <italic>p</italic> = .08), and trait anger (β = .29, <italic>p</italic> = .02), although several of these relations were only marginally significant in magnitude (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Neither anger Beta nor any other signal detection index significantly predicted these personality constructs, all <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .10.</p>
<p>Thus, perceptual sensitivity to facial anger was more consistently related to physical aggression relative to verbal aggression, hostility, and trait anger. There are multiple possible reasons for this finding. From an evocative standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>), physical aggressive behaviors would clearly evoke anger in others. Anger and hostility sometimes remain unexpressed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211430233">Gross &amp; Levenson, 1993</xref>), and thus an individual’s tendencies toward anger and hostility would not evoke anger in others if they are not manifested in outward aggression. Verbal aggression may also not consistently evoke anger in others, as arguments are often viewed as helpful, but spirited, exchanges of information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211430233">Averill, 1983</xref>). Thus, physical aggression’s consistent relation with facial expression perception may be due to the increased evocation of anger in others, and thus to increased practice perceiving this expression.</p>
<p>Beyond this, it is also true that physical aggression alone necessitates face-to-face communication. Verbal aggression can take an indirect form (i.e., relationally aggressive acts, such as behind the back rumor spreading; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211430233">Archer &amp; Coyne, 2005</xref>), and anger and hostility can often be the result of prolonged rumination rather than immediate face-to-face reactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167211430233">Wilkowski &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>). Thus, physical aggression may also be more directly related to facial expression perception simply because of its greater relevance to face-to-face interactions.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<sec id="section38-0146167211430233">
<title>Summary of Hypotheses and Results</title>
<p>Historically, physical aggression has been seen as the result of cognitive biases and social ineptitude (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211430233">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211430233">1999</xref>). More recently, though, other theorists have argued that at least some aggressive individuals have developed unique cognitive skills that support their aggressive tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211430233">Cillessen &amp; Mayeax, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211430233">Sutton et al., 1999a</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that through their increased exposure to aggressive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211430233">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>), physically aggressive individuals had developed a greater expertise in the perception of angry expressions. This implies a reinterpretation of previous findings suggesting that these individuals are biased to perceive nonangry facial expressions as angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211430233">Barth &amp; Bastiani, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211430233">Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211430233">Knyazaev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211430233">Larkin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211430233">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Three studies were conducted to test this hypothesis. These studies were based on classic signal detection studies of perceptual thresholds (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211430233">Hecht et al., 1941</xref>). In them, participants were presented with faces displaying subtly different levels of anger (Study 1: 0% &amp; 50%; Studies 2-3: 40%, 50%, &amp; 60%), as well as other facial expressions. Sensitivity was measured as increases in perceptions of anger that covaried with the actual increase in displayed anger, and bias was measured as a stimulus-independent tendency to label facial expressions as angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211430233">Macmillon &amp; Creelman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Across all studies, physically aggressive individuals were more sensitive to subtle differences in facial anger. This finding was demonstrated with two separate blends, namely, angry/happy blends (Studies 1 and 2) and angry/neutral blends (Studies 1 and 3). Moreover, this finding could not be explained in terms of bias or broader perceptual abilities, as physical aggression was consistently unrelated to signal detection indices of anger-related bias or perceptual sensitivity for other expressions.</p>
<p>Future research should continue to test these predictions in several fashions. The ecological validity of this phenomenon should also be tested using photographed facial expressions of real people. Beyond this, the applicability of this phenomenon to extreme levels of physical aggression (e.g., criminal offenders) should be tested. Presumably, this perceptual ability would be even more apparent among extremely aggressive individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section39-0146167211430233">
<title>Are Aggressive Individuals Biased to Perceive Anger?</title>
<p>It is intuitive to suggest that aggressive individuals are prone to misperceive anger in others’ expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211430233">Hall, 2006</xref>). A number of studies have claimed to support biases of this type (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211430233">Knyazaev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211430233">Larkin et al., 2002</xref>), but the procedures used were not ideal. In particular, such investigations have rarely compared people’s anger perceptions across different degrees of displayed anger. Without modeling such within-subject factors, we cannot be sure whether anger sensitivity, anger perception biases, or both are involved.</p>
<p>These methodological features are particularly problematic given that several theorists have argued that aggression may sometimes be associated with cognitive skills rather than cognitive incompetence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211430233">Cillessen &amp; Mayeax, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211430233">Sutton et al., 1999a</xref>). In the present studies, we included the percentage of displayed anger as a within-subject factor in the design. Higher levels of physical aggression interacted with such within-subject manipulations in all studies, suggesting greater sensitivity to anger rather than greater bias. At least among adults, then, our results suggest that it is a mistake to suggest that aggressive individuals are biased to perceive anger. Instead, they are highly sensitive to perceiving subtle facial cues of anger.</p>
<p>On the basis of our results, we suggest a reinterpretation of the hostile attribution bias. This bias is such that aggressive children and adults are more likely to perceive hostile intent when such intent is ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211430233">Dill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211430233">Dodge et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211430233">Epps &amp; Kendall, 1995</xref>). Under such conditions, it may be problematic to infer that hostile attributions represent a bias. Instead, it is entirely possible that aggressive individuals are more sensitive to hostile cues in such situations and make their judgments accordingly. In other words, what appears to be a bias may instead be represent greater sensitivity to the hostile cues which are truly present. Support for this reinterpretation of the hostile attribution bias seems consistent with data showing that aggressive individuals are generally not more likely to attribute hostile intent in unambiguous situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211430233">Dodge, 1980</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section40-0146167211430233">
<title>The Function of Perceptual Sensitivity</title>
<p>Learning studies have shown that practice perceiving a given stimulus increases a person’s perceptual sensitivity to that stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211430233">Goldstone, 1998</xref>). From one perspective, our findings can be viewed in terms of this general principle. Aggressive individuals emerge from hostile environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211430233">Patterson et al., 1989</xref>) and act in ways that make other people angry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211430233">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, they are likely to develop perceptual expertise in recognizing gradations in facial anger. Such ideas are consistent with findings that children exposed to abusive environments subsequently develop better anger perception skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211430233">Pollak, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At a more basic level, though, one must ask why experience promotes perceptual learning at all. Presumably, human beings evolved the ability to learn from experience because it is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211430233">Pigliucci, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167211430233">Pulliam &amp; Dunford, 1980</xref>). We learn to make finer perceptual distinctions because this prepares us to handle similar events in the future. From this perspective, then, learning to discriminate subtle facial cues of anger serves an adaptive function for aggressive individuals. This view stands in marked contrast to the classic social information processing perspective that aggression and the cognitive processing tendencies that support it are maladaptive in all respects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211430233">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211430233">1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although aggression is viewed as socially undesirable in modern society, it is nonetheless true that aggression is a viable strategy from an evolutionary perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>). There are certainly trade-offs here, as aggression is likely to harm one’s relationships. Nonetheless, aggression is a mechanism that can be used to gain social status and access to scarce resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167211430233">Maynard-Smith, 1974</xref>) and to deter victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211430233">Clutton-Brock &amp; Parker, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present studies, we showed that aggressive individuals display greater perceptual sensitivity to facial anger. We suggest that this perceptual skill should support an aggressive interpersonal strategy. If so, greater anger sensitivity may predict some of the purported benefits of aggression, such as achieving status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211430233">Hawley, 2007</xref>) and deterring victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211430233">Clutton-Brock &amp; Parker, 1995</xref>). By accurately perceiving hostile intent in one’s environment, aggressive individuals can better direct their aggressive actions in a fashion that achieves these evolutionarily adaptive ends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section41-0146167211430233">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Aggression has traditionally been seen as the result of cognitive biases and social ineptitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211430233">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211430233">1999</xref>). The current studies demonstrate that what may appear to be a bias is actually a finely tuned skill. Physically aggressive individuals were more perceptually sensitive to facial anger, rather than more biased. Such findings suggest that the cognitive characteristics of aggressive individuals may at least sometimes be indicative of a Machiavellian brand of social skill, rather than social incompetence.</p>
