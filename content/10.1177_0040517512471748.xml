<abstract>
<p>Hairiness affects the post-spinning processes and fabric appearance. In order to reduce the yarn hairiness, the present work attempted to design and develop an air nozzle that can be easily attached on to the sirospun spinning system. The system, based on a nozzle attachment to the sirospun spinning system, is named the siro-jet. In our previous studies, the nozzle was used in ring and compact spinning processes and the changes in yarn properties were analyzed. In this study, various nozzles having different injector angles, main hole diameters, injector diameters, number of injectors, nozzle shapes and injector positions were used and siro-jet yarns were produced at different air pressure levels. At the end of the experiments, it was determined that there is an optimum value for each nozzle parameter, and that the number of injectors and injector position play the most important roles in reducing yarn hairiness, whereas nozzle shape shows the weakest effect. On the other hand, the findings showed that it is possible to get lower hairiness values by different modifications on the same nozzle design. Considering the hairiness results, a constant was defined indicating the relationship between nozzle structural parameters and hairiness of the yarns to ease the nozzle design efforts. Depending on nozzle type, the siro-jet spinning system truly improves the yarn hairiness by 40–75%. In the literature, many researchers used an air nozzle in the spinning and also the winding processes. However, the combination of the air nozzle and sirospun spinning system in this manner is still not a common application.</p>

<p>Barella<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512471748">1</xref></sup> classified yam hairiness into three types: protruding fiber ends, fiber loops, and wild fibers. Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512471748">2</xref></sup> pointed out that yam hairiness may consist of 82–87% protruding fiber ends (including both leading and trailing ends), 9–12% fiber loops and 4–6% wild fibers. Therefore, hairiness may be defined as the fibers and loops protruding from the yarn body (the imaginary cylinder where most fibers are concreted). Hairiness is a key property affecting yarn and fabric appearances and also performances during the subsequent processes. Short fibers/hairs are desirable, which give soft hand and warmth to the product. However, a higher number of or longer hairs results in a mainly uneven appearance, greater pilling tendency, stoppages during weaving and knitting processes and a differential dyeing effect. Therefore, it is important to be able to control the yarn hairiness. There have been many developments regarding the measurement and understanding of yarn hairiness. Most of these instruments have not met with high commercial success and their usage has not been widespread. The commonly used instruments today work on two different principles and they characterize the hairiness as the number of fibers of each category length or the total length of hairs in 1 cm of the yarn.</p>
<p>There is ever increasing interest in the industry on the topic of yarn hairiness and its reduction. Yarn hairiness generally depends on factors such as fiber parameters, yarn structural properties and processing variables in yarn forming. Fiber parameters are fiber length, fineness, strength, extension to break, flexural rigidity, torsional rigidity and fiber cross-sectional shape. Other fiber characteristics are surface morphology and fracture toughness. Yarn structural parameters are mainly yarn linear density and yarn twist and also yarn evenness and yarn porosity. Lastly, processing variables basically includes the processes, starting from fiber preparation to yarn production, and spinning parameters. Preparation processes are blowroom, carding, combing, drawing and roving. Spinning parameters play an important role as fiber properties in yarn hairiness: they are draft ratio, drafting system, spindle speed, spindle eccentricity, balloon separator, balloon control ring, ring diameter, coating of ring and traveler, traveler type, weight and shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512471748">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some researchers have been making some efforts to control the yarn hairiness by placing an air nozzle on the various spinning systems and also winding machines. An air nozzle used at the ring frame was named the Jetring or NozzleRing, while a nozzle attached to the compact spinning machine was named the Compact-jet. In the Jetring and Compact-jet spinning systems, the aim is to bind the projected fibers onto the yarn body using the swirling airflow in the nozzle and to reduce the yarn hairiness. Many researchers determined that the Jetring and Compact-jet spinning systems are capable of producing yarns with improved yarn hairiness compared to that of the conventional ring spun yarns:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512471748">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512471748">10</xref></sup> hairiness decreased by up to 40–50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512471748">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512471748">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512471748">13</xref></sup> Similar to the spinning process, it was shown that nozzle usage improves the yarn properties; in particular, yarn hairiness decreases significantly after winding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512471748">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512471748">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, considering the effect of an air nozzle on yarn properties, we located an air nozzle on the sirospun spinning machine and the system was named the siro-jet. The siro-jet combines the air nozzle and sirospun spinning system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512471748">Figure 1</xref>). Actually, the sirospun spinning system was developed for the worsted yarn industry between 1975 and 1976 by CSIRO. In 1980, the sirospun process was advertised to the market as a new production method. In this system, the spinning and doubling processes are combined in one operation. Two rovings are led in parallel through the drafting system, separated by two specially developed condensers, and then drafted separately. Twist is introduced by means of a ring and traveler as for a normal single yarn. Regarding the benefits of the sirospun spinning process, excellent yarn strength, smooth yarn surface and less hairiness have been stated by the researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512471748">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512471748">23</xref></sup> In the other studies related to this spinning system, firstly the effect of strand spacing and typical process parameters, such as spindle speed and traveler weight, on the yarn properties were investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512471748">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512471748">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512471748">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512471748">28</xref></sup> In addition to these studies, Sun and Cheng,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512471748">20</xref></sup> and also Ito and Nitta,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0040517512471748">29</xref></sup> studied the quality of the fabric obtained from sirospun yarns. In addition to experimental studies, theoretical analysis was realized to explain the yarn formation mechanism in the sirospun spinning system and to determine force balance and dynamic characters of the system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0040517512471748">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0040517512471748">33</xref></sup> As a conclusion, in literature, it is not a common application of air nozzle attachment on to the sirospun spinning system. Therefore, the siro-jet spinning system can be considered to be a new application in the spinning field. In the present work, the nozzles were placed between the exit of the drafting system and the yarn guide of the sirospun spinning system. The air nozzle can be thought of as the main component of this application. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of the nozzle structural parameters on yarn hairiness and to optimize the nozzle design.

<p>In sirospun yarn production, two rovings are fed into the drafting roller. Therefore, at the beginning of the experiments, a condenser (1) was placed between the back and middle rollers, while we put another condenser (2) between the middle and front rollers to separate the rovings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512471748">Figure 2</xref>). Following drafting, twist was inserted to the separated strands using the same ring-traveler and then twisted strands were plied to each other.

<sec id="sec4-0040517512471748"><title>Siro-jet spinning system</title>
<p>An air nozzle was placed between the exit of the drafting system and the yarn guide of the sirospun spinning system. In order to combine the sirospun system and an air nozzle, a supporting device was mounted below the drafting system of the spinning frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512471748">Figure 3</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The supporting device provides the desired distance arrangement between the air nozzle and drafting system. In the present study, the nozzle was positioned about 6 cm below the front roller of the drafting unit. As the distance gets shorter, it was determined that yarn breakage becomes more. In accordance with a previous work, 6 cm was found to be an optimum distance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0040517512471748">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In siro-jet yarn production, as reported for Jetring yarns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0040517512471748">35</xref></sup> the starter yarn was fed to the lower end of the air-jet nozzle, and the air flow sucks the yarn through the nozzle for piecing. Thus, piecing was not difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040517512471748"><title>Air nozzle</title>
<p>The nozzle, used in siro-jet yarn production, consists of a nozzle head and nozzle body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512471748">Figure 4</xref>). The nozzle body has a cylindrical cross-section consisting of the main hole (1), injectors (2), twisting chamber (3) and nozzle outlet (4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512471748">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The main hole lies starting from the nozzle inlet to the nozzle outlet and the nozzle has a constant diameter. Injectors are positioned at a certain angle with respect to the nozzle axis and so they lie tangentially to the twisting chamber. The nozzle inlet can be considered to be an opening in which airflow can occur as an inflow or outflow depending on the injector angle and the air pressure level.
<fig id="fig4-0040517512471748" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Nozzle head (a), nozzle body (b) and the nozzle (c) (1: main hole; 2: injectors; 3: twisting chamber; 4: nozzle outlet).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512471748-fig4.tif"/>

<p>The nozzle head transfers the pressurized air coming from the compressor into the nozzle body by means of the injectors. The pressurized air goes out of the nozzle inlet and outlet.</p>
<p>The angle profile of the injectors (θ) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512471748">Figure 5</xref>.

Therefore, we believe that the results of this study will help to fulfill the shortcomings in the literature.</p>
<p>During the experimental analysis, air pressure was measured in terms of the Alicat Scientific electronic pressure gauge controller for each nozzle type. In the measurements, the device was placed between the compressor and the nozzle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512471748">Figure 6</xref>). In the study, air pressures of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 bar were used. In particular, more yarn breaks beyond 0.5 bar were observed. Hence, the experiments focused on 0.25 and 0.5 bar pressure levels. In addition, it is also important to mention that these air pressure levels are “gauge pressure” measured by the pressure gauge controller.

<p>To minimize any possible variation, we used the same spindles for each yarn type. Yarn tests were carried out on Officine Brustio ETT twist tester, Zweigle G566 hairiness tester, Uster Tester 3 and also Uster Tensorapid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517512471748">Table 4</xref>). Three samples were tested for each parameter and air pressure value. In the study, different air pressure levels were used to analyze the effect of air pressure and also to eliminate any possible variation. Also, three samples were produced for the comparison of sirospun and siro-jet yarns. The tests were carried out under standard atmospheric conditions. All tests were done on the same tester and the test results were analyzed statistically to determine any significant differences.<sup>34</sup>

<sec id="sec8-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the injector angle</title>
<p>In the first set of the experiments, the effect of the injector angle on yarn hairiness was analyzed. Injector angles were selected as 15° and 45°, while the other structural parameters of the nozzle were kept the same. Siro-jet yarns were produced at the pressure levels of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 bar. Zweigle hairiness (s3) results of the siro-jet yarns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512471748">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0040517512471748" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The effect of injector angle on the hairiness of siro-jet yarns.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512471748-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512471748">Figure 7</xref>, siro-jet yarns become more hairy as the injector angle increases. The injector angle of 15°, in particular, gives the least hairiness values. This result agrees with previous findings concerning Jetring and Compact-jet spinning systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512471748">10</xref></sup> The difference in hairiness values of the yarns increases with the higher air pressure and becomes statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0040517512471748">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, 15° and 45° injector angles produce considerably different s3 values at 0.5 and 0.75 bar air pressure levels. In particular, for 15°, s3 values are similar at all air pressures. Statistical analysis results also show that there are no statistically significant differences in the s3 values of the yarns produced with different air pressure levels at 15° (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0040517512471748">Table 5</xref>). Therefore, air pressure does not have a statistically significant effect on yarn hairiness for 15°. However, the injector angle of 45°, in particular, gives statistically significant s3 values as the air pressure increases and, hence, air pressure is an important parameter for 45°.

<p>In literature, the effect of injector angle was analyzed. However, the studies focused on the 40°–50° injector angle range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512471748">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512471748">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512471748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0040517512471748">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0040517512471748">40</xref></sup> Therefore, 15° is different from this range. We believe that the better hairiness values for 15° may result from the effect of injector angle on swirling airflow characteristics. On the other hand, yarn hairiness increases beyond 0.5 bar. In particular this case is more apparent for 45°. According to the findings in the literature regarding the influence of air pressure on yarn properties, it was stated that the tangential and axial components of air velocity, and so the resultant velocity, increase with the air pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512471748">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512471748">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512471748">38</xref></sup> Higher swirling airflow intensity gives rise to bend, wraps the projected fibers around the yarn body and decreases the yarn hairiness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512471748">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0040517512471748">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0040517512471748">38</xref></sup> However, when the pressure exceeds certain values, it was determined that fluid flow becomes unstable, hairiness decreases in smaller amounts and spinning deteriorates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0040517512471748">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0040517512471748">39</xref></sup> Therefore, lower pressure levels, such as 0.5 bar, should be used from the point of view of yarn properties and also production costs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the main hole diameter</title>
<p>In the second stage, the effect of the main hole diameter on yarn hairiness was analyzed. Siro-jet yarns were produced with the nozzles having 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 mm main hole diameters. In these experiments, other structural parameters of the nozzle were kept the same. The injector angle was fixed at 15° and the injector diameter was taken as 0.8 mm. Siro-jet yarns were produced at the pressure levels of 0.25 and 0.5 bar. Zweigle hairiness (s3) results of the siro-jet yarns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512471748">Figure 8</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>It can be clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512471748">Figure 8</xref> that the s3 hairiness values increase with the larger main hole diameter. However, at the diameter of 2.5 mm, we could not succeed in spinning the siro-jet yarns. Siro-jet yarns spun with the nozzle of 3.0 mm diameter have lower hairiness than the yarns obtained with the diameter of 3.5 mm at both air pressure levels.</p>
<p>In the literature, the effect of main hole diameter was analyzed intensely for Jetring yarns. However, the nozzle designs differ from each other. Nevertheless, the studies coincide with each other and all reported that larger main hole diameter would reduce twisting efficiency and require greater air consumption. Therefore, a smaller diameter should be adopted under sufficient spinning conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512471748">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0040517512471748">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0040517512471748">41</xref></sup> From this point, our findings are similar to previous studies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the effect of main hole diameter on yarn hairiness was found to be statistically insignificant. In addition, all air pressure levels give close hairiness values for both main hole diameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0040517512471748">Table 6</xref>).

<sec id="sec10-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the injector diameter</title>
<p>To determine the effect of the injector diameter on yarn hairiness, siro-jet yarns were produced with the nozzles having different injector diameters (0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mm) at different air pressures when the other structural parameters of the nozzle were kept constant. The injector angle was 15° and the main hole diameter was 3.0 mm. The air pressures were 0.25 and 0.5 bar. The Zweigle hairiness (s3) results of the siro-jet yarns are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512471748">Figure 9</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512471748">Figure 9</xref>, s3 hairiness of siro-jet yarns decreases when the injector diameter increases. However, with further increase in injector diameter, hairiness values start to rise. This increase becomes clear at 0.8 mm diameter. In particular, 0.5 mm produces statistically significant higher s3 hairiness values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0040517512471748">Table 7</xref>). In particular, the injector diameter between 0.6 and 0.7 mm gives considerably lower hairiness values and this range may be critical injector diameter. On the other hand, there is a similar trend regarding the effect of injector diameter at both air pressure levels and the statistical analysis displays this case. For all injector diameters, the effect of air pressure on hairiness was found to be statistically insignificant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0040517512471748">Table 7</xref>).

<p>There are limited studies regarding the effect of injector diameter on Jetring and air-jet yarns properties. Jeon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512471748">12</xref></sup> stated that air suction, resulting from a larger injector diameter, weakens yarns, and that smaller diameters may block the airflows and reduce the effectiveness of the air suction.</p>
<p>Our results coincide with the statement in the literature. At the smaller diameter, the air pressure in the nozzle increases and airflow form becomes irregular due to blocking of the air. On the other hand, at larger diameters, swirling intensity weakens and hence the positive effect of swirling airflow on yarn hairiness decreases. In particular, beyond the critical diameter value, there cannot be any improvement in hairiness values.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the number of injectors</title>
<p>In another stage of the study, we analyzed the effect of the injector number on yarn hairiness. In this part, siro-jet yarns were produced with the nozzle having two, three and four injectors. As in other experiments, the structural parameters of the nozzle were kept the same when the injector number was changed. Zweigle hairiness (s3) results of the siro-jet yarns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512471748">Figure 10</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512471748">Figure 10</xref> shows that s3 yarn hairiness values improve as the number of injectors decreases.

In particular, s3 values decrease significantly when the nozzle has three injectors. However, the reduction in s3 hairiness values becomes less when the number of injectors is two. In the meantime, we believe that the minimum number of injectors should be two to keep the airflow symmetry. Contrary to air pressure, the effect of injector numbers on yarn hairiness was found to be statistically significant and, in particular, the nozzle with four injectors produces considerably higher s3 values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0040517512471748">Table 8</xref>).

<p>Guo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0040517512471748">40</xref></sup> stated that air will come out from the nozzle inlet for larger injector numbers and it is not helpful to draw fibers into the nozzle. Better hairiness results of lower injector numbers coincide with this statement. In smaller injector numbers, the airflow may be forced to swirl through the nozzle and hence more swirling airflow may move with the yarn. This case leads to an improvement in reducing yarn hairiness.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the nozzle shape</title>
<p>As mentioned above, the nozzle used in siro-jet yarn production consists of a nozzle head and a nozzle body. The nozzle body has a cylindrical cross-section consisting of a main hole, injectors, a twisting chamber and a nozzle outlet. The main hole lies starting from the nozzle inlet to the nozzle outlet and the nozzle has a constant diameter. In this part of the study, a conical shape was given to the nozzle. The conicity rate is 1/50. This means that the nozzle enlarges starting from nozzle inlet to the outlet and that the diameter of the main hole increases with the rate of 1/50 through the nozzle length. Two types of nozzle were used to get more results and they had 2.5 and 3.0 mm main hole diameters, while other structural parameters were the same. Siro-jet yarns were produced with the normal and conical nozzles, and Zweigle s3 hairiness results of the yarns were compared to understand the effect of the nozzle shape on yarn hairiness.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512471748">Figure 11</xref>, the code of N represents the normal nozzle with a 3.0 mm main hole diameter, while conical nozzles are shown with C1 and C2 codes. In particular, normal and C2 conical nozzles have similar nozzle structural parameters; the only different parameter is the nozzle shape. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517512471748">Figure 11</xref>, conical nozzles (C1 and C2) give higher s3 hairiness values than a normal nozzle (N) with a constant main hole diameter at both air pressure levels. In particular, in conical nozzles, s3 hairiness values increase with the larger main hole diameter. However, there are no statistically significant differences in s3 values of the nozzles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0040517512471748">Table 9</xref>).

<p>Conical nozzles do not have an improvement effect on yarn hairiness and lead to similar results with the nozzle having larger main hole diameters. For conical nozzles, Bernoulli's law, isentropic state for gas fluids, can be considered and the airflow form of the nozzle can be explained according to this law. As the flow area of the nozzle increases, the Mach number decreases (Ma &lt; 1). The pressure of the airflow increases while the velocity of the air decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0040517512471748">42</xref></sup> We believe that there is similar state in conical nozzles used in this study. Conical nozzles may lead to lower air velocity and higher air pressure in comparison to that of the normal nozzle. Hence, airflow form may be changed and hairiness of the yarns may be affected from this airflow form. In particular, we believe that airflow may move with larger steps in the nozzle and tend to leave from the nozzle. The effectiveness of the swirling airflow decreases through the nozzle. This results in more hairy yarn production in comparison to the normal nozzle. Guo et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0040517512471748">43</xref></sup> in their study, increased the nozzle outlet diameter and they obtained a similar nozzle design. In their simulations, it was determined that maximum velocities near the wall and the extent of the central recirculation flow decrease. Therefore, they proposed a smaller nozzle outlet diameter. However, we believe that airflow form and properties change through the nozzle. Airflow may have supersonic form at the nozzle injectors and the Mach number may be higher than 1 at this section of the nozzle. Contrary to the interior part of the nozzle, at the injectors, an opposite affect occurs. Air pressure decreases while the velocity of the airflow increases. Therefore, air velocity values at the injectors are higher than that of the other parts of the nozzle, while air pressure values are lower.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0040517512471748"><title>Effect of the injector position</title>
<p>In this part of the study, nozzle injectors, placed close to the nozzle inlet, were taken to the nozzle center and hence the effect of injector position on yarn hairiness was studied. Two types of nozzle were used to achieve the real findings with more test results. Their injector angle was 15°, the main hole diameter was 3.0 mm and the number of injectors was four. Injector diameters were 0.5 and 0.8 mm. Injectors were located at the middle of the nozzle. Zweigle s3 hairiness results of the siro-jet yarns are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512471748">Figure 12</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512471748">Figure 12</xref>, the code of N1 represents the normal nozzle with a 0.5 mm injector diameter and N2 represents the nozzle with 0.8 mm injector diameter. Injectors were placed on the center of the nozzle and this was named the center-positioned nozzle (CR1 and CR2). CR1 was used for the nozzle with 0.5 mm injector diameter and CR2 was used for the nozzle with 0.8 mm injector diameter. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517512471748">Figure 12</xref>, s3 hairiness values of the siro-jet yarns decrease as the position of the injectors is taken to the center of the nozzle. On the other hand, for similar injector diameters, the center-positioned nozzles (CR1 and CR2) give lower s3 values than the normal nozzles (N1 and N2). In particular, there is a considerable difference in the hairiness of siro-jet yarns produced with the normal (N1) and center-positioned (CR1) nozzles with similar injector diameters. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0040517512471748">Table 10</xref>, in particular, there are statistically significant differences between s3 values of normal (N1) and other nozzles at both air pressures and, hence, we can conclude that the effect of injector position is statistically significant. The nozzle of CR2 gives the lowest s3 values, while the N1 normal nozzle produces the most hairy yarns. Similar results were obtained at both air pressure levels. When any nozzle type was considered, it was determined that the air pressure level has no statistically significant effect on s3 hairiness values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0040517512471748">Table 10</xref>).

<p>In the literature, Guo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0040517512471748">40</xref></sup> studied the injector position numerically. They reported that a reverse airflow moves upstream of the injectors when the injector is positioned close to the nozzle inlet. Hence it will be difficult to suck the fibers into the nozzle. As the injector position shifts toward the nozzle center, vortex breakdown locates downstream of the nozzle. Hence, swirling airflow intensity increases from the nozzle injectors to the nozzle outlet and this makes a positive contribution to the yarn hairiness, leading to lower hairiness.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0040517512471748">Table 11</xref>, the number of injectors and then the injector position have the strongest effect on hairiness of siro-jet yarns at both air pressure values due to their greatest difference values. In fact, the difference values of injector diameter and position are similar. However, for injector diameter, the difference value decreases when the air pressure increases. The main hole diameter exhibits the weakest effect resulting from its lowest difference value. Contrary to other parameters, nozzle shape has no improving effect on yarn hairiness. On the other hand, when the air pressure increases, the intensity of the effect of the concerned parameter slightly changes, except for the injector angle. As a result, the number of injectors, injector position and injector diameter are the strongest, while the main hole diameter is the weakest parameter concerning less hairy yarn production.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that it is possible to get lower hairiness values by different modifications on the same nozzle design. There is not only one nozzle design for less hairy yarn productions.

<p>In this part of the study, it was aimed to ease the nozzle fabrication and to minimize the number of experiments during the less hairy yarn production. For this aim, we attempted to define a constant in accordance with some of the nozzle structural parameters and hairiness values of siro-jet yarns. The constant was symbolized with “<italic>K</italic>” and it is the ratio of the area of nozzle injectors to the area of the main hole of the nozzle.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0040517512471748">Figure 13</xref>, <italic>K</italic> is actually the geometric value regarding the nozzle structural parameters. Therefore, this value represents the relationship between some of the nozzle design parameters and hairiness of the siro-jet yarns. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0040517512471748">Figure 13</xref>, the curve has not only one character and there are a few critical <italic>K</italic> points giving lower s3 hairiness values. When the curve is analyzed in detail, it is observed that s3 values of siro-jet yarns decrease up to 0.25 and then start to increase significantly. The yarns are getting less hairy between 0.4 and 0.6. Beyond the value of 0.6, s3 values display an increasing trend again. There are similar findings for both air pressure levels. <italic>K</italic>, up to 0.25, gives the least hairy yarns while the value of 0.4 produces the most hairy yarns. For the least hairy yarn production, <italic>K</italic> can be proposed in the range between 0.1–0.25, 0.4–0.6 and 0.8–0.9. Beyond these ranges, the character of the airflow may become irregular. In particular, at the higher <italic>K</italic> values, swirling of the airflow decreases and a reverse airflow occurs. On the other hand, at the lower <italic>K</italic> values, the efficiency of the airflow may be insufficient. All these cases give rise to higher s3 yarn hairiness values. On the other hand, there are many <italic>K</italic> values for less hairy yarn production and this result also indicates that it is possible to achieve lower hairiness values with different modifications on the same nozzle type.

<p>To display the influence of the nozzle on yarn hairiness and also other yarn properties, the results of the yarns produced on the siro-jet and sirospun spinning systems were compared. In the comparison, the results obtained from two types of nozzle having the strongest effect on yarn hairiness were taken into account. Siro-jet (1) yarns were produced with the nozzle having three injectors close to the nozzle inlet and siro-jet (2) yarns were obtained using the nozzle with the four injectors at the middle of the nozzle. Both nozzle types were different from each other regarding the number of injectors and injector position. They had similar injector angle (15°), main hole (3.0 mm) and injector diameters (0.5 mm).

There is a statistically significant difference between sirospun and siro-jet (1) yarns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>), and the difference in their hairiness values is about 75%. Although the difference in hairiness of siro-jet (2) and sirospun yarns reaches up to 40%, both yarns have similar s3 hairiness values according to statistical analysis results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>). On the other hand, statistical analysis results showed that there is no statistically significant difference in s3 values of siro-jet (1) and siro-jet (2). Hence, concerning s3 hairiness results, siro-jet (1) and siro-jet (2) yarns are not statistically different from each other in spite of their different nozzle structural parameters. As a result, the siro-jet spinning system improves the hairiness at least 40% in comparison to the sirospun spinning system.

<p>In addition to s3 results of the yarns, we also analyzed the number of hairs in 1 mm (s1) and 2 mm (s2) hair-length groups expressing the short hairiness. To interpret the short hairiness, s1 and s2 values were summed indicating the number of hairs in 1 and 2 mm hair-length groups.</p>
<p>According to these overall values, both siro-jet yarns have fewer short hairs than that of the sirospun yarns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0040517512471748">Figure 15</xref>). In particular, the difference in s3 values of siro-jet (1) and sirospun yarns is statistically significant. However, there are no statistically significant differences in the values of sirospun and siro-jet (2), and also between both siro-jet yarns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>). Nevertheless, siro-jet yarns have fewer long and short hairs than that of the sirospun system. This result coincides with the Compact-jet yarns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512471748">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A swirling airflow has been produced in the nozzle depending on the nozzle geometry and pressurized air.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512471748">11</xref></sup> The false twist effect is obtained with the swirling airflow. Yarn hairiness results indicate that this swirling airflow in the nozzle wraps the long hairs onto the yarn body, so covering some of the short hairs. Short hairs are not wrapped on to the yarn body by the swirling airflow due to its high bending rigidity. They have not sufficient length that covers the yarn body and hence the hairs lie down on the yarn body in a short time during the flow process. However, long hairs get entangled around short hairs and hence shorter ones are surrounded by the longer ones. This case leads to different hair-length scale distribution and there is a reduction in the number of hairs for all length groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512471748">9</xref></sup> However, it will be useful to mention that the modified spinning systems having nozzle components (Jetring, Compact-jet and siro-jet) are not always capable of reducing the number of short hairs in the yarns. In particular, in Jetring yarns, it was determined that the number of short hairs increases with nozzle usage. The changes in number of short hairs depend on raw material, yarn count, nozzle design, air pressure level and spinning system. In some cases, long hairs cannot be wrapped with the whole length and also completely locked into the yarn structure. This wrapping case causes the long hairs coming to the short hair state. Therefore, the number of short hairs increases after nozzle usage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512471748">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, to understand the mechanism of swirling airflow in the nozzle, we measured the twist values of the yarns according twist contraction method on an Officine Brustio ETT twist tester. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0040517512471748">Figure 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>, there is no significant difference in twist values of the yarns. A similar twist amount of the yarns indicates that siro-jet yarns are first loosened to some extent due to swirling airflow and then tightened up again through the nozzle, as mentioned for Jetring and Compact-jet yarns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512471748">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512471748">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0040517512471748">35</xref></sup> This untwisting and twisting case contributes to wrapping of the protruding hairs on to the yarn body, while swirling airflow does not cause considerable loss or additional twist in the yarn. In sirospun yarn production, two rovings are fed into the drafting system and each fiber strand is twisted by the ring-traveler system of the sirospun machine. Then the yarn passes inside the air nozzle. Therefore, we believe that the nozzle and hence the airflow could not affect the twist of each brand. However, the nozzle in the siro-jet spinning system acts as a false twister and the yarn is, to some extent, first untwisted and then twisted.

</fig></p>
<p>Wrapping fibers in siro-jet yarns may lead to higher bending rigidity and hence an increase in yarn stiffness. Air-jet and vortex-spun yarns are well known for being stiffer than equivalent ring spun yarns, which ascribed to their structure with wrapping fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0040517512471748">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0040517512471748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0040517512471748"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0040517512471748">47</xref></sup> The rigidity of air-jet yarns was explained by the clustering effect resulted from parallel-laid core fibers bound by wrappers. The straight and parallel arrangement of core fibers wrapped by helically arranged binding fibers offers very little freedom of movement to the fibers within the core when the yarn is bent, which enhances stiffness. Studies have been done to reduce the yarn rigidity by the use of a lower sliver feed ratio with the reduction in main draft and by lowering down the injector jet pressure. It stands to be logical that the use of heat also plays an important role in controlling rigidity. It was determined that the rigidity of air-jet yarn decreases after dry and wet types of thermal treatment due to opening up of the structure, which favors easy inter-fiber movement during bending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0040517512471748">45</xref></sup> Concerning siro-jet yarns, we do not expect bending rigidity and yarn stiffness as much as that of the air-jet and vortex spun yarns due to lower number of wrapper fibers in the siro-jet yarn structure. Nevertheless, if required, yarn stiffness may be reduced with a lower main draft and usage of heat after spinning as reported in the literature.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0040517512471748"><title>Yarn tenacity</title>
<p>In the present study, the yarns spun with the nozzle were compared with the yarns produced without any nozzle to determine the effect of the air nozzle on yarn tenacity. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0040517512471748">Figure 17</xref>, both siro-jet yarns have lower yarn tenacity values than that of the sirospun yarns. However, according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>, there are no statistically significant differences in the tenacity values of the yarns and, hence, all yarns have similar yarn tenacity values.

</fig></p>
<p>In the literature, regarding yarns produced with the nozzle attachment on spinning machines, some of the researchers indicated that the tensile properties of Jetring spun yarns are higher than conventional ring spun yarns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512471748">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512471748">12</xref></sup> while some of them reported that conventional ring and Jetring spun yarns have a similar tenacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512471748">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512471748">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512471748">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512471748">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512471748">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the findings do not agree with each other regarding the tenacity property. On the other hand, protruding hairs are wrapped on to the yarn body by the swirling airflow of Jetring and also siro-jet systems. Therefore, the number of fibers in the yarn structure increases and, hence, we expect an increase in tenacity values of the produced yarns. Contrary to our expectations, siro-jet yarns do not have higher tenacity values than that of the sirospun yarns. From our findings about siro-jet and also Jetring spinning systems, we concluded that air nozzle usage cannot always lead to higher yarn tenacity values in the spinning process. This may result from the changes in the sirospun yarn structure due to the untwisting and twisting effects of the swirling airflow in the nozzle. In addition, wrapping of the fibers may not be as effective as integrating the fibers into the yarn structure to produce stronger yarns than the ring spun yarns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0040517512471748"><title>Yarn elongation</title>
<p>In addition to yarn tenacity, yarn elongation results of the sirospun and siro-jet yarns were compared. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0040517512471748">Figure 18</xref>, both siro-jet yarns have lower elongation values than that of the sirospun yarns. Siro-jet (1) yarns have the lowest elongation values, while sirospun yarns have the highest elongation values. In particular, the difference in elongation values of siro-jet (1) and sirospun yarns is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0040517512471748">Table 12</xref>).
<fig id="fig18-0040517512471748" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Yarn elongation results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512471748-fig18.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Swirling airflow, produced in the nozzle with the compressed air, causes the loosening and tightening of the yarn. We believe that the mentioned untwisting and twisting effect of the airflow in the nozzle changes the yarn structure. Another possible reason may be the wrapping fibers of the siro-jet yarns. Başal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0040517512471748">48</xref></sup> compared the properties of air-jet and vortex yarns and it was determined that vortex spun yarns have lower elongation values. The explanation of this result is the decrease in fiber slippage due to better grip by wrapper fibers. Therefore, we believe that wrapper fibers of siro-jet yarns make the siro-jet yarn structure compact and, hence, elongation values of siro-jet yarns decrease.</p>

As can be seen, both siro-jet yarns are more uneven than sirospun yarns. The higher yarn irregularity values of the siro-jet yarns are in agreement with the preceding findings of Jetring and Compact-jet yarns.

<p>Hairiness is a prominent yarn property for spun yarns. In this study, we attempted to design and develop an air nozzle that can be easily attached on to a sirospun spinning system in order to reduce yarn hairiness. The spinning system, which was based on a nozzle attachment to the sirospun spinning system, was named the siro-jet. In fact, this work is a follow-up of nozzle usage on conventional ring and compact spinning systems. In both applications, yarns with considerably lower hairiness were produced. From this point of view, the nozzle was tried on a sirospun spinning system that was developed for two-fold yarn production. In siro-jet spinning, we primarily aimed to achieve lower yarn hairiness values in comparison to sirospun yarns. To realize this aim, we attempted to optimize the nozzle design with regard to yarn hairiness. Basically, we focused on the influence of the many nozzle structural parameters.</p>
<p>Concerning the effect of the injector angle, it was determined that 15° produces less hairy siro-jet yarns in comparison to 45°. As the main hole diameter increases, yarn hairiness increases and, hence, the main hole diameter can be proposed between 3.0 and 3.5 mm. It is not sensible to increase the main hole diameter over 3.5 mm. Concerning the injector diameter, an optimum diameter range is changing between 0.6 and 0.8 mm. As the number of nozzle injectors decreases, the hairiness of siro-jet yarns improves. In particular, the nozzle with three and two injectors leads to a significant reduction in hairiness. On the other hand, the nozzle with a larger main hole diameter from the nozzle inlet to outlet does not provide any improvement in yarn hairiness compared with the normal nozzle with a constant main hole diameter through the nozzle. As the injector position is closer to the nozzle center, better hairiness results were obtained.</p>
<p>The changes in hairiness values indicate that the number of the injector and then injector position and injector diameter represent the most important attributes in reducing yarn hairiness, whereas nozzle shape and then main hole diameter show a weaker effect. Even nozzle shape leads to deterioration in hairiness.</p>
<p>A constant (<italic>K</italic>) was defined representing the relationship between some of the nozzle structural parameters and hairiness results to help the nozzle fabrication, to shorten the nozzle design stage and also to reduce the number of production experiments. As a result, a few critical <italic>K</italic> values were determined for the least yarn production and they are changing between 0.1–0.25, 0.4–0.6 and 0.8–0.9. However, it may be also useful to mention that more experiments are necessary to achieve a certain constant. This work can be considered a starting point for this kind of the effort.</p>
<p>In addition to the analysis of nozzle structural parameters, test results of the siro-jet yarns were compared with that of the sirospun yarns to interpret the effects of the nozzle on yarn properties. It was determined that siro-jet yarns are significantly less hairy than sirospun yarns. s3 values of siro-jet yarns are about 2–4 times lower than that of the sirospun yarns, depending on the nozzle type. The siro-jet spinning system improves the hairiness by up to 40% in comparison to the sirospun system as found in Jetring and Compact-jet spinning systems. Contrary to the improvement in yarn hairiness, siro-jet yarns have statistically similar yarn tenacity and lower elongation values.</p>
<p>In short, the siro-jet spinning system is considerably effective on yarn hairiness and reduces predominantly the number of longer hairs. Depending on nozzle type, the system has no significant negative effect on the other yarn properties. The system is flexible regarding nozzle type and succeeds in producing less hairy yarns at even lower air pressure levels. There is not just one nozzle design for the less hairy yarn productions. The system allows working with various nozzle types depending on the desired improvement effect on yarn hairiness values. In the literature, many researchers studied air nozzle usage in the spinning and also the winding processes. However, the combination of the air nozzle and sirospun spinning system in this manner is not a common application. Therefore, the siro-jet spinning system is a new application in the spinning field. On the other hand, the wrapping motion of the swirling air flow in the nozzle is still insufficient to produce considerably stronger yarns compared to sirospun yarns. Therefore, detailed works related to the geometric structure of the nozzle are required to make the system effective regarding tensile properties in addition to yarn hairiness. On the other hand, siro-jet yarns were produced at very low spindle speed. Therefore, in other works, siro-jet yarns should be produced at higher spindle speeds and the effect of spindle speed on siro-jet system performance should be analyzed.</p>
