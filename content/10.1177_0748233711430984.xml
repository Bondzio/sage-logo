<p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of curcumin on acute lung injury induced by intestinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R). A total of 30 male Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups: sham, I/R, and I/R + curcumin; each group contains 10 animals. Sham group animals underwent laparotomy without I/R injury. After I/R groups animals underwent laparotomy, 1 h of superior mesenteric artery ligation were followed by 1 h of reperfusion. In the curcumin group, 3 days before I/R, curcumin (100 mg/kg) was administered by gastric gavage. All animals were killed at the end of reperfusion and lung tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histopathological investigation in all groups. To date, no more biochemical and histopathological changes on intestinal I/R injury in rats by curcumin treatment have been reported. Curcumin treatment significantly decreased the elevated tissue malondialdehyde levels and increased reduced superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activities in lung tissue samples. Intestinal I/R caused severe histopathological injury including oedema, haemorrhage, increased thickness of the alveolar wall, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveolar spaces. Curcumin treatment significantly attenuated the severity of intestinal I/R injury. Furthermore, there is a significant reduction in the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase and increase in the expression of surfactant protein D in lung tissue of acute lung injury induced by intestinal I/R with curcumin therapy. It was concluded that curcumin treatment may have beneficial effects in acute lung injury, and therefore has potential for clinical use.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intestinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a grave condition resulting from acute mesenteric ischaemia, haemorrhagic, traumatic or septic shock, or severe burns, and some surgical procedures including small bowel transplantation and abdominal aortic surgery and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430984">Deitch, 1992</xref>). Of these remote organ injuries, lung injury has been very well characterized as an acute inflammation with sequestration of leukocytes and their enzymatic products in lung tissue, increased microvascular permeability, perivascular and interstitial oedema, and pulmonary oedema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711430984">Frutos-Vivar et al., 2006</xref>). The lung appears to be the first remote organ that is affected by this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430984">Deitch, 1992</xref>). Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) can develop after generalized <italic>systemic inflammatory response syndrome</italic> and is the major cause of death in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430984">Mallick et al., 2004</xref>). ARDS remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233711430984">Turnage et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the organs may be protected from the damaging effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defence. These include enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711430984">Bhatia and Moochhala, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430984">Metnitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711430984">Tasaka et al., 2008</xref>). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a good indicator of free radical activity and its altitude presents increased lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711430984">Aksu et al., 2007</xref>). However, alveolar macrophages can manufacture potent ROS such as superoxide radicals and consequently peroxynitrite which can be produced by the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with superoxide radicals and exhibits a highly oxidative species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711430984">Bhatia and Moochhala, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430984">Metnitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711430984">Tasaka et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanisms of lung injury induced by intestinal I/R are very complex. It is well established that lipid peroxidation is one of the major factors causing lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711430984">Giakoustidis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711430984">Rossman et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, evidence showed that overproduction of NO generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) not only aggravates oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430984">Pararajasingam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748233711430984">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>) but leads to pulmonary microvascular dysfunction as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233711430984">Turnage et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the therapeutical strategy by removing free radicals and reducing NO overproduction should be potential effective strategies for the protection against lung injury following intestinal I/R.</p>
<p>Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the collectin family of proteins, which plays important roles in innate host defence of the lung and regulation of surfactant homeostasis and is synthesized in alveolar type II cells and Clara cells of lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711430984">Leth-Larsen et al., 2003</xref>). Alveolar cell damage leads to decreased and impaired synthesis, secretion, function, and composition of SP-D in acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430984">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430984">Herbein and Wright, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711430984">Guzel et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Curcumin is a dietary antioxidant derived from turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, Zingiberaceae) and has been known since ancient times to possess therapeutic properties. It has been reported to scavenge oxygen free radicals, to inhibit lipid peroxidation, and to protect the cellular macromolecules, including DNA from oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711430984">Kalpana and Menon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711430984">Polasa et al., 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of curcumin treatment on acute lung injury induced by intestinal I/R.</p>

<sec id="section3-0748233711430984">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male albino Wistar albino rats (200â250 g) were used in the present study. All the animals were kept under optimum conditions (21 Â± 1Â°C, 40â70% humidity, 12/12 darkâlight cycle) at Ondokuz Mayis Universityâs Laboratory Animal Unit and were fed ad libitum with standard pellet diet and water. The experimental protocol was approved by Ondokuz Mayis Universityâs Ethic Committee for Animal Research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748233711430984">
<title>Experimental groups</title>
<p>A total of 30 male Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups: sham, I/R, and I/R + curcumin; each group contains 10 rats. Animals were pretreated with curcumin by gastric gavage (in a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days before intestinal I/R as described for I/R group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711430984">
<title>Technique of intestinal I/R</title>
<p>Feeding of the animals was stopped 12 h prior to the start of the intestinal I/R procedure and they received only water. The rats were anaesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) and their temperature was regulated by means of a lamp light bulb during the test. Intestinal I/R was induced as follows: the rats were placed in the supine position and secured in the dissection tray. The abdominal region was shaved and cleaned with antiseptic solutions. The intestinal region was reached by means of midline laparotomy. Superior mesenteric artery was subjected with care and occluded with an atraumatic microvascular clamp, thus intestinal ischaemia was created in 1 h when the existence of pulseless or pale colour of the intestine was recognized. The abdominal region was then closed. Following ischaemia, the clamp was removed and 1 h reperfusion was induced. The return of the pulses and the reestablishment of the pink colour were assumed to be due to the reperfusion of the intestine. At the end of reperfusion, the pulmonary segment was taken out, and the animals were killed by exsanguination.</p>

<title>Biochemical procedures</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment, the harvested lung tissue samples were quickly washed in cold saline and stored at â70Â°C.</p>
<p>
<italic>Measurement of tissue malondialdehyde level</italic>. Lung tissue samples were frozen at â70Â°C and irrigated well with a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl; 0.9%). By admixing it with potassium chloride (KCl; 1.5%), homogenization at a ratio of 1:10 was achieved. The DIAÃ9000 Homogenizer (Heidolph Instruments, Germany) was used to homogenize the tissue samples. The lipid peroxide level in the centrifuged tissue homogenates was measured according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711430984">Ohkawa et al. (1979)</xref>. The reaction product was assayed spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu UV-1700, Japan) at 532 nm. The lipid peroxide level was expressed as the nanomole (nmol) of MDA per milligram of lung tissue protein. Protein levels were measured according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711430984">Lowry et al. (1951)</xref>. </p>
<p>
<italic>Measurement of tissue superoxide dismutase activity. </italic>SOD activity was determined according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711430984">Sun et al. (1988)</xref>. This method is based on the inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by the xanthine oxidase (XO) system as a superoxide generator. Activity was assessed in the ethanol phase of the lysate after 1.0 ml ethanol/chloroform mixture (5/3, v/v) was added to the same volume of sample and centrifuged. One unit of SOD was defined as the enzyme amount causing 50% inhibition in the NBT reduction rate. SOD activity was also expressed as units per milligram of protein.</p>
<p>
<italic>Glutathione peroxidase activity. </italic>GSH-Px activity was measured by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711430984">Paglia and Valentine (1967)</xref>. The enzymatic reaction was initiated in a tube containing the following items: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced glutathione, sodium azide, and glutathione reductase by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored by a spectrophotometer. Activity was given in units per gram of protein. All samples were assayed in duplicate.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>Portions of right lung (anterior lobe, median lobe, posterior lobe, and post caval lobe) and left lung (upper left lobe and lower left lobe) were individually immersed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated in alcohol, embedded in paraffin, and then cut into 5-Î¼m thick cross-sections through the middle of the lobe, so that each section included hilum to periphery. Sections were placed on slides, deparaffinated, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) using standard procedures. Six slides were analyzed in a standardized fashion. Each lung lobe sections were divided equally for histopathological and biochemical investigations. Each slide was examined and evaluated in random order under blindfold conditions for immunostaining by a histologist and stained with H&amp;E for histopathologic assessment under a standard light microscopy. The slides were examined for the presence of peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration (PICI), alveolar septal infiltration (ASI), alveolar oedema (AED), alveolar exudate (AEX), and interstitial fibrosis (IF). These changes were scored according to the 4-point scale used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711430984">Takil et al. (2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748233711430984">Table 1</xref>). A histopathological assessment was performed in at least randomly selected eight microscopic high-power fields from each lung lobe. The final score determined in each category for each individual animal was the mean of the scores from the sections of the lungs examined.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical reactions were performed according to the ABC technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711430984">Hsu et al. (1981)</xref>. The procedure involved the following steps: (1) endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in distilled water for 30 min, (2) the sections were washed in distilled water for 10 min, (3) nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by incubation with normal goat serum (DAKO X 0907, Carpinteria, CA, USA) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), diluted 1:4, (4) the sections were incubated with specific rabbit polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody (Cat. # RB-1605-P, Neomarkers, USA) and specific rabbit polyclonal SP-D antibody (Cat. # AB3434, Chemicon, USA), diluted 1:50 for 1 h, and then at room temperature, (5) the sections were washed in PBS 3 Ã 3 min, (6) the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO LSAB 2 Kit, Carpinteria, CA, USA), (7) the sections were washed in PBS 3 Ã 3 min, (8) the sections were incubated with ABC complex (DAKO LSAB 2 Kit), (9) the sections were washed in PBS 3 Ã 3 min, (10) peroxidase was detected with an aminoethylcarbazole substrate kit (AEC kit; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA, USA), (11) the sections were washed in tap water for 10 min and then dehydrated, (12) the nuclei were stained with haematoxylin, and (13) the sections were mounted in DAKO paramount.</p>
<p>The positive staining of iNOS and SP-D cell numbers were scored in a semiquantitative manner in order to determine the differences between the control group and the experimental groups in the distribution patterns of intensity of immunolabelling of lung tissue. The numbers of the positive staining were recorded as absent (â), a few (Â±), few (+), medium (++), high (+++), and very high (++++). This analysis was performed in at least randomly selected eight microscopic high-power fields from each lung lobe section, in two sections from each animal at Ã400 magnification. The final score determined in each category for each individual animal was the average of the scores from the sections of the lungs examined.</p>

Sham animals presented normal lung tissue; neither oedema nor alveolar haemorrhage was encountered in these lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430984">Figure 1a</xref>). Specifically, oedema, haemorrhage, increased thickness of the alveolar wall, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveolar spaces were observed in the I/R group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430984">Figure 1b</xref>). Treatment with curcumin prevented pulmonary parenchymal damage, and the lung histology was similar to that of the sham group, with numerous distended alveoli that had thin, flattened, delicate walls. The alveoli were well aerated, and few inflammatory cells were observed within the interstitium in the I/R + curcumin group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430984">Figure 1c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute respiratory failure is the single most important component of the MODS that follows intestinal injury and continues to be a leading source of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, with an estimated incidence of 10â14 per 100,000 people and a mortality rate of 36â52%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711430984">Reynolds et al., 1998</xref>). There is evidence that intestinal I/R results in a generalized systemic inflammatory response and subsequent MODS, beginning with acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430984">Deitch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711430984">Taylor, 1998</xref>). In the gut hypothesis of MODS, intestinal injury leads to epithelial barrier dysfunction with subsequent release of bacteria and endotoxin into the systemic circulation. This leads to activation of proinflammatory cytokines, circulating leukocytes, and the coagulation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430984">Deitch, 1992</xref>). The tissue hypoperfusion that occurs during ischaemic injury also results in activation of circulating leukocytes and upregulation of endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules. The interaction between activated leukocytes and endothelial cells leads to emigration of leukocytes and production of ROS and proteases that cause further tissue damage and subsequent end organ damage if the ongoing inflammatory response is not controlled. </p>
<p>Intestinal ischaemia followed by reperfusion is associated with acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular permeability, histologic evidence of alveolar capillary endothelial cell injury, and the pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711430984">Foulds et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711430984">Schmeling et al., 1989</xref>). In this study, the typical histologic features that occurred in intestinal I/R group were characterized by oedema, haemorrhage, increased thickness of the alveolar wall, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveolar spaces in lung tissues. Our data are corroborated by previous studies reported by other investigators of intestinal I/R-induced lung injury damage in animals. However, to date no information about the effect of curcumin on intestinal I/R-induced lung injury in rats has been reported. Our study showed that curcumin treatment inhibits the inflammatory pulmonary responses reducing significantly PICI, the ASI, AED, AEX, and IF in intestinal I/R-treated rats.</p>
<p>Among the free radicals produced during I/R, NO is also important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711430984">Karamsetty and Klinger, 2002</xref>). Excessive production of NO through the activity of iNOS contributes to the pathophysiology of intestinal I/R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711430984">Cerqueira et al., 2005</xref>). However, NO produced through constitutive NO synthase activity may be important for protecting the small intestine at the onset of intestinal I/R. NO has beneficial vasodilatory effects in the microvascular system, through the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, but, paradoxically, it could also be involved in the production of cytotoxic free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711430984">Cerqueira et al., 2005</xref>). NO derived from iNOS may contribute to intestinal I/R-induced lung injury, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233711430984">Uchida et al. (2007)</xref> reported that inhibition of iNOS ameliorated lung injury after intestinal I/R in rats. Previous studies demonstrated that selective inhibition of iNOS prevented intestinal I/R injury in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430984">Barocelli et al., 2006</xref>), whereas nonselective inhibition of NOS increased both IL-6 levels in lymph nodes and lung microvascular permeability after intestinal I/R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711430984">Breithaupt-Faloppa et al., 2009</xref>). The results from the present study were consistent with these previous reports. After intestinal I/R, iNOS expression increased in the lung; curcumin pretreatment downregulated iNOS expression. The reduction in iNOS expression by curcumin makes it a potentially therapeutic anti-inflammatory agent that may protect lung parenchyma in intestinal I/R.</p>
<p>Acute lung injury is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality following pulmonary or systemic infections. Injury to the alveolar epithelial barrier is a major determinant of the extent and severity of acute clinical lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711430984">Bachofen and Weibel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430984">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>). SP-D is a member of the collectin family of proteins, which plays important roles in innate host defence of the lung and regulation of surfactant homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711430984">Botas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711430984">Crouch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711430984">Ikegami et al., 2007</xref>). SP-D is synthesized in alveolar type II cells and Clara cells of rat lungs. In acute lung injury, there is decreased and impaired synthesis, secretion, function, and composition of SP-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430984">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430984">Herbein and Wright, 2001</xref>). This study was undertaken to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of SP-D in lung injury due to intestinal I/R. Pursuant to our results, SP-D was strongly expressed in lung injury in our nontreated study group. There is a significant reduction in the activity arising in the expression of SP-D in lung tissue of intestinal I/R models with curcumin therapy. Our present study demonstrates that a rise in the expression of SP-D in lung tissue of intestinal I/R treated with curcumin therapy.</p>
<p>Intestinal I/R causes distal organ injury by various mechanisms, including neutrophils, ROS, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233711430984">Teke et al., 2008</xref>). MDA is a final product of lipid peroxidation, and its concentration is directly proportional to the cell damage caused by ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711430984">Barut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711430984">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, increased production of ROS during intestinal I/R results in the consumption and depletion of endogenous scavenging antioxidant enzymes such as SOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711430984">Atahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711430984">Turut et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, activated neutrophils secrete MPO, which catalyses the formation of hypochlorous acid and chloride anions. Therefore, increased MPO activity is a good index of neutrophil activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711430984">Barut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711430984">Turut et al., 2009</xref>). The enzyme, XO, is another important source of ROS in postischaemic tissues. XO generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> during the oxidation of hypoxanthine or xanthine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711430984">Cerqueira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711430984">Turut et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, increased production of ROS during I/R results in the consumption and depletion of endogenous scavenging antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, catalase, and GPx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711430984">Atahan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711430984">Turut et al., 2009</xref>). We found that the MDA content was upregulated after intestinal I/R injury and remarkably downregulated after curcumin administration. In addition, another hallmark of intestinal reperfusion injury as determined by SOD and GSH-Px activities were upregulated after curcumin treatment as well.</p>
<p>We conclude that curcumin therapy causes morphologic improvement on acute lung injury in rats after intestinal I/R injury. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of curcumin may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on pulmonary damage after intestinal I/R injury in rats.</p>
