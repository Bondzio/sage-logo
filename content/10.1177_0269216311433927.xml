<body>
<p>Edwards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311433927">1</xref></sup> recently described in a meta-study how they themselves, the authors of the papers they examined, and many of subjects of those papers had difficulty in defining spirituality and could not easily describe what they meant by spiritual care. My experience too is that clinicians generally have the same difficulty.</p>
<p>Our problem is all about perspective. We usually try to describe spirituality from within our acquired belief systems. This is self-limiting and constrains our understanding of both the origins of spirituality and the beliefs of others. It particularly creates a problem in heterogeneous communities with a wide range of often-contradictory explanations for life.</p>
<p>I think we should set aside our various culturally driven beliefs that tell us how things work and what to think. With a clean slate we can start to consider the phenomena we describe as spirituality in terms of our growing scientific understanding of the origins and function of our brains. (With the qualification that it may be that we simply do not have the capacity to understand the higher-level workings of our brains. The mechanisms that deliver self-awareness may be found, in the same way as nuclear physics, to be too complex for almost all of us to comprehend.)</p>
<p>Whatever our individual limitations, science is starting to describe how our minds work. For example, Quirin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311433927">2</xref></sup> performed functional MRI scanning on subjects in whom they generated fear of mortality or fear of dental pain. These revealed that the contemplation of mortality, but not of non-life-threatening pain, activated areas of the brain associated with habitual behaviours and love. This strongly suggests that awareness of end-of-life issues has hard-wired neuroanatomical correlates. Such evidence, produced by clinical observation and new technologies, supports the hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311433927">3</xref></sup> that our self-awareness is the product of our structure.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a growing understanding of the concept of emergent phenomena: communities of simple components (e.g. ants), each following simple rules that govern their behaviour and interaction, manifest complex higher-level behaviours of which none of the individual members is aware.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311433927">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the activity of the population of cells that make up our brain produces the emergent phenomenon of self-awareness. Our brains generate a perception or a perspective of an identity separate from our physical body. For many of us the complexity of self-awareness includes a need for an explanation or a meaning, and, particularly at the end of our lives, for validation. For some this is met by fulfilling the values of culture, which evolved in part to meet this need, and with which we are programmed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311433927">5</xref></sup> Others seem unable ever to generate the neurophysiological state that we describe as feeling at peace.</p>
<p>As animals that are, in general, responsive to the mental states of our companions we can influence one another’s sense of peace and security. While this may seem intangible and ill defined, it has been an important part of the success of other social species such as cattle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311433927">6</xref></sup> and elephants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311433927">7</xref></sup> and is the product of our common evolutionary heritage. Effective palliative care workers create a contagious ambiance within which many patients and families are able to achieve the state of mind wherein they feel good, and which they might describe as being at peace with mortality.</p>
<p>While psychosocial care and spiritual care may have seemed to be separate when modern palliative care arose, this was before socio-biology and the evolutionary origins of culture and beliefs had been widely considered. I think the concept of spirituality should not stand alone but be relocated within the taxonomy of the biopsychosocial explanations of behaviour. While practical therapeutic approaches have been developed to improve the spiritual state of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311433927">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311433927">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311433927">10</xref></sup> the scientific understanding of what we call spirituality will be enhanced when it is viewed as a product of our brains.</p>
<p>This requires a change in perspective that, as briefly discussed here, poses big challenges for us in palliative care. However successful we might be in achieving an intellectual explanation of how we work, as social beings we will continue to experience our lives as the complex entanglement of the structure of our brains with their programming, and within a further group of emergent phenomena, our communities. The first challenge is to deliver the benefits of scientific understanding to patients without confronting and undermining the beliefs that give them comfort, whatever they may be. The second, and perhaps the greater, is to deal with the challenges that may be posed for our personal belief systems by scientific explanations for the workings of our minds.</p>
