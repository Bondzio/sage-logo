<p>The task of this book’s reviewer is not easy. Here is a large volume with 26 chapters contributed by a variety of authors who see themselves as involved in a project – that of putting a new ‘sub-discipline’ (the editors’ word) on the map by demonstrating its ability to elucidate and deepen our understanding of something that perplexes many of us (especially the present reviewer) – the world financial system and its current troubles. Authors include some of the most distinguished scholars in the psychoanalysis of organizations, numerous consultants with extensive experience of working with senior finance and banking companies (and therefore who can claim to know the sector well) and other scholars who believe that the world financial system requires the insights of psychoanalysis to reveal its complexities and apparent irrationalities. At the most general level, what brings all these scholars together is the belief that social phenomena and, in particular, the nexus of institutions, practices and people that represent today’s finance, call for the resources of psychoanalysis in order to understand them.</p>
<p>The use of psychoanalytic ideas to elucidate social and cultural phenomena is not new. It dates back to Freud’s seminal contributions to the study of religion and other cultural institutions, and includes Wilhelm Reich’s and Erich Fromm’s pioneering studies of fascism, Herbert Marcuse’s towering critique of consumer society and Norman O. Brown’s quest for an emancipatory theory of money in the psychoanalytic theory of anal sexuality. The ambition of most contributors to this collection is, inevitably, more modest, each using a greater or lesser range of psychoanalytic concepts and theories to address some aspect of the triumvirate ‘money–finance–capitalism’. Contributions are organized in three parts, each one headed by one of the triumvirate’s members. In truth, however, there are extensive overlaps between the three and there are attempts to analyse the current financial crisis in each of the book’s parts. Contributors draw on many psychoanalytic resources. However, those that most consistently surface in the discussions in this book are the Tavistock-inspired theory of system psychodynamics and social defences, Bion’s theory of a group’s (or organization’s) primary task and its lapses into the fantasy world of basic assumptions, and Klein’s theory of envy and greed and underlying defences of splitting and denial. Behind all these are variants of the idea that anxieties, in individuals, groups, organizations and even nations that fail to contain them, can lead to all kinds of irrationalities, pathologies and dysfunctions.</p>
<p>The book’s contents include abstract contributions on the nature of money, markets, risk, profit, entrepreneurship, loans and so forth (e.g. chapters by Shafer, Long, Pelzer, Levine, Schwartz), field studies of specific financial institutions, groups or professionals (e.g. Gill and Sher, Lawrence, Tarim, Fraher, van den Hoof), and more focused discussions of the current crisis and its antecedents (e.g. Sievers, Nagel, van de Koo and Kemna, Hirschhorn).</p>
<p>The chapters based on field studies are possibly those that readers not versed in psychoanalysis will find most accessible and immediately rewarding. Outstanding among these is a very close psychological portrait of two highly successful bankers by Hans van den Hoof, which immediately displays the advantages of a psychoanalytic approach. Both of these high-flyers had, in mid-career, experienced a ‘corporate fall’, one feeling himself excluded and cold-shouldered by those who had enthusiastically recruited him, the other finding himself overpowered by a desire to please and agree with others to the point of finding himself without an identity he could call his own. The author resorts to a time-honoured psychoanalytic method to elucidate the predicaments of his subjects, using an archetype drawn from an ancient myth, that of Phaëthon. Phaëthon, the son of the Sun God, was eager to fly his father’s bright chariot. His motive, in the Ovid version of the story, was to prove his identity and worth but, in the older Euripidean variant which has recently come to light, it was to escape from a terrestrial world of compromises and constraints. In both variants, Phaëthon crashes to Earth, unable to control the chariot’s powerful horses. Van den Hoof skilfully develops the Phaëthon motif and uses it to explain his characters’ corporate climb and subsequent catastrophic falls when they fail to control the ‘horse called career’.</p>
<p>The theme of young men (and, much less often, women) attracted by high finance and money as a means of escape from what seem like mundane realities of ordinary careers is one that many academics who have seen some of their brightest students disappear down that route will recognize. It surfaces eloquently in the contribution by Douglas Kirsner, who views the financial markets as ‘psychic retreats’, a fantasy world where effortless and everlasting wealth can be amassed, leading to a kind of inebriation and detachment from reality. The fantastic features of high finance are also highlighted in Claudia Nagel’s chapter in which money represents the ultimate fetish: those who dedicate themselves to its pursuit use it to make up (i.e. as a defence against) an unbearable experience of deficiency. Such defences are bolstered by a set of illusions and fantasies (‘this time it is different’, ‘we are in control’, ‘we have mastered risk’, etc.) that seek to silence the anxieties that are produced by a complex, interdependent and largely unmanageable world.</p>
<p>While contributions such as those described above highlight the narcissism, bombast and bluster of finance executives, Alison Gill and Mannie Sher’s chapter, based on research with numerous finance and banking executives, highlights their insecurities, confusions and attendant defensive postures. Behind an exaltation of the market, blind faith in highly abstract mathematical models and an unquestioned worship of money, these authors found deep insecurities and fears:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of our respondents struggle to understand the global, social and systemic nature of the financial crisis. They seldom come up with anything better than headline catchphrases like ‘trust’, ‘relationships’, ‘interdependence’, but these could hardly help them really understand what happened to their industry nor lead them to any effective solutions. (pp. 64–65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following the onset of the crisis, many of these respondents lapse into rationalizations, deny that they had anything to do with it or that many really suffer as a result. While it is reassuring for the rest of us to know that we are not alone in our incomprehension and confusion over the strange forces unleashed by markets, the chapter left me somewhat uncertain over the nature of the crisis narrative (see below) being proposed by the authors or their respondents.</p>
<p>Among the more abstract conceptual chapters, I must single out three that really captured my imagination and to which I shall be returning regularly. These three, by themselves, would make the book worth having as they combine rigorous argument and highly sophisticated use of psychoanalytic concepts and theories with profound insights into the world of money and finance. Peter Pelzer’s chapter on risk has truly opened for me a new way of understanding risk as a relatively new social construct, one that emerged when, in dealing with uncertainty, humans turned away from a theological conception that hinged on the idea of fate and towards an economic conception that sought to provide insurance against misfortune in the form of money. As a theological fixation runs aground with the failure to find proof for God, ‘the idea of God [was replaced] with a more mundane idea of a symbolic global exchangeability, i.e. money’ (p. 151). Where God’s failed promise was eternal life in exchange for earthly sufferings, the promise of money rests on the inevitability of death and therefore the value of time. Time is money – hence, risk involves considering possible futures, evaluating them accurately and acting accordingly. And this is its main contribution:
<disp-quote>
<p>Risk orders future by making it present. Risk is containment of the threatening future by ordering it. … Risk may enable us to deal with the future in the double meaning of the word: risk may handle the future, and it may make a deal by buying a future. The world is contingent, but therefore it offers options. And it offers futures to choose from – which is much more that the financial markets have on offer. (p. 160)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pelzer’s contribution, therefore, is to highlight the importance of the seminal concept of choice in today’s consumer capitalism, a concept conspicuously absent from the other chapters or, maybe, I should say, absorbed in the concept of the market.</p>
<p>David P. Levine does for the concept of ‘speculation’ what Pelzer did for risk – he offers a novel and utterly beguiling interpretation of a phenomenon that is all too easily assimilated in moralistic discussions of greed and easy money. Levine, by contrast, views speculation as a perversion of fantasy. Where fantasy may seek to change reality through work and bring into being new forms of existence, speculation denies the importance of work and pursues its object through a process akin to magic or prayer. Levine links speculation to a conception of greed that can be traced to Winnicott’s work that views it as the result of an adult person’s failed attempt to find his or her space in a world composed of other adults, seeking instead to incorporate and dominate everything around them. Levine develops his argument with great energy, linking it to the vilification of caring and serving qualities, which narcissistically seek to deny the existence of a needy and dependent self, and suggests that the ‘ethic of service’ so strong among young people may be harnessed to offset the greedy self. He reaches the conclusion that the purpose of social policy ‘should not be to suppress greed through moral education but to ensure that neither family nor civil society becomes a setting for narcissistic domination’ (p. 275).</p>
<p>Howard Schwartz’s contribution offers exemplary accounts of Oedipal and anti-Oedipal dynamics in developing an interpretation of the alleged discriminatory practices of banks when refusing home loans to individuals, an issue that had been highlighted in a report by the Federal Bank of Boston. Schwartz views the report and its philosophy as expressions of the continuing dominance of an ideology of political correctness in US social and economic life, an ideology that undermines equal treatment of all according to legitimate, impartial rules and standards. A long-term critic of political correctness, Schwartz argues that it expresses a challenge to the Oedipal worldview and rule of the father, embodied in the disciplines and rigours of an external reality and which attempts to establish rules and laws for civilized living. Political correctness seeks, instead, to restore the perfect world of the love of a primal mother, a world where each and every person can rediscover themselves as the centre of a benevolent universe without having to try. Along the way, Schwartz proposes a highly provocative explanation for the idealization of oppressed people and minority groups and the resulting perpetuation of oppression in the name of reparation. Schwartz’s argument demands to be read and engaged seriously by anyone interested in contemporary US politics.</p>
<p>I expect that many readers will come to this book, however, neither for its insightful field studies nor for its abstract theoretical contributions but to examine how socioanalysis helps us understand the financial crisis, currently on everyone’s agenda. Now, this discourse is very difficult to pin down, with all kinds of different facts, opinions and explanations, economic, social, political and psychological, competing for attention, at times reinforcing each other, at other times challenging each other, and at yet other times remaining indifferent to each other. In an attempt to disentangle the different threads that make up this discourse, I have compiled, as someone interested in narratives (not as an economist or a psychoanalyst) the following narrative which may be viewed as a lay person’s core narrative, one which different theorists may support, qualify or challenge. It runs something like this:
<disp-quote>
<p>The 2008 world financial crisis was the product of excessive risk-taking by greedy bankers who did not understand the complexity and interdependency of the financial entities they were dealing with. In this they were aided and abetted by governments’ unwillingness or inability to provide satisfactory regulation, subject to a neo-liberal economic creed that has blind faith in markets to regulate themselves and offer efficient allocation of resources. It was further compounded by investors who were confused and placed the money in the hands of finance whizz-kids who did not understand what was going on and were generally ‘greedy’ in seeking excessive profits from their investments. Ordinary people also contributed to the crisis by getting themselves into debts that they could not service, by believing that the value of their assets (especially their homes) would cover these debts, only to find that their assets were not worth what they thought they were. And finally, there was a contribution from the crazy psychology of markets that have no way of stopping a spiral of panic-selling once it has kicked in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In an attempt to demonstrate how socioanalysis can enrich this account and offer a psychoanalytic explanation for the crisis, Burkard Sievers has synthesized a number of arguments. He notes that many eminent economists acknowledge that the crisis has a ‘psychological dimension’ or even ‘psychological causes’ which they are ill-equipped to provide. He then goes on to offer a number of socioanalytic approaches, each one of which illuminated a psychoanalytic dimension of the crisis. They amount to a narrative in their own right that runs somewhat as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0170840612454491" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is a manic denial of reality that asserts, against all sensible caution, that everything in the world of finance is under control and that competent, smart people are in charge;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The supposed competence and smartness of these people is the product of collective narcissism and a fantasy about the perfection of organizations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The primary task of many financial institutions is perverted, from helping people and institutions to make deposits and obtain loans, to enriching themselves;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once the crisis takes hold, a mentality of toxicity takes hold, seeking to inoculate institutions from ‘toxic assets’ by raising barriers that prove ineffective; this prompts a paralysis of resistance and lapse to depression akin to a state of miasma;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The crisis precipitates a return of repressed anxieties and what was an idealized object (the market) turns into a persecutory one;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This reveals the underlying psychotic dynamic of the financial system which is built on a denial of the harsh realities of life and death and its replacement by a system of make-believe of easy money and effortless comfort.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Readers will make up their own minds as to the value of this alternative narrative and its utility in helping them make sense of the crisis. Suffice to say that each one of the contributions in this volume that addresses the crisis can be placed somewhere within Sievers’ overall scheme. One chapter, however, that somehow stretches the discourse of the crisis beyond Sievers’ narrative and which I found particularly stimulating is that by Larry Hirschhorn. Hirschhorn is one of those theorists who not only can build a convincing argument but, along the way, is interested in engaging with counter-arguments and, when necessary, rebutting them or at least differentiating his position from them. Thus Hirschhorn offers a powerful counter-argument to the views that the market signifies either a God-like article of faith or a complex entity to be mastered through the resources of rational mathematical equations. Instead, argues Hirschhorn, the market, for those who are daily engaged with it, represents an object of aesthetic beauty which unleashes their creative imagination.</p>
<p>Unlike most other writers in this volume (but not Levine and Pelzer), Hirschhorn carefully differentiates fantasy from imagination and argues that the latter stands behind much human creativity and reconciles the pleasure and the reality principles. It finds pleasure not in denying chaos or seeking to master it but in learning to live with it and make the most of it. When the pleasure principle is left untamed, the result is unbridled narcissism, as was drawn out by Schwartz (whom Hirschhorn cites approvingly). In the regime of narcissism, entitlement rather than greed (here Hirschhorn differentiates himself interestingly from virtually every other contributor) becomes the dominant dynamic – not the child that wants everything for herself but the child who has convinced herself that they were promised something that they never got. The banks and financial institutions, argues Hirschhorn, found themselves behaving in precisely this manner – they were neither greedy nor imprudent, but underestimated systemic risks when the beautiful system they believed they had created and had learned to live with turned out to behave in an ugly way. One must admire Hirschhorn’s ingeniousness, which certainly casts the protagonists of the drama not as incompetent idiots nor as melodramatic villains but as artists who lost the plot, an idea that should be explored further.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, how well does the book live up to the promise of putting socioanalysis on the map as a sub-discipline by proving its worth against the ugly beast of the moment, the financial system and its current crisis? I very much welcome a systematic psychological challenge to the imperialism of economics when it comes to speaking about finance and the crisis. Economists have been riding high in the world of the social sciences and the crisis, far from clipping their wings, has, if anything, enhanced their position as experts. Socioanalysis is not the only challenge to economic hegemony, but is adding its weight in this direction. The interminable troubles of Greece and the plight of the euro serve as useful reminders that economics can write off neither politics nor psychology.</p>
<p>All the same, I find that socioanalysis has some way to go before it emerges as a coherent and critical discipline. There is too much heterogeneity of approaches in this volume to allow us to speak of a uniform discipline that shares some core concepts and assumptions. It also seems to me that some of the concepts used by authors in this volume lack the kind of critical sharpness that they now have in other social science discourses. For example, the concept of system (and its primary task) in this volume still carries the Tavistock imprimatur and tries to be all things from autopoiesis to complexity and chaos. Too often, while reading this volume, I felt distinctly uncomfortable about the uncritical use of distinctions between normality and pathology, sanity and madness, reality and fantasy, creativity and dysfunction that other disciplines have effectively queried. Finally, I am not sure what the distinctive element or hypothesis of socioanalysis may be, one that would differentiate it from psychoanalysis of social phenomena or from what Hirschhorn, following a French school, prefers to call psychosociology.</p>
<p>At the moment, socioanalysis gives the impression of an emerging discourse that is still finding its voice, hence this book’s title, <italic>Towards a Socioanalysis of Money, Finance and Capitalism</italic>, is entirely accurate. Its readers will find a broad set of valuable conceptual resources and arguments in developing their own psychoanalytically grounded understandings of these phenomena. They will also find some priceless gems that will challenge their ways of thinking and maybe force them to reconsider things that they believed they knew and understood well. Finally, as someone who has already adopted several chapters from this collection to support courses I teach, I have no doubt that the book will find many similar uses with other colleagues.</p>
