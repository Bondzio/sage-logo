<p>April 7-9, 2013</p>
<p>Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia</p>
<p>Presented by GSU School of Music, the GSU Neuroscience Institute, and the Center for Collaborative and International Arts</p>
<p>Organizing Committee: Dr. Martin Norgaard (Symposium Chair), Dr. Patrick Freer, Dr. Katie Carlisle, Mr. Daniel Welborn</p>
<p><italic>The Improvising Brain</italic> is a symposium and concert event that will bring together faculty researchers, graduate students, and musicians to explore music, improvisation, and related brain processes. The concert and symposium will feature keynote speaker Dr. Robert Zatorre, one of the leading neuroscientists in the field of music perception and production, and Christian Howes, an up-and-coming jazz violinist representing the improvising performer.</p>
<p>The symposium will explore questions related to music perception, production, and the underlying cognitive processes. Of specific interest is research concerning any aspect of improvisation. Examples include the following: Are note choices during improvisation and word choices during speech controlled by similar cognitive mechanisms? What is the role of subconscious procedural processes during note selection?</p>
<p>We seek related papers and posters describing completed or in-progress work from both faculty and graduate students. Paper presentations should be 20 minutes in length and should include visual slides. For more information regarding the conference and submissions, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cas.gsu.edu/theimprovisingbrain/">http://www.cas.gsu.edu/theimprovisingbrain/</ext-link>. Submissions from faculty and graduate students must be received by October 15, 2012, and notifications will be made by November 1, 2012.</p>
<p>The symposium will feature a research mentor session in which Dr. Zatorre and others will review ideas for research related to music cognition and improvisation. Junior researchers may submit proposed research for this panel to discuss by March 1, 2013.</p>
<p>Please address questions to Martin Norgaard, PhD, at <email>mnorgaard@gsu.edu</email>.</p>
<p>The organizing committee would like to thank the following for their support of this event: Mr. W. Dwight Coleman (Director, School of Music), Dr. Walter Wilczynski (Director, Neuroscience Institute), Dr. Pearl McHaney (Associate Dean, Fine Arts; Director, the Center for Collaborative and International Arts).</p>
