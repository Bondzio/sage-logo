<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Surfing is a popular activity, and with many people wanting to learn how to surf, emergency departments record an increasing amount of injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412447501">Hay et al., 2009</xref>). In most cases the injuries are to the back or head. On the upper extremities it is usually the shoulder that is injured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412447501">Lowdon et al., 1983</xref>). Injuries to the hand are rare. We report a series of surfing related hand injuries.</p>
<p>The main mechanism of the injury is a leash winding around one finger. After a fall, the surfer tries to bring back the surfboard by pulling the leash with his hand. He winds up the cable around a finger, voluntarily or involuntarily, because of the power of the wave. The traction strength is so powerful that the injury occurs.</p>
<p>We retrospectively identified 82 patients with fingertip injuries we believe were caused by the surfboard leash, from 2008 to 2011. There were 68 male and 14 female. Their median age was 23 years at diagnosis (range, 13–37 years of age). In each case only one finger was damaged. The index, middle, ring and little fingers were respectively concerned in 1 (1.2%), 15 (18.3%), 35 (42.7%) and 31 (37.8%) cases. There were 35 (42.7%) complete amputations of the distal phalanx. A total of 16 concerned the proximal half of the nail and 19 were localized between the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint and the nail matrix. There were 41 (50%) incomplete amputations encountered; 25 concerned the proximal half of the nail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412447501">Figure 1</xref>), 16 the area located between the DIP joint and the nail matrix. Five fingertips injuries were encountered with skin loss only.</p>

<p>In one case there was palmar skin loss from the head of the proximal phalanx to the fingertip, exposing the bones and tendons without injury to the neurovascular bundles, similar to a ring avulsion injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412447501">Figure 2</xref>). Bones and tendons were exposed without injury to the neurovascular bundles. The stripping occurred with the string closest to the tail of the surfboard. The nylon string was twisted, by the wave, around the finger and removed all the palmar skin as a ring finger.</p>

</fig>
<p>Treatment comprised either simple dressings three times a week until complete healing occurred, or surgical options of local flaps (43 cases), osteosynthesis and temporarily Kirschner wire arthodesis of the DIP joint (39 cases), returning the avulsed part as a composite graft (11 cases) or microsurgical revascularization (9 cases) for partial amputations. Nail bed suture and nail repositioning were performed when necessary. For the extensive palmar skin avulsion, a dorsal digitometacarpal island flap was used with a full thickness skin graft to the donor site.</p>
<p>Although surfing and skim boarding are practiced in the same environment, the pattern of injuries seen in surfers differs substantially from those sustained while skim boarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412447501">Sciarretta et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We report a series of surfing related hand injuries, the pattern of which we feel suggests the main mechanism of injury is similar to a rope avulsion injury occurring when the surf board leash wraps around the digit and traction is applied.</p>
<p>New devices, such as the ‘surf protect leash’ are beginning to be developed. This is a kind of belt attachment, which wraps around the leash close to its attachment to the surfboard, reducing the risk of such an injury.</p>
