<abstract>
<p>Vallila Library is a medium sized public library and belongs to the Helsinki City Library. It was the first public institution to seek and receive the EcoCompass environmental label (2011). We created our own environmental strategies and policies, and reviewed such activities as recirculation and recycling. However, we could not decide alone on what kind of greener actions should be adopted; we are not independent actors. It was not always clear what kind of actions should be taken and what to measure. The greatest challenge was nobody had spelled out the concept of ‘green library’: we were forced to view the issue on a broader scale. It seemed that the best option was to show others the road to becoming green(er). Our commitment to environmental responsibility shows that we consider green values to be important. We offer easy access to information on ecological issues and arrange events that focus on environmental issues. We have to tell the world (and decision makers) that libraries are responsible actors and promote environmental sustainability. Commitment to green values may increase environmental sustainability and help libraries to take a new and visible role in changing society.</p>

<title>Environmentally friendly foundations and seeking an Eco-label</title>
<p>Libraries are quite ‘green’ in that the basic activities consist of information retrieval, circulating the collections, as well as offering an open, public space. None of our activities are harmful to the environment. This is fine, but it means that it is challenging to develop greener ways of acting. The foundation is already environmentally sustainable. This was the lesson we at Vallila Library learned when we were the first public institution to receive the EcoCompass environmental label in 2011, along with some 30 small business companies as well as the Finnish National Opera. </p>
<p>The following remarks concern, first of all, our own environmental project and what we learnt during the project. However, I may at least wish that our work contributes to the broader discussion on environmental sustainability in libraries. The logic of the situations, as well as problems, may well be common to most public libraries.</p>
<p>The EcoCompass eco-label is granted by the Helsinki City Environmental Center and it is a quite light, streamlined environmental system. It is created for smaller companies. Now, since the environmental system was ‘lighter’, our approach was a little different from the usual. To receive an environmental label usually means that that the building has to fulfill several requirements. The focus is on the ecological features of the building. This is also the case with the discussion on ‘green libraries’: the discussion often concerns only library buildings, the walls. However, we cannot reconstruct all the library buildings. We have to act in existing ones and the only possible way to be greener is to act in greener way inside the old walls. This was our starting point: although we could not have a new ecologically efficient library building, we wanted to do something, i.e. act more ecologically. </p>
<p>On the other hand, even a lighter environmental system includes environmental management. Vallila library joined the environmental project in early 2010 and during that year we created our own environmental strategy and policies, and reviewed such activities as recirculation and recycling. Our environmental policy is in line with the policy of the Helsinki City Library, which is based on the efficient circulation of collections, preserving the cultural heritage, preventing alienation, increasing consciousness concerning environmental issues and decreasing environmental strain. All this is quite abstract and does not have much to do with the everyday work in a small library. However, the Helsinki City Library has been very active in this respect and has also a few more practical practices. In Helsinki City Library, there is, for example, a network of ecological support staff, one in almost every library. These persons take care of environmental issues in the libraries and keep the rest of the staff informed. </p>
<p>All this left us in an odd situation. The foundations were already environmentally sustainable, there was not much we could do with the existing building (in the short term) and Helsinki City Library had already drawn the guidelines of environmental management (and some good practices). So, what should we do to earn the environmental label?</p>
<p>The answer was that there was a lot to do. This is a good start, but it is only a beginning. The environmental project led us to think and rethink environmental questions. We had to clarify for ourselves what does it mean to be an environmentally friendly library. Environmental management had to be brought down to earth and we had to become aware of what the intrinsic strengths and weakness are for libraries concerning environmental sustainability. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0340035212455624">
<title>Down-to-earth environmental management: recycling, saving energy, and procurements</title>
<p>Recycling, environmentally friendly purchases and saving energy are at the core of being environmentally friendly. These were also the key words in almost any environmental strategy and policy. First we thought that this was not a problem for us. However, some points can be made concerning use of paper, computers and saving energy and, it seems to me, that these remarks concern most of the libraries and reveal the special situation in which libraries act. And I might even suggest that some standard rules for ecological sustainability have to be modified to apply to libraries, libraries are not like all the other institutions. </p>
<p>Some years ago, we thought that computers would make us environmentally friendly – that we would work in offices without a single sheet of paper. However, the use of paper has not decreased. All too often I have to admit that accidents happen. At times I intend to print a short message when in fact three pages get printed. We recycle paper and try to find out new uses for used sheets of paper, but all the same: the amount of paper has not decreased. </p>
<p>At the same time, many have begun to calculate how much waste and scrap computers bring. High Tech is not particularly high longevity and equipment is changed and updated frequently. Computers and other technical equipment also require electricity. In Vallila Library, we have calculated that the easiest way to save energy would be to switch off all computers for the night. However, this practice was restricted as all program updates took place during nighttime hours. This rule has only recently changed due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>This was our first important discovery. As a municipal library, we are dependent on many other actors and we have to follow the general rules given by the City. We cannot make independent decisions like small businesses can. So unfortunately, sometimes easy solutions are out of the question.</p>
<p>We faced this fact quite a few times. Vallila library is a part of a greater building complex and therefore it cannot decide alone what kind of greener actions shall be adopted. For example, we share waste containers with a daycare facility. Our interests in waste management are quite different than theirs and consequently compromises are often necessary. The same holds true with procurements. Helsinki City has a special office that handles procurements; they select distributors and arrange the tendering of prices. In this way our purchases are guided and we cannot advance our own criterion. At the city level environmental considerations do not always have weight. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, our environmental strategy presumed for some actions and savings. Thus we had to think where we could save, and how to measure the savings. Here comes our second discovery. One has to be careful about what is measured. According to the simple model, we should decrease the use of electricity and energy used for warming. This is usually an assumption behind environmental projects. The goal is continuous decrease. Is this always possible in principle or in practice? During cold winters buildings have to be heated. In Finland, the temperature may stay below 20 degrees Celsius for months. </p>
<p>Moreover, there exists a paradox. It seems that more is less. Now, the easiest way to save energy would be to decrease opening hours, keep the library closed, switch off lights and take the computers away. However, we are trying to do the opposite. We attempt to keep the library open as much as possible and to offer a common space for reading, working, socializing or just to pass time. This is why we have the lights on whereas elsewhere lights can be switched off. Another example is that we try to offer sufficient amounts of computers so that everyone does not need to buy their own computer. Hence the paradoxical conclusion is that we may successfully decrease the total use of electricity by increasing our own use of electricity. </p>
<p>This situation seems to be quite typical for libraries. Libraries are seldom independent actors but are parts of greater institutions or share buildings with them. Often somebody else, like the City, is responsible for the care of the building and regulates many functions. This does not always leave much room for greener actions. On the other hand, libraries are public rooms, shared studying places or living rooms. This has to be taken into account when it is decided what is counted as ‘green activity’. In fact, it is quite difficult to say what should be measured and how. How can one measure the saving of energy which is due to the fact that many people gather to work in local library? </p>
<p>The conclusion was that it is hard to find new ecological ways to act – if these actions are to have some real weight. </p>

<title>Showing the green way: an example and contributor of knowledge</title>
<p>Since acting in an even greener fashion presented challenges, it seemed that the best option was to show others the road to becoming green. We thought that this might be a suitable role for a library. To show a greener way means that we express our commitment to environmental issues to our clients and other actors. We also show examples and encourage others to take the same road. Receiving an eco-label was an important part of this process. It tells about our values but also states that we have taken actions. We consider environmental issues so important that we have struggled to reach the standards to receive the label. </p>
<p>Showing the green way consists of small steps. The point is that many small steps may create a remarkable advance. Now, our first step was simply to let our clients know about our environmental project. One can find some information about our environmental project from the library and our web pages. </p>
<p>The second step was that we attempted to offer easy access to information concerning environmental issues. This may appear more or less self-evident. However, as the amount of information grows, it becomes more and more difficult to find relevant and reliable knowledge. And, unfortunately, the classification system used in libraries does not make it easier to find information on ecological subjects. Books about recycling, climate change and energy efficient building methods are scattered around the library, as they belong in different categories. In Vallila, we gathered all eco-related books onto one shelf. Here you can also find some brochures made by the environmental center. The collection may be quite small, but our clients have found it.</p>
<p>There is also another important point here. We did not accept the suggested requirement that we should grow the eco-collection. Why? The easiest way to grow the collection would be to not delete anything from it. However, it is important that we discard all information that does not hold true anymore. It is better to have a small but reliable collection of eco-books than a vast and unreliable one. Here, less is more.</p>
<p>Our third step was to arrange events on environmental questions. In the spring of 2010 there was a discussion on climate change, in 2011 on issues related with water, and the next year a series of discussions on ecological lifestyle. Leading experts have welcomed the possibility to share their expertise with a broader audience. For this reason we are planning to arrange a series of events on ecological topics in cooperation with environmental organizations. These organizations, by the way, quite often search for a place to reach people. A library is quite a suitable one.</p>
<p>Finally, our forth step has been to show an example for other libraries. We have presented our environment project for other libraries in Helsinki and we have even taken the same role to the national level. We have joined a national environmental project. To a large extent our function is to share our experiences and to raise discussion. </p>

<title>Some innovations</title>
<p>Sometimes tiny little things make a great difference. Our wish is that our small green steps make a great difference. However, the actions mentioned above are not enough. Showing a greener way presumes some new activities and ideas. In the Helsinki City Library we have already tried quite a few new ideas. Our libraries lend out traditional library collections, but many libraries also offer electricity gauges or sport equipment. Some of these items are owned by other municipal offices, like the Sports and Recreation Department. Some items are owned by the libraries themselves. </p>
<p>In both cases, the problem is that someone has to buy all these items and libraries have to be able to store them. In Vallila, we have been testing a slightly different way to lend out and re-circulate things. The library cooperates with the private organization Kuinoma. This organization was founded to enable a new kind of loaning. Members lend out their own possessions, like skis and cameras, to strangers. The owner of the item and the borrower agree on the details of the loan and thereafter the owner brings the item to the library for the borrower to pick up. After use the item is returned to the library. The library operates by acting as a mediator, lending the items with the help of a code number. There may be a nominal fee involved between the two parties, but library does not participate in that transaction.</p>
<p>The advantage of this activity is that the library does not need to buy any of these items, we only mediate the exchange. The only thing which is needed is people willing to lend their own items for the benefit of strangers. Surprisingly enough there are willing people! People wish to advance environmental sustainability and are searching for new ways to act. </p>
<p>It is actually quite simple. The motive of this activity is to repress consumption. If you need a drilling machine for a couple of days, say after having moved to a new apartment, you may see if someone has such a machine and would be willing to lend it. You do not need to buy everything. This is in fact the same idea as when libraries lend books or allow clients to use computers or other technical equipments free of charge. These are some new ideas of how to broaden the idea of circulation, which libraries already do, and to promote the importance of green values. </p>
<p>One might note here also that the idea of libraries as common living rooms is basically a green idea. It is a question about shared space like ‘lending’ is about shared things, books or other items. It might be even suggested that common living rooms, shared spaces could lead to a situation where people are satisfied with smaller apartments – you may leave home to work and spend time in a common living room. A green library should offer that possibility, and that is our goal. Also in this respect first steps have been taken in Helsinki: Kohtaamispaikka Lasipalatsi offers Urban Office, i.e. room to work. </p>

<sec id="section5-0340035212455624">
<title>Green image has a marketing value</title>
<p>In a way libraries have always been green – and after rethinking the issue, libraries have a lot to give in this respect also in future. However, it has been typical for libraries to remain quiet about this fact. This is a pity. It is not enough to just ‘be green’. One has to say it aloud, or better still to shout it from the rooftops! In other words, we have to tell people that we are environmentally friendly. We have to have a green image.</p>
<p>Why? An image is not a real thing. It is true that having a green image does not change anything. Image does not prevent climate change or save the world. </p>
<p>The value of the green image is in marketing the library. And this is a point where libraries have traditionally been quite shy. However, we should pay more attention to our image and learn marketing. If libraries wish to have sufficient or more resources, for example, from the city, libraries must take care that those who make decisions agree that libraries are indeed worth it. The same holds for the media and clients. They should recognize that libraries are needed and do important work; that libraries are responsible actors and advocate valuable issues. Having an eco-label and an environmentally friendly image are ways to do this.</p>
<p>In Vallila, we realized this quite soon. The fact that the library had joined an environmental project received a very positive reception. Our users appreciated our green values. As one of our users put it, “I’m proud that my local library acts responsibly on these green issues”. This showed us that green values are important in creating our image. We were also surprised to realize that the media was interested in our environmental project. Two different television channels and the biggest newspaper all reported on our cooperation with Kuinoma. It seems to be news that we in libraries do something else than lend out books, and that we are green. I wonder why.</p>
