<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is called a modern public health epidemic with prevalence in the general population at 1% and in those over 80 years at 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457132">1</xref></sup> The prevalence and incidence increase over time even after adjustment of age, and the lifetime risk of developing AF in individuals 40 years and older is 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112457132">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112457132">2</xref></sup> AF is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and the management is complex, often with limited results such as in sinus rhythm or stopping progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112457132">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112457132">4</xref></sup> The epidemiology and clinical consequences have been subjected to considerable investigations, while less attention has been paid to patient-related issues such as subjective well-being. Quantitative studies have shown that patients with AF rate their well-being as low compared with age-matched healthy individuals, the general population and other patients with coronary heart disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112457132">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112457132">6</xref></sup> and the psychosocial aspects especially are identified as the most critical part in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112457132">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is co-variation between well-being in self-rated severity of symptoms and uncertainty in both patients with AF and patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112457132">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112457132">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112457132">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In regard to how AF is associated with patients’ well-being, it is important to gather knowledge from a patient’s own experience. To our knowledge only one qualitative study exists reporting that AF and its symptoms are linked to uncertainty, distress and feelings of non-support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457132">17</xref></sup> Patients’ strategies for handling AF and its symptoms are learned through trial and error and are transiently effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457132">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is one qualitative study in patients with supraventricular arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112457132">18</xref></sup> and another in patients with AF who have an ICD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112457132">19</xref></sup> These patients express difficulties in living with arrhythmia as based on a shortage of human relationships and that healthcare services are not aware of arrhythmia’s negative influence on patients’ well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112457132">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112457132">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, there is a gap in the knowledge and support from healthcare about AF and its consequences in order to reduce patients’ experience of uncertainty, distress and lack of support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457132">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112457132">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112457132">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457132">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112457132">20</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to explore and describe critical incidents in which patients experience how AF affects their well-being and what actions they take to prevent and handle it.</p>

<title>2.1 Design and method description</title>
<p>The study had an explorative descriptive design with a qualitative approach using the critical incident technique (CIT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref></sup> CIT is a systematic inductive method by which observations of human behaviour in defined situations are collected, aiming to provide findings that are focused on solutions to practical problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112457132">23</xref></sup> A critical incident is, according to Flanagan’s definition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132">22</xref></sup> ‘any observable human activity that is sufficiently complete in itself to permit interferences and predictions about the person performing the action’ and the term critical as the fact that the actual behaviour described in the situation plays an important or critical role in determining an outcome. The activity investigated has a well-defined purpose, and the participants are asked to provide descriptions of situations, either positive or negative, that they perceive as significant to the purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132">22</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-1474515112457132">
<title>2.2. Settings and participants</title>
<p>Patients with diagnosed AF were asked to participate by a nurse in a cardiac care department at a county hospital in southern Sweden. Those included were patients over 18 years old hospitalised due to symptoms of AF. They were strategically chosen in line with the qualitative tradition regarding sex, age, educational level and civil status, as well as type and duration of AF. Clinical data obtained from medical records included type of AF, time since diagnosis and co-morbidities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112457132">Table 1</xref>). Exclusion criteria were severe acute or chronic conditions, i.e. acute myocardial infarction, but also dementia or an inability to understand or speak Swedish. In total 25 patients were asked to participate and all of them agreed. Within 2 weeks of hospitalisation, the first author called the patient to make an appointment for an interview. The participants were patients with intermittent/persisting or permanent AF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112457132">Table 1</xref>). The median age was 72 years; 16 were men, 19 lived together with a partner and 11 had elementary school as their highest educational level. Time between diagnosis and interview had a mean of 9.4 years (range 1 month to 32 years).</p>

<title>2.3 Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected as semi-structured interviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112457132">24</xref></sup> performed face to face by the first author during September 2009 and June 2010. Due to patient choice, the interviews mainly took place in their homes, but three occurred at the university and one at the hospital. The interviews were based on three open-ended questions constructed by the authors, all with long clinical and methodological experience. The questions asked were: Describe a situation related to AF which influences your well-being. How was the situation handled? Clarify the consequence of the action in the situation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457132">25</xref></sup> These questions were followed by further in-depth questions. Initially, two test interviews with selection based on age, sex and duration of AF (P01, P02; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112457132">Table 1</xref>) were conducted to ensure concordance in line with the study aim. These required no adjustments and were subsequently included in the study. The interviews, which were recorded digitally and lasted between 45 and 120 minutes, were transcribed verbatim.</p>

<sec id="section11-1474515112457132">
<title>2.4 Ethics</title>
<p>The study followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112457132">26</xref></sup> and had permission from the Regional Committee for Human Research, Linkoping University, Sweden (Dnr: M8-09). Participants were given both verbal and written information about the aim of the study, and told that data should be treated confidentially and that participation was voluntary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112457132">
<title>2.5 Data analysis</title>
<p>The interviews were read by the first author several times to obtain a clear picture of the whole. The authors collaborated in the whole analysis process until a negotiated consensus was reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112457132">27</xref></sup> Incidents were subjected to a structural analysis in line with the CIT tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457132">25</xref></sup> With regard to the study aim, the incidents were analysed in their character and content. An example of a critical incident could be a situation where the patient experienced shortness of breath. A total of 152 critical incidents were sorted into a number of meaning units. Comparisons between experience as well as between actions were made in order to find similarities and differences, with the aim of grouping them. These incidents were categorised by experience (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112457132">Table 2</xref>) and actions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112457132">Table 3</xref>) into 22 and 16 sub-categories, respectively. In order to describe the general character, the sub-categories were then divided into four and six categories, respectively. Finally, two main areas emerged for experience and two main areas for actions (25).</p>

<sec id="section14-1474515112457132">
<title>3.1 Discomfort in daily life</title>
<p>This main area described how patients experienced the AF influencing well-being both in a bodily and an existential way, i.e. discomfort in daily life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112457132">Table 2</xref>). Bodily impact consisted of symptoms that reduced capacity and symptoms in general associated with serious conditions, sometimes even with life-threatening conditions. An existential impact was dependent on perceptions of bodily symptoms or earlier experience of AF. Where bodily symptoms were judged as a serious threat to well-being, those gave rise to stress and anxiety. Furthermore, existential anxiety was described as a feeling of impending danger, e.g. an intense fear of the situation. These reactions could be reduced by long and repeated experience of AF. On the other hand, recurring AF and reduced condition gave feelings of hopelessness and existential concerns about the future and that AF seriously injured the heart.</p>
<sec id="section15-1474515112457132">
<title>3.1.1 Bodily impact</title>
<p>Patients experienced AF as uncomfortable, with actual bodily impact, such as severe weakness or dizziness. “I did not do anything; I was totally exhausted anyway” (P03). The sensations of irregular or fast heartbeat, shortness of breath and sometimes pain in the chest were described as very unpleasant and scary. “So it was that halt, and then I lie there waiting for if it will start again, or not start at all” (P04). Patients, both with intermittent and permanent AF, did not always experience any impact. “When it has come and gone, I have had difficulty in feeling the limits of that really” (P07).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1474515112457132">
<title>3.1.2 Existential impact</title>
<p>The bodily symptoms affected patients’ existential well-being in different ways. In their description of existential impact, the patients differed between common sense and emotional response to bodily symptoms. Despite the fact that the patient had received information about AF and understood that the situation in the case of AF was not directly life-threatening, bodily symptoms of AF led to feelings of existential anxiety. This emotional response to AF was experienced as a major influence, difficult to break and handle with palpitations and irregular heartbeat giving anxiety. “I’m afraid that I’m not going to wake up in the morning. It is scary going to bed at night” (P15). The perceptions of AF caused emotional concerns and had an emotional impact on relationships. “Constant worry, which takes energy” (P07). Patients not having permanent AF described an intense emotion of relief when the heartbeat calmed down or the symptoms decelerated. “It is just wonderful when it eases” (P22).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1474515112457132">
<title>3.2 Limitations in daily life</title>
<p>This main area described how patients experienced the AF as raising limitations in daily life (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112457132">Table 2</xref>). Consequences of bodily and existential impact and uncertainty about the future affected patients’ well-being as limitations. The consequences restricted activities and gave concerns about appropriate activities to perform with regard to the AF. Patients’ experiences of AF were difficult to predict and having a lack of knowledge about AF resulted in uncertainty about the future.</p>
<sec id="section18-1474515112457132">
<title>3.2.1 Consequences of impact</title>
<p>Patients experienced limitations because of impaired bodily impact in the form of reduced capacity involving both everyday and leisure activities. “I cannot sing. I just am not able to. This affects all of me” (P18). They described difficulties in accepting the reduced capacity. “I thought it was too early. I was not so old" (P01). Both bodily and existential impact raised not only insecurity about what activities to be exposed to and regard to promote general health, but also the risk of provoking the AF. “I can do more than I dare to” (P08).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1474515112457132">
<title>3.2.2 Uncertainty about the future</title>
<p>Difficulties in predicting AF made patients memorise details in situations related to provocations of AF in order to find some structure in it. They found that distress and exertion influenced the AF, as well as some or too much food and drink. “I feel well from not engaging so much” (P15). “… sometimes it has happened that I have run and then I don’t dare to do it anymore” (P17). “Ehh, because it was all the time connected to what I ate and drank, I thought that it probably was my stomach that started the fibrillation” (P22). The patients were able to identify possible triggers affected to provoke symptoms, but they also had the experience of AF being affected even without these trigger factors. This experience led to becoming unsure about when AF would appear. “Before it came at night. Now it may come at any time” (P05). They experienced hopelessness facing the future and that nothing seemed to cure them. “I was desperate and sad as it lasted and lasted” (P04). Another experience was the lack of knowledge about AF and the capacity to judge it, as well as the insecurity of being at home when not feeling well.“I want to go to the hospital, although they say I can waitat home” (P14).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section20-1474515112457132">
<title>3.3 Self-care related actions</title>
<p>This main area described what actions patients took to prevent and handle their AF by self-care in order to achieve well-being (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112457132">Table 3</xref>). These actions were based on patient experience and perceived severity of AF, from the healthcare and media or from own beliefs on how to maintain well-being. Patients were in a state of readiness that AF would appear. By actions they facilitated, remedied and adapted to their condition as well as made statements about the need for healthcare.</p>
<sec id="section21-1474515112457132">
<title>3.3.1 Patients were in a state of readiness</title>
<p>The AF was difficult to predict, which led to a constant readiness for it to appear. “I drive only short distances with the car, in case it would happen” (P03). To act preventively by avoiding situations associated with earlier provocations of AF became a significant part of life. Through the patient having more experience of AF, more situations associated with the provocation of AF were added which led to more situations being excluded from the patient’s daily life, e.g. to avoid distress, exertion and food and drink. “I was telling my daughter I cannot babysit at night anymore” (P05). Patients were very concerned about how AF impacted the health of their heart. “It concerns me all the time, that the heart beats unevenly and what consequences it will have” (P07).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1474515112457132">
<title>3.3.2 Patients facilitated or remedied their condition</title>
<p>Based on experience, perceptions of symptoms, information and beliefs, patients developed strategies to manage their AF. Patients tried to alter the heartbeat or stop the AF when they felt it by changing body position, resting or relaxation: “by just calming down, going away, breathing calmly and thinking of something else” (P15). When the AF became too distressing, patients handled the situations by adjusting or enduring the bodily and existential impact in order to not ponder and feel it. “You must have something that is distracting. It can be the computer” (P10). Patients handled weakness in activities: “I had to stop and rest” (P25).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1474515112457132">
<title>3.3.3 Patients adapted to the actual condition</title>
<p>Patients adapted to their condition by handling the permanent limitations. “I’m trying to take it in stride” (P04). In addition, patients performed custom activities. “I parked the car in the same building as the shop” (P06). Handling the social situation was to control the next of kin’s anxiety as well as one’s own anxiety and managing uncertainty about when or if the AF would appear. “I try to not talk about it so much now. Only if I feel it several times” (P09).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1474515112457132">
<title>3.3.4 Patients made statements about the need for healthcare</title>
<p>Decisions about whether AF was to be handled individually or demanded health care were grounded in the perceived severity of the AF in the actual situation and past experience of AF. “I stay home with it. They still cannot cure me” (P13). If it was possible in regard to the severity of the AF and time frame for converting, the patients waited at home for the AF to calm down. “ … and I have something so I can check my pulse and blood pressure at home. Sometimes I’ll do that” (P08).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1474515112457132">
<title>3.4 Healthcare related actions</title>
<p>This main area described what actions patients took to prevent and handle the AF after they decided there was a need for health care in order to achieve well-being (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112457132">Table 3</xref>). The patients contacted or visited healthcare personnel immediately when they experienced severity of AF in the actual situation or when they were told to do so by those in health care. They waited to contact healthcare personnel until long-term symptoms if they experienced a lesser severity of AF, felt uncomfortable with the healthcare or were waiting for improvement in well-being.</p>
<sec id="section26-1474515112457132">
<title>3.4.1 Patients contacted healthcare personnel immediately if discomfort appeared</title>
<p>Whether patients went to a healthcare facility immediately or contacted those for support by telephone depended on how the severity of AF in the actual situation was perceived. Also crucial was the information from healthcare personnel and by experience of past provocation of AF. “I feel myself that I cannot wait at home as long as the healthcare services recommend” (P14).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1474515112457132">
<title>3.4.2 Patients contacted healthcare personnel when discomfort persisted</title>
<p>With regard to long-term symptoms, patients usually contacted healthcare personnel for support by telephone. “So that Sunday when I had been like this, sitting in bed sleeping … I phoned the healthcare centre…” (P12). There were patients with more long-term symptoms who visited a healthcare facility as first choice. “I went there in order to find out what it was …” (P09).</p>

<title>4.1 On methods</title>
<p>In a qualitative study researchers consider whether stability can be ensured throughout the research process regarding applicability, concordance, security and accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112457132">28</xref></sup> In this study, applicability was ensured based on the chosen method, i.e. CIT was chosen because of its credibility when focusing on behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112457132">23</xref></sup> With regard to the CIT tradition, the participants were identified based on a strategic sample to ensure variety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref></sup> The participants included were in need of acute cardiac care and were hospitalised due to acute symptoms related to AF, selected with regard to demographical and clinical characteristics, such as sex, age, educational level and civil status, as well as type and duration of AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112457132">24</xref></sup> A plausible limitation of the sample selection was that all participants came from the same healthcare catchment area. However, the findings seem applicable for similar settings but questionable in being applied for patients without acute symptoms of AF. Interviews were considered as being the most appropriate instrument of data collection when using CIT as it allows participants to elaborate their thoughts based on detailed follow-up questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref></sup> As the researchers had experience of AF from a cardiac nursing context, the pre-understanding and reflecting questions minimised the risk of misunderstanding during the interviews. Concordance describes the validity of the design in relation to the aim. Two test interviews were conducted and found to be adequate with the purpose of verifying the validity of the questions. Security was ensured as the data was processed a number of times by the researchers and thoroughly discussed until a negotiated consensus was reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112457132">27</xref></sup> The researchers were aware of the risk of their pre-understanding influencing the study, were attentive during the process of analysis by reflecting together and did not take any findings for granted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457132">25</xref></sup> Concerning the aspect of accuracy, the most controversial part of CIT is the aspect of categorisation, which has been criticised for being both a subjective and difficult process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457132">25</xref></sup> Data can be categorised in more than one way; however, it is always possible to revert to the critical incident.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112457132">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112457132">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112457132">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>4.2 On results</title>
<p>AF results in pronounced limitations on daily life caused by reduced condition and by fear of provoking it. The insecurity that arises when AF is difficult to predict leads to the patients constantly looking for causation for how AF is affected, and out of their experience they develop strategies in order to avoid AF, which are often based on vague suspicions of causation. The difficulty in predicting AF also results in patients living in constant readiness that AF will be provoked, which is also described in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457132">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112457132">19</xref></sup> Patients adapt to current limitations, but this leads to concerns and more long-term emotional effects, for example a feeling of decreased energy and hopelessness.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is that patients find it difficult to share the emotional consequences of AF with their next of kin; instead they withhold feelings in order not to upset others or face their anxiety. The emotional aspects that accompany AF and limitations in daily life may affect the well-being of those next of kin of the patients with AF, which also is shown by Bohnen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112457132">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AF is uncomfortable and patients confirm what was described earlier, including bodily symptoms such as weakness, heartbeat, pressure in the breast and shortness of breath, leading to the patients judging their situation as critical, which in turn causes emotional and existential effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112457132">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112457132">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112457132">30</xref></sup> They also interpret their symptoms more critically than healthcare personnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112457132">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112457132">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112457132">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112457132">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112457132">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112457132">33</xref></sup> In this study the extent of emotional and existential impact is present as independent of time since diagnosis of AF or to the type of AF. The symptoms may differ with regard to clinical characteristics but not in that AF will result in a verity of emotional and existential impact. All of the patients experienced uncertainty and worry about AF progressing, as well as worry that AF, in time, would seriously damage their heart and become life-threatening.</p>
<p>If existential impact of AF arises, these emotions begin to be the prominent factor in the patient’s judgement of the situation; the sense had less meaning in assessment of these situations and in the patient’s choice of action. Existential effect of AF is difficult to handle and difficult to avert, but is mitigated through the patient resting, breathing deeply and relaxing. Patients even used the same actions to stop an AF attack at an early stage or to calm down other bodily symptoms. A further aspect that has previously been described and was significant in this study is the meaning of stress and worry as the primary cause of AF arising; in other words, stress, exertion, food or drink can all provoke AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112457132">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112457132">34</xref></sup> AF can also be provoked even in the absence of these aspects, which creates uncertainty affecting activities but also patients’ entire lives.</p>
<p>It has been previously identified that the presence of emotional impact in the form of uncertainty and stress varies in correlation to both the experience of AF and the frequency of symptoms, with decreased well-being as a consequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112457132">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112457132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112457132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112457132">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112457132">35</xref></sup> The patients’ emotional response to bodily symptoms is an important aspect on the influence of well-being in the case of AF. The patients are left in their self-care to proceed from their own experience and perceived severity to prevent and to handle AF in order to maintain well-being; thus meaningful contributions directed toward these patients are highly demanded. Healthcare personnel need to inquire and observe how AF affects patients’ daily lives both emotionally and from the point of view of what limitations it leads to. The patients need knowledge and practical tools in order to handle the emotional consequences that come with AF.</p>

<title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>AF affects well-being when it is uncomfortable and leads to pronounced limitations in daily life. Patients therefore try to maintain or restore well-being through adapting and developing strategies for self-care proceeding from their experience of AF. In order to enable a good life with preserved well-being for patients with AF, clinical implications to health care are to identify and give importance to how these patients’ daily lives are affected by AF. Moreover, patients need practical tools in order to judge and handle their situation. As the patients are limited in daily life and have difficulty in sharing their experience of AF with those close to them, it is important that continued research discovers how AF affects next of kin.</p>
