<abstract>
<p>The supremacy of fictitious capital together with the contraction of average growth rates and the global economic production system have plunged capitalism into severe crisis. The crisis is not simply a contradiction between real and speculative economies, as these are merely manifestations of the difficulties that confront productive expansion and the valuation of capital. At this point, timid state intervention and exchange rate regulation are insufficient policies to calm the profound crisis being experienced by Europe and the United States. While it may not spell the end of the capitalist system, it does mark depletion of its progressive phase and its capacity to sustain further development of the productive forces. This signifies a contradictory phase of structural stagnation as the planet’s natural resources and ecological systems become incorporated into a massive chain of exploitation, thus redefining the historical context in which the global working class must organize and struggle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Capitalism is a system that evolves and functions in a spiral from contradictions and mutations of rupture and continuity, this is to say, toward its maturity and decadence. These aspects make it dynamic and they condition its processes of production, reproduction, and crisis. Nevertheless, the material base of this process is to be found in the purchase and use of the labor force that capital consumes in production. This can be seen as the central mechanism for producing surplus, which is the basic category that guarantees systemic continuity.</p>
<p>The current crisis being experienced is structural and prolonged. It has resulted from contradictions accumulated during the last three decades which have been exacerbated by the policies of neoliberalism and globalization; that is, by a historical form of production, reproduction, interchange, and consumption of international and state capital founded upon the international division of labor and the entrepreneurial dynamic of market forces.</p>
<p>This capitalist crisis stems from insufficiency in the production of value and surplus. Regardless of what applications of ‘corrective policies’ are made, they are proving unable to overcome it or to prevent the appearance of new difficulties, contradictions, and problems that may gradually grow to be unsolvable. Therefore, it is not merely a ‘real estate crisis’ or a ‘financial’ one, as is often proclaimed by the official circles of political-ideological power in the United States and the European Union and echoed through private and official media. The crisis that unfolded in late 2007 at the core of the capitalist economic system, the United States, and which continued into the next decade, spread throughout 16 countries of the Euro-zone and enveloped Great Britain, Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Latin American countries, especially those such as Mexico – dependent upon the US economy, and Brazil – dependent upon Chinese imports.</p>
<p>The discussion of the characteristics of the accumulation and reproduction of capital at a worldwide scale in the 21st century has yet to be fully developed, particularly with respect to whether it is a long-term or conjunctural phenomenon. This subject corresponds to a phase of capitalism and imperialism that has yet to be defined. There is evidence to suggest tendencies, for example, toward a prevalence of prolonged cycles of recession throughout the world economy along with declining cycles of growth and development. There exist systemic crises to the detriment of structural stability amidst an international ‘fracturing’ process of globalization. This process is an unfinished one that summons protectionism and neo-Keynesianism while it reinforces the power of transnational corporations and its deep imbrication with the strong states of imperialism. These have tended to maintain the influence of speculative activities (of fictitious capital in the Marxian sense) in the face of secular tendencies for the production of value and surplus and, thereby, for the profit rate to fall. All of these tendencies provide rational explanations for the universalization of strategic methods of exploitation of labor. And they provide explanations for the production of absolute and relative surplus in the logic of capital reproduction amidst the struggle to restore the rate of profit that comprises the engine of the whole economic and social system.</p>
<p>What is absolutely clear is that comprehension of the roots of the crisis by the workers and their class organizations must be a central task to better orient their struggles and demands. In this sense, it is possible to glimpse processes and tendencies that appear on the horizon with respect to both the immediate and more distant future. For instance, there is a propensity to experience increasing difficulties for capital’s expansion at a worldwide scale (less production of value and surplus, in spite of the growth of labor productivity via technological development). The most recent forms of organization of the labor process (Toyotism) have become based on a flexible accumulation of capital and on the facilities it obtains from a state’s neo-liberal policies. This imposed flexibility and real pauperization on the world of labor in a legal, systematic manner with relatively few barriers. At the same time, big capital has needed to resort to war as the expression of these difficulties (Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya) in order to control countries, territories, and natural and energy resources by all possible means including through massacres, use of military force, and destruction.</p>
<p>On the geopolitical board of the imperialist map, an essential function developed by US unilateralism used ‘permanent post-global war to reaffirm political-military leadership and inject dynamism into markets, firstly the stock markets, which are entrusted with the role of propagandistic megaphone of economic growth, and subsequently into growth imposed in forced stages according to the capitalist form of production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511419901">Vasapollo, 2007</xref>: 42).</p>
<p>It must be clarified that both the unilateralism of the United States and the postcolonial wars now unfolding were developed in an utterly different historical context. In the past, the economic and political supremacy of the United States went unchallenged. In the present era, the ‘American locomotive’ has proven unable to power and drag the world economy given the evolved dynamics of unbalance and perturbation, including the heavy emphasis on China’s economic power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511419901">Vergopoulos, 2005</xref>: 175). In 1985, the Plaza Accord reached in New York, fostered back then by the recently appointed Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker – who convened a meeting of the so-called G-5 (United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Great Britain) – reminds us of when the first of the aforementioned countries handily imposed its political will on the rest of the world and devalued its currency, with support from the other members of the group, with a view to recovering and promoting its exports. Now this correlation of forces no longer exists, at least not in an environment so favorable for the United States. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to achieve these conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511419901">Vergopoulos (2005)</xref> points to one of the causes of this situation – the growing external deficit of the United States, whose huge external debt has caused a massive and unparalleled contraction of the world economy.</p>
<p>Another disturbing aspect is that the huge American global debt, which leaped from US$2.7 trillion in 1989 to more than US$10 trillion currently (roughly 65% of the US GDP in 2008), will continue to increase in the years to come, as the crisis deepens and the USA bears the expenses of war. This astronomical number is displayed in a gigantic clock located high in New York, near Times Square, which exposes the fantastic 14-digit figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511419901"><italic>La Nación</italic>, 2008</xref>). This results in a paradox: ‘while the prosperity of the United States is maintained, its external position will progressively deteriorate and it will be least capable of exercising the role of economic and monetary stabilizer of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511419901">Vergopoulos, 2005</xref>: 182). Effectively, we have reached a point where the old ‘hegemony’ of American imperialism has made room for an accumulation of dynamic international imbalances and the development of new geo-economic and political blocs in Asia, Europe, and even Latin America, including the creation of the <italic>Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas.</italic></p>

<title>The Crisis and Failed Forecasts from Kondratiev Waves</title>
<p>Several authors have drawn upon the theory of long waves to sketch answers to important issues such as the capitalist crisis and its recovery processes in the medium and long terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511419901">Izquierdo, 1979</xref>). This calls attention to two opposing and undeniable aspects of the global economy: widespread unemployment and the volatility of global financial markets. These twin factors cloud the very best of scenarios and forecasts from international organizations and communications media. The recurrent volatility of the stock market, monetary devaluations, and the course of the crisis along with its duration are all critical issues that defy easy explanation. Given this uncertainty, it is ever more important to reorient the organization and struggle of laborers in relation to state responses and the organized efforts of the capitalist class.</p>
<p>The theory of Kondratiev waves supposes that economies evolve in successive waves lasting for about 25 years each and which recycle at 50. This means that during a complete wave, shorter phases or cycles, booms and busts, have worked as a source of inspiration for many authors. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511419901">Mandel (1979)</xref> discards the structural cyclical character of capitalism in the long term. He speaks instead of ‘long waves’ but for the short term, that is, periods of 5 or 10 years during which one may clearly see its cyclical character. But we must be very careful with the meaning of this conception, especially in current times when in conjunction with the historical laws of capitalism, the centrifugal forces of volatile and speculative financial capital interact. The fact is that all of these forces combine to fracture usable perspectives when it comes to viably determining the possible scenarios for a long expansive wave which has up until now failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Even considering these methodological and analytical limitations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511419901">Mandel (1986</xref>: 92) identifies four long waves divided into two phases, ascending and descending, which span from the late 18th century (1789) until the long depressive wave of the 1970s decade, which as we will see, extended through the first decade of the current century.</p>
<list id="list1-0896920511419901" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In the long wave of 1789–1848, there was an ascending phase between 1789 and 1815–25 and a descending phase between 1826 and 1848.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the following long wave, between 1848 and 1893, there was an ascending phase between 1848 and 1873, and a descending phase between 1873 and 1893.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Between 1893 and 1940 (ascending phase), the peak of imperialism occurred (1893–1913) as well as a descending phase between 1914 and 1940, which covered the great depression in the 1930s, WWI (between 1914 and 1918) and the outbreak of WWII (between 1939 and 1945).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the following wave from 1948 to 1993, there were two periods: the one after WWII until 1967–71 (ascending phase of ‘The Glorious Thirty’) and the last, from 1967–71 to 1993 (a descending phase), which explains the shift from Keynesian policies to the massive application of liberal monetarism and the market forces of global neoliberalism.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419901">Dos Santos (1992</xref>: 117) subsequently identified three phases: the first (between 1979 and 1982) marked by deflationary processes and the fall of inflation rates, which reached an apex with the long-term crisis that had started in the mid-1960s. During the 1983–7 period, the world economy recovered, boosted by the increase in US demand and its growing fiscal deficit. Nevertheless, the author attributes an induced and fictitious character to the ‘recovery’ between 1983 and 1989, essentially due to the manipulation of financial statistics under the Reagan Administration. Finally, the third phase (1987–93), which started with the crack in the stock and financial markets in October 1987, deepened the disinflation, and accelerated the 1990–3 recession.</p>
<p>The 1994 recovery ‘prepared the world economy for a new phase of long-term economic boom, possibly the “A” phase of a Kondratiev cycle of nearly 25 years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511419901">Dos Santos, 1992</xref>: 117). Reaffirming this hypothesis of the advent of a new phase of long-term economic growth of capitalism, Dos Santos adds: ‘for long we have defended the thesis that the beginning of the 1990’s decade will be marked by a violent devaluation of assets, which will devalue the constant capital at a worldwide level, thus allowing for a new and solid period of growth of the world economy; with the introduction of radical innovations through the incorporation of new technologies. It will be the end of the long-term depressive period started in 1967 and the beginning of a new ascending cycle of 25 to 30 years, beginning from the mid-1990’s’ (1992: 117).</p>
<p>In this way, Dos Santos reasons that this last ascending cycle (1994) should extend at least until the year 2024. In reality, however, we have seen the converse. The recessive phase that has extended from its beginnings during the 1974–5 world crisis to the present, has been regenerated throughout the 1980s and 1990s with the liberal and mercantilist policies of big capital and the neoliberal state. In our view, the difficulty lies in the moment when one has to forecast the future of an expansive wave. This seemed to have appeared in the 1994 recovery and generated the premise that capitalism as a world system would experience a wave of economic growth for more than two decades. That premise, however, was not confirmed by the historic facts. The reality was that we witnessed the collapse of stock and financial markets, from the Mexican crisis late in 1994, to Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The crises of Korea (1997), Russia (1998), Argentina (1999–2002), and the United States (2001) all acted to reinforce the depressive phase of Kondratiev. The same is occurring in the current crisis (2007–11), thus revealing the long-term and deepening recessive nature of the world economy.</p>
<p>The current recessive cycle, itself a product of the world crisis in 1974–5, was regenerated by the liberal and mercantilist policies of big capital and the Keynesian state of the 1980s and 1990s. Many theoreticians did not grasp this reality and assumed that the crises in the system were of a conjunctural character. They commonly state that the problem is ‘strictly financial’ and is attributable to difficulties in the prices of the goods (‘deterioration of the terms of exchange’) and of profit rates.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511419901">Xavier Vence (2008</xref>: 20), the decline of the world economy was observable as of the mid-1970s and in particular by the mid-1980s when the economic growth rate averaged half (1.6% annual) of its prior value during the three decades after WWII (3% annual). That is why we should not be surprised that the most developed economies in the world can now only with considerable difficulty manage to surpass single digit growth rates. This can be observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0896920511419901">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Of interest here is the Japanese economy, considered until very recently to be the second most powerful economy on the planet, which in 2008 contracted by 3.2%. In the last quarter of that year, the Japanese economy experienced a free-fall as its GDP contracted by −12.7%. Conversely, the experience of the People’s Republic of China amidst the turmoil of the global economy amounted to 9% growth on average in 2008, this before important collapses of the European Union economies, which accelerated the global recession and crisis. For example, Spain’s economy on average grew only 1.2% in 2008, with a −0.7% reading over the last quarter of the same year, thus confirming its entrance into recession.</p>
<p>Again, we want to emphasize that for workers and their organizations, it is critical to comprehend the environment in which they must defend and struggle for their interests. The fact is these are not favorable moments in terms of economic growth, social policies, and employment, but rather a period of setbacks in employment and wages and the loss of their social and labor rights as expressed in the pauperization of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511419901">Castillo, 2009</xref>). A prolonged stage of recession and crisis invariably pushes capital even harder to demand sacrifices, and this means an increasingly precarious situation for labor and a tendency to extend the rate of exploitation to compensate for losses of value, surplus, and gains won previously by the working class.</p>

<sec id="section3-0896920511419901">
<title>Crisis of Overproduction or Crisis of Accumulation and the Production of Value?</title>
<p>The ‘crisis of overproduction’ and ‘capital over-accumulation’ must be explained by reference to its structural and systemic roots. It is a crisis arising from difficulties and obstacles of every kind (economic, social, technical, and political-ideological) that capital encounters to produce sufficient value and surplus value from the exploitation of the labor force. Revenues must be realized in a manner secure enough to continue with its reproduction and self-valuation ad infinitum.</p>
<p>It may be considered that every capitalist <italic>crisis</italic> is an <italic>overproduction</italic> crisis when the supply is greater than the demand and the consumption capacity of the society is below the stock of existing goods and services. This simple idea was raised by Classical Political Economy in the 19th century. Say’s Law, for example, argues (without ever demonstrating) that supply creates its own demand. The crisis is moreover one of realization of goods and capital as problems develop to realize the surplus created by live labor in the productive processes.</p>
<p>The trajectory of the capitalist mode of production is in a certain manner cyclical because it goes through stages of prosperity, expansion, recession, depression, and crisis. In each of these stages, the state and the policies of capital intervene in order to guarantee their continuous reproduction. But it is important to note the qualitative and spiraling nature, that is, it is an historic structural process of <italic>global</italic> capitalist development that intertwines the collective fate of dependent and underdeveloped countries. In every 10-year cycle, we can see how the duration of the periods of growth and production decrease and how the periods of recession, depression, and crisis increase. Because of this, the current capitalist crisis of the world is essentially one of production of value and surplus. This thesis was delineated by Karl Marx 150 years ago in his <italic>Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie</italic> (<italic>Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy</italic>), and he later developed this thesis in his monumental work <italic>Capital</italic> (<italic>Critique of Political Economy</italic>), developing an epistemological, conceptual, ideological, and political sequence between the two texts. For the first time in these works a materialist theory of capitalist development and its decline was put forth by considering that only human labor, the worker’s labor force, creates value and surplus and accomplishes the valuing of capital. Machines, technologies, instruments, money or land do not create value. Labor and capital are the <italic>antipodes</italic> of historical class society in a mode of production whose dynamic influences other social categories such as culture, traditions, the formation of cities, language, and law.</p>
<p>The capitalist crisis, therefore, was shown to originate from the insufficiency of systemic mechanisms to generate enough value in the labor process, to valuate the invested capital (on means of production, raw materials, labor force or variable capital), to create surplus, and to restitute the growth of the rate of profit. These limitations encouraged a detour into the speculative sphere of financial capital and contribute to the formation of speculative bubbles in other areas such as real estate, energy, and food. The affirmation has its root in three theses exposed in exemplary fashion by Marx and scientific Marxism: (a) labor is the originative phenomenon (<italic>Urphänomen</italic>) of both humanity and social being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511419901">Lukács, 2004</xref>); (b) it is the <italic>only factor</italic> or producer of value, that is, surplus; and (c) that when capital is not in the sphere of production, but only in that of circulation (in the market), it is unproductive. As Marx puts it: ‘This process of realization is at the same time the process of de-realization of labor; labor is objectively placed, but places this objectivity as its own non-being or as the being of its non-being: of capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 415). This is to say, capital denies itself when it goes out of the sphere of its production (which is its oxygen) and enters into the market, into circulation (which is its phlogiston or contrary to oxygenation). Nevertheless, it needs to go through and remain for some time in this state as a condition of its realization to enter again into the production of <italic>new</italic> capital.</p>
<p>Capital displaces the labor force in all industries, services and activities, countries, territories, and regions of the whole world, preferably by means of dismissals and, at the same time, it dislocates toward speculative activities, an aspect proper to <italic>fictitious capital</italic> (i.e. the capital that disconnects, for certain periods, from the sphere of production). Although it is true that both phenomena cause a higher production of products (that is: values of use), in the long run less (exchange) value is progressively created, since the only thing that creates value and surplus for the capital is human labor or the labor force. This lesser disposition of labor force ends up severely punishing the average rate of profit of the system. And this phenomenon becomes more acute because the tendency of capital is ‘… to make human labor (relatively) superfluous, to push it as human labor to excessive limits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 350).</p>
<p>When capital is concentrated in the sphere of circulation (banks, stocks markets, commerce, services) it reaffirms its devaluing, because it creates neither value nor surplus value in these spheres, but only in the sphere of production and of the labor process, which is the space–time where the labor force is articulated with the means of production and with the transformation of the nature to (be able to) produce consumption means and new production means which revitalize the process of capital reproduction at a higher scale. Hence,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… the devaluing becomes an element of the valuing process; what is already implicit in the fact that the product of the process in its direct form is not <italic>value</italic>, but it has to enter once again into circulation to realize itself as such. Therefore, if by means of the production process the capital is reproduced as value and new value, at the same time it is placed as <italic>non-value</italic>, as something that is not <italic>valued as long as it does not enter into interchange</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 355, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Marx, the process of capital valuing also includes the preservation of value (of the means of production, tools, and labor force) and the creation of surplus value.</p>
<p>The <italic>use value</italic> of the labor force – which capital purchases on the market – <italic>produces surplus</italic> (vital for the system) and it is determined by the socially necessary labor time for its production and reproduction. This is to say, this time of necessary social labor is translated into the amount of salary the laborer receives from their work as expressed in an amount of goods and services, and in other factors such as education, housing, health, recreation, and leisure. It is because of this very reason that Marx clarifies ‘the live labor time the capitalist acquires in the exchange is not the exchange value, but the use value of the labor capacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 195). In demonstrating the fallacy of the economist David Ricardo and by extension the whole theoretical tradition of classical political economy, this confusion between use value (the capacity of creating surplus) and exchange value (which is expressed in the amount of money the laborer receives as a wage) Marx clarifies: ‘what the capitalist receives in the exchange is the <italic>capacity of labor</italic>: this is the exchange value that is paid; live labor is the use value which for him has this exchange value and from this use value surplus value arises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 54).</p>
<p>These are simple categories, yet they form the basis of all the confusion in classical and neoclassical political economics which underrates the centrality of labor as creator of value and surplus. The ideologists of capital uselessly search for the origin of value in machines or in commerce and not where it actually resides, in the exploitation of the labor force.</p>
<p>The process of capital valuation contradictorily punishes the value-producing labor. That is, its use value is determined by the time of socially necessary labor for its production and that is expressed in a monetary proportion in the shape of a wage. Indeed, in a shift (see the Fourth Section of <italic>Capital</italic>), the capital compresses the time of socially necessary labor that corresponds to the value of the labor force so as to increase the unremunerated exceeding labor time that represents the surplus of the capitalist.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0896920511419901">Figure 1</xref> exemplifies our statement. The figure shows how the proportional part corresponding to the value of the labor force decreases (line a-b), and how the part corresponding to the exceeding work not paid to the laborer which the capital takes increases (line b-c), without increasing the absolute magnitude of the shift.</p>

</fig>
<p>Nonetheless there is another possibility that consists in prolonging the line (c-d), for instance, so that it reaches 12, 14, 15 or 17 or more hours a day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0896920511419901">Figure 2</xref>). This last alternative was the one approved by the European Union Ministers who sought to prolong the working week to 65 hours. Clearly, this method of <italic>absolute</italic> surplus provokes grave social conflicts with both laborers and capitalists, as well as with the very labor legislation that is theoretically being enforced by the state and embodied in laws, clauses, and everyday regulations. Capital uses this last alternative of prolonging the working week as a last resort when the crisis does not leave any other option open, as occurs in so many countries.</p>

</fig>
<p>A third mechanism frequently utilized is the increase of the <italic>intensity of labor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511419901">Dal Rosso, 2008</xref>) which keeps the work shifts unchanged but intensifies, at the same time, the production of value and surplus value. This last method is closely linked to modern organizational methods, both in the labor process and in the production of merchandise (automobiles, ships, furniture, canneries) based on the Toyotist system of flexible production. <italic>In practice, these mechanisms concur to self-valuate capital</italic>; this is the reason why capital makes use of the scientific-technological revolution (computational, micro-electronic, communicational) in order to increase the productivity of labor and, at the same time, obtain the relative surplus from reducing the time of socially necessary labor which corresponds to the value of the labor force (live labor) and its reproduction (in the schema the line represented by a-b). Nevertheless, in practice the production of (relative) surplus encounters ever increasing difficulties which hamper its growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419901">Alves, 2007</xref>), and the capital system cannot create the sufficient mass of surplus and, therefore, of profits needed to reproduce within a private property economy. This is the essence of the explanation of the crisis. To the extent live labor is reduced over and over (the labor force) by means of dismissals, substitution by machines or any other method, the value produced in society and the absolute mass of surplus which is what finally determines the amount of capitalist profit at the same time becomes reduced. In the medium and long terms, this leads the system to a sheer decline in the average profit rate and results in capital becoming concentrated in the sphere of monetary-financial speculation.</p>
<p>If line a-b is systematically reduced to make it zero (a really absurd situation, but statistically possible), then the capitalist system will collapse like a house of cards since the production of value would cease, a necessary result because the only factor that creates value and surplus is the labor force.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511419901">
<title>Crisis in Labor Time and the Dis-Measure of Value</title>
<p>The ‘labor time’ category, the axis upon which all values and prices of merchandise have been calculated in contemporary capitalism, enters first into tension and then into crisis. Marx’s scientific projection (now valid for the 21st century and for the essential explanation of the contemporary crisis of capital) is that in capitalism, the contradictory struggle between labor time and what we call <italic>dis-measure of value</italic> becomes more acute. In every cycle, the actual increase of the social productivity of labor due, among other factors, to the incessant increment and incorporation of state-of-the-art technology in the labor process, means that ‘labor time’ alone is no longer a sufficient factor to increase surplus value. Consequently, the profit rate tends to decline in the long run, stimulating in the entire system the speculative cycle that accompanies the concentration and centralization of capital. The result becomes constant financial, monetary and real-estate crises such as those taking place in the US over recent years. Socially necessary labor time grows less every day because of the displacement of the labor force by machines, technology, and raw materials which, as we said, do not create value, and thereby surplus, but instead transfer it to the final product. The relative surplus that the laborer creates with the help from machines is thereby reduced.</p>
<p>Marx formulates this statement in <italic>Grundrisse</italic> in the following terms:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The larger the surplus value of capital before the increase of productive force, the larger the amount of presupposed surplus labor or surplus value of capital; or, the smaller the fractional part of the working day which forms the equivalent of the worker, which expresses necessary labor, the smaller is the increase in surplus value which capital obtains from the increase of productive force. Its surplus value rises, but in an ever smaller relation to the development of the productive force. Thus the more developed capital already is, the more surplus labor it has created, the more terribly must it develop the productive force in order to realize itself in only smaller proportion, i.e. to add surplus value – because its barrier always remains the relation between the fractional part of the day which expresses necessary labor, and the entire working day. It can move only within these boundaries. The smaller already the fractional part falling to necessary labor, the greater the surplus labor, the less can any increase in productive force perceptibly diminish necessary labor; since the denominator has grown enormously. The self-realization of capital becomes more difficult to the extent that it has already been realized. The increase of productive force would become irrelevant to capital; realization itself would become irrelevant, because its proportions have become minimal, and it would have ceased to be capital.… But this happens not because wages have increased or the share of labor in the product, but because it has already fallen so low, regarded in its relation to the product of labor or to the living workday. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx, 1980</xref>: 283–284)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Let us reiterate this prophetic affirmation of Marx: ‘The increment in productive forces will become indifferent for capital’ since the more capital revolutionizes its production and transportation capacities, as well as science and technology applied to its productive and labor processes, it will increasingly fail to significantly increase surplus value, an issue that places the system on the brink of a dangerous road to stagnation and recession.’</p>
<p>Based on this insight, the hypothesis we advance is the following: regardless of the increase in productivity, the development of the technological revolution and the ‘savings in labor force’ (unemployment, industrial reservoir army, destruction of productive employments, etc.), the reduction of socially necessary time required to produce merchandise and labor force becomes increasingly difficult and marginal; this is increasingly insignificant for value and surplus value, even though the general volume of physical wealth progressively grows (use values), it nonetheless exhibits a contained value that is every day lower.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920511419901">
<title>Recovery from the Crisis</title>
<p>The alternatives for capital in the face of the crisis remain various and this is not the last crisis despite its severity and spectacular scope. There is no basis to argue a terminal crisis of the system at this time. The social metabolism of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511419901">Mészáros, 2001</xref>) contains devices to regenerate itself and self-valuate. We call attention to two important tendencies: the imperial war and the generalization of the socioeconomic regime of super-exploitation of labor as immediate ‘exits’ for the crisis, which might reset the rate of economic growth of the capitalist system, albeit in an infinitely lesser proportion to that reached during previous recoveries.</p>
<p>Starting from the 1980s, when the stabilizing strategies of neoliberalism and financial capital took over, the modern capitalist crises are more than ever before associated with the restructuring of capital and the world of labor (in relation to wages, retirements, employment, organization in the labor process, union formation, qualification, and training, as well as the industrial reserve army), so as to adequate them to the logic and functioning conditions of the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511419901">Alves, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511419901">Sotelo, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511419901">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511419901">2010</xref>). In this framework, we saw a strategic role taken by the state and capital policies aimed at stimulating the growth of the rate of profit, counteracting the tendencies towards braking the pace of accumulation, and favoring the process of restructuration and deregulation of the labor force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511419901">O’Connor, 1987</xref>). Nevertheless, the policies of industrial reconversion and adjustment of the economies to the technical and marketing requirements of the market and transnational corporations in the 1980s and 1990s definitely turned out to have been insufficient to ‘solve’ the crisis.</p>
<p>In the present era, the accumulation of capital values more highly the production of primary products for exportation (agriculture, energy, and minerals), as well as biofuels. Given this fact, the conditions for economic growth imposed by international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, OCDE, and IADB depend on the level reached by the productive specialization in each national economy – in the framework of the new international division of labor – and on the capacity to export natural resources and basic products (formerly consumed by the population). We saw this occur in the Southern Cone countries (e.g. Argentina, where complex merchandise of high technological added value resulted from the process of industrialization) as repeatedly stated by authors of ECLAC.</p>
<p>In the political-juridical and social sphere, the profile corresponding to this reproduction pattern is expressed, from our viewpoint, in the management of significant changes in the state, which shifts from a ‘social welfare state’ to one blatantly <italic>neoliberal</italic>, <italic>minimalist</italic>, and <italic>entrepreneurial</italic>. This is to say, a bourgeois state obsessed with security that criminalizes social struggles and the defense of human rights, such as the right to employment and health. This is a model that is spreading with much force around the world and serves to legalize the policies of big capital in economic, social, and environmental matters, increasingly promoting the commodification of all things. Obviously we can see in the imposition and functioning of this sort of state by the use of force the generalization of systems that exclude the population from the minimal means vital to subsistence, much less any active participation in the matters of government. It is a permanent national security and counterinsurgency state founded on what the Brazilian author <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511419901">Ruy Mauro Marini (1973)</xref> referred to as the ‘fourth branch’ of state power, capable of revitalizing itself in the advanced capitalist countries and with even greater force in the dependent and underdeveloped countries on their periphery.</p>
<p>The contemporary capitalist state is substantially more functional and organic for the reproduction of capitalism in this neoliberal and conservative phase and completely incapable of providing for the requirements of the labor force and the growing needs of the large majorities of people for food, health, education, housing, and leisure. We do not have to look very far to verify that this situation has created a virulent form of capitalism. In the wake of the energy, financial, and real-estate crisis in the United States, we have seen its extension to the countries of southern Europe, who are now trying to ‘fix it’ by means of the expropriation of the rights and guarantees of laborers. This points to social and labor reforms that tend to increase the super-exploitation of labor all around the world, particularly pauperizing labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511419901">Castillo, 2009</xref>), decreasing retirement pensions, incomes, and wages of the laborers, and intensifying the intensity and prolongation of work shifts.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, the crisis and the depletion of the old reproduction pattern from the mid-1970s and the advent of a new pattern from the 1980s onwards are explained by an asynchrony between what Marx called the <italic>structure</italic> and the categories corresponding to the superstructure. Wrongly, or maybe because of myopia, the critics of Marxism took it literally, thus overlooking its metaphoric, critical, qualitative dimension, and of course its methodological capacity to imagine the paths of scientific research which move from the abstract to the concrete and back to the abstract in providing a perspective of multiple reactions and interrelations of global and dynamic character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511419901">Marx, 1973</xref>: 182). This historic totality and global vision enables qualifying the crisis as proper to the integrity of capitalism and not merely to one of their parts such as a ‘financial or real-estate crisis’.</p>
<p>Two and a half decades of worldwide and vernacular neoliberalism is the critical history of this contradiction between the old way of life, of production and capitalist labor which refuses to die (the old welfare state: developmentalist, industrializing, and Fordist, as born in Europe and the United States and later exported to Latin America), and an alleged new, neoliberal, global, aggressive, excluding, polarizing anti-industrializing way that grows stronger at any cost, even with the repression of the popular movements opposed to it anywhere in the world. It was from this logic that early in the 1980s with support from neoliberal governments (Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the United States), neoliberalism privatized the economic and social system so as to adapt it to the needs of accumulation and reproduction of the capital of the Western developed countries.</p>
<p>In the logic of capital’s development and the implementation by the state of neoliberal policies based on the market, an expansion of powerful transnational corporations was verified. Such an expansion was spurred by the states of the dependent and underdeveloped countries, as well as by the governments of the United States, the European Union, and Japan, in pursuit of a predominantly financial globalization and a fostering of the formal processes of democratization. The whole package was presented to public opinion as ‘universal and social justice values’, together with proclamations such as respect for ‘human rights’. This reinforced the cohesion of capital at the industrial, commercial, rentier, banking, financial, fictitious, and ideological levels and built a one-dimensional, mystic, and mythological image of the globalization of transnational power.</p>
<p>Part of the working class and their trade unions around the world believed this ‘theoretical fiction’ which in time proved to be evidently false (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511419901">Antunes, 2005</xref>). This included the ideological formulas of the ‘end of history and labor’ by authors such as Fukuyama and Bell, the boom messages of the ‘new economy’, and the famous ‘Washington consensus’ which spread the subliminal message that the system was ‘all-powerful’ with no social or political forces ever able to overcome it. Ironically, all of this occurred in a context where capital was assuming a global configuration under the parasitic form of fictitious capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511419901">Chesnais, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511419901">Harvey, 2004</xref>), that is, the rise to supremacy of a 21st-century capitalism that severely punishes the productive systems and the growth rate of productive employment.</p>
<p>Fictitious capital (which creates neither value nor surplus) linked to the contraction of the average growth rates of the productive and economic system effectively sank global capitalism into its most severe crisis ever, one which we continue to experience. Let us recall the recovery factors of capital’s profitability that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511419901">Marx (1980</xref>: 232–239) famously states concerning the law of the diminishing tendency of the profit share, that is, ‘causes which counteract the law’:</p>
<list id="list2-0896920511419901" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Increase in the degree of labor exploitation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduction of the wage below its value (over-exploitation).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cheapening of the elements that compose constant capital (machines, raw materials, premises).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase in unemployment and sub-employment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Broadening of foreign trade in the world market.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increase of capital-actions (fictitious capital).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Not only have these mechanisms been utilized to counteract the fall of the rate of profit but they have also been refined and combined together with new ones, such as the spectacular development of speculative financial capital (fictitious capital), the transnational dynamic of the multinational corporations, the generalization and universalization of the over-exploitation of labor and of the law of value (globalization), the use of new methods of production and organization of labor sheltered by informational and technological developments, as well as the direction that the neoliberal state imprints on its public policies in favor of private profitability and the expansion of capital.</p>
<p>On the other side, we have the development of new methods of exploitation and organization of labor, such as the Toyotism of Japanese origin that has as an axis the intensification of labor and management by stress in order to increase relative surplus. Lastly, the third element of the super-exploitation of labor, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511419901">Marini (1973)</xref> exposes in <italic>Dialectic of Dependency</italic> and which constitutes a specific regime of exploitation, is the reduction of the workers’ consumption fund and its conversion into a source of accumulation of capital. This last situation presupposes the suppression of wages below the real average value of labor force – a phenomenon that is now appearing throughout the global system of capitalism.</p>
<p>The regime of super-exploitation of labor as a category that constitutes dependent capitalism, historically developed between 1850 and 1982 in the context of global capitalism, has now become generalized in the very core of developed countries, and from there operates as a containment mechanism for the crisis and the problems of reproduction and profitability. As we have stated above, the ‘real estate and financial crises’ are in that context merely manifestations of the profound mutations and adjustments taking place in the world of labor and capitalist exploitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0896920511419901" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The capitalist crisis does not arise out of a contradiction between real and speculative economies as formally presented by the media and many experts in the field. In reality, the crisis emerges in one sense from growing fictitious capital which in its full plenitude and sequel of bankrupting companies, banks, enterprises, production system closings (such as in the automotive industry), financial and real estate problems, and insolvency claims (which are as real as the fall of profit rates for entrepreneurs) amount to only manifestations of the difficulties, obstacles, and problems that take place in the productive dimension and the valuation of capital. This is the foundation from which new contradictions continually emerge as governments try to manage them by resorting to monetary measures or by controlling public deficits in order to subsidize enterprises and companies.</p>
<p>Measures such as the timid intervention of the state in the economy and regulation of exchange rates are insufficient in the face of the profound crisis being experience by the United States and the European capitalist emporium. These measures are not able to find a way to afford capitalism without making its contradictions even more acute and so they precipitate new escalations of inflation and unemployment. <italic>Although this does not spell the end of the capitalist system as some have alleged, we believe it is the prelude to the depletion of the progressive phase of capitalism as a mode of production and systemic development of productive forces. It marks the beginning of a new phase tending to structural stagnation, one much more destructive and contradictory than seen up until now, as it incorporates natural resources, the environment and the ecological systems of the planet into a massive chain of exploitation to produce merchandise and services</italic>. This is the only way the system seems able to continue until a new cycle of contradictions and uncertainties arises.</p>
<p>In the past, advancing capitalism nourished efficacious devices such as Fordism and Taylorism that with the consolidation and expansion of the welfare state managed to experience the most successful period of its history. By the 1970s, it nevertheless entered into crisis and greeted the arrival of neoliberalism which in popular jargon means a set of entrepreneurial policies, regulation, and practices founded on market forces and an exacerbated and ferocious individualism which submitted society and workers to the empire of unbridled competition, social inequality, and political defeat. The preferred path included the destruction of the welfare state in conjunction with the development of science and technology applied to the productive and labor processes, symbolized by a more flexible Toyotist social organization of production.</p>
<p>In neoliberalism, the central cultural element of these new forms of social relations of production and organization of labor has been the appropriation of the subjectivity of labor (the knowledge and know-how of the workers) and its intensification. In the face of the limits marked by Taylorism and Fordism, the appropriation of the collective laborers’ knowledge is essential in order to subordinate it, codify it, and privilege it in the production of value and surplus. When intensity and policies to extend the workweek become elements privileged by capital to reduce the costs of production and increase profits, these represent, as we argued earlier, moments of anti-valuation because they do not produce additional surplus value.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, both procedures (the appropriation of knowledge and intensity which are constituents of the production and organization system of Toyotist labor) have been utilized in the attempt to overcome the crisis of labor time and the dis-measure of value as elements of the modern social metabolism of capital. <italic>Just-in-time</italic> systems, <italic>work teams</italic>, <italic>total quality programs</italic>, and the <italic>Kanban</italic> system are typical devices of the new pattern of flexible accumulation of capital, which once again are in crisis. It is from this point that we can see unfolding a new restructuring of labor and capital which is required to deepen the Toyotist system and at the same time generalize the super-exploitation of labor, even in the economies and productive processes of the core countries.</p>
<p>The crisis of labor time, derived from the development of productive forces and the endless increase in the productivity of labor, made surplus labor and over-exploitation insufficient to alleviate the crisis and to secure a growing accumulation scale. It now guarantees, at least for capital, a recovery of the average rate of profit at a worldwide level, and then reasonable levels of profitability for individual capitalists, by enterprise, branch, and sector. This is the thermometer that measures the development and health of the system, put into practice either in the public or private sector policies. Upon this measurement depend the other coordinates of the system and society: employment, wages, retirement pensions, public and social expenditure, industrial, credit and banking policies, and social development programs.</p>
<p>It is in this overall context that the organizations and struggles of the global working class must develop, that is, a rigid market neoliberalism in crisis without durable alternatives from the state and capital. It is a scenario that places mankind at considerable risk of entering into a destructive phase characterized by violence and irrationality. But the present conjuncture in the crisis of the capitalist mode of production opens new horizons and a variety of possibilities for laborers and emancipation movements around the planet. By beginning to discuss them and to understand the possibilities that exist for capital to seek to survive its historic crisis is to illuminate the basis for strategies for workers and society as a whole, to pursue a process that can prevent savagery from imposing itself once again.</p>
