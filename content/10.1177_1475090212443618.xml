<p><bold>In honour of Professor Yousheng Wu</bold></p>
<p>In May 1985, Yousheng came to Tsinghua University to recruit MSc students for the postgraduate school of China Ship Scientific Research Center (CSSRC). He gave a speech to introduce the research capabilities and activities at the Center and I was greatly impressed by his manner and his intelligence. I then made the decision to follow him and carry out further study at CSSRC. This first impression totally formed my later life and, under his guidance and arrangement, I am able to come to this level. About two months after I started my MSc studies, CSSRC had a vacancy from the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) to choose one candidate to study a PhD course in the UK, and Yousheng recommended me to take this opportunity. In 1992, when I was doing post-doctorate research in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, University of Bristol, he invited me to return to CSSRC. In early 1993, I rejoined CSSRC and transferred my academic work to the field of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. Under his leadership, I became gradually familiar with this new area of research. Since then my work has been closely tied to Yousheng. He is my guide and one of my most respected scholars. As one of his former students, I feel very privileged to be associated with Yousheng and I am honored to be invited to prepare this Special Issue published in <italic>Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part M: Journal of Engineering for the Maritime Environment</italic> (<italic>JEME</italic>), that recognizes and celebrates Yousheng’s 70th birthday and his achievements.</p>
<p>Yousheng graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1964 with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering Mechanics and from Tsinghua University in 1967 with a master’s degree in Solid Mechanics. After graduation he worked in the China Ship Scientific Research Center in the field of structural dynamics and fluid-structure interactions of ships. He made original contributions in developing the prediction and measurement techniques of shock responses of ship structures and onboard equipment induced by explosion under water or in the air, and design criteria to improve the endurance of ship structures against non-contact explosions. During his research work Yousheng paid great attention to the progress of research regarding fluid–structure interaction problems in the world, among which was work initiated by the late Richard (Dick) E. D. Bishop and his group in the late 1970s associated with the term ‘hydroelasticity’.</p>
<p>In 1980, Professor Bishop and Dr Geraint Price were invited by the late Professor Gu Maoxiang, Director of CSSRC, to deliver several lectures on ‘Hydroelasticity of Ships’ in Wuxi. Yousheng acted as their interpreter at these lectures. During this visit, Professor Bishop made a good impression on Yousheng. Knowing that Yousheng was going to America, sponsored by the Chinese government, as visiting scholar to study the fluid–structure interaction problems for two years, Professor Bishop invited him to move to the UK. During the period of 1981–1984, Yousheng had the opportunity to work in Professor Bishop and Dr Price’s group where, under the enthusiastic encouragement and constant support of Dick and Geraint, he concentrated on the work that interested him and successfully extended the concept of original two-dimensional hydroelasticity theory to produce the three-dimensional theory and the numerical method. This was described in his famous thesis <italic>Hydroelasticity of Floating Bodies</italic>.</p>
<p>Yousheng returned to CSSRC in 1984. He took on the roles of Associate Technical Director, Technical Director, Deputy Director and Director of CSSRC successively until 1998, after which he became the Honorary Director of CSSRC. During this time he actively directed and guided the research work of the institute in the wide field of engineering. He was also a member of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China (1999–2003). These duties did not stop him continuing to work independently and leading a group devoted to innovative and systematic research on various problems related to hydroelasticity of marine structures. These include the second-order non-linear 3D hydroelasticity theories, the linear 3D hydroelasticity theory in acoustic medium, the 2D hydroelasticity theory in viscous fluid, the linear 3D hydroelasticity theory with time domain Green function, the 3D hydroelastic analysis with forward speed effect, and the experimental technique of flexible ship models. He has made a particular effort in extending applications of hydroelastic analysis methods in the design of ships. One example is the extensive hydroelastic analyses of loads, strength, vibration and noise radiation of an Ocean-Survey SWATH ship with the displacement of 1500 t in the design and manufacturing stage. He was the Chief Designer of this ship, which is now in operation with excellent performance in the China Sea. He has also contributed to the development of vibration and noise control technology of ships, and structural monitoring techniques of offshore structures. In recent years he has initiated research work on the deep sea space station for future exploration of ocean resources.</p>
<p>Yousheng has authored more than 170 papers and edited four books. The quality and innovative aspects of his research work, and the great contributions to engineering applications made by his research group, were recognized when he, together with his colleagues, received ten awards for technical progress and achievements from the state and ministries. In 1994, when the Chinese Academy of Engineering was founded, he was elected the academician, one of the youngest individuals to be awarded this position at the time.</p>
<p>Although Yousheng’s research covered a wide range of areas from quasi-static response to dynamical response, theoretical research to practical design, and technical research on a specialized subject to the overall strategy of government planning in the field of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, this workshop is limited to the scope of hydroelasticity. Due to the time limit (a one-day workshop) and space limit (one issue of the Journal), only a few good friends and colleagues were invited to make presentations at the workshop and these papers are published in this Special Issue.</p>
<p>In the previous Special Issue (<italic>JEME</italic> vol. 223, no. 3) dedicated to Professor William Geraint Price on the same subject, an overview of the theoretical development in hydroelasticity was given and the papers in this Special Issue seem to be more application based. Five papers by Pandeli Temarel and co-workers, Faltinsen and Shao, Jorgen Juncher Jensen et al., Xiao-bo Chen and Sime Malenica, Yousheng Wu and co-workers are all dedicated to ship problems, while two papers by Takeshi Kinoshita et al. and M. K. Kobayashi et al. are dedicated to elastic net sheets and water-borne debris respectively. Professor Rodney Eatock Taylor discusses the transient responses of floating beams and the role of radiation damping.</p>
<p>I am most grateful to all contributors for their support and hard work in producing this issue of high-quality papers. They represent the current state of the art in the field of hydroelasticity theory and application. The papers in this Special Issue, together with those in another Special Issue (<italic>JEME</italic> vol. 223, no. 3), provide a succinct overview of current research and indicate the many challenges remaining in order to increase the accuracy of numerical predictions and to enhance the applications for improving behaviors and safety of ships and marine structures.</p>
