<p>The effectiveness of ministerial training continues to be critical due to the growing need for more professional and capable ministers. This collection of essays seeks to support and direct those involved in training lay and ordained ministers; especially, for the Church of England. The experience and knowledge of the authors offer readers a worthy introduction to the challenges in ministerial formation, providing both theological reflection and practical suggestions.</p>
<p>The essays are arranged thematically into three sections, with an additional section focused on the practicalities of money, law and meetings. The first section centers on the person of the minister, discussing the confidence found in God’s calling, the importance of friendship, and the creative formation of the minister. Though each essay is limited due to length, the authors provide many valuable insights for ministers. For example, Andrew D. Mayes describes a healthy, holistic approach to ministerial formation by exploring four aspects of formation: being formed by the Word, worship, woundedness, and wonder.</p>
<p>The second section addresses the critical relationship between the trainer and minister in training, including the issues of developing openness in the relationship, use of questions in mentoring, and the value of reflection and critical conversation. Roger Matthews’ essay offers an outstanding biblical and historical foundation for the use of questions in training, as well as numerous methods for asking good questions. Stuart Burns writes a solid introduction to reflection and critical conversation, but it is lacking in practical suggestions likely due to length restrictions.</p>
<p>The third section explores the ministry practices of time management, enabling others in ministry, and the preaching ministry. Stephen Cherry’s essay provides an intriguing idea, arguing more time management is not the answer to the busyness and burnout of ministry. He offers a superb solution: time wisdom. Time wisdom is ‘the combination of skills, habits, insights and qualities that lies behind effective use of time by those in ministry…’ (p. 102). Time wise ministers see time not only as linear, but also are in tune with the rhythms of life. In addition, the essay on preaching is very helpful offering numerous practical ideas to enhance this skill.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth “miscellaneous” section of essays covers some basic administrative issues; however, they seem a little random in view of the previous three sections. The essay on law demonstrates the importance of ministers having a foundational knowledge of church polity and governance, yet this discussion is limited to the context of the Church of England.</p>
<p>This book is a worthy read for those involved in ministerial training. It provides a great introduction to many critical ministerial development issues, and prompts the reader to research these issues further.</p>
