<abstract>
<p>The study assesses the effect of social and emotional learning (SEL) integrated in a literature class, named here “affective teaching,” as compared to conventional teaching. Dependent variables include relationships, behavior, motivation to learn, and content knowledge. Participants were 36 teacher trainees in one college in Israel and 1,137 fifth and sixth grade students from 36 classrooms in 12 schools. A hierarchical model of analyses (Mixed Models) was used to assess children’s gains in the two teaching conditions. Results indicated significantly more improvement on all measures for children in the affective teaching condition compared to control. Relationships and behavior were significantly associated with children’s gains in motivation and content knowledge. The discussion focuses on the importance of SEL for children’s development and the potential contribution of affective teaching as a modality of social and emotional learning.</p>

<body>
<p>In light of the increased association found among emotional abilities, social climate, and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212441359">Elias, Zins, Graczyk, &amp; Weissberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212441359">Zins, Elias, &amp; Greenberg, 2007</xref>), social and emotional learning (SEL) programs have been more widely implemented in K–12 education over the past decade. SEL programs are usually delivered in segregated sessions but can also be integrated into content teaching. In this article, we present SEL embedded within literature teaching, which we refer to as “affective teaching.” The study was designed to assess the impact of SEL delivered through affective teaching on relationships, motivation to learn, and content knowledge, as compared to conventional teaching.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002831212441359">
<title>What Is SEL?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212441359">Elias et al. (1997)</xref> defined SEL as the process of acquiring core competencies to recognize and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, establish and maintain positive relationships, make responsible decisions, and handle interpersonal situations constructively. Others have suggested that the goals of SEL programs are to foster the development of five interrelated sets of cognitive, affective, and behavioral competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationships skills, and responsible decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212441359">Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, 2005</xref>). These competencies, in turn, should provide a foundation for better adjustment and academic performance, more positive social behavior, and fewer conduct problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212441359">Greenberg et al., 2003</xref>). SEL programs also increase social and emotional development through establishing a safe and caring learning environment in which children are actively engaged in classroom and school life. Together, these promote personal and environmental outcomes that help students to better cope with school demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0002831212441359">
<title>SEL, Relationships, and Academic Performance</title>
<p>Discipline problems, poor interpersonal relationships, and poor academic achievement are interrelated. “Students typically do not learn alone but rather in collaboration with their teachers, in company with their peers, and with encouragement of their families” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnicki, Taylor, &amp; Schellinger, 2011</xref>, p. 405). Emotional competences help students pay more attention in the classroom, assist them in coping with learning difficulties, guide them in establishing proper goals, and are associated with academic achievements and performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212441359">Zeidner, Matthews, &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>, for a review). Classroom social climate is also associated with academic achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212441359">Elias et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212441359">Zins et al., 2007</xref>). Emotional and cognitive growth among children can be attained only in a supportive climate in which they feel respected and validated by peers and teachers alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831212441359">Zins &amp; Elias, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The evaluation of school-based SEL programs is in general positive. Research indicates that SEL programs enhance students’ connection to school, improve classroom behavior, and increase academic achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212441359">Zins, Bloodworth, Weissberg, &amp; Walberg, 2004</xref>). Moreover, they enhance youth development and general mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831212441359">Durlak &amp; Wells, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, they have been found effective in reducing negative behavior and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212441359">Shechtman &amp; Ifargan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831212441359">Wilson &amp; Lipsey, 2007</xref>). In a most recent meta-analysis of school based interventions including 213 schools and 270,034 students of various age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak and colleagues (2011)</xref> showed that compared to controls, SEL participants demonstrated significantly improved social and emotional skills, attitudes, behavior, and academic performance.</p>
<p>Another important finding of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak et al. (2011)</xref> study is that classroom teachers and other school personnel effectively conducted SEL programs. This result suggests that SEL interventions can be incorporated into routine educational practices. However, most of the SEL programs were delivered in segregated educational sessions. An alternative way to teach social and emotional skills would be through subject matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212441359">Zeidner et al., 2009</xref>) as an integral component of the content learned. Such learning comes naturally with many of the liberal arts, such as literature. Children identify with the characters presented, grow to better understand their difficulties, and eventually develop understanding of classmates and develop insight into their own feelings and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212441359">Shechtman, 2010</xref>). In the current study we offer SEL incorporated in a literature class, expecting to achieve academic improvement, positive relationships, and a classroom with minimal discipline problems.</p>

<title>SEL and Affective Teaching</title>
<p>SEL incorporated in a teaching unit requires a special way of teaching named here “affective teaching.” It is rooted in the three levels of teaching developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212441359">Harmin, Kirschenbaum, and Simon (1973)</xref>: the informative, conceptual, and valuing levels. The informative level is composed of facts and knowledge, while the conceptual level entails a higher abstract thinking that integrates these facts and simple information into broad concepts and understanding. Affective teaching builds on these two levels of teaching by adding a third valuing level, which focuses on SEL. On this level, children relate the facts and concepts they have learned to their social and emotional lives, trying to make meaning of the knowledge they have gained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212441359">Ashcraft, Treadwell, &amp; Krishna Kumar, 2008</xref>). Such teaching integrates cognitive understanding, emotional engagement, and behavior and makes teaching materials relevant to students’ lives.</p>
<p>Affective teaching has its origins in humanistic theory. Humanistic education relates to the child as the center of effort; treats the child as a whole entity, including cognition, emotion, and behavior; and considers the human climate as highly important for the child’s development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212441359">Rogers, 1989</xref>). The basic conditions of love, acceptance, reassurance, trust, and autonomy, which are necessary for a child’s healthy development at home, are also needed in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212441359">Aviezer, Sagi, Resnick, &amp; Gini, 2002</xref>). Humanistic education is, of course, learner centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212441359">Lambert &amp; McCombs, 1998</xref>) because it takes account of cognitive and emotional individual differences, requires personalized teaching to make it relevant to the learner, and builds on active and inquiry processes of learning (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212441359">Dewey, 1963</xref>). However, affective teaching is also unique in its focus on the valuing process. The valuing process requires that learners explore their thoughts, feelings, and experiences because, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212441359">Rogers (1989)</xref>, “[i]ndividuals who are thus in touch with their experiences come to value such directions as sincerity, independence, self-direction, self-knowledge, social responsibility, and loving interpersonal relationships” (p. 221). Thus, valuing means social and emotional inquiry, which contributes not only to self-growth but also to positive relationships. As a result, students’ motivation to learn increases and academic achievement improves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831212441359">Jennings &amp; Greenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831212441359">Zins &amp; Elias, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, one can teach a poem, such as “Joey” by Shel Silverstein, on the three levels, as follows. Children first read the poem and learn the main text and vocabulary: Joey knocked down the sun with a stone and the world became dark immediately, and there was no way to correct it. This is then conceptualized through the understanding that it is sometimes hard to envision the consequences of an impulsive act; therefore, caution is needed in acting out behavior. The valuing level is added by referring this to the children’s lives, asking about similar experiences of losing control and feeling regret. It is also possible to discuss anger and how children can identify it before acting impulsively. Such a discussion not only vitalizes the material but also creates intimacy through shared feelings and experiences, thus enhancing group cohesion and a positive climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212441359">Shechtman, 2007</xref>). Moreover, it bridges the gap between teacher and student, helping teachers see the uniqueness of each child, which eventually leads to greater teacher support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831212441359">Shechtman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated in the review of the literature, positive outcomes of SEL programs are evident. Less is known of SEL integrated within teaching subject matter, named here “affective teaching.” We know of only one study that compared affective and conventional teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212441359">Shechtman &amp; Leichtentritt, 2004</xref>). The study involved 52 graduate students who in the course of their internship each taught a class of special education children. They delivered two consecutive units to the same class—a conventional unit followed by an affective one. All sessions were transcribed by an independent observer and then analyzed for children’s positive and negative behavior. Results indicated a significant and impressive reduction in negative behavior and an increase in positive behavior in the affective teaching unit compared to the conventional one.</p>

<sec id="section4-0002831212441359">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study is an extension of the above. In this study, regular classrooms (rather than special education classrooms) were randomly divided into experimental (affective teaching) and control (conventional teaching) conditions, and lessons in Arabic literature were taught by two different sets of teacher trainees, each trained in one of the teaching methods. Moreover, additional variables of classroom behavior were tested, including classroom climate, group cohesion, motivation to learn, content knowledge, teacher self-efficacy, and the relationships among them.</p>
<p>Based on the literature, we formulated the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0002831212441359" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>More favorable outcomes on all variables (knowledge, motivation, classroom climate-total and the subscales of relationship and system maintenance, and group cohesion) will be found for children in the affective teaching condition (experimental) than the conventional teaching condition (control).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Climate, cohesion, and behavior will predict outcomes (content knowledge and motivation to learn) so that a more positive climate, higher cohesion, and more positive and less negative behavior will be related to gains in content knowledge and motivation to learn.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0002831212441359">
<title>Population</title>
<p>The study included a convenience sample of 36 teacher trainees in one college in Israel and the Arab students they taught. The former were all female second-year students in training, with an age range of 19–20, and the latter included 1,137 fifth and sixth graders from 36 classes in 12 Arab schools. Each school had at least one experimental and one control class (seven schools had one class of each type of teaching, four schools had two classes of each type, and one school had three classes of each type). It should be noted that the Arab population in Israel is unique in several ways: It is mostly a rural population that is characterized as a collectivistic society, in which exposure to emotions is somewhat inhibited by the culture and exposure to SEL programs is quite uncommon.</p>
<p>In each of the schools, 57–177 children participated in the study (<italic>M</italic> = 94.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 40.75), with 25–38 students per class (<italic>M</italic> = 31.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.84). There were 689 fifth graders in 22 of the classrooms (61%) and 448 sixth graders in the remaining 14 classrooms. Of all the children, 558 (49.1%) were boys—48% of the fifth graders and 51% of the sixth graders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0002831212441359">
<title>The Intervention</title>
<p>The content of the lessons was identical in both types of teaching. It comprised a unit of six literature sessions, using a different piece of literature in each 45-minute session. The literature was taken from national curricular programs for the fifth and sixth grades. Trainees in the conventional teaching condition taught on the informational and conceptual levels. Trainees in the affective teaching condition added the valuing level, which accounted for about one third of each lesson. The following exemplifies the two versions of the lessons.</p>
<p>One lesson focused on Aesop’s story “The Fox and the Crow.” The content involves a fox who saw a crow flying with a piece of cheese in its beak. The fox wanted the cheese, so when the crow landed upon a tree branch, he sat down beneath the tree and started a conversation, flattering her. The crow was very pleased, and when asked to sing for the fox, she agreed, dropping the cheese in front of him. In exchange for the cheese, the fox gave the following piece of advice: “Never trust a flatterer.”</p>
<p>On the informational level, the children need to identify the characters and their characteristics and understand the sequence of events. On the conceptual level, they need to understand the behavior of cheating and how it affects other people and the need for approval and being flattered. This may be achieved in conventional teaching through a classroom discussion, questions for individual work, worksheets, and the like—in short, in any way the teacher is able to engage the students.</p>
<p>In affective teaching, a large portion of the lesson is devoted to experiences related to these two concepts: how it feels for them to get approval or be deprived of it, how peers’ perceptions of them affect them and their behavior. The children are encouraged to give examples of cheating or being cheated, how it happened, and how they felt. Questions about remorse and change they may wish to make in their own behavior are also explored. Such learning can be achieved through personal sharing following questions as well as through such strategies as rank ordering, dilemmas, and continua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212441359">Raths, Harmin, &amp; Simon, 1966</xref>). For example, children may place themselves on a continuum from 1 to 10 following the question, “To what extent do you feel approved by your classmates?” An exchange of feelings follows the individual work, and thoughts about some change needed to make classmates feel better are raised. Thus, affective teaching differs from conventional teaching in that it moves from understanding to feeling, from observation to self-inquiry. The affective teacher cannot teach values without the two fundamental levels of knowing and understanding, but he or she takes it a step further to involve students emotionally and engage them in SEL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0002831212441359">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p><italic>Behavior</italic> was measured by means of observations of the entire lesson in each of the six classroom sessions. Trained observers who were blind to the experimental conditions used a chart of all classmates to assess the frequency of eight behaviors—four negative (talking without permission, distractive behavior—playing with an object, moving around or leaving, and verbal or physical aggression) and four positive (engaging in class discussion, expressing feelings, demonstrating understanding of self and others, and offering encouragement, support, and positive feedback). Face validity was established by a group of educators who had selected these variables as most relevant to classroom life and used them in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212441359">Shechtman &amp; Leichtentritt, 2004</xref>). For each child, the appearance of any of the above behaviors during a given session was noted. If the same child performed the same behavior several times during a lesson, the observer marked each instance separately.</p>
<p>Observers were taken from a pool of 27 first-year teacher trainees who had assessed behavior in pairs in classrooms not included in the study, with raters reaching agreement of more than 90% of the behavior coded. For the current research, only one observer was used per classroom. Correlations among the negative behaviors ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .63 to <italic>r</italic> = .76, and those among the positive behaviors ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .68 to <italic>r</italic> = .82. The range of correlations for negative and positive behaviors was .28–.64, with a mean correlation of <italic>r</italic> = .61.</p>
<p>Exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation and the criterion of an Eigenvalue greater than 1 revealed two factors: Positive (Eigenvalue = 5.07, explaining 63.4% of variance), including all four positive behaviors (with item loadings of 0.79–0.90), and Negative (Eigenvalue = 1.43, explaining 17.8% of variance), including all four negative behaviors (with item loadings of 0.78–0.89). Internal consistency (α) was .88 for negative behavior and .91 for positive behavior. The frequency of positive behavior ranged between 0 and 19 times per child (for all sessions); negative behavior ranged between 0 and 21 times. The higher the score, the more frequent the behavior.</p>
<p>
<italic>Relationships</italic> were measured with the Classroom Climate and the Group Cohesion scales. Classroom climate (hereafter climate) was measured with the Classroom Environment Scale (CES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831212441359">Moos &amp; Trickett, 1974</xref>), which assesses students’ perceptions of climate. In the current study, items were adjusted to refer to the investigated literature class. The scale consists of three components: (a) relationships (engagement, cohesion, and teacher support; sample item: “The teacher of literature takes personal interest in the students”), (b) orientation and competition (tasks and competition; sample item: “Students compete to answer questions in literature class”), and (c) system (order, regulations, teacher control, and creativity; sample item: “In literature class, there are clear rules of behavior”). The original scale contains 90 items, with a reported reliability (α) of .80 and a range of .67–.86. Intercorrelations within components ranged from .48–.57. Test–retest reliability ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .72 to <italic>r</italic> = .90. Validity was based on the relationship between climate ratings and relevant variables, such as satisfaction, mood, and school attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831212441359">Dorman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study used an abridged version of 36 items, including 4 items from each subscale, as suggested by the authors. The correlation with the full questionnaire was .80. A Hebrew version of this scale was previously used and found to be negatively related to the classroom level of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212441359">Shechtman, 2006</xref>). That scale was translated to Arabic and back translated. Internal consistency in the current study was .83 for the total scale, .72 for relationships, .44 for personal growth, and .68 for system. Due to the low consistency of the personal growth scale, it was not included in analyses. Responses on each item are on a 3-point scale: <italic>not at all, sometimes</italic>, and <italic>often</italic>. A high score reflects a positive climate. The children completed the scale both pre and post.</p>
<p>Group cohesion (hereafter cohesion) was measured with the Group Identification Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212441359">Henry, Arrow, &amp; Carini, 1999</xref>), developed to assess students’ identification with the group on three components: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. A revised Hebrew version, with three added items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831212441359">Eisen, 2003</xref>), was translated for the present study to Arabic and back translated. Again, items were adjusted to refer to the investigated literature class. Sample items from the current study include “I perceive myself as different from other students in literature class,” “Classmates like each other in literature class,” and “In literature class children listen to each other.” Responses on the 15 items fall along a 5-point scale, from <italic>don’t agree</italic> to <italic>agree very much</italic>. Reported reliability ranged from .76 to .89. Validity was based on comparison to the Social Identification Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212441359">Hinkle, Taylor, &amp; Fox-Cardamone, 1989</xref>), with a correlation of .84. Internal consistency (α) in the current study was .82 for the total score, .58 for cognitive, .71 for affective, and .48 for behavioral. Due to the low internal consistency of subscales, only the total score was used for analyses. The children completed the scale both pre and post.</p>
<p>
<italic>Motivation to learn</italic> (hereafter motivation) was measured with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212441359">Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, and McKeachie (1991)</xref>. Validity was based on the correlation of MSLQ scores with students’ final course grades (<italic>r</italic> = .72–.80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212441359">Pintrich et al., 1991</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients for the subscales of the MSLQ range from .52 to .93. A Hebrew version of the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212441359">Ravid, 2000</xref>) was translated to Arabic and back translated, and items were adjusted to refer to the literature class. The scale consisted of three subscales: (a) willingness to engage in classroom tasks (“To what extent are you ready to cope with difficult material in literature class?”), (b) curiosity and interest in learning the material (“To what extent do you read beyond teacher requirements in literature class?”), and (c) desire to master the knowledge (“Do you feel satisfaction when you understand well the subject taught in literature class?”). The questionnaire contains 14 items, with a response scale of 1–5, from <italic>don’t agree</italic> to <italic>agree very much</italic>. The reported internal consistency (α) in the Hebrew version was .81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212441359">Ravid, 2000</xref>). Internal consistency in the current study for the total scale was .76. As consistency for the subscales was low (ranging from .35 to .68), only the total score was used for analyses. The children completed the scale both pre and post.</p>
<p><italic>Content knowledge</italic> was gleaned from a test designed to assess learning in the specific unit taught in the course of the six sessions of the literature class that were investigated. The test includes a text, followed by 15 questions addressing two levels of teaching—information (“In the poem, what do the young children want from the adults?”) and comprehension (“What led to the feelings of the characters in the poem?”). The test was identical in both teaching conditions, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 100. The test was administered one week after the six-session unit was terminated. To measure gains, scores were compared to a similar test on a unit studied earlier.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A total of 36 teacher trainees, enrolled in a didactic course in one college, were randomly divided into two groups. One group was trained by two college faculty members in the conventional teaching method, including information and comprehension levels. The other group studied the experimental (affective teaching) method, in which a valuing level was added.</p>
<p>Members of this second group were trained by a single instructor familiar with the method and were themselves taught according to the affective teaching model. For example, one course session focused on expectations in education. Rather than teaching about high expectations in our society, the instructor used a story to illustrate the issue of unrealistic expectations. The story told of a highly ambitious father who expected his 4-year-old son to be able to tell time and hit the child when he failed. The trainees discussed developmental differences of children and the reasons for parents’ high expectations. Then a third level was added: The group discussed their own experiences with parents’ and teachers’ expectations, the fear of failure, and the like. One highly ambitious trainee, a mother of two, then admitted that now she understands the pressure she puts on her own children. “I can see the horror in their eyes when they have to show me their homework,” she said. Following this session, she was much more open to her failing students as well.</p>
<p>The college students who were not exposed to affective teaching were trained in the conventional methods taught in teacher training. While this did not exclude their occasional or spontaneous use of a personal question, it was not used systematically.</p>
<p>The 36 trainees were unaware of the differences between the methods because each group was trained by a different instructor, only one of whom was familiar with affective teaching. Under the supervision of their training personnel, all trainees used the method they were trained in to teach the same six-session unit in Arabic literature to fifth or six graders in the schools and classrooms in which they did their student teaching. The interventions were carried out at the same time and lasted 8 weeks. The participating children completed questionnaires anonymously, in the classroom, before and after the six-session unit. The questionnaires, which were coded to conceal information, were handed out by the homeroom teacher. Observations were performed in each classroom, for each of the six sessions of the teaching unit, by trained observers from another university course (one observer per classroom).</p>
<p>To ensure integrity of the intervention, all sessions were observed by the three instructors involved in the study. The study was approved by the Ministry of Education, and parental consent was received in advance. As the research was carried out as part of a course, all trainees took part in the study and all children participated in their respective classrooms.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Data were analyzed with the SPSS18 Mixed Models procedure, at four levels: time, student, class, and school. Due to the basic assumption of interdependency of scores within a class in school, analyses were conducted with hierarchical Mixed Models of these four levels. The class within a school was defined as the random variable. Dependent variables were content knowledge and motivation, and independent variables were climate, cohesion, behavior, and teacher self-efficacy. Student-level variables included gender, positive and negative behavior, climate, cohesion, motivation, and content knowledge. Positive and negative behavior included six time levels (one per session), while all other variables included two time levels (pre/post). Class-level variables included teaching type (affective/conventional), teacher self-efficacy, and grade level (fifth/sixth), with the latter used as a control variable. Dichotomous variables were defined as dummy variables (gender: 0 = <italic>female</italic>, 1 = <italic>male</italic>; grade level: 0 = <italic>fifth</italic>, 1 = <italic>sixth</italic>). Change in student-level variables was assessed with Mixed Models including time (pre-post or six sessions), teaching type (affective/conventional), gender (male/female), and second- and third-order interactions, defined as multiplications. To control for grade level, it was entered as a covariate. As teacher self-efficacy is a class-level variable, change was assessed by a repeated measures MANOVA (and post hoc analyses) including time (pre/post) and teaching type (affective/conventional). In order to evaluate the final hypothesis, change in motivation and in content knowledge were defined as residual gains (the difference between post score and pre score, controlling for the pre score). The independent variables in this analysis—behavior, climate, cohesion, and teacher self-efficacy—were defined as the means of the process (pre-post or six sessions) and centered around the mean of each class. Mixed Models were assessed with main effects of the predictors.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses were conducted on pre scores of all dependent and independent variables, with Mixed Models, to examine differences by teaching type, gender, grade level, teaching type × gender, and teaching type × grade level. Significant gender differences were found for positive behavior, <italic>F</italic>(1, 927.26) = 73.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .07; negative behavior, <italic>F</italic>(1, 931.49) = 142.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .13; climate, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1070.41) = 7.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .01; cohesion, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1078.43) = 3.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .01; motivation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1075.61) = 7.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .01; and content knowledge, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1102.34) = 33.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .03. Girls scored higher than boys on all variables, except for negative behavior, on which they scored lower. Hence, gender was included in all analyses. However, these results confirm that children in the two teaching conditions had a similar composition of grade level and gender.</p>
<p>Preliminary differences were not found between the two teaching types, except for positive behavior, with higher initial scores for children in the affective teaching condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 25.90) = 10.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .03. Therefore, the main results for behavior were tested controlling for initial differences.</p>

<title>Gains in Knowledge, Motivation, Climate, and Cohesion</title>
<p>The first hypothesis suggested that results for all study variables would be more favorable for children in the affective teaching condition. Means and standard deviations for content knowledge, motivation to learn, classroom climate, and group cohesion are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831212441359">Table 1</xref>. As can be seen in the table, mean scores on these variables increased from pre to post only in the affective teaching condition.</p>

<p>Differences in these variables were assessed with Mixed Models, including teaching type (affective/conventional), time (pre/post), gender (male/female), and their interactions, with grade level serving as a covariate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831212441359">Table 2</xref>). The important finding here is the significant teaching type × time interaction. Post hoc paired comparisons, using estimated marginal means, confirmed that children in the affective teaching condition gained more on all variables than the children in the control condition. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was fully supported for the variables in question: Children in the experimental condition showed more favorable results than their counterparts in the control group.</p>

<p>For positive behavior, due to pre score differences, differences from the first to the sixth session were measured on adjusted residual gains (i.e., the sixth session score minus the first session score, controlling for the latter). Mixed Models analysis of the adjusted gain by teaching type, gender, and their interactions, indicated a significant difference between the teaching, <italic>F</italic>(1, 25.82) = 55.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .38. Thus, even with first session scores controlled, children in the affective teaching condition improved their positive behavior significantly more than children in the conventional teaching condition.</p>
<p>In the Mixed Models analysis, a teaching type × time × gender interaction was found significant for positive behavior. Post hoc paired comparisons, with estimated marginal means, were used to analyze the interactions. The time (i.e., six sessions) difference in gains in the affective condition was positive for boys and girls alike: <italic>F</italic>(5, 1976.73) = 163.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .51 and <italic>F</italic>(5, 1976.73) = 152.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .50, respectively.

<p>A similar analysis was conducted for negative behavior.

<p>The second hypothesis proposed that relationships (climate and cohesion) and behavior would predict outcomes (gains in content knowledge and motivation to learn). Pearson correlations between gains on content knowledge and on motivation, on the one hand, and the mean scores of climate, cohesion, positive behavior, negative behavior, on the other, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831212441359">Table 5</xref>. As before, gains were defined as residual gains, controlling for the pre score of content knowledge and motivation; mean scores for predictors were defined as means of pre-post or means of the six sessions (for behavior). Results indicate mild to moderate associations, with rather high correlations between gains in motivation, on the one hand, and relationships (climate, cohesion), on the other, and a moderate correlation between gains in content knowledge and positive behavior.</p>

<p>It should be noted that intercorrelations of mean scores on all variables (results not in table) indicated particularly high correlations between content knowledge and behavior (<italic>r</italic> = .65 and –.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for positive and negative behavior, respectively), and between motivation and classroom variables (<italic>r</italic> = .54 and .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for climate and cohesion, respectively). The correlation between gains in scores based on observed behavior (first to sixth session) and increase in perceived climate was high (<italic>r</italic> = .44 and –.40 for positive and negative behavior, respectively).</p>
<p>Finally, Mixed Models were used to predict outcomes on content knowledge and motivation by all variables. Two models were analyzed, with dependent variables being the gains in content knowledge and motivation, and predictors being teaching type, gender, climate (total), cohesion, positive behavior, and negative behavior. Grade level was used as a covariate. Individual-level variables (climate, cohesion, and behavior) were centered around the mean of each class (group). Teaching type, gender, and grade level (fifth/sixth) were defined as dummy variables.</p>
<p>Results of the Mixed Models regressions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0002831212441359">Table 6</xref>. Gains in content knowledge were positively predicted by climate and positive behavior and negatively predicted by negative behavior. That is, a more positive climate, more positive behavior, and less negative behavior were predictive of greater gains in content knowledge. Furthermore, affective teaching was predictive of greater gains in knowledge, and boys gained more than girls. Group cohesion was unrelated to gains in knowledge, while behavior (both positive and negative) was the best predictor of such gains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to assess SEL integrated in teaching literature, referred to as “affective teaching method” (experimental group), as compared to conventional teaching (control). We expected more favorable outcomes for students in the affective teaching condition due to the unique features of this method. Results confirmed our expectations. Students in the affective teaching condition showed more favorable outcomes in content knowledge, motivation to learn, perceived classroom climate, and group cohesion, and their observed behavior improved more than that of those taught by the conventional teaching method. In addition, gains in both content knowledge and motivation to learn were predicted by most of the other variables.</p>
<p>Specifically, the first hypothesis suggested that students in the affective teaching condition would exhibit greater improvement in perceived classroom climate, group cohesion, behavior, motivation to learn, and knowledge of content. Results confirmed all these expectations, based on both student self-reports and observational data. This may be explained by the characteristics of SEL programs, including affective teaching, which engage children on all levels—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831212441359">Durlak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212441359">Elias et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212441359">Harmin et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212441359">Shechtman &amp; Leichtentritt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212441359">Zins et al., 2007</xref>). As the content becomes personalized, it may become more interesting and more effectively internalized. Such processes include revealing personal information and disclosure of emotions, which are known to improve the group climate and sense of cohesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212441359">Blum &amp; Libbey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831212441359">Pianta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212441359">Shechtman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212441359">Zins et al., 2004</xref>). Children become more intimate with one another and more willing to cooperate and interrupt less. The relationships between a positive classroom climate and academic motivation and achievement are well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831212441359">Aronson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212441359">Elias, 2006</xref>). Children who feel liked, encouraged, and supported are freer to enjoy learning.</p>
<p>Indeed, children’s behavior improved consistently in lessons involving affective teaching, and, overall, their positive behavior increased and negative behavior decreased. This is an important addition to the validity of the intervention method because it is based on observational information. Positive behavior includes engagement, speaking openly about self, understanding self and others, and encouraging classmates. The improvement in positive behavior was more than threefold in the affective teaching condition, whereas there was minimal change in the control condition. Negative behavior (e.g., off-task behavior, aggression) started with an average of more than four instances per child in the affective teaching condition and ended with less than one instance, as compared with very little change in the control group.</p>
<p>Looking at the type of behavior considered positive and negative, it is clear how these behaviors are associated with perceived climate and group cohesion. Indeed, the correlation between gains in scores based on observed behavior and increase in perceived climate was high. Such outcomes are supported by earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831212441359">Buyse, Verschueren, Doumen, Van Damme, &amp; Maes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The second hypothesis suggested that classroom variables and behavior would predict gains on motivation to learn and knowledge of content. Gains were best explained by climate and teaching type. These results strengthen the well-known association between classroom climate and learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212441359">Durlak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212441359">Elias, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212441359">Elliot &amp; Gable, 2001</xref>). In a positive climate, students are more motivated to make an effort and are more engaged in the material presented. A positive classroom climate is an important byproduct of affective teaching, thus increasing outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whereas behavior explains gains in content knowledge, group cohesion explains gains in motivation to learn. Motivation is an attitude that may be affected by positive feelings toward classmates. However, gains in content knowledge require more; it takes time to cover the material. This is difficult to achieve in a less disciplined classroom. The more frequent the positive behavior, and especially the least frequent the negative behavior, the greater the chance not only to develop a positive climate but also to spend more time on teaching and learning. Similar results have been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212441359">Horner, Sugai, Todd, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831212441359">Murdock, Anderman, &amp; Hodge, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, teacher self-efficacy was the least important contributor to both outcomes. One explanation for this may be statistical. The mean score of teacher self-efficacy was highly interrelated with positive and negative behavior; thus, once behavior entered the equation, self-efficacy was no longer a significant predictor.</p>
<sec id="section17-0002831212441359">
<title>Gender Differences</title>
<p>There were preliminary gender differences on all questionnaire measures, with girls scoring higher. However, no teaching type × time interaction was found for boys or girls. There were also gender differences in behavior, with girls scoring higher on positive behavior and lower on negative behavior. These results are consistent with the literature, suggesting that girls present less discipline problems and perceive climate and cohesion as more positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212441359">Oplatka &amp; Atias, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212441359">Robinson, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>There was also a time × gender interaction for behavior, suggesting that both boys and girls improved their behavior in the affective teaching condition, whereas only girls improved in conventional teaching, though less so than in the experimental group. In negative behavior, both genders reduced incidents in the affective teaching condition, while only boys decreased them in the control group. Girls could be expected to do better in the affective teaching condition, as they tend to feel more comfortable with an emotional and empathic focus of learning. However, results showed that both genders improved, suggesting that boys can benefit from affective lessons as much as girls. This is an important finding considering the reservations raised in the literature in reference to differences in how boys and girls should be taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212441359">Hall &amp; Matsumoto, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>There are a number of limitations to the research findings. First, generalizability of results is limited, as the study was conducted in a single country (Israel) within a unique population of Arabs, in one teacher-training college, and for one subject of learning (Arabic literature). Moreover, the study involved trainees in teaching; results might have been different with experienced teachers. Future research should evaluate the method in other populations and other school subjects.</p>
<p>A second limitation is the use of self-reports on most measures, especially in light of the students’ young age. Moreover, the short duration of the intervention makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of the teaching method offered, particularly as no follow-up measurement was available to examine the lasting effect of the intervention. Future research should be targeted at longer interventions and include assessment of long-term gains.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the lack of validity of the observational measure. Moreover, behavior was measured with only one observer per class, so that rater agreement could not be assessed. However, as behavior was found to be correlated with outcomes in the current study, this does provide some after-the-fact validity to the instrument.</p>
<p>Finally, we had no hypothesis regarding gender differences prior to this study. Age and gender differences are routinely checked in our studies to control for possible differences, and results demonstrated some interesting differences. Future research should devote more attention to the impact of gender on outcomes of SEL programs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, the study has several strengths. First, it involves a very large population relative to other intervention studies, including students and teachers from a number of schools and classrooms, which also permits analyzing the data in a nested procedure. Second, the study used both self-reports and observations. Third, the consistency in results strengthens our findings, and the relationships among variables help to explain some of the outcomes and add validity to the proposed intervention. In short, the study proposes a practical teaching method that helps incoming teachers improve the classroom climate and student relationships, increase motivation to learn, and affect progress in content knowledge—all critical factors in education. These results join a great amount of recent research supporting SEL programs. Emotional and social learning is important for children’s mental health, and efforts to enhance it are strongly advocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831212441359">U.S. Public Health Services, 2000</xref>, p. 3). Another important finding is that academic performance improves following participation in SEL. In an era when academic achievement has become the standard goal for education, it is reassuring to know that taking away time from academic teaching for socioemotional learning only improves outcomes. But perhaps most important is showing that teachers can change their teaching strategies and routinely integrate SEL into their teaching subject matters. SEL should be an integrated part in students’ lives. The more teachers incorporate SEL in their teaching programs, the better the reality of school may become for students.</p>
