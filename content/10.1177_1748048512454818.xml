<abstract>
<p>Peaceful development of large and fractious interethnic nations and regions is facilitated by and may require a shared informational infrastructure that meets the following conditions: public service orientation; independence of major state and corporate centers of power; contributing to the functioning of nationwide institutions of economic, political and cultural importance; and commanding benign public perception. With specific reference to the Russian news agency Interfax, this article explores the ‘black box’ of the often touted but seldom explicated relationship between news agencies and national or regional ‘development.’ It finds that Interfax has played an important role in the establishment of a political and economic, horizontal informational infrastructure that meets the above conditions. The article concludes that Interfax contributed to a new informational paradigm, synchronizing with macro processes of political and economic reform, and enveloping a heteroegenous swathe of Russia, the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The agency thus helped create conditions conducive to regional, interethnic stability.</p>

<title>News agencies in the context of development</title>
<p>In this article I identify the complexities inherent in the multiple political, economic and cultural activities of news agencies that operate in interethnic, national and international contexts, with reference to the largest independent, privately owned news agency of modern Russia, Interfax. I analyze its indirect contribution to the transformation of political and economic structures of governance that emerged in Russia from the late 1980s onwards, heralding the country’s transition from a supply to a demand-driven economy, amid considerable tensions among the many different territories that made up the former Soviet Union (FSU) and its wider sphere of influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The Russian news agency’s emergence, survival and financial success was facilitated by its formative role – exercised independently of, and in implicit opposition to at least the conservative wing of the Communist Party – as an alternative information provider in the latter days of the Soviet Union, one that tailored its news services to the interests of foreign and domestic clients alike, earning the respect and support of senior members of the reformist movement including, most notably, the last president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>In fulfilling a developmental role as harbinger of a new, semi-western, high-tech approach to information gathering and dissemination Interfax assured its institutional independence and financial survival by adapting the business models of the west’s major financial news agencies, notably Reuters (now Thomson-Reuters) and Bloomberg (both now headquartered in North America). Interfax developed a wide range of products, from traditional printed bulletins to sophisticated electronic financial information and analytic instruments, helping build the informational infrastructure, discourses and self-regulatory mechanisms of a modern capitalist economy. Evidence gathered by interview with Interfax executives in 2010–2011 and from available corporate documentation indicates that Interfax plays a significant developmental role in both political and economic domains across the territories of the FSU, facilitating their qualified buy-in to a cultural framework at whose center is market primacy. This in turn has implications for the degree to which the region can assimilate peacefully into the global neoliberal economy.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency invites reconsideration of an older ‘dependency’-inspired discourse about the relationship between news agencies and peaceful development, one that was particularly influential in the early stages of the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) debates of the 1970s and was acknowledged, if insufficiently unpacked, in the resulting 1980 McBride Report. While development is multivariate, most discussions emphasize its economic and political dimensions. Previous work has delved into the ‘black box’ of the relationship between news agencies and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512454818">Boyd-Barrett, 2012</xref>) to identify general features of this relationship. This article explores how a financial news agency contributes to macro-structural economic development that, in turn, influences peaceful coexistence of diverse ethnicities and cultures, by constructing a shared, informational public sphere – arguably a precondition for peaceful coexistence across a region of heterogeneous nations and communities.</p>
<p>Early literature on development communication (see overviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454818">Melkote and Steeves, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512454818">Servaes, 2008</xref>) emphasized economic growth from a westernized perspective using criteria such as gross domestic product (GDP) as indices of national development, which it associated with processes of modernization, urbanization, mass communication, consumerism, and integration into a neoliberal global economy. More recent literature is skeptical of macro measures, recognizing that systemic economic growth sometimes exacerbates social inequalities that are further intensified by catastrophic negative externalities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454818">Meadows et al., 2005</xref>) including global warming, annihilation of species, deforestation, desertification, drought and pollution of air, water, sea and earth. Many such scholars celebrate development initiatives from the grassroots, sometimes with NGO and others’ support, driven by local community aspirations and needs in negotiation with local power structures and cultural practices. This approach escapes the worst of patronizing, top-down models of ‘development,’ but may underestimate the implications of top-down paradigm shifts of the kind that have occurred in the FSU, transitions that have significantly improved the quality of many lives even while leaving many others at risk. Such macro shifts shape prevailing cultural value systems, influencing conceptions of what is desirable and possible. Missing from both the top-down and bottom-up approaches to development is adequate consideration of informational infrastructures.</p>
<p>For a market-based economy to realize a more even and less damaging diffusion of economic initiative requires the generation and distribution of investment practices that are less exclusively focused on global and national centers in favor of ‘peripheral’ territories, their specificities, needs and interests. This in turn requires enhancement in the sphere and scale of developmentally relevant information gathering and dissemination, improved circulation of information between centers and peripheries, and optimization of access to such information by all stakeholders. Relative to its state-owned peers and to foreign players in the Russian and FSU information markets, Interfax has made substantial headway toward meeting these informational preconditions for economic growth and peaceful coexistence.</p>

<title>News agencies, development and shifting paradigms of governance</title>
<p>Discussions of national or regional development invoke many different definitions (all rooted in human values, which inevitably conflict) and indicators. Controversy over definition is intensified in periods in which societies undergo profound shifts in what may be described as <italic>paradigms of governance</italic>, typically with dramatic implications for the organization of economic activity, social and cultural existence. What counts as ‘development’ in one epoch may be considered in an entirely different way in another. This article explores the correspondence between just such a shift in the paradigm of governance and the birth of Interfax news agency during the transition from the Soviet Union to modern Russia and the FSU, and the ways in which Interfax has facilitated realization of the new paradigm in the informational sphere, with relevance to both political and economic development.</p>
<p>Following its establishment in 1989 Interfax responded strategically to a range of political and market challenges across three main areas of information provision: general news for media clients; specialist economic and financial news and information for state and corporate clients; and direct business support services. These shaped the agency’s capacity for responding to the informational requirements of large, and sometimes conflicting interethnic, intercultural regions, enhancing the range and depth of information that is shared across the eight heterogeneous federal districts that make up the world’s single largest country, and across the varied nations of the FSU. Many of the news agencies emerging from the FSU, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Central and Eastern Europe are reincarnations or structural continuations of older national news agencies or of the branch offices of what had been the principal state news agency of the Soviet Union, TASS. Interfax, by contrast, is the outcome of original, private entrepreneurship. It benefitted from a modest early infusion of international capital, even though it was initially established within Radio Moscow (Gosteleradio), used some of Radio Moscow’s facilities and accrued the support of highly placed politicians favorable to the reformist policies of President Mikhail Gorbachev. Interfax journalism approximated more closely to the Anglo-American model than to the state-ideological propaganda functions of other Soviet agencies, embracing directness of expression and clarity. Interfax was perceived as an alternative to the state-run information services, one that was responsive to the news needs of western media and other clients hungry for enlightenment as to the course of events in the closing drama of the Soviet Union. Western criteria of newsworthiness were familiar to early Interfax staff, since these had been their benchmarks in English-language Radio Moscow coverage. The agency’s own history (<italic>Your Interfax: Information Bulletin for Subscribers</italic>, 20th anniversary addition, 2009 – henceforth cited as YI20Y) demonstrates that founding members fostered positive <italic>inclusive</italic> working relations with leading politicians of different ideological tendencies, notably with supporters of both Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin (later with Vladimir Putin and Dmitri Medvedev), rather more than with ‘conservatives’ of the old Communist Party. The agency promoted its original core business, the news service, as a supplemental benefit to the lease of fax machines.</p>
<p>Interfax grew by serving the needs of both media and non-media clients both overseas and <italic>across the (former) Soviet Union</italic>. This distinguished it from most other news agency ventures of the time. The number of Russian newspapers dedicated to finance and business increased sharply in the 1990s, creating a niche market and showcase for Interfax, even though this was not to prove its main source of revenue. Interfax emerged just ahead of the first appearance of private banks in Russia and privatization of its economy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512454818">Rantanen (2002</xref>) reports that 85% of clients of the early financial agencies consisted of banks and financial enterprises, 10% insurance and audit companies and 5% privatized enterprises. By contrast with competitors Interfax had established an early lead in financial news by focusing, among other things, on key Russian industries that were of regional and world interest, such as oil, gas, finances and metals, and by nurturing synergistic strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>Interfax today might be considered a Russian version of Bloomberg, the major business, financial and economic news agency founded in New York in 1986 by Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg primarily served the lucrative news and information niches of business, economic and financial news for non-media markets. General and political news was added later, in part to promote the financial services. By contrast, Interfax started operations in the less lucrative arena of general and political news for media and non-media markets, but then moved into the supply of business, economic and financial news. Each agency commenced operations in a significantly competitive market. Just as Bloomberg put down roots a little in advance of the popularization of the Internet in the US, Interfax arrived just before the arrival and spread of the Internet – which it quickly assimilated – in Russia. More importantly even, Interfax understood and applied market principles ahead of the popularization of market concepts in the Soviet Union, the post-Soviet Russia Federation and the FSU.</p>
<p>For general and political news of the Soviet Union and for news of the world for Soviet media, prior to the arrival of Interfax, major suppliers were the official government agency TASS, and the equally official features agency Novosti. TASS was established in 1925 on the foundation of the older Russian Telegraph Agency or ROSTA, the first state agency of the Soviet Union. TASS was renamed ITAR-TASS in 1992 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It describes itself today as the state’s central information agency. The Russia Information Agency Novosti or RIA Novosti began as the Soviet Information Bureau of 1941, renamed first as Novosti Press Agency in 1961, and later as Russian Information Agency Novosti in 1991, within the jurisdiction of the Press and Information Ministry. It is a government-owned agency specializing in provision of news and feature materials for periodicals, radio, television and the web. RIA Novosti is a significant multi-platform publisher. By 2010 both agencies continued to be substantially financed by government, with the larger subvention going to RIA Novosti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454818">Komissar, 2011</xref>): $109m, as against $36m for ITAR-TASS. Quantitative evidence of media usage, domestic and overseas, shows a consistently strong lead for the independent agency, Interfax, over these two state-dependent organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454818">Komissar, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Interfax succeeded not only in expanding its market share against two state rivals, but contained the penetration of its markets by global information giants Bloomberg and Thomson-Reuters, thus preserving a significant measure of informational sovereignty alongside its independence of government. It achieved this, in part, by strategic partnerships with the giants, while building a unique reporting strength through the Russian Federation in the form of a network of autonomous, self-financing but affiliated agencies in each of the eight Federal districts, together with either daughter agencies or branch offices in all nations of the FSU (no matter how repressive). Interfax developed specializations similar to those of Bloomberg (and others unique to Interfax). But its principal focus is newsgathering and sales for the large geopolitical area that embraces Russia, the FSU/CIS, Central Asia and China. Unlike Bloomberg or Thomson-Reuters, Interfax is as much a general and political news agency in revenue terms as it is an economic news and financial services agency. In 2010, Interfax news media services generated 56% of its revenues but only 13% of its profits. Its newsgathering resources are principally concentrated in Russia which accounts for most of its direct clients and earnings. Interfax retains foreign correspondents elsewhere, notably in China, and achieves global distribution by making its services (principally about Russia and the FSU) available through the Bloomberg network. Bloomberg clients outside of Russia can subscribe to Interfax, accessing its services through Bloomberg terminals; and Bloomberg clients in Russia automatically receive as part of their Bloomberg subscription three specialized financial Interfax news services on Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The Russian service gives Bloomberg subscribers some 250 breaking news stories a day. Through its informational infrastructure, therefore, Interfax helps to integrate the different components of the FSU as well as integrating the FSU with the global economy.</p>

<title>The shift to economic news</title>
<p>The Interfax move toward business, financial and economic news deserves contextualization with respect to the history of entrepreneurship in the operations of news agencies and the contribution of the international news agencies to the hegemonic informational needs of an emerging global neoliberal economy. Unlike most national or regional agencies Interfax has accommodated to these needs without surrender of local informational sovereignty while maintaining its independence of local state-supported competitors. This in turn has helped it build client confidence across the FSU.</p>
<p>Reuters, from the 1960s onwards, began more and more to concentrate on this market for non-media clients in the business, economic and financial sectors, so that by the 1990s over 90% of revenues were generated from these sources. From its earliest days, the provision of business, securities and commodities information had been important to the operations of Reuters, and continued being so, if not much talked about before the 1960s, throughout most of its history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048512454818">Boyd-Barrett, 1980</xref>). In the early 1960s UNESCO encouraged members of the Organization of Asian Pacific News Agencies (OANA) to develop specialist economic news services in order to supplement their modest revenues. Reuters’ long-established operation, headquartered in the world’s leading center of finance, and its 1946 purchase of specialist economic news agency Comtel, laid the foundation for what later became, in 1966, Reuters Economic Services (RES). This positioned Reuters to exploit the relaxation by state-controlled PTTs (postal, telegraphic and telephonic companies) of regulations governing client use of transnational communications facilities. Deregulation was partly the outcome of the news agencies’ own lobbying organization, the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), whose work today focuses on the web. The emerging relevance of computing for the business model of news agencies was confirmed first by Reuters’ acquisition in 1964 of (US) Ultronics and later that year, in partnership with Ultronics, the launch of Stockmaster, a desktop market-quotation system. Reuters was now poised to take advantage of the reintroduction of flexible exchange rates, in the wake of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1972. This created an entry to money market services and trading systems with Reuters’ Monitor brand which, by the mid- to late 1970s, generated a rate of profit without precedent in the history of news agencies.</p>
<p>Few agencies followed directly in Reuters’ footsteps but Interfax is one of them. Two of Reuters’ (and now Thomson-Reuters’) most important competitors were and continue to be Bloomberg and Dow Jones (acquired by News Corporation in 2007). These three corporations have so excelled in gathering and selling financial, economic and business news around the world that there are few national markets where local players can sustain enterprises capable of dominating national market share. Many agencies have tried, such as Canadian Press (CP), which has 3500 clients for such services. These smaller efforts typically are not of the same scale, range, sophistication, or value (although the Chinese news agency Xinhua was making significant investments in the 2000s).</p>
<p>Some agencies extracted a more general lesson from Reuters’ example, namely the benefits of independence through entrepreneurship. Agencies’ pathways to this goal have varied considerably. Agencies not owned or only part-owned or controlled by state or government have had the strongest economic motivation to generate revenues additional to the fees and subscriptions that they receive for traditional general news services for print and broadcast retail media. These have moved, spectacularly in some cases, toward more entrepreneurial business models involving innovation, diversification and market segmentation or specialization. The goal is not simply to grow revenues but to grow them on a scale that reduces these agencies’ dependence on money-strapped owner-member or client news media.</p>
<p>Interfax experienced no constraints on entrepreneurship in Russia, but did face powerful incumbent, government-supported national news agencies, ITAR-TASS and RIA Novosti. Whatever their earlier strengths, these agencies were not well prepared to deal with news in the business, financial and economic realms, spheres they had not particularly valued or understood in Soviet times, and for which western-style trading opportunities had not then existed (though both agencies have grown their participation in this market in more recent years). There was a shortage of human and other resources sufficient to satisfy the appreciating demand for such information. Fresh to the business, with strong professional ties to foreign clientele and a reputation for professionalism and independence that it had earned during the final years of the Soviet Union, Interfax was entrapped neither in incumbent structures nor in Soviet ideological mind-sets. Interfax understood like none other the significance of the shift to a market economy, and leveraged this understanding for business growth almost as soon as the trends became apparent in the final days of the Soviet Union and after.</p>
<p>Having been recognized by Reuters as a credible, non-state, source of information about events in Russia, Interfax leveraged this relationship (and others with international media) to propel itself forward in the economic realm. We can conclude that the pressures of market competition led Interfax to give considerable weight, first, to the fostering of economic, financial and business news services and, second, to remain focused on business-to-business activities in subsequent years, in this way moderating its exposure to the vagaries of unstable media markets and advertising-dependent sources of revenue in favor of building networks with the most powerful political and business entities of the FSU and with the largest global corporations in the business of information supply (including Bloomberg, Business Wire, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian, LexisNexis, Moody’s Investors Service, Platts, Regulatory News Service and Thomson-Reuters).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748048512454818">
<title>A news force for economic development</title>
<p>From its inception, Interfax provided news coverage as much and sometimes of much greater importance to business people, bankers, brokers, financiers and traders as to general news media. Interfax founder Mikhail Komissar records (YI20Y, p. 12) that at an early stage of the agency’s development he realized that the business-to-business collection and dissemination of political news was limited to only hundreds of clients whereas he envisaged that such an operation in the realm of financial news could potentially appeal to hundreds of thousands of highly motivated clients. From the early 1990s Interfax, a fully autonomous operation, was totally dependent on the profits that it could generate, and it was obvious to Komissar that he needed to look beyond media markets to satisfy demand for economic news and information for clients in the business and financial sectors. This striving for economic independence, coupled with its horizontal extension through the FSU helped protect the agency from aggressive takeover from government, oligarchs, or multinational corporations, positioning it within a local, publicly oriented space.</p>
<p>Having studied the operations of the big international agencies such as AP and AFP, Komissar realized that they did not generate significant surplus as both had classically operated on a not-for-profit basis. He turned to the example of Reuters. ‘I was amazed when I learned that the sale of political news earned Reuters only 5–6% of its revenues.’ Reuters provided the initial model he was looking for, although the later inspiration of Bloomberg proved more vital. Komissar indicated that from the start there was an effort to specialize in different industries. In 1991–1992 Interfax ‘became the first in the country to start developing business and financial reporting, focused on individual industries on a professional basis’ (YI20Y, p. 13), closely observing western reporting standards. By 2009, Mikhail Komissar told Alexei Vorobyov in interview, that in the domains of financial and economic news on the Russian market, Interfax competed as an equal with the two global behemoths.</p>
<p>Although competition from the international agencies mainly threatened Interfax in the domain of financial and economic news, their penetration of the domestic market also extended to general news. The primary goal of these agencies (notably, AP, AFP, Thomson-Reuters) is to be the first source of accurate news in international news markets. Accordingly, they specialize in the news about Russia for which there will be demand from other parts of the world. It is not so important for them to satisfy the demand for in-depth news of Russia and the FSU that comes from the media that actually serve readers and audiences within these markets. The international agencies therefore can afford to invest much less in domestic news than is required of Interfax, even though they can continue to charge high subscriptions on account of their combined services of international and domestic news. The presence of the international agencies in the domestic media market constitutes another, less direct threat in so far as they may use their news services as a device for ‘branding’ which, if successful, can assist their marketing of other products which, in the case of Thomson-Reuters, include a substantial array of economic and financial news products for non-media markets. On the other hand, Interfax generally enjoys ties of social, linguistic and cultural affiliation to the Russian establishment that are not as easily accessible to its international competitors, and it can expect to be first to receive significant political news. In the major cities outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg Reuters or Bloomberg is likely to depend mainly on monitoring local media, while Interfax deploys a large contingent of full-time correspondents, not just in the principal cities, but in some of the major towns.</p>
<p>Russian oligarchs have tried by various means to buy Interfax, but Mikhail Komissar determined that the agency had to be independent, not simply by preference but because association by ownership with an oligarch would negatively impact its credibility and market share and likely reduce the agency’s potential to maintain services that are inclusive as to the diverse information needs of the FSU. If at some risk to himself, Komissar successfully dissuaded his suitors. After the ascent of Putin to the presidency, many oligarchs learned that buying into media for political gain would no longer help them advance their interests, since their use of media power had provoked an aggressive and crushing response from the Kremlin (interview with Komissar; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512454818">Zassoursky, 2004</xref>). Suitors interested in financial news agencies out of a simple-minded view of achieving quick, high returns may have learned a cautionary lesson from Interfax’s competitor, RBC. RBC lacked as strong an independent network of correspondents as Interfax. Developing mainly on the basis of its advertising model, growing at an annual rate of 60–70% at its peak by means of debt-leveraged acquisition, its annual revenues grew from $2m to $200m in a little more than 10 years, but it then took a severe hit in the economic crisis of 2008. RBC was acquired by a bank, part of the Onexim Group associated with oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, which acquired a 51% holding for $80m in 2010, of which half went to pay debts (<italic>Moscow Times</italic>, 5 November 2010).</p>
<p>Principal domestic competitors for Interfax remain the financial news services of the two state-supported agencies, RIA Novosti and Prime-TASS (the economic service of ITAR-TASS). RIA Novosti generated revenues of $20m in 2011, with overall losses of $42m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454818">Komissar, 2011</xref>) and according to Interfax sources was earning approximately $5m for financial news services. ITAR-TASS had revenues of over $15m in 2009, with losses of over a quarter million. According to Interfax sources, Prime-TASS was earning from $3m to $5m a year. Much of this was earned from a customized service provided for the Central Bank. Interfax earned almost $58m in 2009, with profits of nearly $5m.</p>
<p>RIA Novosti’s economic services on its multi-media site appear to be addressed primarily to media and public audiences, in 14 languages. Prime-TASS describes itself as a private company, in which the state news agency ITAR-TASS holds a 35% stake. It claims 250 permanent staff (in addition to drawing on the main network of ITAR-TASS, which staffs 130 bureaus in Russia and abroad) and scores of stringers, providing 400 stories a day in Russian and 100 in English. RIA Novosti distributes Prime-TASS overseas. Continuing state subsidy for two news agencies is attributed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454818">Komissar (2011</xref>) to an anti-market logic of ‘factionalism’ among Russian elites that explains similar dualistic structures in other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The original primary target audience for Interfax services was foreign, mainly western, media and non-media. Within a few years the new Russia was to see a flowering of business-oriented publications, and these provided Interfax with a ready domestic market for such information among media clients. The principal focus increasingly was the non-media market, including ‘mainly major global companies looking closely at the gigantic market and industrial potential of a new Russia and the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States,’ interested particularly in oil, metals and finances (YI20Y, p. 51), but becoming more distinctively Russian over time.</p>
<p>Development of the 11-member CIS offered the prospect of a wide variety of different domains, each with its own growing media and business markets and a growing appetite for information services. Even if these were not all lucrative in terms of revenue, Interfax’s demonstration of capacity to award them serious attention in general news and economic information products added competitive advantage, helping make it an attractive partner for international corporations seeking entry into the region. Within the FSU the principal Interfax sources of revenue are Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Belarus, accounting for almost 6% of the Group’s total revenues in 2010 and over 6% of profits.</p>
<p>Interfax directors Gerasimov and Pogorely recount (YI20Y, pp. 50–52) that in the early 1990s one of the main challenges was the ‘huge deficit of news worthy of the term “business news,” ’ since very few domestic sources had been trained to think about such matters from the perspective of a market economy. ‘What do you want to know that for?’ might be the retort of a Soviet factory director presented with a question from a journalist asking about investment, projects, or operating results. Essential basics such as currency values (whether rubles, foreign currency rubles, transferable rubles, each having different official and unofficial exchange rates) could not be easily or meaningfully established for conversion into foreign currencies. Initiating a reputation for innovative products in these domains, Interfax issued a weekly publication from early 1991 on foreign trade, then added a daily English-language bulletin called <italic>Soviet Business Report</italic>, and later that same year introduced specialized publications on oil and gas, agriculture and the banking sector. A telecommunications news service followed in 1998. Almost every issue of the early bulletins carried essential economic news that only a short time before had been classified. Today, Interfax clients for business and financial services receive real-time data and latest news from the Russian, Ukrainian and major international trading floors, and analytical forecasts, consensus forecasts and commentaries on financial markets. In 2010, Interfax claimed that more than 30,000 stock market players received Interfax news, from major banks to private investors.</p>
<p>In September 2010, in email correspondence for this study, Mikhail Komissar noted that Interfax had introduced the very notion of economic information in the FSU, which had practically not existed beforehand – there had been no market information as the term is understood today, namely company news, market moving news, information about material events in major corporations, quick and unbiased statistical and other important reporting. From 1992, Interfax was first in the FSU to provide industry-focused publications such as <italic>Oil &amp; Gas Report</italic>, <italic>Finance &amp; Banking Report</italic>, <italic>Mining &amp; Metals Report</italic> and <italic>Agriculture Report</italic>. Even the very idea of specialization by industry was somewhat controversial. ‘But we felt the flavor of the newly-born Russian capitalist society and decided to develop in line with the growing economy.’ This led to increased demand from local and international business communities for much more sophisticated and professional industry news. In the mid-1990s Interfax created the first specialized news agencies: Financial Information Agency, Petroleum Information Agency, Gas Information Agency. These in turn helped the agency accumulate financial and human resources to set up legal entities capable of working at international levels of quality. Interfax understood very well the information needs of the markets that it monitored, that the FSU would develop in the same way as other international markets and that Interfax would need to create the tools of information infrastructure without which no modern market can operate. Such thinking led it to major service innovations, including a world standard rating agency, Moody’s Interfax Rating Agency; the Credit Bureau Experian Interfax, a joint venture with the world’s leader in credit ratings, Experian; a professional database of corporate information – SPARK – that enabled Interfax to create a joint venture with Dun &amp; Bradstreet; one of the first investor relations services in the FSU, in cooperation with Thomson-Reuters; and the SCAN media database, following the models of Factiva and LexisNexis. Interfax’s online business and financial news services have acquired many thousands of subscribers and are available on the desktop screens of all key business decision-makers throughout the FSU.</p>
<p>Komissar’s reflection stressed the role of Interfax in being first to systematically identify a national need for economic information services in Russia. The agency took a conscious decision to align its interests with the needs of the emerging capitalist order and to do this in two closely interrelated ways: construction of an informational infrastructure and, proceeding cautiously, development of basic information services by industry/market sector. As much as anything this represented a refining of its corporate mind-set toward a more acute appreciation of what was needed to help support the continued growth and strength of the new economy, exemplified by the perception that rating services would be an appropriate, needed and lucrative new area of activity. In combination, all these features had a further dramatic consequence: Interfax became a highly visible and unique partner for international corporations seeking to do business in the former Soviet Union. Once again, we see that the agency facilitated horizontal, informational and economic integration within the FSU in part by fostering such integration between the FSU and the global informational market. This combined initiative may be regarded as a structural precondition for harmonious working relationships across the FSU.</p>

<title>Financial news products as the informational infrastructure of capitalism</title>
<p>The range of Interfax financial and economic informational products today is vast. The purpose of examining a few of these here is not to promote the agency or its products but to demonstrate the complexity of the informational infrastructure that is required to sustain a peaceably functioning modern capitalist economy across a vast and heterogeneous region. The Russian commodity market, as Interfax executive director Vladimir Gerasimov pointed out in interview in May 2010, had in the beginning generally lacked transparency and organization and there was limited demand for real-time market data, news and fundamentals. Since 1991 Interfax has provided news and market data about oil and gas, metals and agriculture and now has a presence in practically all segments of these markets. Electricity data through the Financial and Economic Information Service (EfiR), for example, combine local and global information, news, archives, technical analysis, exchange and trading session data.</p>
<p>The development of these services, originally by means of weekly bulletins, has concentrated on industrial markets, commodities and areas that attract intense export and import activity. These have nurtured a high degree of journalistic specialization. Yury Pogorely, Interfax EfiR deputy general director, highlighted his division’s concentration on the physical statistics of production, transportation and markets. The agency also customizes products, such as its service of industrial and equipment manufacturing news for Siemens. One of the agency’s earliest specialist industrial correspondents covered Norilsk Nikel in Siberia, and was first to compile what by today’s standard would be considered fairly basic statistics of business and production. There was an effort to focus on important activities that competitors like Reuters or Dow Jones were not so adept at covering. The largest sectors received the most extensive coverage. The retail sector grew increasingly important following Russia’s recovery from the 1998 crisis, as have telecommunications, electricity, the bond market (now bigger than equities), gas (comprising seven to ten companies, dominated by Gazprom), railways, metals, coal, agriculture and construction.</p>
<p>The transition to daily, online publications occurred in the late 1990s, even though the market for printed weekly versions, while shrinking, persists (in English language). Daily online publication enhanced the volume and speed of newsgathering and dissemination, shifting the rhythm of industrial reporting closer in line with that of general and financial news. The online services helped generate copy for the weekly bulletins, which provide much material that clients do not need on a daily basis, including periodic statistics, profiles and other background. In the late 1990s, Pogorely’s unit produced 60 stories a day: this had increased to 500 a day by 2010, nearly a 10-fold increase without respective supplementation of correspondents.</p>
<p>Interfax has more industrial journalists in the field than any other service. RIA Novosti and ITAR-TASS did not cultivate sector-specific news to the same degree, and each fields 20–25 correspondents in industrial coverage as against Interfax’s 80. News coverage of the ‘physical’ industrial sectors, such as mining, is more difficult than others, Pogorely believes, because to be any good, correspondents need immersion in the field, and require more training if they are to acquire an expert sense of what ‘their’ industry is all about. They need sensitivity to personal and human interest as well as to industrial angles.</p>
<p>The principal Interfax news products constitute an imposing list of some 40–50 continuous, daily, or weekly news services of Russia and the former republics, covering general, business, financial, banking and investment news, as well as diplomacy, military, press coverage, energy, health, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, mining and metals and health technologies – principally for clients in Russia, the former republics and China. From the 1990s Interfax has published authoritative analytical reports on banks and insurance companies; surveys of different sectors; assessments of asset management quality; and information services that assist in investment process, risk management, corporate structure and other factors. Interfax-100 Rankings are issued regularly, and include the Interfax-100 Analytic and Statistical Survey of the Banking System, and the Interfax-100 Analytic and Statistical Survey of the Insurance Sector. Interfax-1000 Rankings compile metrics that compare all major banks of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other CIS countries in terms of asset value and other financial indicators.</p>
<p>Among the most influential Interfax services in 2010 were the following:</p>
<sec id="section6-1748048512454818">
<title>The Financial-Economic Information Service</title>
<p>The Financial-Economic Information Service (EFiR) (already discussed) is one of the oldest Interfax products. Its chief editor, Radion Romov, interviewed for the <italic>Interfax Bulletin</italic> (No. 11, 2010) noted that clients for this service increasingly express an interest in being served more international information (particularly from the USA, UK, EU, Australia and China), including information about changing regulations in foreign markets.</p>

<sec id="section7-1748048512454818">
<title>ETHER</title>
<p>Established in 1998, ETHER provides a comprehensive service of Interfax news, stock exchange data, supplemental reference and analytical information. It incorporates the following categories of data: money, foreign exchange, monetary and credit markets; security, stocks and shares; loan securities; trade markets for metal, oil, gas, oil products, energy; company information, and, of course, Interfax news. Interfax also provides a monthly consensus forecast of major macroeconomic indicators in Russia, based on a survey of leading investment firms, banks, think tanks and international financial institutions.</p>

<title>SPARK</title>
<p>In conversation with the author in December 2010, Interfax Group founder and chairman, Mikhail Komissar explained how Interfax became involved in receiving and disseminating the ‘disclosure’ information routinely released (in response to regulatory requirement) by Russian companies. This plays a modest but important role in establishing Interfax as a key player in the accumulation and dissemination of financial information and is of critical importance to the operation of the stock market. Interfax created its first database on Russian companies in 1998. Pressure to acquire the necessary data prompted Interfax to establish ties with different state bodies to get more and faster company data. This led to state identification of ‘authorized’ new agencies: private news organizations authorized by the state to deliver regulatory news to investors and also to copy all the data to the Russian stock market regulator (FSFR). In 2010, Russian issuers reported some 300,000 material events through the news agencies. Interfax gained a 75–80% share of this market by 2009.</p>
<p>The pivotal role of Interfax in the company disclosure system is the foundation of its SPARK, Russia’s largest corporate database, covering all existing legal entities and private entrepreneurs. Its features indicate, first of all, the complexity of sophisticated information products that a financial agency must deliver to today’s market in business and investor news services and, second, the interweaving of these products with the informational infrastructure that is indispensable for advanced capitalist societies. As such, they underline the role of Interfax as a significant contributor to general processes of economic development.</p>
<p>SPARK contained 15 million legal entities and processed 8 million inquiries for more than 2000 users in 2009. The total number of businesses registered in Russia was almost 7 million in 2009, of which nearly 5 million were active. All of them were in the SPARK database, in addition to equivalent information for the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The database provides financial information on 2.1 million enterprises in Russia, full information on 50,000 joint stock companies, detailed profiles of 5000 issuers and data from 15 government agencies including the State Statistical Services of Russia and Kazakhstan; State Register of Legal Entities (Russia); Federal Service for Financial Markets, Russia; Federal Tax Service; Federal Agency for Management of State Property of Russia; and the Supreme Arbitration (commercial) Court of Russia.</p>
<p>SPARK provides access to tools for both snapshot and comprehensive evaluations of the financial status of companies, industries and regions. It provides specialist methodologies for evaluation purposes, as well as for the presentation of information in the system. It provides effective solutions for the evaluation of credit risks – scoring, benchmarking and bankruptcy. The total value of this market is estimated at around $25–30m, of which Interfax controls around 60%.</p>

<title>SCAN</title>
<p>This is a service allowing users to search in Interfax archives for mass media resources, whether from Interfax, other news agencies, newspapers, corporate publications, blogs, television or radio, as well as corporate registration and financial indicators from the Interfax SPARK database. The SCAN search engine, Search Wizard, was created by Interfax’s own center for software development. SCAN was considerably augmented by a partnership in 2008 with LexisNexis. In interview for the company’s bulletin (No. 11, 2010), Interfax director of sales Aleksei Kirlikov explained that SCAN is a keyword search engine similar to Google or Yandex but which filters out unnecessary information unrelated to the topic of the search.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The significance, range and depth of Interfax services for business and financial communities go far beyond the mere furnishing of access to specialist information, but contribute to a shared, spatially horizontal informational infrastructure and platform that is fundamental to the operation of a modern market economy, influences how that economy reports and interrogates itself, and contributes directly to its health and performance. These services facilitate interactive communication and trading between different businesses, government agencies and media, doing so across a complex network of national, regional and globally distributed territories and are therefore necessary if not sufficient conditions for the achievement of intercultural communication and stability in the region. To the heterogeneous, multilingual, multiethnic, multicultural and sometimes fractious network of Russian Federal districts and nations of the FSU and Central Asia, not to mention Eastern Europe and China, the status of Interfax as a non-state, privately owned but publicly-spirited service institution operating, in many sites, through autonomous affiliate or daughter agencies that it has helped to develop, contributes to an infrastructure that serves an integrative function for the entire region at the operational level of capacity and capability. While this does not and cannot in itself overcome intercultural or other conflicts in the region it does contribute a post-Soviet infrastructure that facilitates information gathering and distribution, investment, trade and commerce throughout the region, providing fast, reliable and essential information that enables investment, business development and market growth. In these senses alone, although there are many other dimensions, Interfax contributes to capitalistic development, nationally, regionally and internationally. I intend that these considerations should provide some insight into the actual and potential contributions of news agencies to macro-level processes of development using this term to include peaceful intercultural relations, particularly in the context of societies that are undergoing fundamental changes in paradigms of governance.</p>
