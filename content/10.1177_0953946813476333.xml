<p>The papers in this issue, with one exception, arise from the annual conference of the Society for the Study of Christian Ethics held in Cambridge in September 2012. The conference theme was Theological Anthropology and Ethics, an indication not only of a growing interest in understanding the human person in relation to God but too, of an emerging sense of the problematic and ambiguous inheritance such a study confers on moral thinking. Accordingly, the papers here are full of questions. Their authors are well aware of the hard places where one struggles for clarity, since anthropology is a discipline that seeks to articulate the nature of a phenomenon that is most strange and yet most of concern to the very ones who engage in it. It matters most to us to come to know ourselves even as we slip away from every effort at grasping our inmost essence as a whole. In each word, each description, something is disclosed while yet something remains hidden, for as human beings enter into their own self-understanding there is both satisfaction and loss, a coming to light and a remaining darkness that eludes speech and ever attracts us forward. So one hears in these papers an urgent desire to shed the skin into which thinking has been pressed by tradition and to stretch out into what has not yet been elucidated so that a better fit might be found.</p>
<p>Along the way, the character of the moral life also unfolds. It is plain in what follows that theological anthropology can lead us astray into places that are self-destructive of the very creature who there hopes for fulfilment, or can fix boundaries around the quest in advance of our going there to determine for ourselves what might be known. So the discipline itself becomes subject of moral judgment – for the exclusions its definitions impose, for the support it gives to prevailing ideologies or idolatries, for the totalising impulse by which the future is foreclosed, for the failure of its speaking to bring to life the ones to whom its investigation is addressed. These problems find expression in various forms here. And with them, something of what essentially belongs to moral thinking is glimpsed. Theological anthropology runs the risk of presenting the human phenomenon as a whole, complete in itself, even to the point of allotting the place where God may be revealed. Thus do our human ways of thought pretend their knowledge. It is given to the moral thinker to care for the mystery, to attend quite precisely to the moment of encounter when the human person is met by God, and so to hold open the ways by which I may receive my own future from beyond myself. Such is the birthplace of that One, both human and divine, whose life is yet to become mine and who calls me now to adoration.</p>
