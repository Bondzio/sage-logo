<abstract>
<p>In this article, we present the findings of a study on the electoral use of intergovernmental grants for municipal infrastructure. The study adds to the body of work on redistributive politics by showing that both federal and provincial governments use intergovernmental grants for electoral purposes. The study also shows that grant distribution seems to be skewed toward electoral districts hold by governing party and by legislators who are influential in their party because they have more seniority or they fill ministerial positions. Therefore, this finding does not match the predictions of McGillivray’s model according to which in a political system like Canada’s, grant distribution would benefit to swing districts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Federal systems tend to intensify relationships between and among the different levels of government and to create a greater interdependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X13480804">Elazar 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160323X13480804">Zimmerman 2001</xref>). Grants from federal governments to other levels of government are an example of this tendency. In Canada, the amount of federal government grants to provinces and territories increased from $1.25 billion in 1961 to $63.8 billion in 2009. Grants from provincial to municipal governments followed the same trend. They went from $0.87 billion in 1961 to about $53 billion in 2009 (<italic>Ministère des Finances du Canada</italic> 2010).</p>
<p>The normative theories of fiscal federalism attribute the existence of intergovernmental grants to considerations of efficiency and equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X13480804">Gramlich 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X13480804">Oates 2008</xref>). The objective of the grants is to optimize the supply of local public goods and to reduce social disparities among the regions. For their part, positive theories of fiscal federalism uphold that the principles of efficiency and equity do not constitute the real reasons for intergovernmental grants. Rather, it is the political interests of the actors in the different political institutions of the federal system that explain the existence of these grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X13480804">Brennan and Buchanan 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X13480804">Inman 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This study falls within the framework of positive theories of fiscal federalism. Its objective is to analyze the influence of electoral considerations on the allocation of intergovernmental grants. We have applied redistributive politics models to the Canadian context, a parliamentary democracy in which, to the best of our knowledge, there exist only a few studies that have analyzed the effect of electoral considerations on the distribution of intergovernmental grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13480804">Dickson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>). As a result, our study furthers the findings of recent works that have shed light on the politics of intergovernmental grants outside the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13480804">Dahlberg and Johansson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13480804">Dickson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X13480804">Leigh 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X13480804">Veiga and Pinho 2007</xref>). In fact, most of the studies using redistributive politics models have dealt with the American political system. And yet this system has features that are different from those of parliamentary systems, in particular, the division of powers and the influence of political parties on decision making (Levitt and Snyder 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>). Certain actors, such as political parties, may therefore play a more important role in parliamentary systems than in presidential systems and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X13480804">Denemark 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13480804">Dickson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X13480804">McGillivray 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This study’s originality is found in its analysis of the influence of redistributive politics of the federal and provincial governments on the distribution of intergovernmental grants in Canada. More precisely, it looks into the case in which the federal government transfers funds to the provincial government that must, in turn, distribute these funds among the municipalities. In this regard, it must be noted that studies on the politics of intergovernmental grants have focused on the electoral motivations of the federal government, and, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies on the use of federal grants for political purposes by recipient governments.</p>
<p>This article is comprised of four sections. In the first section, we set out the study’s theoretical framework. Next, we present the Canada-Quebec Infrastructure Works 2000 Program (CQIW 2000 Program), the subject of this study. The findings of the study are presented in the third section. In the fourth section, we conclude the article with a discussion.</p>
<sec id="section2-0160323X13480804">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The models of redistributive politics are based upon the idea that legislators who “bring home the bacon” are rewarded by their electors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X13480804">Bickers and Stein 2000</xref>). As a result, electors’ sensitivity to grants constitutes an incentive to use public spending for electoral purposes (Cox and McCubbins 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X13480804">Dixit and Londregan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X13480804">Lindbeck and Weibull 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Two relevant models that have exerted much influence on the analysis of redistributive politics can be distinguished: the Cox and McCubbins model (1986) and the Lindbeck–Weibull–Dixit–Londregan model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X13480804">Lindbeck and Weibull 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X13480804">Dixit and Londregan 1998</xref>). The Cox and McCubbins model predicts that governing parties that tolerate risk tend to focus on <italic>swing voters</italic> because these voters have the highest electoral rate of return. For their part, governing parties with high risk aversion favor their core constituencies even if the privileges accorded to these electors are less rewarding than those directed toward swing voters.</p>
<p>In the Dixit and Londregan model (1998), the existence of differences in ideological intensity among social groups greatly influences the pattern of redistributive politics. In fact, the model predicts that redistribution favors the groups that have a greater proportion of individuals who are indifferent to the ideologies of political parties (swing voters). These groups are more worth the investment than the groups with high ideological intensity because the latter are less likely to change their vote in exchange for economic benefits.</p>
<p>The Cox and McCubbins model and the Lindbeck–Weibull–Dixit–Londregan model are criticized for not having appropriately taken into account the impact of the institutional framework on redistributive politics (Golden and Picci 2008). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X13480804">McGillivray (2004)</xref> picks up on the distinction between the majority and proportional electoral systems. In the majority electoral system, such as that used in Canada, the party that wishes to stay in power needs a plurality of the votes in a majority of the electoral districts. A slight increase in dissatisfaction with the government may lead swing districts to vote for the opposition and vice versa. For this reason, the governing party would adopt public policies that favor swing districts even if these policies are less popular in districts that are party strongholds.</p>
<p>However, the capacity to target swing districts depends on the political party’s influence on its members. In a system with strong political parties, the governing party is able to implement public policies that favor swing districts. On the other hand, in political systems with weak political parties, the McGillivray model (2004) predicts that public policies favor governing party strongholds. This situation does not constitute a deliberate choice by the governing party, but instead it expresses elected officials’ ability to place their interests before those of the party. In fact, safe districts are generally represented by members that have the capacity to influence decision making within their party as well as in the legislature (Golden and Picci 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X13480804">Leigh 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X13480804">McGillivray 2004</xref>). These members would therefore use their influence to siphon off public funds to benefit their electors.</p>
<p>The proportional system encourages the formation of new political parties. For this reason, McGillivray’s model (2004) predicts that the governing party wishes to support party strongholds in order to develop voter loyalty and to prevent new parties from eroding its power base. However, the capacity of the governing party to establish its will depends on the power it holds over its members. Strong political parties that control their members are going to adopt policies favoring their strongholds. Golden and Picci (2008) widened the predictions of McGillivray’s model (2004) to include the case of political systems in which the parties are weak, as is the case in Italy. In these countries, the proportional electoral system would produce public policies favoring the districts held by the most powerful members of the governing party.</p>
<p>Electoral districts that profit from public policies may thus change according to the electoral system and the relative influence of political parties. With regard to the latter, political parties are seen to have more influence in parliamentary systems than in presidential systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X13480804">Denemark 2000</xref>). In a parliamentary system, like that of Canada, the party must have members’ cohesion and discipline to enjoy the confidence of the legislature and to remain in power. To this end, it has certain means permitting it to control its members, such as the power to nominate candidates in elections and to appoint elected officials to cabinet positions once in power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13480804">Dickson 2009</xref>). Members of Parliament are thus obliged to respect the party line and have less leeway to take independent action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X13480804">Soroka et al. 2009</xref>). In Canada, therefore, researchers are of the opinion that the governing party dominates the process of policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X13480804">Radin and Boase 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that Canada is a parliamentary democracy with a majority electoral system in which the governing party dominates the decision-making process, the McGillivray model (2004) predicts that this country’s public policies should favor swing districts. Since the governing party dominates the decision-making process, it can also be deduced that, in Canada, individual legislators have little influence on public policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on the politics of intergovernmental grants have highlighted federal government electoral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13480804">Collins and Gerber 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13480804">Dahlberg and Johansson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13480804">Dickson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X13480804">Leigh 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X13480804">Veiga and Pinho 2007</xref>). But, in several transfer programs, subnational governments are also responsible for redistributing the federal government’s grants among municipalities. As is the case with the federal government, we will argue in the following paragraphs that subnational governments may also use the received grants for electoral purposes.</p>
<p>Chubb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X13480804">1985</xref>) and Nicholson-Chrotty (2005) used the agency theory to analyze the effectiveness of intergovernmental grants. The authors found that goal conflict and asymmetric information between the federal government (the principal) and subnational governments (the agent) encourage the latter to spend the funds in sectors that are different from those for which they were intended.</p>
<p>Agency problems are made worse in federations because the rigidity of the institutional framework limits the capacity of the federal government to intervene in subnational governments’ jurisdictions. In the Canadian Constitution, for example, the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over municipal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X13480804">L’heureux 1986</xref>). The federal government thus has not the right to intervene in municipal affairs without the consent of the provinces. Furthermore, several attempts to redesign the division of powers between the two levels of government have failed in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X13480804">Simeon and Robinson 1990</xref>). The constraints of the Canadian constitution are cited among the main reasons that explain why the federal government usually uses grants to intervene in provincial jurisdictions, which strengthens the provincial position when negotiating conditions attached to these grants.</p>
<p>Chubb’s (1985) and Nicholson-Crotty’s (2005) studies have the merit of having used the agency theory and the median voter model to show that, in a context of asymmetric information, subnational governments can spend the funds received from the federal government based on the preferences of the local median voter, a situation that does not necessarily coincide with the federal governments’ objectives. Nicholson-Crotty (2005) starts from the premise that the subnational government maximizes the welfare of the local median voter. This premise is plausible when voters are well informed about the subnational government’s policies and, as a result, they are able to penalize any decision that deviates from the local median voter’s preferences. However, even at the subnational level of government, electors do not seem to have the necessary information to adequately control the government’s behavior. The subnational government can take advantage of this situation to use public funds in general, and the grants received from the federal government in particular, for purposes that do not exactly correspond to the local median voter’s preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X13480804">Filimon et al. 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>In this regard, it is worth noting that Canadian provinces have a political structure similar to that of the federal government, that is, a parliamentary democracy and a majority electoral system. The governing party must thus win the plurality of the seats of the legislative body to remain in power. For this reason, and as the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13480804">Joanis (2011)</xref> has shown, the governing parties in Canadian provinces can use public spending for electoral purposes.</p>
<p>The governing parties in Canadian provinces can thus benefit from the information advantage in relation to the federal government and voters to direct federal grants toward provincial districts with the highest electoral rate of return. More precisely, the McGillivray model (2004) predicts that in the Canadian political system, grant distribution will be skewed toward swing districts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160323X13480804">
<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>In 2000, the federal government created the Infrastructure Canada Program. With a budget of $2.65 billion, the program’s objective was to improve the quality of Canadian urban and rural infrastructure and the quality of life of its citizens. Funding allocation was spread among the provinces and territories in accordance with a formula that took into account the population and the unemployment rate (Infrastructure Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X13480804">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the framework of this initiative, the Governments of Canada and Quebec concluded the Canada-Quebec agreement relating to infrastructure works, giving rise to the CQIW 2000 Program. On the average, the federal government assumed one-third of the cost of the infrastructure projects funded by the program, representing approximately $500 million. The Government of Quebec, the municipalities, and other recipient organizations contributed the remaining funds.</p>
<p>The types of infrastructure eligible for the program fall into three categories: local drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, local transportation infrastructure, and projects with an economic, urban, or regional impact.</p>
<p>The project selection process for the CQIW 2000 Program has two main stages. In the first stage, municipalities apply for program funding. In the second stage, the applications are first studied by the Government of Quebec in order to select a list of projects that will be sent to the federal government for approval. The federal government then ensures that the proposed projects respect the terms of the Canada-Quebec agreement regarding infrastructure programs.</p>
<p>The CQIW 2000 Program is well suited for the study of redistributive politics. The evaluation criteria of the projects and the rating of each criterion are not well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X13480804">Gouvernement du Québec 2001</xref>). Under these conditions, once the projects meet the eligibility requirements, the federal and provincial governments have great discretionary power in the selection of projects. This flexibility opens the way for the CQIW 2000 Program to be more subject to redistributive politics than universal programs in which funding distribution is generally done in accordance with well-established rules that do not allow the government to allocate the grants according to its electoral needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X13480804">Bickers and Stein 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13480804">Dahlberg and Johansson 2002</xref>; Levitt and Snyder 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>In this study, we have used the logit model to test the effect of electoral motivations on the distribution of funding of the CQIW 2000 Program among Quebec municipalities.<sup>1</sup> The logit model permits measuring the influence of electoral considerations on the propensity of a municipality to benefit from the CQIW 2000 Program funding. A similar model was also used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13480804">Dahlberg and Johansson (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X13480804">Balla et al. (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13480804">Collins and Gerber (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>The study aims notably at knowing to what extent municipalities that are in a swing district and municipalities that are represented by elected officials who are members of the governing party or of a parliamentary committee, by senior elected officials, or by ministers influence the propensity of these municipalities to receive program funding. These variables are usually used to analyze the politics of intergovernmental grants (Golden and Picci 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X13480804">Knight 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13480804">Dahlberg and Johansson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13480804">Joanis 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X13480804">Veiga and Pinho 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the McGillivray model (2004), we expect the existence of a negative association between the vote margin and CQIW 2000 Program funding. Swing-district municipalities would then have a higher propensity to benefit from the program than other municipalities. We also expect that party affiliation of elected officials has no effect on the distribution of CQIW 2000 Program funding since this funding is disproportionately directed toward swing districts. As for the other political variables, they measure the influence of individual legislators on the distribution of funding. In a parliamentary system with strong political parties such as in Canada, individual legislators are not supposed to have an effect on public policies. The coefficients of these variables thus should not theoretically be different from zero.</p>
<sec id="section5-0160323X13480804">
<title>Control of Confounding Factors</title>
<p>Several studies have shown that grant distribution is not determined by electoral considerations alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13480804">Gamkhar and Ali 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>). The characteristics of the municipalities can also play a role. When these characteristics are correlated with political factors, they can bias the estimation of the latter on grant distribution. For this reason, they must be taken into account in the analysis.</p>
<p>In this respect, the works dealing with the determinants of intergovernmental grant distribution enable to distinguish the following factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>):</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Municipalities’ needs: Empirical studies have found a strong association between the recipient governments’ socioeconomic characteristics, such as population and income, and the amount of the funding received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>; Stein 1981). In this study, we have taken population size, median income, the amount of spending before the program, the proportion of low-income individuals, the proportion of university graduates, and the proportion of individuals aged sixty-five years and over as proxies to the needs of municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X13480804">Acosta 2010</xref>; Brooks and Phillips 2010). We have also taken the number of projects submitted to the CQIW 2000 Program as a variable of the measurement of municipalities’ needs.  The CQIW 2000 Program provides that the subsidies could be used to favor the linking of the infrastructure of merged municipalities. We have therefore introduced a variable into the model to control the effect of municipal mergers on grant distribution. To this must be added Quebec’s seventeen administrative regions. Administrative regions are intended to control nonobservable characteristics that are shared by municipalities belonging to the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13480804">Gamkhar and Ali 2008</xref>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Administrative and financial capacities: The administrative capacity of the municipality constitutes a valuable asset, enabling it to submit projects that satisfy the requirements of the funders and, at the same time, rank among the highest of projects eligible for grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>). As an indicator measuring municipal administrative capacity, we have used the proportion of municipal staff in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13480804">Collins and Gerber 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding financial capacity, on the average, municipalities assume one-third of the cost of projects funded by the CQIW 2000 Program. Certain municipalities may therefore refrain from requesting funding because they do not have sufficient financial resources to assume their portion of the project cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008b</xref>). Since property value makes up the main source of Quebec municipalities’ income, we have used this variable as an indicator of the municipalities’ financial capacity.</p>

<title>Study Data</title>
<p>The Canada-Quebec agreement relating to infrastructure works that gave rise to the CQIW 2000 Program was concluded between the federal government led by the Liberal Party of Canada following the 2000 election and the Quebec provincial government led by the Parti Québécois that was elected in 1998. According to this agreement, eligible projects were to be completed before March 31, 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X13480804">Gouvernement du Québec 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding this, it must be noted that the Parti Québécois relinquished power to the Parti Libéral du Québec following the 2003 provincial election. Consequently, we are faced with the following question: are we to use the data from the 1998 or the 2003 provincial election?</p>
<p>The data on the implementation of the CQIW 2000 Program indicate that 902 projects were funded by this program. Of this total, 725 projects (81 percent) were accepted before August 2002 and 858 (95 percent) before April 2004 (Marceau et al. 2005). The change of government in Quebec does not seem to have had a notable influence on CQIW 2000 funding distribution since the quasi-totality of the projects was selected under the Parti Québécois government. The task of the Parti Libéral du Québec government thus consisted basically of monitoring the projects already selected by the previous government. For this reason, we have used the data from the 1998 provincial election and from the 2000 federal election.</p>
<p>Data on the 1998 provincial election were obtained from the office of Quebec’s Chief Electoral Officer (<italic>Directeur général des élections du Québec</italic>) and data on the 2000 federal election, from Elections Canada. Finally, data about elected officials’ seniority were obtained by consulting the Web sites of the Quebec National Assembly (<italic>Assemblée nationale du Québec</italic>) and the Parliament of Canada.</p>
<p>Data on municipalities’ grant applications and on funding were supplied by Ministère des affaires municipales, des régions et de l’organisation du territoire (MAMROT) and the Quebec Ministry of Transportation (<italic>Ministère des Transports du Québec</italic>—MTQ). The data relating to municipalities’ investment in program-eligible infrastructure, as well as to their administrative and financial capacity, were obtained from municipal organizations’ financial reports published by MAMROT. Data relating to municipalities’ socioeconomic characteristics were provided by Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>During the implementation of the CQIW 2000 Program, Quebec underwent a series of municipal mergers. The purpose of these mergers was to overcome the management deficiencies of local services resulting from the existence of a large number of municipalities, in particular, deficiencies relating to the management of issues that go beyond the municipalities’ borders, like urban development, public transit, and economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X13480804">Gouvernement du Québec 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2004, approximately 320 municipalities were merged, resulting in the creation of eighty-four new municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X13480804">Gouvernement du Québec 2004</xref>). To ensure the comparability of the data, we have taken the list of after-merger municipalities as the unit of analysis, in other words, the 2005 list of municipalities. Specifically, we have aggregated the data for 320 municipalities to obtain the data for the eighty-four municipalities created following the municipal mergers.</p>
<p>For municipalities including several constituencies, the political variables were coded as follows: the party in power was coded 1 if the majority of the seats are held by the governing party and 0 if not. The minister variable was coded 1 if the municipality is represented by a minister and 0 if not. Committee was coded 1 if the municipality is represented by a member of a parliamentary committee and 0 if no. The vote margin equals the difference in votes between the party that received the most votes and the runner-up. With regard to the seniority variable, it equals the average seniority of the elected officials.</p>

<title>Study Findings</title>
<p>Data on the CQIW 2000 Program show that, of the 1,084 municipalities, 861 submitted projects to this program, a figure that represents approximately 79 percent of the municipalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X13480804">2</xref>
</sup> Among the municipalities that submitted projects, 45 percent obtained funding. Therefore, there was a strong demand in relation to the program funding available.</p>
<p>The regressions focus on the analysis of the effect of redistributive politics on the distribution of the CQIW 2000 Program funding. The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X13480804">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The first model, which has a coefficient of pseudodetermination of 0.13, indicates that the governing party in the provincial political arena has a positive and statistically significant coefficient. The municipalities represented by members of the governing party thus seem to have a greater propensity to obtain CQIW 2000 Program funding than other municipalities. With regard to the minister, seniority, committee, and vote margin variables, they do not have a statistically significant association. These variables do not then seem to have an influence on the distribution of program funding.</p>
<p>Concerning the federal political arena, the coefficient of the minister is positive and statistically significant. The municipalities represented by ministers would then have a greater propensity to receive program funding. The committee variable has a negative coefficient, suggesting that municipalities represented by legislators sitting on parliamentary committees have a lower probability of benefiting from the program than other municipalities. This finding is counterintuitive since it is expected that the coefficient of this variable will be superior to zero in the case of systems with weak political parties or equal to zero in the opposite case.</p>
<p>In the second model, we have taken only the 861 municipalities that submitted projects. We have also introduced the number of projects submitted by each municipality as a new control variable. Compared to the results of the first model, the results of the second model show that the coefficient of the member’s seniority variable in the provincial political arena is positive and statistically significant. Municipalities represented by members having more seniority thus seem to have a greater propensity to benefit from the program funding than other municipalities. For their part, the coefficients of the other variables are essentially the same.</p>
<p>The first two models thus indicate that the two levels of government would use CQIW 2000 Program grants for election purposes. However, the way in which these grants are used does not correspond to the hypotheses that can be obtained from McGillivray’s model (2004). In fact, the CQIW 2000 Program grants do not seem to favor swing districts as can be expected in a political system characterized by a majority electoral system on one hand and by political parties with considerable influence on their members on the other. The study suggests that funding is directed to a greater extent toward municipalities located in districts that are represented by members of the governing party or by members who are influential in their party because they have more seniority or they fill ministerial positions.</p>
<p>In the third model, we have introduced interactions between the variables of the provincial political arena and the variables of the federal political arena. This analysis brings forth new information on redistributive politics. With respect to provincial arena, funding seems to favor members from the governing party who serve on parliamentary committees as well as ministers elected from swing districts. On the federal political arena, the coefficients of the interactions between the political variables are not statistically significant.</p>
<p>In the fourth model, we tested for the interaction between the federal and provincial political arenas. This analysis is interesting in the Quebec context in which two main political forces shape the political landscape. On one hand, there are the separatist parties seeking Quebec’s independence and, on the other hand, there are the federalist parties working to keep the province within the Canadian federation. So, in Quebec, the Parti Québécois and the Bloc Québécois, both separatist parties, had obtained the majority of the seats in the 1998 provincial election and the 2000 federal election, respectively.</p>
<p>The results show that municipalities in provincial districts held by the governing Parti Québécois have a greater propensity to benefit from CQIW 2000 Program funding than the municipalities in districts represented by the opposition. This is true whether the municipalities were represented federally by the Bloc Québécois or the Liberal Party of Canada. Contrary to what could be expected, the Parti Québécois therefore does not seem to have used CQIW 2000 Program funding to support its counterpart in the federal political arena, namely the Bloc Québécois.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The normative theories of fiscal federalism recommend organizing the public sector around the principles of efficiency and equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X13480804">Oates 2008</xref>). The central government takes charge of delivering national public goods and stabilizing the economy. As for the local governments, their mission is to deliver local public goods. Within this framework, the purpose of matching grants is to ensure the optimal production of local public goods by adjusting the externalities between or among jurisdictions. As for unconditional grants, they are devoted to ensuring a certain kind of horizontal equity.</p>
<p>Like other studies on the politics of intergovernmental grants, our analysis suggests that the distribution of the CQIW 2000 Program funding is not only due to the considerations of efficiency and equity but also due to electoral considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X13480804">Bickers and Stein 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X13480804">Denemark 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13480804">Gamkhar and Ali 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13480804">Hall 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X13480804">Veiga and Pinho 2007</xref>). This use is facilitated by the absence of a funding distribution formula and project selection criteria that limit the discretionary powers of the federal and Quebec governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>This study contributes to research on fiscal federalism by showing that subnational governments can benefit from the existence of asymmetric information to use federal grants for electoral purposes. This result then suggests taking into account not only federal politics but also the politics of the other levels of government in the analysis of the distribution of intergovernmental grants.</p>
<p>In addition, the study shows the way in which grants are used does not correspond to the hypotheses relating to the Canadian political system taken from McGillivray’s model (2004). Swing districts do not seem to benefit more from CQIW 2000 Program funding than other electoral districts. Instead, program funding seems to be disproportionately directed toward districts held by the governing party, a pattern of grant distribution that is in accordance with the Cox and McCubbins model (1986) which states that, when politicians have high risk aversion, distributive politics tend to favor governing party strongholds. Also, individual legislators would have some leeway in influencing the government’s choices despite the party’s power over its members. In a majority electoral system like Canada’s, McGillivray’s model (2004) maintains that this pattern of funding distribution should be observed in political systems with weak political parties which, in the opinion of several Canadian political scientists, does not seem to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X13480804">Dupré 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X13480804">Radin and Boase 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is not the first Canadian study to have shown that governments do not often behave according to the predictions of the McGillivray model of redistributive politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X13480804">Milligan and Smart (2005)</xref> found that the political party affiliation of elected officials as well as their seniority exerts influence on the distribution of federal government spending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13480804">Joanis (2011)</xref> also showed that the Government of Quebec’s spending on roads tends to favor the governing party’s stronghold districts.</p>
<p>Our study also draws attention to the influence of political factors on the implementation of public policies. More precisely, it shows that the principle of dichotomy between politics and administration, constituting one of the fundamental principles of public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X13480804">Wilson 1887</xref>), is not always respected. The influence of political factors on the implementation of the CQIW 2000 program seems have led to a less efficient and less equitable allocation of the funding of this program. A significant portion of funding is used for electoral purposes rather than for enhancing the population’s well-being.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be noted that there is a need to understand which mechanisms politicians use to exert their influence on the distribution of intergovernmental grants. In other words, the distortion of the distribution of funding would have to be examined to see if it is the result of pressure actively exercised by the political actors on the administrative system or, on the contrary, if it is the result of administrative tactics aiming to obtain political support for these programs, and, therefore, the sustainability of funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13480804">Rich 1989</xref>).</p>

<p>We tested the presence of selection bias by using a two-stage bivariate probit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X13480804">Greene, 2003</xref>). Two instruments that are not among project selection criteria are used for this purpose, the amount of investment per capita before the CQIW 2000 Program and the proportion of university graduates. We find that the correlation between the error terms of the funding-request equation and of the project-selection equation is not statistically different from zero. Therefore, the use of a single-stage logit model is appropriate. Furthermore, the estimates of the two models are essentially the same. The results of the two-stage model can be supplied on request.</p>
