<abstract>
<p>There is considerable interest in applying Response to Intervention (RtI) as a schoolwide methodology for instruction, assessment, and intervention for students who, early in their academic careers, are struggling academically. Supporters contend that the tiered service delivery model holds great promise for many students who otherwise would fall behind and end up with a disability label. It is unclear whether RtI is compatible with gifted learners, although a number of authorities in the gifted field are advocating for its adoption for all students, including high-ability students. This article provides a rationale for why gifted education should consider RtI assessment protocols compatible with gifted learners, discusses the implications of RtI’s core requirements and assessment measures for gifted learners, and offers a model for implementing RtI for gifted learners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Response to Intervention (RtI) has become an instructional practice employed predominantly in general education classrooms across the United States as a direct result of the reauthorization of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734282911428200">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA, 2004)</xref>. RtI is not a specific curriculum or educational program; rather it is a framework for promoting access to high-quality core curriculum and providing increasingly intensive educational interventions in response to students needs. It provides educators with systemic measures of student progress which yield data in order for teachers to make important instructional decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734282911428200">Batsche et al., 2006</xref>). It can be defined as student-centered assessment models that use problem-solving and research-based methods to identify and address learning difficulties in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734282911428200">Johnson, Mellard, Fuchs, &amp; McKnight, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>RtI has implications for gifted education as a framework for assessing and serving gifted students because it is an integrative approach to observing student behaviors, assessing and subsequently reassessing students’ strengths and needs through traditional and nontraditional measures, and modifying classroom practices based on students’ academic or behavioral needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734282911428200">National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2007</xref>). An effective system of assessment for gifted learners includes identification, program intervention, and student outcomes of learning linked together and established at the front end of program design and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska, 2008</xref>). High-quality instruction matched to student needs as a result of ongoing assessment is at the core of the RtI framework.</p>
<p>In a traditional model of RtI, educators use a problem-solving approach to determine student weaknesses to deliver structured, systematic, and scientifically based interventions to address the student’s educational needs. It was designed to identify at-risk students who were not achieving at grade-level competencies to intervene early, prior to a formal referral and identification process for special education. It is generally delivered through a three-tier system of support beginning with Tier 1 which serves 80% of learners in the general education classroom. If the learner fails to achieve at this level, targeted interventions are added, addressing specific deficiencies at the second tier. These interventions would typically serve 10% to 15% of the student population but would be less intensive than exceptional education. Learners who do not succeed in Tier 2 would then move to Tier 3, which is specially designed instruction delivered by special education specialist to serve the remaining 5% of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911428200">Council for Exceptional Children, 2007</xref>). As the model is intended to be fluid, learners can move back and forth, based on demonstrated proficiency, between the tiered services, unlike a traditional exceptional children education model which classifies students to receive services or not.</p>
<p>In an ideal way, adaptation of this model for gifted learners would consider learners’ strengths and areas of demonstrated mastery. Learners would receive acceleration and enrichment opportunities matched to their propensities at the relevant tiers with increasing levels of intensity. If teachers of the gifted adopted this approach to providing services and modifying instruction for gifted learners, based on diagnostic assessment and progress monitoring, then it would set the context for gifted learners to perform at optimal levels. This article focuses on how employing an RtI framework supports advanced learning needs with respect to curriculum and instruction through the consistent and targeted application of assessment components including universal screening, curriculum-based authentic assessment measures, and progress monitoring. While the RtI framework holds great promise for gifted learners, there is a paucity of research on implementing the model, in particular the assessment components, with gifted learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734282911428200">The Association for the Gifted division of the Council for Exceptional Children’s position paper (2007)</xref> posits that the RtI model be expanded in its implementation to include the needs of gifted children as well as students who are gifted with disabilities. RtI for gifted learners differentiates the depth and breath, pacing and complexity of content for students within each tier through acceleration and enrichment opportunities. There are a handful of states which have designed models that include gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911428200">Rollins, Mursky, &amp; Johnsen, 2011</xref>), but it is too early to determine whether gifted learners benefit from this new approach. Quite clearly, research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of RtI for all students, including the high-ability student.</p>
<sec id="section2-0734282911428200">
<title>Rationale for Consideration of an RtI Assessment Framework for Gifted Education</title>
<p>Scaffolding services and interventions based on the intensity of need requires educators to gather relevant data and think about the learner first and then subsequently match the supports and services to his or her strengths and needs. The key components of RtI center on high-quality core instruction, universal screening, ongoing progress monitoring tiered interventions, and data-based decision making. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734282911428200">Hughes and Rollins (2009)</xref>, the six key components for RtI/gifted are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0734282911428200" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Universal screening that examines both exceptionally high and exceptionally low student performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Early intervention to nurture the academic needs of <italic>all</italic> students.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Progress monitoring to assure that students receive the level of intervention most appropriate to their needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tiered intervention services using established procedural guides, implemented with fidelity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collaborative teams including both gifted and academic specialists to develop interventions appropriate to students’ needs and who encourage parental input and communication.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Problem-solving approaches that are applied to students who are not progressing appropriately for their abilities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The concept of a stage approach that moves students from simple thinking to complex thinking or from enrichment components to acceleration and/or individualized research opportunities are not new to the gifted field. However, what these models lack is a systematic integration of screening, student progress, and ongoing assessment data to drive appropriate services and instruction. The use of tiered approaches is not new to gifted education. Undergirding gifted education is the principle that students learn at different rates and at varying levels of complexity. Curriculum differentiation has promoted a tiered approach to service delivery for more than 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734282911428200">Tomlinson, 1999</xref>). Many states and school systems have employed a tiered approach to service delivery for gifted learners which targeted more intensive services or programs based on the degree of student precocity in a domain. Several curriculum models employed in gifted education incorporate a stage approach for talent development, including the Purdue three-stage enrichment model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734282911428200">Feldhusen &amp; Kolloff, 1986</xref>) and the Renzulli schoolwide enrichment triad model (SEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911428200">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 1985</xref>). At a practical level, RtI is effective teaching. It is an ongoing assessment of students through a strategic process, making modifications in accordance to a student’s needs and monitoring student progress in order for higher student outcomes to be realized.</p>
<p>The use of performance-based assessment that seeks to measure student pre- and postprogress has been employed in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska, Bracken, Stambaugh, &amp; Feng, 2007</xref>), and products, portfolios, and other performance-based approaches have long been advocated for gifted learners to demonstrate their ability to synthesize and apply knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911428200">Moon, Brighton, Callahan, &amp; Robinson, 2005</xref>). Yet using performance-based measures with gifted learners as part of an RtI curriculum-based protocol within a given tier has not been empirically documented. Moreover, in a meta-analysis comparing at-risk children designated as responders and low responders to interventions in reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734282911428200">Tran, Sanchez, Arellano, and Swanson’s (2011)</xref> central question addressed whether individual differences in reading-related skills at pretest predict responders at posttest across a variety of interventions. The researchers concluded that regardless of type of treatment and identification criteria, RtI conditions were not effective in mitigating learner characteristics related to pretest conditions.</p>
<p>However, can this model be successfully implemented with students in general education classrooms who exceed the normative reference group? Can RtI be adapted for students who demonstrate outstanding levels of achievement (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in the top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains? The answer lies within the interpretation and ultimately successful implementation of a tiered approach to dynamic assessment, differentiated instruction, and the use of collaborative planning.</p>
<p>There are many program and curricular models in gifted education; some address a tiered approach to instruction and interventions, whereas other models address curricular or grouping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>). Regardless of the program or curricular model employed in gifted education classrooms, it is typically not implemented consistently across states or even within the same school district. As a field, gifted education does not endorse any one approach to serving students because of the range of student abilities and resulting concomitant diverse needs. The delivery of services in gifted education is, at least in theory, consonant with RtI. To implement RtI with gifted learners, with fidelity and incorporating scientifically based practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911428200">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>), several assessment considerations need to be considered prior to implementation.</p>

<title>Assessment Considerations for Implementing RtI With Gifted Learners</title>
<sec id="section4-0734282911428200">
<title>Student exceeds curriculum benchmarks</title>
<p>Typically gifted learners are performing at above-grade-level standards, and therefore the core instruction may not be responsive to these students because, for many of them, they have already mastered the core competencies. Implementing universal screening to the students in the top 5% to 10% of the class would signal the need for more intensive intervention and enrichment in a proactive manner. Universal screening, therefore, would need to include assessments that are above grade-level standards so the gifted learners who have unique skills and interests in specific subject areas are identified. In addition, using reliable preassessment data benchmarked against the standards, rather than relying on postassessment data-only analysis, affords educators an opportunity to front-load the assessments and differentiate the curricular and instructional approaches accordingly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734282911428200">
<title>Students demonstrate ceiling effect on standardized measures</title>
<p>Julian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734282911428200">Stanley (1976)</xref> stated that most achievement tests used to identify gifted students were inappropriate because they failed to have a high-enough ceiling; in other words, most tests do not contain enough difficult items at the upper end. Tests that are calibrated to grade- or age-level norms are usually too easy for gifted learners. For example, if students enter Grade 4 already scoring at the 95th percentile on an in-grade reading assessment, the learning result on that same measure will reflect minor, if any, growth gains at the end of the year, regardless of how effective the curriculum or instructional practices were because the problem rests with the assessment, not the learner. If the same-type assessment were off level, we could assess how much further beyond grade-level expectations a gifted learner had progressed. This is the premise behind the regional talent search programs, such as Duke Talent Identification Program. Off-level assessment measures represent an important consideration in understanding gifted learners’ learning capacities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734282911428200">
<title>Content mastery</title>
<p>Content mastery refers to the inference that can be made about the student’s knowledge of a concept or domain based on the performance on the test or learning task. It is the degree to which the test or task demand measures what it purports to measure so that inferences about learning can be made and adjustments in instruction can occur. With gifted learners if the task demand is not sufficiently rigorous, the teacher may incorrectly assume an incorrect level of student mastery. The content of the task demand needs to provide an opportunity for gifted learners to demonstrate a cognitive stretch and demonstrate advanced thinking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734282911428200">Csikszentmihalyi (1990)</xref> refers to this as creating “flow.” One of the conditions for flow to occur is that the challenges of the activity are well-matched to the individual’s skills. Most teachers have difficulty creating the conditions for flow in the regular classroom. This is quite challenging, of course, with a heterogeneously grouped class. Gifted learners frequently have to wait for others to catch up because the content is not challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911428200">Rogers, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734282911428200">Robinson and Kolloff (2006)</xref> found that teachers rarely adapt instructional practices to meet the needs of the gifted. The activities and skills must continue to be complex and intellectually challenging to engage the gifted learner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734282911428200">
<title>Timing of assessment implementation</title>
<p>Most schools formally identify gifted students on an annual cycle, rather than referring students as they display advanced-learner characteristics in the classroom. One of the components of RtI is the fluidity of on-going monitoring and assessment with an emphasis on early intervention. Even in states which ensure that opportunities are provided during the screening and nomination process (prior to formal identification), the nomination and screening occurs within a limited time frame (usually at the beginning or ending of a school year). A more flexible and on-going assessment model is preferable, in my opinion, to the standard, preestablished time during the school year to screen for gifted students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734282911428200">
<title>Definition, identification, and service delivery practices</title>
<p>Assessment practices for identification purposes are linked to definitions of giftedness. Vague or even unstated definitions of giftedness and the myriad of procedures for identifying gifted and talented students have long plagued the field and have created a complex and challenging conundrum for teachers, counselors, and administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734282911428200">Pfeiffer, 2002</xref>). Definitions of giftedness and appropriate identification measures are consistently the most frequently cited barriers to identifying, placing, and providing appropriate services to gifted learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911428200">Clasen, Middleton, &amp; Connell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911428200">Maker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734282911428200">Pfeiffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911428200">Sarouphim, 1999</xref>). Concerns about assessment and identification are exacerbated for nontraditional learners who come from culturally diverse or different backgrounds, from low-SES households, or who have limited English-language proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911428200">Bracken &amp; McCallum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911428200">Ford &amp; Harmon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734282911428200">McCallum, Bracken, &amp; Wasserman, 2001</xref>). Early recognition is important for all children, but it is essential for young gifted learners from culturally diverse and economically disadvantaged backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911428200">Ford, 1996</xref>). Finally, there are many examples where students are identified “gifted” based on an aptitude or achievement measure and then placed in a classroom environment which is a “mismatch.” For example, a mathematically precocious student is identified due to her advanced mathematical ability and placed in a pull-out enrichment class that emphasizes language arts. As programs for the gifted typically emphasize higher level thinking, problem-solving, and research as central to the curriculum, appropriate assessments for learning must assess these skills; too infrequently assessments examine these areas. One promising direction is the use of performance-based measures. In an RtI framework, one can adapt curriculum-based measures as authentic measures of student growth in specific skill areas. High-ability students who are in classrooms without curricular differentiation are less likely to exhibit above-grade-level skills.</p>

<title>High-quality, research-based curriculum instruction</title>
<p>This component represents the requirement that all students receive high-quality instruction in the general education setting. It is predicated on the belief that general education instruction is research-based and that teachers assume an active role in students’ assessment in the classroom curriculum. The curricular and instructional emphases that teachers employ in general educational classrooms are driven by the relevant state content standards. Unfortunately, the content that the gifted receive in the general school program is minimal compared with what they are capable of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska, 1998</xref>). There are two issues for gifted learners; typically, the standard curriculum is not complex enough and teachers have difficulty in assessing gifted learners performance in a regular education classroom. State content standards provide useful frameworks, but too often they are minimum guidelines and are unlikely to challenge gifted students sufficiently. Second, teachers must make appropriate instructional choices with a range of students. Most teachers do not have sufficient training or resources to address the gifted learners and be knowledgeable about how to differentiate instruction effectively with gifted learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734282911428200">Westberg &amp; Daoust, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734282911428200">
<title>Universal screening</title>
<p>The universal screening component of the RtI model is where school staff, including classroom teachers, conduct universal screening of academics and behavior. Criteria for judging the achievement of all students are determined, in terms of targeting students who may require closer monitoring. Universal screening provides baseline data. In gifted education, this is analogous for casting a wide net and conducting screening for early recognition of potential. Screening for giftedness is a typical precursor to formal identification. In a survey of authorities in gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734282911428200">Pfeiffer, 2003</xref>), 41% cited the identification process as the second most pressing issue facing the field, in large part, due to the lack of technically sound screening instruments. It is a hope of many in the field of gifted education that new conceptions of giftedness will provide for a new paradigm for identifying and serving students and will help low socioeconomic and minority students become more represented in gifted programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911428200">Ford, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska, Patton, &amp; Prillaman, 1991</xref>). This new paradigm would call for more varied and authentic assessments. Instead of relying on intelligence and achievement test scores solely for identification, multiple criteria would be used when properly validated, including more nontraditional measures. Universal screening in a traditional gifted program is establishing scores that students would reach to be considered for a “talent pool.” Using an RtI framework for universal screening, schools and school systems could establish baseline scores that students would need to reach that indicate a need for differentiated and advanced instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734282911428200">Hughes, Rollins, &amp; Coleman, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734282911428200">
<title>Progress monitoring</title>
<p>Progress monitoring is gathering data systematically to determine the ongoing progress of a leaner to determine whether the student is benefitting from the instructional program. It means knowing how to assess a learner over time. This differs from universal screening in frequency and the kind of information it provides. In universal screening, a school is comparing student performance to a criterion-referenced measure. Progress monitoring, however, provides routine data that displays student growth over time. Progress monitoring is the key to planning instruction (and interventions) in Tiers 1 and 2 and assists school teams in making decisions about which level of intervention is most appropriate. In the literature, various researchers have commented on the frequencies of time for progress monitoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734282911428200">Fuchs and Fuchs (2005)</xref> recommend weekly progress monitoring in Tier 2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734282911428200">Vaughn (2003)</xref> used a system that documented progress twice a month. Frequent monitoring of student progress results in enhanced instruction. The underlying premise here is that teachers should monitor their student’s progress to determine growth over time. The implication of progress monitoring is to continue or revise placement/services. For a gifted learner, the goal is to raise achievement beyond the general education classroom; to accelerate and enrich, especially if either the universal screening or the curriculum-based measurement (CBM) demonstrated advanced skills and abilities. Gifted learners benefit greatly from curriculum experiences that go beyond and across the traditional content areas to acquire an integrated understanding of knowledge. Educators employing progress monitoring with gifted learners would require an array of CB measures that has not only a strong content base but also a conceptual one. Recent research on appropriate curriculum for gifted learners has stressed a confluent approach to differentiation of curriculum that includes both acceleration and enrichment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>). One assessment measure that has been effective in RtI and can be employed with gifted learners is the use of CBM.</p>
<p>In the RtI framework, CBM has been used as a form of progress monitoring and outcomes evaluation within a problem-solving model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734282911428200">Shinn, 2002</xref>). Within the implementation of the typical tiered services framework, CBM provides a method of continuous progress monitoring in determining whether an intervention is effective or whether the intensity or focus of the intervention should be modified. An appropriate use and adaptation of CBM in a gifted context is the use of CBM as a preassessment measure in the general education classroom to determine preexisting knowledge, skills, and readiness. The use of preassessment in gifted education to diagnostically evaluate a gifted learner’s performance prior to instruction has been widely used in classrooms to determine an authentic level of achievement and then implement pedagogical modifications matched to individual students. Preassessment has been documented as an effective tool with gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911428200">Callahan, 2005</xref>), especially if educators accept the premise that gifted students have already mastered approximately 30% of the curriculum to be taught (U.S. Department of Education, 1993). Using CBM as a preassessment holds promise for gifted education if the assessment has advanced content, allows for deep processing, and can allow students to demonstrate quality products. The use of a valid and reliable assessment for students’ academic skills has long been identified as one of the most fundamental variables related to effective educational decision making and positive student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734282911428200">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 1986</xref>). In addition, CBM can be used as a performance-based authentic assessment. Performance-based approaches, akin to curriculum-based measures, which allow gifted learners to demonstrate advanced competencies and synthesize knowledge, are now incorporated in many states in large-scale assessments. Examples of this include writing and mathematics portfolios in Vermont; writing, reading, and mathematics performance tasks and portfolios in Kentucky, and more recently, performance-based measures have been incorporated into South Carolina’s statewide identification system for gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska, Feng, &amp; Evans, 2007</xref>). Performance-based measures allow for the assessment of high-level performance and provide educators with credible evidence of student growth. Performance assessments can be used pre-, during, or postinstruction. Designers of performance assessments must carefully consider the range and purposes of tasks given in the assessment.</p>
<p>After a student has been identified to receive services, whether in a pull-out enrichment model or within the classroom where content or processes are differentiated, progress monitoring would provide information to the teacher about whether the selection of curriculum materials is sufficiently or conceptually accelerated as well as whether the instructional methods need to be modified. Monitoring should occur in all tiers, and it should be directly related to the curriculum and/or the level of service.</p>

<title>Research-based interventions at Tiers 2 and 3</title>
<p>Tiers 2 and 3 can serve different functions depending on the purpose of the RtI model. From a deficit perspective, Tier 2 can serve to implement interventions to remediate the student’s deficits. From a strength orientation, Tiers 2 and 3 can serve to accelerate or enrich a targeted strategy for gifted learners based on assessment data demonstrating a student’s proclivity in a specific domain. For example, if a gifted learner is mathematically precocious and has demonstrated above-grade-level mastery, either through universal screening on a standardized measure or through a curriculum-based measure, then the intervention for this student should focus on mathematical thinking and application. The same holds true for any domain in which a student’s assessment and screening indicate a need for above-level work. It has been posited by national reports that general education classrooms are insufficient for gifted learners (National Excellence, 1993). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911428200">Renzulli (1991)</xref> states,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The mismatch between gifted youth and the curriculum they are forced to study most of the time is nothing short of an American tragedy. The human waste in terms of both student and faculty time is inestimable, and this waste can be found in both rich schools and poor, and even in schools that have well established programs for the gifted. (pp. 75-76)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, Tiers 2 and 3 interventions for gifted learners are paramount to meeting their instructional needs because research has shown that the general educational classroom provides little differentiation in instructional and curricular practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734282911428200">Westberg, Archambault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993</xref>). Awareness and acknowledgment about differences among students’ learning propensity seems to be increasing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Acknowledging that students learn at different speeds and that they differ widely in their ability to think abstractly or understand complex ideas is like acknowledging that students at any given age aren’t all the same height. It is not a statement of worth, but of reality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734282911428200">Tomlinson, 2001</xref>, p. viii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal of Tiers 2 and 3 is to provide supplemental instruction to students for whom Tier 1 instruction is insufficient. For gifted students, this may be where “gifted education happens.” Tiers 2 and 3 should be delivered by a gifted specialist with increasing rigorous task demands, bolstered by assessment data. The implementation of Tiers 2 and 3 can occur sequentially or in combination. Currently, pull-out enrichment clusters or cluster groups of students working on advanced math would constitute a Tier 2 service model, but the difference in an RtI framework is that the Tier 2 or 3 activity or intervention would completely be driven by assessment data of the student’s needs and not just placing students in an already established enrichment cluster because the pull-out program has been in place for years, regardless of the student’s screening and progress monitoring data. Data drive programming.</p>

<title>Fidelity measures</title>
<p>Fidelity of implementation means that the delivery of instruction or intervention is delivered in the way it was designed to be delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911428200">Gresham, MacMillan, Beebe-Franklenberger, &amp; Bocian, 2000</xref>). Several studies suggest that positive student outcomes can be attributed to three related fidelity factors:</p>
<list id="list3-0734282911428200" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Fidelity of implementation of the process (at the school level)</italic>: In an RtI model, this refers to the consistency with which various components are implemented across classrooms and grade levels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Fidelity of selected interventions which are empirically supported</italic>: The degree to which the instructional practice has a strong evidence base with a given population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Fidelity of implementation of the instructional practice (at the teacher level)</italic>: It is the degree to which teachers implement the practice the way it was designed. If teachers do not implement the practice or intervention the way it was designed, students will not benefit and false assumptions may occur concluding that the problem lies with the student, as opposed to poor quality of implementation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Systematic differentiation in the gifted field is nested in teacher understanding of how to translate curriculum and instruction in appropriate ways and with diverse gifted populations. With gifted students finding empirical evidence to support the implementation of advanced instructional practices is critical. Based on the analysis of curriculum models typically employed in gifted programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>), the strongest body of research evidence supports the use of advanced curricula in core areas of learning at an accelerated rate for high-ability learners. This conclusion has not changed much in the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734282911428200">Daurio, 1979</xref>). Moreover, recent meta-analytic studies continue to confirm the superior learning effects of acceleration over enrichment in tandem with grouping the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734282911428200">Kulik, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911428200">Figure 1</xref> is a consideration of assessment measures and service delivery for gifted learners at relevant tiers within an RtI framework as a way to explicitly link assessment and progress monitoring throughout all tiers of service to overtly match services to student’s strengths. It is a structure for fidelity because it incorporates empirically based assessment protocols to concomitant student needs while matching instructional practices, like advanced content and rapid acceleration, to yield strong results with gifted learners. As important as identification is to overall program design with gifted learners, equally important is the planned interventions or services strategically planned for and implemented based on carefully monitoring student assessment data.</p>

Planned interventions must include approaches at the program, curriculum, and service levels. Although assessment and services may be planned at each tier, a comprehensive model that provides a way of thinking about the multiple uses and purposes of assessment is a way to link them together. This system allows educators to study whether our selection of students is well matched to the programs or services we deliver and whether instructional corrections are needed in the intervention phases of the program. It offers a way of providing data for making programmatic decisions at critical junctures and allows for intentional scale-up at all levels because it is guided by fidelity of implementation with flexibility to ensure expected outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>RtI’s framework is built around high-quality instruction and formative assessments (screening and progress monitoring) that match learners’ needs with research-based, appropriate instruction and curricula. In a traditional model, there are tiers of providing increasing levels of intensity of focused intervention. Tier 1 is designed for students in the general education classroom through which the core curriculum is delivered. Assessments typically employed in Tier 1 include universal screening implemented within the school year as a way to gauge all students’ educational performance. Universal screening can help identify precocious learners with unique intellectual and academic gifts. Curriculum-based measures are implemented with greater frequency and targets a smaller subset of skills. Out-of-level assessment can document unique abilities and mastery for gifted students. For gifted students, Tier 1 can also include compacting of the core curriculum, enrichment opportunities, and an emphasis on conceptual learning. Tier 2 is the structure designed to provide targeted, focused instructional interventions, typically for students who are not learning and achieving but, in gifted education, can be applied to those for which Tier 1 is insufficient and require differentiated pace, intensity, and complexity of learning. Tier 2 should include diagnostic approaches followed by prescriptive responses in terms of specific content. Students should have opportunities to engage with the content in depth because mass coverage of content is not required. Concept development should be introduced or reinforced allowing for abstraction and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911428200">Taba, 1965</xref>). Progress monitoring, a key component of RtI, can be used with gifted students to document mastery and increasing levels of knowledge acquisition, by providing routine data over time, so that opportunities and advanced materials can be provided. Intensive support or, in the case of gifted learners, rapid acceleration and opportunities for optimal student learning through in-depth investigations or research in an area of interest and ability, can best be provided through Tier 3. Tier 3 might be where a student, acting in tandem with a professional, would be provided with opportunities to “test” his or her talents through presentations or exhibits of his or her work. This is essentially authentic assessment and allows a student to develop expertise within a domain. Movement throughout the tiers is fluid and not lock-step and is assessed based on continuous progress monitoring at each tier. Gifted education uses aspects of an RtI framework but has not systematically used assessment data to drive instructional approaches. RtI is not yet an evidence-based intervention of proven validity with students with learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734282911428200">Tran, Sanchez, Arellano, &amp; Swanson, 2011</xref>), much less gifted learners. Educators of gifted learners need to ask themselves what the assessment is capable of providing, which specific outcomes of learning need to be assessed, and the purpose for which the assessment will be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911428200">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Zuo, 2011</xref>). If gifted education were to adopt the implementation of the assessment approaches systematically and coherently, the use of universal screening, curriculum-based measures, progress monitoring, and fidelity of assessment measures, then excellence could be the standard and schools would be more likely to promote talent development in all areas of the school and provide appropriate challenges for all learners.</p>
