<abstract>
<p>Extensive work has been done in North America to examine practices recommended to facilitate postschool transitions for youth with disabilities. Few studies in Australia, however, have investigated these practices. This study drew on the Taxonomy for Transition Programming developed by Kohler to benchmark practice at government and nongovernment schools throughout Queensland, Australia. A statewide survey was used to gather data from teachers and other influential staff (<italic>N</italic> = 104). Participants were asked to (a) indicate their level of agreement that each practice was a program quality indicator and (b) report on the current use of that practice in school programs. Transition practices in the areas of Family–School Relationships, Student Development, and student-focused planning were strongly endorsed and frequently implemented. Lower levels of endorsement and implementation, however, were signaled in the areas of Interagency Collaboration and Program Structure. Recommendations for reform at the school, systems, and interagency levels are provided.</p>

<p>Increasingly, teachers around the globe are being asked to show “evidence of meeting standards, benchmarks, and indicators” related to quality practice and practice improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022466910366602">Otis-Wilborn, Winn, Ford, &amp; Keyes, 2000</xref>, p. 20). Today, as in the past, inquiry into best practice is making an important contribution in this area. In best practice inquiry, sets of literature-based practices are identified and are then subjected to expert opinion, professional consensus, or social validation to become practice standards or indicators of program quality. Hence, research of this kind allows individuals within a service to consider their everyday practice and evaluate their performance against predetermined practice standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022466910366602">Everitt &amp; Hardiker, 1996</xref>). This process of benchmarking, moreover, is not viewed to be the endpoint of activity. Often, benchmarking is seen to serve as a beginning point to direct efforts (individual and collective) toward professional development, program improvement, workplace reform, and systems change. Within the educational context, this approach <italic>presumes that</italic> teacher adoption of practice standards leads to improved teaching and learning and, ultimately, to improved student outcomes.</p>
<p>Benchmarking teachers’ everyday practice against identified “best” or ideal practice is a well-established procedure in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022466910366602">Peters &amp; Heron, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022466910366602">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Perhaps the ongoing need for special educators to demonstrate educational effectiveness with their difficult-to-teach student population has contributed to the ongoing popularity of best practice research in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>). Appeal also may be related to the notion that benchmarking provides opportunity for participating teachers to reflect systematically on the complexity and status of their current teaching practice. As confirmed recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466910366602">Cook, Tankersley, and Landrum (2009)</xref>, teaching practice is an aspect on which special educators have focused attention because it is “one determinant of student outcomes over which they have always exercised primary control” (p. 365).</p>
<p>The first set of comprehensive best practice inquiries were undertaken in the area of severe disabilities. Pioneering U.S.-based work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466910366602">Atkins, Campbell, and Hartley (1987)</xref> in Mississippi and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022466910366602">Williams, Fox, Thousand, and Fox (1990)</xref> in Vermont was aimed to appraise the quality of public educational programs for this particular student population. Both inquiries drew on a best practice listing developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910366602">Fox et al. (1986)</xref> to conduct statewide surveys of practitioner and parent stakeholders. Both inquiries reported that moderate to high levels of participant endorsement (level of agreement) were accompanied by lower levels of actual use (level of implementation) and that a substantial gap existed between endorsement of best practice (agreement) and actual practice use (implementation). Assorted benchmarking inquiries related to the education of this student population followed in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910366602">Ayres, Meyer, Erevelles, &amp; Park-Lee, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022466910366602">Eichinger &amp; Downing, 1992</xref>) and in Australia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022466910366602">Beamish, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910366602">Chalmers, Carter, Clayton, &amp; Hook, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022466910366602">Stephenson &amp; Carter, 2005</xref>). All studies furnished confirmatory agreement and implementation data that highlighted the need for schools and education systems to bridge the research to practice gap.</p>
<p>Complementary inquiries also have been undertaken in the area of transition from school to adult life for students with disabilities. Over the past 15 years, “best practices have been identified in both skills needed by students and processes needed to support transition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910366602">Lubbers, Repetto, &amp; McGorray, 2008</xref>, p. 281). One of the most comprehensive and widely accepted frameworks of quality transition practice is the Taxonomy for Transition Programming, developed by Kohler and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022466910366602">Kohler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466910366602">Kohler &amp; Field, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022466910366602">Test, Aspel, and Everson (2006)</xref>, Kohler’s taxonomy is the only research-based transition model in the literature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022466910366602">Figure 1</xref> presents the Taxonomy for Transition Programming, with practices organized according to five key areas indicative of successful transition-focused programming and an outcome-oriented planning process. These areas are Student-Focused Planning, Student Development, Interagency Collaboration, Family Involvement, and Program Structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>Kohler’s taxonomy has provided the foundation for extensive tool development in the United States across the past decade. For example, the taxonomy was the starting point for the well-known Transition Specialist Competencies generated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022466910366602">Division on Career Development and Transition (2000)</xref> and the distinguished Standards for the Preparation of Transition Specialists published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466910366602">Council for Exceptional Children (2001)</xref>. By comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910366602">Anderson et al. (2003)</xref> used a supplementary competency-oriented tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466910366602">Kohler, 2000</xref>) and the Standards for the Preparation of Transition Specialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466910366602">Council for Exceptional Children, 2001</xref>) to generate the <italic>Secondary Transition Program Survey</italic>. This instrument was subsequently used in a national survey to examine the quality of personnel preparation in transition. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022466910366602">Wandry et al. (2008)</xref> adapted the five areas of Kohler’s taxonomy when constructing a section of a tool aimed to measure preservice teachers’ perceived levels of instruction and competence in transition-focused education.</p>
<p>In the United States, these and many other research-based transition initiatives have worked in concert with federal special education regulations to improve postschool student outcomes through boosting the effectiveness of transition services and the competencies of transition staff. Statewide survey-based inquiries into transition practice have been particularly instrumental in providing feedback on the status of transition-focused programs and in providing stimulus for systems change. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466910366602">McMahan and Baer (2001)</xref> reported general compliance with mandated policy and regulations but not widespread use of best practices among 105 transition teams in Ohio. On a smaller scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022466910366602">Thoma, Held, and Saddler (2002)</xref> found that the majority of special educators (<italic>N</italic> = 84) in Nevada and Arizona demonstrated effective knowledge about particular transition assessment practices but did not use these practices to support student self-determination. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022466910366602">Zhang, Ivester, Chen, and Katsiyannis (2005)</xref> concluded from their investigation into the quality of school and district transition services throughout South Carolina that schools had done only “an adequate job” (p. 23) in addressing crucial transition practices. Findings from a recent inquiry by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910366602">Lubbers et al. (2008)</xref> reported that teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 492) and district transition contacts (<italic>n</italic> = 41) throughout Florida identified system and policy issues and information and training as key barriers to the transition process.</p>
<p>In the United States, extensive research efforts and substantial policy reform have progressively led to improvements in transition programs and practices. By comparison, Australian inquiries into the transition from school to adult life for youth with disabilities have been sparse. Moreover, specific policy or rigorous guidelines related to transition-focused education for students with disabilities have not been put in place by any educational system in this country. Furthermore, no nationally mandated set of transition practices in Australia compare to those found in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910366602">Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022466910366602">1997)</xref> and its amendments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466910366602">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004</xref>) in the United States.</p>
<p>Australian transition literature, in journals and postings on government and nongovernment Web sites, is primarily composed of reports. In the main, these reports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022466910366602">Centre for Disability Research and Development, Edith Cowan University, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910366602">Hudson, Carr, Dowsett, &amp; Moroney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022466910366602">Laragy, 2004</xref>) provide descriptions of transition models, program content, and some recommendations for future action. They do not feature any hard data about actual transition practice or student outcomes. One notable exception has been the New South Wales transition initiative (for a comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022466910366602">Riches, 1996</xref>). This transition project, which began as a pilot in 1989, led to several reports that described program features and identified student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022466910366602">Parmenter &amp; Riches, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022466910366602">Riches, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022466910366602">Riches &amp; Parmenter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022466910366602">Riches, Parmenter, Fegent, &amp; Bailey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022466910366602">Riches, Parmenter, &amp; Robertson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022466910366602">Watters, Riches, &amp; Parmenter, 1993</xref>). These reports provided commentary about the pivotal role that both government and educational sectors played in the development of a strategic policy and plan to support effective transition practices for students with disabilities in that state. Findings, however, were not translated into government policy or mandates. Taken together, the paucity of legislative frameworks and practice guidelines throughout Australian states and territories set the agenda for a benchmarking inquiry into postschool transition practices in Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>This current study was part of a larger study that investigated the relationship between outcomes for students with intellectual disability, autism, and dual diagnosis and the transition practices in place throughout Queensland state, independent, or Catholic education sectors (i.e., secondary schools, secondary special education units and classes, and special schools in the sectors). The study was restricted to this specific student population because the transition practices used with these groups of students were of particular interest to the government department funding the investigation. To date, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466910366602">Meadows (2009)</xref> has provided an overview of the total study and major recommendation and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910366602">Davies and Beamish (2009)</xref> have reported the findings of a statewide parent survey.</p>
<p>The present study sought to benchmark the current practice of teachers and other influential staff involved in the school to postschool transition for this specific student population. Two research questions framed the study:</p>
<list id="list1-0022466910366602" list-type="bullet">

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>As in the parent survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910366602">Davies &amp; Beamish, 2009</xref>), this study used a statewide survey methodology. A direct field-based sampling procedure was employed but varied across sectors. For the government sector, this procedure involved using an electronic listing of schools to invite the participation of staff involved in transition programs. For the nongovernment sectors (independent and Catholic education), designated officers invited their respective schools to participate. In all, 198 schools (secondary, secondary education units and classes, and special schools) were requested to provide individual e-mail addresses of interested teachers and influential staff to the research team. In all, 220 potential participants were identified through this process: 90 from special education units in state secondary schools, 90 from state special schools, 20 from independent schools, and 20 from catholic schools.</p>
<p>All participants were subsequently e-mailed instructions on how to access an online survey and given 1 month to respond. Within 2 weeks, many participants communicated that they were experiencing technical difficulties in completing the survey “online.” In response, a hard copy of the survey was mailed to all participants. A 3-week time frame for completion was requested. Incoming responses were collated, and two reminders were sent to participants. A total of 104 useable surveys (online and hard copy) were received, constituting a response rate of 47.3%. This return rate compared more than favorably to similar U.S.-based statewide transition studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910366602">Lubbers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022466910366602">Thoma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022466910366602">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466910366602">Table 1</xref> presents demographic information on staff who completed the present benchmark survey. Staff were evenly spread between secondary and special schools, with a majority of schools (61%) located in an urban area. Slightly more than half of the participants were male. The majority of participants (63%) were classroom teachers, and 20% were heads of special education services. School transition officers (6%) and principals (5%) composed the remainder of the sample. Almost half (44%) of the sample possessed a special education qualification at the undergraduate or postgraduate level. The modal number of years of teaching experience was 15 years, with 32% having little experience (1–3 years) in the area of transition education, 35% a moderate amount (4–8 years), and 34% a great deal of experience (9–20 years). Of the participants, 52% reported that they had had previous experience in an industry other than education.</p>

<title>The Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The benchmark survey comprised 8 demographic items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022466910366602">Table 1</xref>) and 46 practice items. Practice item statements were generated from a range of material developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466910366602">Kohler (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910366602">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910366602">2003b)</xref> for staff reflection on practices recommended in her taxonomy. Items were clustered according to the taxonomy’s five practice areas.</p>
<p>Items were then refined and field tested using a three-step process. First, the research team considered the statements in terms of perceived levels of importance, measurability, and relevance to the Queensland context. Second, a highly experienced school transition officer reviewed the practice items and made several editorial suggestions. Third, a group of 10 experienced transition teachers from the state and Catholic school sectors reviewed the practices, item by item. This process resulted in further editorial revisions to the wording of particular practice items and the labeling of one practice area (i.e., Family Involvement was renamed Family–School Relationships because of practice item content). The need for a glossary of key terms (e.g., transition planning documents, work experience) also was identified, and this material was generated and embedded in the survey.</p>
<p>A total of 46 practice items, with abbreviated descriptors, resulted from this process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022466910366602">Table 2</xref>). Item distribution across practice areas was as follows: Student-Focused Planning (<italic>n</italic> = 9), Student Development (<italic>n</italic> = 10), Interagency Collaboration (<italic>n</italic> = 7), Family–School Relationships (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and Program Structure (<italic>n</italic> = 13). Demographic and practice items were then incorporated into an online survey using a package developed at Griffith University called <italic>Surveymaker</italic>.</p>

<p>The survey format involved three parts. Part 1 aimed to collect demographic information using fixed-response questions. Parts 2 and 3 provided a relevant glossary of terms before presenting each of the 46 practice item statements for a response using a six-category response format. In Part 2, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed that each of the transition practices was an indicator of program quality. This level of agreement was rated on a continuum consisting of <italic>completely disagree</italic>, <italic>disagree</italic>, <italic>inclined to disagree</italic>, <italic>inclined to agree</italic>, <italic>agree</italic>, and <italic>completely agree</italic>. In Part 3, participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they implemented each practice in their school programs. This level of implementation was rated on a continuum consisting of <italic>not at all</italic>, <italic>infrequently</italic>, <italic>not very much</italic>, <italic>on a few occasions</italic>, <italic>frequently</italic>, and <italic>very frequently</italic>. In addition, comments on each of the five practice areas on the survey were sought in Parts 2 and 3 and a final open-ended comment was invited at the end of Part 3.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022466910366602">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The quantitative components of the benchmark survey were analyzed using SPSS. The first step in these analyses was to use a data-collapsing strategy to decrease the number of response categories. The systematic collapsing of categories is a well-established procedure in survey research methodology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910366602">Babbie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910366602">Goldberg &amp; Williams, 1988</xref>) and in best practice research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910366602">Chalmers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466910366602">Odom, McLean, Johnson, &amp; LaMontagne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022466910366602">Stephenson &amp; Carter, 2005</xref>). In the present study, the collapsing of categories was aimed to facilitate inferences about decision making related to levels of agreement and implementation. For level of agreement, the two lowest levels (<italic>completely disagree</italic> and <italic>disagree</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>disagreement</italic>. The two middle levels (<italic>inclined to disagree</italic> and <italic>inclined to agree</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>uncertain</italic>, whereas the two highest ratings (<italic>agree</italic> and <italic>completely agree</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>agreement</italic>. Similarly, for levels of implementation, the two lowest levels (<italic>not at all</italic> and <italic>infrequently</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>nonimplementation</italic>. The two middle levels (<italic>not very much</italic> and <italic>on a few occasions</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>uncertain</italic>, whereas the two highest ratings (<italic>frequently</italic> and <italic>very frequently</italic>) were combined and labeled <italic>implementation</italic>. These labels for the combined ratings are used as measures of agreement and implementation throughout this article. The rationale for combining the categories in this manner was that, for both agreement and implementation, the two lowest ratings were a clear indication of a lack of agreement with, or commitment to, the item as an indicator of program quality or of nonimplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>). Conversely, the two highest ratings indicated either a strong agreement with or commitment to the item as an indicator of program quality or a high rating for implementation. In contrast, the two middle ratings indicated a degree of uncertainty about commitment to or implementation of the practice and so could be grouped together.</p>
<p>The examination of levels of agreement and implementation used well-known benchmarking conventions. For level of agreement, both the 50% criterion level of agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466910366602">Odom et al., 1995</xref>) and the more stringent 80% criterion level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022466910366602">Williams et al., 1990</xref>) were used. For level of implementation, the traditional 50% criterion level for implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910366602">Beamish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022466910366602">Odom et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022466910366602">Williams et al., 1990</xref>) was used.</p>
<p>To provide an alternative approach to analyzing levels of agreement and implementation, the response categories were assumed to have interval value. Each category was allocated a numerical value for level of agreement (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> = 1, <italic>disagree</italic> = 2, <italic>inclined to disagree</italic> = 3, <italic>inclined to agree</italic> = 4, <italic>agree</italic> = 5, and <italic>completely agree</italic> = 6) and for level of implementation (<italic>not at all</italic> = 1, <italic>infrequently</italic> = 2, <italic>not very much</italic> = 3, <italic>on a few occasions</italic> = 4, <italic>frequently</italic> = 5, and <italic>very frequently</italic> = 6). This allocation of numerical values provided the opportunity to analyze responses using descriptive statistics for each item and for each practice area.</p>

<p>All items met the traditional 50% benchmark levels for agreement and implementation. In addition, the more stringent 80% benchmark level for agreement was met by seven (77.8%) of the items. A closer inspection of data revealed that for seven of the nine items, levels of agreement and implementation were similar. Items with the highest discrepancies between levels of agreement and implementation were 1.7 (students taught to take active role) and 1.8 (planning for and use of adjustments). These two items also displayed very high levels of uncertainty for implementation (43% and 34%, respectively) and high levels of uncertainty for agreement (22% and 17%, respectively).</p>

Almost all participants (ranging from 86% to 98%) agreed with the practices, whereas a slightly smaller proportion (ranging from 80% to 94%) reported implementing them. All items met three benchmarks: the 50% and 80% benchmarks for agreement and the 50% benchmark for implementation. In fact, the items also met an 80% level for implementation.

<p>All items met the traditional 50% benchmark level for agreement, with only six (46%) of the items meeting the 80% benchmark. A close inspection of the seven items that did meet this stringent benchmark revealed that all but one of them did not reach the 50% implementation benchmark. It followed that the majority (five of the seven items) had high agreement–implementation discrepancies. Items with the highest discrepancies between agreement and implementation were 5.1 (program philosophy and policy documented), 5.2 (families contribute to overall planning), 5.5 (systemic transition personnel identified), 5.7 (strategic planning at the system level), 5.8 (ongoing evaluation by the school), 5.10 (evaluation at 12 months postschool), 5.11 (training available to teachers), 5.12 (training available to other school staff), and 5.13 (training available to families and providers). The majority of these items were also characterized by high levels of uncertainty.</p>

<title>Summary of Quantitative Data</title>
<p>To provide an overview of the quantitative data, mean levels of agreement and implementation were compared across the five practice areas. Comparisons focus on mean percentages and then on mean ratings. Both comparisons furnish complementary patterns of agreement and implementation.</p>
<p>A graphic comparison of mean percentages is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022466910366602">Figure 2</xref>. Taken as a whole, high levels of agreement were accompanied by lower levels of implementation. For level of agreement, all practice areas met the 50% international benchmark, with three of the five areas meeting the more stringent 80% criterion (Family–School Relationships, Student Development, and Student-Focused Planning). Likewise, for level of implementation, all practice areas met the 50% criterion. The areas of Interagency Collaboration and Program Structure, however, only just met this benchmark and were the lowest on agreement compared to the other practice areas. In contrast, the area of Family–School Relationships showed a position of prominence by exceeding a 90% level of agreement and a slightly lower level of implementation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from this benchmark survey produced an initial view of practice throughout Queensland transition programs for youth with intellectual disability and autism. This view of practice was provided by a substantial cohort of teachers and other influential staff (<italic>N</italic> = 104) who were asked to provide data related to ideal practice (agreement that a specific transition practice was an indicator of program quality) and actual practice (everyday implementation of that transition practice in their particular school program). Overall, three key findings emerged from this benchmarking of practice (ideal and actual). First, the level of practice agreement was sufficiently high to socially validate the North American practices within the Australian context. Second, Family–School Relationships emerged as an area of practice strength. Third, high agreement–implementation discrepancy patterns in the areas of Interagency Collaboration and Program Structure provided cause for concern.</p>
<sec id="section13-0022466910366602">
<title>Validation of Transition Practices</title>
<p>Participant endorsement of transition practices drawn from Kohler’s work was a key feature of this study. All practices (<italic>N</italic> = 46) met the 50% benchmark criterion for level of agreement, which signified that participants identified each and every practice to be an indicator of program quality. Moreover, consensus among participants was so strong that 33 of the practices (72%) met the more stringent 80% benchmark criterion. Allocation of such high levels of agreement provided a Queensland validation of the North American practices. This outcome confirms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910366602">Ashman’s (1990)</xref> assertion that the Australian practice base for working with individuals with intellectual impairment draws substantially on that established in North America. It also is testament to the recommendation that “there is nothing wrong with basing our efforts on accumulated knowledge. The error (if there is one) is not validating this knowledge in our own political, legal, and service provision structures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910366602">Ashman, 1990</xref>, p. 180).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022466910366602">
<title>Family–School Relationships</title>
<p>Practices within Family–School Relationships were the most highly valued and most frequently implemented compared to those in other practice areas. This finding is not surprising given the familiarity with and expectation of collaborative family–teacher relationships that both teachers and family members experience as a result of the individualized education program meeting process. It was highly likely, therefore, that participants had sound knowledge and competence in this practice area, and as such they perceived these practices as ones over which they have substantial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910366602">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022466910366602">Wandry et al., 2008</xref>). Studies from the United States report that the involvement of parents in the transition planning process for students with disabilities is vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910366602">Ankeny, Wilkins, &amp; Spain, 2009</xref>), is a common practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022466910366602">Kraemer &amp; Blacher, 2001</xref>), and is viewed as a key factor in improving student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022466910366602">Defur, Todd-Allen, &amp; Getzel, 2001</xref>). In this Queensland study, family involvement in planning processes and meetings and providing families with transition aims and options were the most strongly endorsed family–school practices. However, the more empowering practices related to families leading decision making and negotiating roles with families were less supported and were accompanied by levels of greater uncertainty. This trend is consistent with North American findings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022466910366602">Defur et al. (2001)</xref> reported that parental views on the transition process were not highly valued or listened to and that despite a high level of parental attendance at meetings, attendance did not always translate into meaningful collaboration. It would appear that participants in this Queensland study were reticent about empowering parents to be equal or leading collaborative partners in the transition planning process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022466910366602">
<title>Interagency Collaboration and Program Structure</title>
<p>By comparison, practices within the areas of Interagency Collaboration and Program Structure were assigned the lowest overall ratings by participants for both agreement and implementation and were also characterized by the largest agreement–implementation discrepancies. For Interagency Collaboration, this pattern of poor endorsement and implementation of transition practices may have been related to postschool agencies not being funded to engage with school students and their teachers. On the other hand, teachers may have had little experience in working with community agencies and may have been unsure about their role in partnering with these staff. Moreover, Queensland teachers, in common with their North American counterparts, may have limited knowledge of the postschool sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910366602">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910366602">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). Whatever the reasons for the low practice ratings, the current relationships between school staff and postschool agencies in Queensland are problematic. More formal collaborative structures between sectors need to be developed locally between schools and agencies and at the cross-departmental systems level.</p>
<p>For Program Structure, almost half of the practices were characterized by very low levels of implementation and high levels of uncertainty. These practices focused not only on staff and parent training but also on program policy, program evaluation, and strategic planning at local and state levels. This correlation of practice ratings suggests a lack of commitment to and support for transition-focused education at the school and systems levels. Teachers in Florida recently identified similar issues and proposed clarity on policy and systemic planning as a primary solution in their efforts to improve transition practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910366602">Lubbers et al., 2008</xref>). A search of Web sites across Queensland education sectors reveals little information and no specific policy on transition-focused education. This lack of policy and strategic direction may account for the reported confusion about staff roles and responsibilities in this overarching practice area. Given that good program practice requires a sound policy base, there is an urgent need in Queensland for government and nongovernment sectors to position transition-focused education within their established policy and procedures frameworks.</p>

<title>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Findings from this study provide an initial benchmarking of transition practice in Queensland, Australia. Because transition-focused education for students with disabilities across Australia is not driven by nationally determined policies, transition standards, or accountability measures, these findings may apply in varying degrees to other states. Findings, however, should be considered with a number of limitations kept in mind. First, sampling bias was evident in participation selection, with only interested teachers and other influential staff at government and nongovernment secondary and special schools completing the survey. Bias was further magnified by problems experienced in the online survey. The views expressed by the 104 participants who persevered and contributed data to the study may not necessarily represent the views of the majority of staff involved in transition programs throughout Queensland. Second, the present study relied on participants to indicate practice agreement and implementation using (a) predetermined practice statements and (b) a range of fixed-response categories. These self-reported data may not have adequately captured genuine beliefs about ideal practice for certain educational communities. Although anonymous, self-reported data also may not always provide an accurate snapshot of actual practice at particular transition programs, such field-based research is crucially important in the planning of research and evaluation as it relates to internal and statistical conclusion validity. The former form of validity relates to the effectiveness of programs or interventions, whereas the latter refers to the degree to which conclusions reached about relationships in data are reasonable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466910366602">Gravetter &amp; Forzano, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The benchmarks identified as a result of this initial study point to the need for further Australian research at a number of levels. At a district level, in-depth cases studies involving individual teachers and schools could provide a better understanding of practice implementation and identify solution-focused strategies for practice improvement (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910366602">Lubbers et al., 2008</xref>). At a state level, a longitudinal inquiry across schools and educational sectors could investigate the effect of specific policy and strategic directions on transition practice and student outcomes if such initiatives were put in place at a systems level (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022466910366602">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). At a national level, the current study could be replicated to provide an initial comparison of transition practice across states (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022466910366602">Thoma et al., 2002</xref>). These data could then be used to develop Australian benchmarks for transition practice, which in turn could be incorporated into standards of practice (at a professional level) and a national evaluation tool (at a systems level). Moreover, other countries may consider replicating elements of this study to develop their distinct transition benchmarks, standards of practice, and evaluation tools.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Findings from the present study signal an urgent need for action—at the teacher, school, and systems levels. Much could be achieved if teachers adopted a more proactive stance and partnered differently with significant “others” in the transition process. As “teacher leaders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022466910366602">Hook &amp; Vass, 2002</xref>, p. 10), they have the capacity to create situations where students and parents can meaningfully contribute in decision making about postschool life, families can be empowered to press for better postschool options, and postschool providers can feel more valued. Moreover, at a school level, they can team with administration and other school staff to build a more responsive school culture that can generate documents and structures related to local school philosophy, transition policy, and interagency cooperation. Furthermore, this bottom-up approach can extend its zone of influence through schools and districts to put pressure on the wider system to commit to transition-focused education for students with disabilities. System commitment should translate into the formulation of specific transition policies and procedures, the establishment of cross-departmental management structures to assist school leavers and their families, and the provision of specific training opportunities for school staff and parents. Teachers, schools, and systems all have a responsibility to ensure that transition policies, structures, and practices are in place to support the achievement of positive postschool pathways for youth with intellectual disability and autism in Queensland.</p>
