<p>This introductory editorial highlights the importance of cross-cultural comparative studies for research, policy making, and prevention efforts in order to improve the lives of young people. It reviews the paucity of large-scale cross-cultural studies that investigate young people’s health. These concern in particular challenges in establishing not only collaborations but also the application of sophisticated quantitative methods that can address the nested characteristics of cross-cultural data. Interestingly, findings from the five articles included in this special issue reveal far more cultural similarities than differences. For instance, the impact and relationship that parents and peers exert on young adolescents appears consistent across countries. In line with two invited commentaries, recommendations for prevention and policy making are provided.</p>

<p>How different are young adolescents in Europe, North America and other parts of the world? This is one of the broad questions that emerged from the five contributions to this special issue. Generally, psychosocial research on young people’s health behaviors, health conditions, and related aspects has proliferated in the last three decades. This research was mainly initiated in North America but is expanding rapidly across many European countries and other parts of the world. Yet cross-cultural studies that involve more than a handful of countries or regions are still scarce.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431611432714">
<title>Need for Cross-Cultural Research</title>
<p>This is surprising given the high importance of cross-cultural studies for research, policy making, and prevention to improve the lives of young people. First, from a sociological perspective, cross-cultural studies enable us to investigate and disentangle the impact of different socialization agents at different levels, that is, the proximal social environment (parents, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) and the cultural context. It is commonplace that individual behavior is shaped by social interactions and norms. Still, only few studies have included both the proximal social environment and cultural characteristics. In one such study, we investigated the television viewing of more than 150,000 adolescents from 34 cultures and concluded that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>not only the amount of television viewing in the immediate social context—family members, friends, classmates, and neighbors—but that also that in the broader social context—the community, region, or country—is associated with an individual’s perception of a lack of classmate support. Television viewing may create a collective “television-biased” unsupportive view of classmates that is culture specific. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611432714">Kuntsche, Overpeck, &amp; Dallago, 2008</xref>, p. 103)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, depending on collective television viewing in the culture in the individual television viewing had a different impact:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It appears that in countries with a high amount of television viewing, everyone is affected and not only those who watch high amounts of television; [. . .] the culture of high television viewing appears to explain most of the television viewing specific variance in the perception of a lack of classmate support, so it is less important if individual adolescents watch a high amount of television. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611432714">Kuntsche et al., 2008</xref>, p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is just one example demonstrating the importance of considering individual behavior within a cultural context.</p>
<p>Second, cross-national results on adolescent health behavior are highly important for policy makers. Whenever we publish our new national data on, for example, adolescents’ smoking and drinking behaviors including trends over the last two decades, the first question of policy makers and the media is “And what about the neighboring countries? Where do we stand in comparison? When will the international results be released?” Underlying these questions are, of course, concerns regarding the efficacy of national drug policies that can only be determined within the international context and national history. Therefore, comparable substance use data from other countries are needed together with consideration of what is feasible and acceptable in a given culture.</p>
<p>Third, for prevention purposes within public health, cross-cultural studies are needed to provide evidence on the potential that a given (successful) program can be readily transferred from one culture to another. This is particularly important for European and developing countries since the majority of the prevention projects has been designed, implemented, and evaluated in North America. However, this problem can even be seen when adapting a prevention program from one European country to another. For example, although quite similar in terms of traditional drinking culture (i.e., both are rather northern, traditionally non-wine producing countries), cross-cultural research has shown that Sweden and the Netherlands differ with respect to mean age of first alcohol consumption and adolescents’ (heavy) drinking prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611432714">Currie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611432714">Hibell et al., 2009</xref>). Aiming to implement in the Netherlands a prevention program focusing on early adolescents that was successful in delaying drinking in Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611432714">Koning et al. (2009)</xref> was confronted to the question to what degree the program could be readily transferred or had to be culturally adapted.</p>

<title>Challenges of Cross-Cultural Research</title>
<p>Despite the abovementioned importance of cross-cultural studies for research, policy makings, and prevention to improve the lives of young people, in my eyes, there are two main reasons for the paucity of large cross-cultural studies to investigate young people’s health. First, such an endeavor requires the collaboration and coordination of many researchers with different cultural and scientific backgrounds. This appears simple and commonplace. Put into practice, however, it often requires ample resources and high compliance of everyone involved. One prominent requirement is the development of a common research protocol for which some questions (e.g., early physical maturation or family wealth) are considered to address an important public health issue in one country while they appear too sensitive or even offensive in the cultural context of another country. Other notable issues that complicate cross-country collaboration are diverging national health policies and priorities, varying current health needs or problems in a given country, and the different scientific background, interest, or work area of the national researchers involved. All these aspects mean that far-reaching compromises have to be negotiated in often long-lasting discussions to meet the requirements of as many countries as possible.</p>
<p>Though requiring a lot of effort, resources and time the potential output of international collaborations of this type is very large indeed often resulting in fascinating projects, rich in complex information. The present special issue provides two examples of a successful cross-national collaboration, that is, the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611432714">de Looze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611432714">Farhat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611432714">Ottova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611432714">Tabak et al., 2012</xref>) and the Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432714">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>). The former includes currently 43 mostly European and North American countries and regions (for further information see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hbsc.org">www.hbsc.org</ext-link>) whereas in the latter nearly all regions of the world are represented by 15 countries in total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611432714">Trommsdorff &amp; Nauck, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The second major challenge concerns the statistical analysis once the multinational data are collected. To compare the countries to each other, a multiple-group approach can be applied when there are a limited number of countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611432714">Farhat et al. (2012)</xref>, for example, used two-way interactions between peer alcohol use and a country identifier to investigate whether the association of peer and adolescent alcohol use significantly differed among adolescents from Greece, Scotland, Switzerland, and the United States. Obviously, when the aim of the study is to compare the different impact of cultural characteristics on relationships within a country (as it was for Farhat and colleagues), this technique gets increasingly demanding with an increasing number of countries (regions, ethnicities, or other culture-specific units) and almost impossible with a large number of countries. More recently, multilevel modeling has been developed as powerful statistical tool to analyze clustered data structures, that is, when individuals are grouped within a large number of units (e.g., schools or countries). Aside from automatically adjusting for cluster effects that leads to underestimated standard errors and biased significance levels when ignored, multilevel modeling allows for the investigation of variance between and within groups. Additionally, the information of the higher level units may explain or serve as moderator in relationships between health behaviors and social determinants at the individual level.</p>
<p>This special issue offers two such applications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611432714">Ottova et al. (2012)</xref> investigated the relationship between both individual-level (family, peers, school) and country-level factors to explain psychosomatic complaints in young adolescents. The authors found that adolescents living in less privileged countries report more psychosomatic complaints even after controlling for the individual living conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432714">Schwarz et al. (2012)</xref> investigated whether the associations between the relationship to parents and peers and life satisfaction in early adolescents differed depending on the importance of family values in the respective culture. Their analyses revealed that the more the children admired their parents, the higher was the children’s life satisfaction across all cultures. For another social relationship, peer acceptance, this link was country specific: the more important family values were in the respective culture, the lower was the association between peer acceptance and participants’ life satisfaction. In conclusion, the authors argue that actions to improve life satisfaction in early adolescence should be sensitive to the prevailing cultural norms and values.</p>

<title>Culturally Different and Yet Alike</title>
<p>The results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432714">Schwarz et al. (2012)</xref>, that is, that the impact of parents was similar across countries and the one of peers differed across countries, raise the general question of how different adolescents from different countries actually are. The article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611432714">de Looze et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrates in this respect that a significant link between early risk behaviors and later injury exists among the 47,106 adolescents included in the study and that this link is consistent in strength among all the 25 countries. The authors concluded that the relation between early risk behaviors and physical injuries may not be extensively influenced by cultural factors.</p>
<p>Based on a sample of almost 200,000 11- and 13-year-olds from 16 countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611432714">Tabak et al. (2012)</xref> analyzed changes in communication with parents about matters of concern over a 12-year period (i.e., from 1993/1994 to 2005/2006). The reported results showed a convergence between countries in parent-child communication. This means that in different Eastern and Western European countries, family characteristics change in a way that they become more and more similar, regardless of the economic status of the country, culture, history, and geographical position.</p>
<p>This synchronization of adolescent experiences and the great similarity in behaviors across countries, which were also observed with respect to excessive alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611432714">Kuntsche et al., 2011</xref>), may have multiple reasons. It might be related to globalization in terms of worldwide flow of capital, goods, services, and information. There are also increased political, legal, and cultural exchanges in the way that people in various countries watch the same movies and television soaps, visit the same internet websites, enjoy the same music broadcasted and merchandized worldwide, eat the same (fast) food and drink the same beverages that come from and are available all over the world. Moreover, electronic media communication facilities (text messaging/SMS, Skype, Facebook, etc.) operating across national boundaries are available and heavily used by an increasing number of adolescents in an increasing number of countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611432714">Kuntsche &amp; Labhart, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611432714">Kuntsche et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, while adolescents are becoming more and more alike across countries, adolescent subcultures within the countries persist. For example, based on answers from more than 18,000 15-year-olds from 10 European countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611432714">Ter Bogt et al. (in press)</xref> found a highly consistent factor structure of music genres in all countries. In other words, adolescents’ musical preferences were more similar across countries than within the countries. Finally, it is also simply possible that socialization processes and experiences as well as measures of adjustment and adolescent behaviors are more similar than different, simply related to the fact that culture plays a much smaller role than previously surmised, but also that youth across cultures are simply not very different. At this point, the same conclusion as De Looze et al. or Tabak et al. seems warranted, namely that the culture of a specific country does not, or perhaps no longer, play a major role in the developmental processes of youth, in the lives of adolescents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611432714">Ter Bogt et al. (in press)</xref> also demonstrate that despite the fact that the classification of music genres was similar across countries, preferring a specific kind of music had a different impact on substance use behaviors in the different countries. For example, while listening to “urban” music (e.g., hip-hop, R &amp; B, reggae) was unrelated to tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use in Belgium, Estonia, Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, it was significantly negatively related in Macedonia and Spain and significantly positively related in Greece, Ireland, and Switzerland. Culture therefore may have less effect on health behavior itself but may moderate the relationship between health and its social correlates.</p>

<sec id="section4-0272431611432714">
<title>Recommendations for Policy Making, Prevention, and Research</title>
<p>Taken these considerations together, what can we recommend to current and future policy making and prevention? Although aspects of feasibility and cultural acceptability always require sound considerations within a given country, the basis on which measures can be discussed and potentially implemented is likely to become increasingly homogenous so that it is easier to learn from other countries’ policies. Policy making may therefore be facilitated when adolescent behaviors, values, relationships, living circumstances, and so forth become increasingly similar across countries. For prevention, this means that programs are more likely to be successfully transferred from one culture to another.</p>
<p>However, this conclusion does not signify that one global one-size-fits-all prevention or policy approach is likely to be successful. To the contrary, it appears that the needs of subgroups of adolescents within the countries are not yet sufficiently taken into account. In the commentaries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611432714">Swahn (2012)</xref> highlights, for example, the unmet mental health and service needs among girls; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611432714">Demetrovics (2012)</xref> stresses the particular needs of youths from traditional ethnic minorities and from minorities resulting from the strong migration in Europe during the last decades. In times of increasing globalization of labor markets these issues will become even more important in the future. It is therefore important to monitor worldwide demographic, economic, social and cultural changes, and their impact on adolescent health. In particular, much more research is needed not only to better understand the joint impact of individual, social, environmental and cultural factors but also to better address the needs of clusters of youths within a country that might be similar across countries.</p>
