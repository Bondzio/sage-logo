<abstract>
<p>The character of Creighton Bernette on the HBO series <italic>Treme</italic>, in his excesses and abjection, embodies post-Katrina New Orleans in crucial ways: physical and emotional excesses become ways to distance his character from viewers, in ways analogous to the othering of the city and its inhabitants in post-Katrina media and public discourses.</p>

<p>In her 2009 essay about post-Katrina New Orleans, writer and educator and Bywater neighborhood resident Anne Gisleson describes the moment when a tour bus drives past a party celebrating the reopening of the Saturn Bar in September 2006, a year after Katrina. Looking at the disaster tourists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476411434517">1</xref></sup> driving along St. Claude Avenue on their way to the Lower Ninth Ward, she describes her reaction:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When the buses passed us by, loaded with these outsiders, come to check out our devastation, our progress and lack of it, our piles of debris and our pain, mile after mile of this complicated, colossal failure, we found ourselves speculating about the passengers’ speculation. Did they think we should be out gutting and rebuilding and cleaning, not drinking in the middle of the afternoon in what appeared to be the only functioning business for miles? (2009, 228)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Saturn Bar crowd collectively wonder how the tourists categorize this spectacle of daytime drinking amid the ruins of the flood within their repertoire of New Orleans stereotypes. Gisleson assumes they will judge them harshly, by traditional puritanical American standards, without understanding the reasons why the party is so important; similarly, there was widespread disbelief and disapproval that the city went ahead with Mardi Gras celebrations in 2006.</p>
<p>New Orleans is famous, and infamous, for its excesses: too much rich food, too many strong drinks, parties that get too crazy. For outsiders, before and after Katrina, the decadent and decaying city represents a place out of step with an “increasingly authoritarian and majoritarian American emotional and financial culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411434517">Negra 2010</xref>, 3). Seen as exceptional and separate from the United States, New Orleans after Katrina also became the target of a newly energized “health triumphalism,” which Diane Negra describes as an attitude that conflates rigid prescriptions for good health with economic and moral strength (2010, 3). Mainstream America’s paradoxical love and disdain for New Orleans became particularly clear in media representations of Katrina and its aftermath, underscoring the city’s exceptional status. But the “City That Care Forgot” is also known for widespread apathy and political corruption, which, accompanied by institutionalized racism and uneven regional development, make it harder to solve the familiar problems plaguing most U.S. cities: too much crime and poverty, too many failing schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476411434517">Hartman and Squires 2008</xref>, 272). Those excesses are not unique to New Orleans, yet the city, in particular after Katrina, became subject to the neoliberal disciplinary regimes of privatization and what Naomi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476411434517">Klein (2008)</xref> terms “disaster capitalism,” as have other so-called dying or failing cities. The mobilization of health metaphors in the post-Katrina media carries with it the implications of individualism and self-determination that pervade the myths inherent in American capitalist ideologies: if hard work and self-discipline are the keys to success, no wonder the sinful city is in such bad shape.</p>
<p>Gisleson explains that almost everything was excessive after Katrina, and that for some it was more than could be borne. Many in the city were coping with various degrees of posttraumatic stress and self-medicating through alcohol and illegal as well as prescription drugs, all in a city with drastically reduced health care options. New Orleans writer Chris Rose joked about the widespread use of antianxiety medications and antidepressants which often led to long pharmacy lines, where neighbors would discuss the relative merits of their prescriptions the way they would ordinarily talk about restaurant menu offerings: “What are you gonna have? The Valium here is good. But I’m going with the Paxil. Last week I had the Xanax and it didn’t agree with me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476411434517">Rose 2005</xref>, 57). In the weeks and months after the flood the suicide rate increased by three hundred percent; in large part due to the appalling lack of mental health care in the city during that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476411434517">Eisler 2007</xref>). Many who had survived the storm and the flood died in the strain of those months afterward, including O’Neil Broyard, the late proprietor of the Saturn: “For many of them, ‘starting over,’ or even the possibility of another arduous evacuation, was more than daunting, it was the finishing blow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476411434517">Gisleson 2009</xref>, 221). But starting over is what New Orleans did, and David Simon’s <italic>Treme</italic> portrays the city’s grueling journey back.</p>
<p>The first episode of HBO’s post-Katrina drama <italic>Treme</italic> (2010) is set three months after the disaster, tracing a complex web of characters through their struggles to recover their own lives and their communities. Meticulously researched, self-consciously employing local creative staff, and based on many real-life characters and events, the show emphasizes the city’s uniqueness and resilience without minimizing the almost unimaginable damage caused by Katrina. <italic>Treme</italic> portrays the physical damage beautifully and hauntingly in the credit sequence’s harrowing close-ups of the toxic mold that grew while houses sat in several feet of flood water for weeks, but the show also dramatizes the emotional damage to individuals and to human relationships. As the first season progresses, couples split; parents and children grow apart; more dead are discovered, mourned, and buried; and some New Orleanians decide to leave the city entirely. The pain of the survivors in those days was indeed excessive, as Gisleson explains, yet difficult for those outside the city to comprehend. Just as many older or ill New Orleanians weren’t strong or healthy enough to survive the post-Katrina ordeals of rebuilding and recovery, the sometimes unsympathetic character of Creighton Bernette (John Goodman) on <italic>Treme</italic> is an example of a survivor who couldn’t endure the aftermath. In this article, I argue that Creighton’s character embodies, and provokes expressions of, America’s paradoxical love and disdain for New Orleans in all its eccentricities and excesses. His character’s abjection, most visibly signaled by his fatness, ultimately operates as a check on the political critique that his character represents on <italic>Treme</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1527476411434517">
<title>Creighton Bernette, Politics, and YouTube</title>
<p>Like New Orleans itself, <italic>Treme</italic>’s Creighton Bernette is portrayed in terms of eccentricity, excess, and pathology. In the first episode, when a British reporter inaccurately terms the destruction of New Orleans a “natural disaster,” Creighton bellows at him, “It was a federal fuckup of epic proportions!” When the reporter suggests that New Orleans is not worth rebuilding after the levee failures, voicing a widely held opinion that echoed around the media and the internet in the aftermath of the flood, Creighton seizes the microphone and throws it in the canal; later he loses his temper during an NPR telephone interview, which is cut short. These scenes show that his inability (or refusal) to control his emotions jeopardizes the efficacy of his political message in the mainstream media: his character appears quite possibly unhinged, much the way New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin’s rants in the media won him fans for his candor, but also worried many.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476411434517">2</xref></sup> Hearing about Creighton’s outbursts in his interactions with the media, his attorney wife Toni asks him whether he thinks they help his argument, suggesting that honey catches more flies. But we can see that he isn’t employing his anger rhetorically; he is completely overwhelmed by it. In subsequent episodes, Creighton’s drinking and depression further underscore his character’s instability.</p>
<p>However, in the fourth episode, Creighton finds a better form of expression on the internet, which earns him a devoted local following and allows internet users everywhere to access his commentaries—much as the late Ashley Morris’s blog did in real life. <italic>Treme</italic>’s Creighton is based on local blogger Morris, who died of a stroke in 2008. Like Morris, Creighton is a transplant: a nonnative New Orleanian who loves the city with the fervor of a convert, which can be infectious, especially in his enthusiasm for the local food and music cultures. Also like Morris, Creighton is an academic; he is a novelist and a Tulane University English professor, a member of the privileged middle-class elite. Patterned on Morris’s renown as a blogger, Creighton is also cast as a political griot of the post-Katrina city. Morris became famous, or infamous, for his blog post “Fuck You, You Fucking Fucks,” in which he excoriates a long list of offenders including the cities of Houston, Atlanta, and New York, Saints owner Tom Benson, and several government officials and agencies including the Corps of Engineers. Morris’s rant became a local mantra, abbreviated as FYYFF and printed on T-shirts prized by many locals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476411434517">Morris 2005</xref>). At a time when New Orleanians and their allies were reeling from the recovery process itself, compounded by the shocking public rhetoric in the national media and online questioning of the rebuilding itself, Morris’s blog spoke bluntly and passionately in defense of the right of New Orleans to exist.</p>
<p>Creighton discovers YouTube when he sees his teenaged daughter Sofia’s webcam clip complaining about her Baton Rouge school and life in exile more generally; he realizes the potential of the site and begins recording his own webcam videos editorializing about post-Katrina New Orleans. He recognizes, in the words of Michael Strangelove’s explanation of the potential of YouTube, that “online amateur video practices may prove to be an important step towards a reinvigorated culture of political participation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476411434517">2010</xref>, 139). Creighton’s YouTube videos, like Morris’s blog posts, combine intelligent political commentary with vernacular expressions that may gently shock viewers while also conveying a sense of the speaker’s anger, outrage, or disbelief in a visual medium that, like Jon Stewart or Bill Maher on cable television, mobilizes comedy in an intelligent way to make political points. Creighton’s YouTube rant borrows long passages from Morris’s blog. For example, in “Fuck You, You Fucking Fucks,” Morris lambastes the cities with the most Katrina evacuees:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Fuck you Houston and Atlanta. No matter how many of our residents you steal, how many of our events you pilfer, you still ain’t got no culture. One of our neighborhoods has more character than all of your pathetic cookie-cutter suburbs laid end to end. Fuck you, fuck you all.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On <italic>Treme</italic>, Creighton’s first YouTube video—now itself a popular clip on YouTube with more than nineteen thousand views—paraphrases and riffs on Morris’s post, with even more colorful language but a similar point:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>To Houston and Atlanta, may I say, lick my hairy balls. You took in thousands of our people, but guess what? You still suck. We’ve got more culture in one neighborhood than you’ve got in all your sorry-assed sprawling suburbs put together (YouTube).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Morris’s blog allowed New Orleanians and their allies around the world to keep up with the city through his viewpoint: a critical voice that adored New Orleans and didn’t shy away from confrontation, ready to shout down the anti–New Orleans voices online and in the media. Creighton’s commentaries serve a similar purpose, using new media to disseminate political critique and personal outrage to a wide audience. As Strangelove writes, “in a society shaped by commercial media, mass self-communication such as blogging and amateur video inevitably challenges power arrangements and generates conflict” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476411434517">2010</xref>, 144). On <italic>Treme</italic>, Creighton’s character gains local notoriety for his videos, which seems to temporarily buoy his spirits.</p>
<p>In Creighton Bernette, David Simon and his team crafted a strong and complex character based on Morris whose big-hearted outrage on behalf of the whole city Simon hoped would capture the audience’s sympathy, particularly the local audience in New Orleans. He says of Morris, “I admired his sense of outrage; petulance and selfish rage are useless, but rightful and righteous anger has an essential place in our times. . . . Ashley was angry on behalf of others, which in my mind makes all the difference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527476411434517">Walker 2010</xref>). Despite his struggles with depression and increasing dissatisfaction with his career as a teacher and writer, Creighton is able to channel his anger into internet media outlets that broadcast his cries for justice to all who would listen. The righteous anger that Creighton expresses on behalf of the drowned city, seemingly forsaken in its ruin, touches a nerve with his friends and family along with his YouTube viewers who feel he is speaking up for them and their city at a time when there are too few voices doing so. Against the backdrop of the “complicated, colossal failure” of the Katrina disaster, his character embodies one of the few overtly political voices on <italic>Treme</italic> in its first season.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527476411434517">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simon claims that unlike his critically acclaimed drama, <italic>The Wire</italic> (HBO, 2002-2008), <italic>Treme</italic> doesn’t have a specific argument to make about single issues such as drug policy or the education system; rather, he says, “This show, if we do it right, is an argument for the city” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411434517">Beiser 2011</xref>). Through audience engagement with the characters, Simon hopes to prove that New Orleans matters, and that urban America matters:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>People here felt alone after the storm. Entirely alone. Alienated not just from Washington or the rest of the country but the rest of the state. We have no sense of the collective anymore in America. The response to Katrina was proof positive of that. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411434517">Beiser 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Simon’s argument gains power gradually, through the development of multiple characters and the struggles in their families, careers, and communities, collectively and individually working to recover and rebuild. The show’s focus on creative workers—musicians in particular—demonstrates Simon’s commitment to portray a cultural politics of survival more than any direct concern with government or electoral politics; in that context, Creighton’s open letter to President George W. Bush, in which he urges Bush to follow through on the promises he made in his carefully choreographed New Orleans speech, is even more prominent. His video commentaries on YouTube constitute the most directly political public act of the show’s first season.</p>
<p>Yet unlike Morris, who died of a stroke in 2008, Creighton’s character commits suicide. Why did the writers choose to kill off Creighton’s character after one season? Insiders say it was simply because Goodman couldn’t commit longer, but why suicide rather than a stroke or other natural cause of death? If he, in his excesses and extreme emotions such as grief and righteous anger, represents the city’s vocal political critique of the colossal failures that led to the devastation and loss of life and dignity, how can we interpret his defeat by despair? A relatively optimistic take is that he has served his purpose: to voice his defense of the city and to die as a poignant casualty of the emotional storm brought on or exacerbated by Katrina and its aftermath. In a David Simon drama, a happy ending would be an insult to the story and to its audience, who are members of an “aristocracy of culture” made up of relatively affluent subscribers; an HBO viewer who seeks out “quality television” like <italic>Treme</italic> most likely does so precisely in order to find an alternative to the contrived, formulaic offerings of the networks and mainstream Hollywood cinema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411434517">Anderson 2008</xref>). And although <italic>Treme</italic> doesn’t directly engage with national politics or mainstream media commentary, it does make political issues central to many of its storylines. Simon says,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>A TV show can’t hold people and institutions to account like good journalism can. But if I can make you care about a character, I may make you think a little longer about certain dynamics that might cause you to reconsider your own political inertia or your own political myopia. You might be more willing to accept a critique of the prevailing political and social systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411434517">Beiser 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The character of Creighton Bernette embodies the righteous anger and political critique emanating from the city at large in the months and years after Katrina, and for many viewers who sympathize with him it is also easy to sympathize with the city (and vice versa). Yet he is a complex character with very human flaws and weaknesses with whom many viewers could not (entirely) sympathize. In keeping with Simon’s commitment to realism, Creighton as political griot of the city cannot be lionized without a clear-eyed portrayal of his failings as well. His character’s drawbacks can all be associated in some way with his most visible “imperfection”: his size. In the rest of this article, I consider the implications of Creighton’s fatness for his character and for the show’s portrayal of implications for the political future of New Orleans.</p>
<p>The U.S. population is getting fatter every year. The Centers for Disease Control lists nine states whose populations in 2009 were more than 30 percent obese—including Louisiana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411434517">CDC 2010</xref>). New Orleans is usually included in lists of the fattest cities in the country; coincidentally for David Simon fans, it tied with Baltimore for no. 13 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476411434517">Ruiz 2007</xref>). Not surprisingly for a city known for its decadent lifestyle, New Orleans has its fair share of fat citizens—celebrity chef Paul Prudhomme, to take one well-known example. On <italic>Treme</italic>, Creighton isn’t the only character whose body type exceeds the typical Hollywood male silhouette: Wendell Pierce’s character, trombone player and philanderer Antoine Batiste, is also heavy. But whereas Antoine’s size might be explained by his mischievous love of and perhaps overindulgence in pleasure, I argue that Creighton’s fatness is expressive of his character in more complicated ways. If Antoine is a lovable avatar of the decadent city and its twin sensual excesses of music and food, Creighton’s fatness signifies a more pathologized New Orleans.</p>
<p>Fatness is often cast as abjection—a concept developed at length most famously by theorist Julia Kristeva, who defines the abject as that which the self must reject and expel in order to define itself. In her article “Fighting Abjection: Representing Fat Women,” Le’a Kent argues that “within mainstream representations of the body, the fat body functions as the abject: it takes up the burden of representing <italic>the horror of the body itself</italic> for the culture at large” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476411434517">Kent 2001</xref>, 135). That horror includes the things about the body that disgust or embarrass us: vomit, excrement, sweat, blood, and other biologically necessary excretions that we usually take pains to clear away and hide from view. Those are substances that were part of us, but that we disown and cast away as “not-us” as soon as they are outside the body. The loss of control of the body and its abjections is associated with illness and death, as well as lack of discipline or socialization. The desire to be thin and healthy, to reject fatness, and often fat people, means that the fear of death and of the body is thus projected onto the fat person in widespread attitudes of disgust and disapproval. In the sections that follow, I will show that Creighton, like New Orleans, is portrayed as abject, which threatens to invalidate even his most cogent political critiques.</p>

<sec id="section2-1527476411434517">
<title>Hurricane Katrina, Abandonment, and Abjection</title>
<p>Media descriptions of the dangerously unhealthy conditions in New Orleans after the flood emphasized the excruciating summer heat; the fetid flood waters contaminated by sewage, chemicals, and corpses; and the sensationalistic (and later discredited) reports of violence that were used to justify the cessation of rescue efforts. But in addition to the lurid reports, accurate and otherwise, of near-apocalyptic catastrophes in the drowned city, the media and other public discourses in post-Katrina discussions about New Orleans also often painted the city and its residents as existing somehow outside the United States. This geographical dysphasia was perhaps exemplified best when George W. Bush, in the same speech in which he praised FEMA head Michael Brown for doing “a heck of a job,” articulated his desire “to comfort people in that part of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476411434517">Fuqua 2009</xref>). The images of the extreme subtropical climate and the poverty, compounded by the already widespread cultural knowledge of the city’s excesses and history of corruption, contributed to the notion that New Orleans is somehow not American; indeed, in many respects, it is portrayed as a “third-world” place. Conjuring the idea of New Orleans as part of the third world reassured Americans that the rest of the United States was still in fact “first-world,” with all the accompanying connotations—safe, organized, civilized, not poor, not corrupt. As these and many more examples show, the city of New Orleans and its people after Katrina appeared to many Americans shockingly unfamiliar, not like the rest of the nation, “not-us.” These disgusted and disapproving descriptions and characterizations enacted that distancing, positioning the city as outside, beyond, abject.</p>
<p>But perhaps most crucial to this rhetorical abjection is race: much of the rest of the nation, and the world, was unaware that Orleans Parish was a poor and majority African American area. The association of blackness with Katrina was an integral part of how New Orleans was othered and excluded from national sympathy. The evacuees in visual images on television and in other media provoked disbelief from commentators, who tried to express their surprise as delicately as possible at the sheer number of poor black people in shelters and on the streets. Cutting right to the heart of the matter, however, came Wolf Blitzer’s baldly inarticulate remark on cable news: “They are so poor, and they are so black!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411434517">CNN 2005a</xref>). These visual images of black New Orleanians in distress were often accompanied by the now familiar media stereotypes of the black poor as undeserving and even criminal, as seen in the widely circulated photo captions of white people “finding” food contrasted with black people “looting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476411434517">Kaufman 2006</xref>). Despite the initial outpourings of sympathy for the survivors and outrage at the mismanagement of the disaster from around the country and around the world, there remained an undercurrent of disavowal and distancing in many of the public discourses of those days and weeks following the disaster, which could be explained in part by the racialization of New Orleans itself.</p>
<p>It became increasingly clear that New Orleans was widely seen as a black, third-world city, unlike the rest of the country, and, in the minds of many, undeserving of the kind of national sympathies that occurred to a large extent after 9/11, four years earlier. Diane Negra points out that in contrast to the victims of 9/11, “who were linked to the idealized daily rhythms of American capitalism and seats of financial and governmental power,” the victims in New Orleans “were presented in compliance with a set of preexisting stereotypes about the idle urban poor in a city where ‘black gangsterism’ was understood to thrive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411434517">Negra 2010</xref>, 16). Indeed, Melissa Harris-Lacewell has shown that in national surveys, white Americans experienced significantly less emotional distress after Katrina than did African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411434517">Harris-Lacewell 2008</xref>, 154). Her interpretation of survey data shows that unlike 9/11, which was “widely understood as an American tragedy that was national in scope,” Katrina provoked a more divided response and was understood as “a more narrow racialized disaster” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411434517">Harris-Lacewell 2008</xref>, 158). As a result of this racialization in the media, the disaster provoked quite different affective responses from African American versus white American viewers. Black Americans, regardless of class or education, reported much more sadness and grief in daily life than white Americans in the five weeks following Katrina because of a difference in the way they perceived the horrors of the event: “While most whites believed that the abandonment of New Orleans was the result of bureaucracy, inefficiency, lack of preparedness, or technical capacity, most blacks believed that race was the real issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411434517">Harris-Lacewell 2008</xref>, 167). Compared to 9/11, when patriotism initially brought Americans together in mourning, “Not only were the victims of the hurricane abandoned in their drowning city, but black Americans were abandoned in their grief as they once again confronted the fact of their second-class citizenship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476411434517">Harris-Lacewell 2008</xref>, 167).</p>
<p>Abandoned and abject, New Orleanians during and after Katrina were left to fend for themselves and treated as noncitizens. Still more extreme, more material invocations of abjection, metaphors of waste products and disease, further implied the disposability of the victims and the disgust directed at them. Henry Giroux argues that the disaster was “about more than incompetence, lack of compassion, and ignorance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476411434517">Giroux 2006</xref>, 11). The way New Orleans and its inhabitants were abjected, he continues, was “the consequence of a systemic, violent form of social engineering in which those populations in the United States marginalized by race and class are now considered disposable—that is, simply collateral damage in the construction of a neoliberal order” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476411434517">Giroux 2006</xref>, 11). The abandoned were as shocked as anyone at their utter abjection, as Ignatieff points out: “they had good reason to be surprised that they were treated not as citizens but as garbage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476411434517">2005</xref>). Deprived of the basic rights of citizenship and cast off like garbage, black New Orleanians’ abjection was further echoed in descriptions of the city itself.</p>
<p>Brenda Weber argues in her analysis of a spate of post-Katrina housing makeover television programming that, since the flood, “New Orleans has been specifically targeted as the worst and most toxic element of a larger diseased social body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476411434517">Weber 2010</xref>, 176). She explains how these programs use hyperbole and health metaphors to describe the city in ways that “corporealize and pathologize (and in many ways feminize) both the city itself and a similarly damaged Gulf region, thus metaphorically conflating those things ‘below the water line’ with an ontology of excess, infection, and decay” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476411434517">Weber 2010</xref>, 176). The city’s abject status in public discourses—through rhetoric that distinguished it as excessive, unhealthy, dangerous, racialized, apart from the rest of the United States—also enabled many Americans to believe in arguments that the nation bore no responsibility for helping the survivors to return or for rebuilding the city.</p>
<p>Blackness and poverty were key visual markers of the evacuees and victims of the floods in the media coverage, images that easily slid into metaphors for the city’s poverty, corruption, and abjection in its rhetorical separation from the United States. Diane Negra notes the “consistent expression of condemnation, umbrage, and distaste toward storm victims” in often hostile online discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411434517">Negra 2010</xref>, 12). In news broadcasts as well as online comments, voice after angry voice declared that New Orleanians had only themselves to blame for living in such a precarious location, for having such dysfunctional city and state government; ultimately, the logic continued, they were to blame for their own suffering and thus undeserving of any assistance in rebuilding. As Negra argues, “national disapproval of New Orleans post-Katrina has consistently caricatured its ‘do-nothing’ citizens, relying on neoliberal discourses of self-sufficiency and studious avoidance of structural features that produce social vulnerability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476411434517">Negra 2010</xref>, 11).</p>
<p>While these images and observations don’t appear at first to correspond to the character of Creighton, a privileged white man whose home sustained little damage and whose family are unharmed and still employed, they are part of a structure of feeling about the city and its inhabitants that encompasses his character as well. Living in a majority black city where he is personally involved and invested in its unique African American cultural contributions to music and the other arts, Creighton is already aligned with blackness; making public political statements in support of the suffering city and its residents—the most visible of whom were African Americans—Creighton places his loyalties squarely in the abject camp the rest of the country had largely turned away from, or turned against.</p>
<p>Within the cast of <italic>Treme</italic>, both Creighton Bernette and Davis McAlary (played by Steve Zahn) are white characters defined in large part by their passionate love of New Orleans music; both consciously position themselves as New Orleanians who, regardless of race, take pride in the local culture and identify with it. The question of white appropriation is more provocative in the case of Davis’s character, who participates in the music business as a performer and producer and who lives in the majority black neighborhood of Tremé. Helen Regis makes a strong case that Davis is a crucial character precisely because he embodies the problematic of whiteness in New Orleans (2011). She argues that Davis</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>exposes many of the ambiguities and contradictions of being white in a majority black city and of uncritically identifying with and consuming black culture, without relinquishing white privilege or acknowledging one’s place in ongoing asymmetries of race, class, and socio-economic power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476411434517">Regis 2011</xref>, 400-401)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Regis examines some of the surprisingly vicious anti-Davis comments on the <italic>Treme</italic> blog of the New Orleans newspaper, the <italic>Times-Picayune</italic>, such as “I hope Steve Zahn’s character walks through Tremé by himself late at night and gets killed off” and “Please have Steve Zahn’s character die in a drive by shooting in the Tremé during the Martin Luther King parade” (qtd. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476411434517">Regis 2011</xref>, 399-400). She argues convincingly that some local viewers are uncomfortable with his character because they are uncomfortable with their own whiteness, rejecting him as an embodiment of the uncritical white appropriation of black culture. Although Davis is by far a more unpopular character on the show, Creighton has attracted a number of negative comments online as well, as Justin Harlacher points out, mostly by non–New Orleanians, which I will discuss in more depth in the next section. But Creighton’s whiteness can also be seen within the context Regis defines for Davis: as a white character who positions himself alongside black New Orleanians as a victim of Katrina.</p>
<p>The impulse to mark as abject the suffering African American New Orleanians portrayed in the media—as looters, as violent offenders, as undeserving poor—parallels the impulses to reject Creighton’s character and to write off the whole city. Given the HBO audience, a relatively affluent, educated, and predominantly white demographic, the creative decision to create a white character who is so intimately affiliated with abjection—through his professed identification with the black victims of Katrina—produces multiple challenges for viewers to sympathize with him. In <italic>Treme</italic>, as Brian G. Rose points out in the context of the earlier series <italic>The Wire</italic>, Simon chooses not to “showcase . . . stars in a predictable manner or repeat viewer-appealing situations and personality traits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476411434517">Rose 2008</xref>, 87). Rather than provide an easy “point of entry” for white middle-class viewers to identify with the show, the Davis and Creighton characters both throw up obstacles, albeit in different ways. Creighton’s alignment with black New Orleanians affiliates him with the abjection of New Orleans from the national body and from national responsibility—the very abjection that Creighton calls to account in his tirades—that essentially blames New Orleans for its own destruction and pathology, much the way popular discourses about obesity distance and mark fatness as abject.</p>

<title>Creighton Bernette, John Goodman, and Physical and Emotional Excess</title>
<p>John Goodman is one of the most successful fat actors on both the big and small screens. But there are interesting distinctions between the two visual media and their conventional representations of fat male characters. Jerry Mosher argues that unlike cinema, in which fat actors are mostly relegated to clown or bit parts, “television’s small screen . . . is friendlier to fat, making it appear more ordinary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476411434517">Mosher 2001</xref>, 166). John Goodman’s career reflects that bifurcation: his film roles—especially his work with Joel and Ethan Coen—tend more to the bombastic, comic, and grotesque, as in <italic>Raising Arizona</italic> (1987) and <italic>The Big Lebowski</italic> (1997). On the other hand, Goodman’s nine years as Dan Conner on <italic>Roseanne</italic> (1988-1997) allowed him to play a “normal” guy. Mosher points out that Dan’s character, while subordinate to Roseanne’s, did develop into a complex, believable character not defined or limited by his size: an intelligent, self-deprecating man who openly expressed his love for his family and even sexual desire for his wife, breaking longstanding taboos on representations of fat sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476411434517">Mosher 2001</xref>, 182). Appropriately for HBO, a cable television network that actively markets itself as “high quality,” Goodman’s role as Creighton Bernette on <italic>Treme</italic> bridges these two divergent tendencies: he has flashes of Dan’s sincerity, wit, and tenderness for his wife and daughter, but also often seems unstable, on the verge of losing control of himself, like Walter Sobchak in <italic>The Big Lebowski</italic>. We see Creighton in violent rages, in dark depressions, emitting icy hostility toward his wife Toni, and passed out on his own front porch—he is less cuddly than Dan Conner, has a bit more of an edge. His fate at the end of the season is the final aspect of his character that makes him the object of ambivalent feelings: viewers who loved him in spite of his problems found themselves, like Toni, feeling angry and frustrated as well as saddened by his suicide.</p>
<p>Creighton’s fatness marks several intersecting issues in the show and in the wider U.S. discourses around Katrina. First of all, authenticity. Goodman is a local resident and spokesman for the activist group Levees.org, beloved of New Orleanians even before <italic>Treme</italic> was made; as an honorary New Orleanian, his own personal pain and passion come through in his portrayal of Creighton. Moreover, in his size he resembles a lot of New Orleanians and the show’s obsession with locally authentic details means that it must have at least a couple of fat characters. Yet his size is also relevant to how his character’s emotional or mental instability might be perceived by the show’s audience. As the show’s self-appointed political voice of post-Katrina New Orleans, Creighton stands up for—and in a way embodies—the city’s powerful emotions: grief, fury, outrage, defiance, political passion, and finally overload. He voices what so many of us felt in those days and continued to feel five years later, watching the first season of <italic>Treme</italic> on HBO in April 2010, while at the same time the Deepwater Horizon blowout and subsequent oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, just south of the city, was unfolding on live television news (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476411434517">Cooper 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476411434517">Styborski 2010</xref>). The anger and helplessness so many of us felt watching our city again threatened cried out for a voice to speak for New Orleans and for south Louisiana. The drowning of New Orleans after Katrina and the inundation of the Gulf and the wetlands by the oil disaster were real, historic events, just as John Goodman is a New Orleanian in real life, playing a character based on a real-life local blogger. These contexts make the character of Creighton all the more authentic as he represents the city in his emotional honesty and excess.</p>
<p>Yet in the scenes such as those described above, where he goes on his tirades and throws away the microphone, Creighton risks appearing irrational. When I first saw that first episode, I commented on this danger on Facebook and thus generated a discussion with fellow New Orleanians who defended the content of Creighton’s rant and his right to be infuriated. My point wasn’t to dispute either of those things; I entirely agree that the flooding of the city was not a natural disaster<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527476411434517">4</xref></sup> and that New Orleans absolutely deserves to be rebuilt. But I worry that viewers who do not share Creighton’s extreme emotions might not be won over by his excesses, and in fact, might doubt his point because of the way he delivers it. This worry is perhaps borne out in Justin Harlacher’s analysis of internet comments about Creighton’s character on a popular David Simon fan site. He observes that local “commenters who are more in tune with the character’s state of mind as representative of a common sense of loss and chronic depression” that pervaded the city at that time appear more sympathetic to Creighton, while a majority of commenters simply dismissed him as “a lazy, self-involved dick,” to cite one memorable quotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476411434517">Harlacher 2011</xref>, 10). In the many scenes in which Creighton is shown to lose control over his emotions, his fatness combined with that loss of control easily plays into a range of common preconceptions about fat people: that they lack self-control or discipline, that they are lazy and lack a strong work ethic, that their fatness is pathological—a health problem or disease.</p>
<p>Moreover, the show portrays Creighton as a textbook sufferer of depression: pushing away his loved ones, self-sabotaging his work projects, unable to take pleasure in things he used to enjoy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411434517">Beck and Alford 2009</xref>, 12-38). Yet unsympathetic commenters don’t view Creighton as a depressed person deserving of empathy; they also seem reluctant to recognize the severity of the external events that triggered or exacerbated his mental illness, namely, Katrina and its aftermath. Thus in his depression as in his fatness and his temper, Creighton is vulnerable to accusations that he simply refuses to help himself, that he is just lazy and lacking self-discipline. This lack of sympathy or understanding becomes clear in the online reactions from Simon fans who wanted to like <italic>Treme</italic> but who felt, as one commenter writes, that it is “hard to relate to the characters when all they do is feel sorry for themselves all the time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476411434517">Harlacher 2011</xref>, 8). The lack of sympathy echoes the anti–New Orleans sentiment described above, in which the abjection is linked with a rejection of blackness and poverty imputed to the city through the media. As Negra highlights, this lack of empathy for the socially weak and victimized is a hallmark of neoliberal U.S. public discourses more generally, in which poverty or the need for assistance in a disaster is seen as a personal failure or shortcoming.</p>
<p>The thread that runs through all these negative associations with Creighton—the perceptions that his fatness, his alignment with blackness, emotionalism, and his depression mean that he is weak, lazy, out of control, pathological, unwilling to help himself—also tie in with his character’s feminization. Creighton is constantly depicted as barely in control of his emotions, whether anger or depression. This very over-emotionality is also a typical sexist stereotype of women that is often extended to fat male characters as well. Jerry Mosher points out that fat characters in television tend to be feminized and portrayed as weak and “sensitive,” contrasted with more assertive female characters and hard-bodied “masculine” male characters; this excessive, feminized emotionality is a key part of Creighton’s characterization (2001, 168-69; Kile 2011). (C. Kile, personal communication, January 25, 2011). In addition to losing his temper with newscasters who continually mislabel Katrina as a “natural disaster,” Creighton suffers from crippling writer’s block while trying to finish his long overdue novel. Because of this passivity, this seeming lack of discipline, his book project looks doomed. Yet his historical novel set at the time of the 1927 flood is also under attack from his agent, who urges him to capitalize on Katrina by reframing the book to include the most recent disaster. Creighton’s outrage at her craven commercialism demonstrates his character’s essential nobility and ethics, yet he is unable to channel this anger into any surge in productivity on the novel as he envisions it. Sequestering himself in his study and staring at the blank screen he is apparently powerless to alter, he seethes with frustrated rage and lashes out at Toni when she checks in on him. In contrast, at the same time, his wife and daughter are slogging ahead with their own lives—Toni’s tireless dedication to her clients frustrates her, but not in the self-destructive ways that Creighton’s depression paralyzes him. He jokes about her “ass-kicking” on behalf of her clients, seemingly giving her a compliment but with a slight barb, further hinting at his feeling threatened by his wife’s competence, productivity, and passion in her job as an attorney. Given how feminized and passive Creighton has become, it’s not hard to believe that his wife’s almost frenetic activity galls him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527476411434517">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Creighton, unlike Toni, is portrayed as disconnected not only from his work as a writer but also as a teacher. In one of his few scenes at work, he delivers an antifeminist rant about Kate Chopin’s 1899 novel <italic>The Awakening</italic> in which he dismisses his well-prepared students’ attempt to discuss the book’s publishing history—rescued from near obscurity by feminist literary scholars in the 1960s—only to insist on interpreting the novel as a universal story of self-discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476411434517">Showalter 2009</xref>, 235). Perhaps he wants to read it as a universal story because, ironically, Creighton’s character has a lot in common with <italic>The Awakening</italic>’s protagonist Edna Pontellier: both are narcissistic and emotional, and like her, he finally drowns himself. But whereas Edna’s suicide is often interpreted as a symbolic form of tragic feminist liberation from her circumscribed position as a woman in nineteenth-century white American—”she realizes that her limited society offers her infatuation, notoriety, or conformity” but not the great passion that she longs for—Creighton’s death by drowning isn’t couched this way on the show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476411434517">Showalter 2009</xref>, 234). Moreover, the heavy-handed allusions to the Chopin novel make Creighton’s rant against its feminism come across as simply perverse whining—in addition to what amounts to a demonstration of poor teaching skills, he also seems to be defending himself from the taint of feminization, having already recognized his deep identification with Edna yet unable to acknowledge it. His death might have been anticipated, particularly by those who recognized that Ashley Morris was an influence on his character’s development, but by killing him off as a suicide the show missed an opportunity to write him a more heroic epitaph. For viewers who found it difficult to sympathize with Creighton, his suicide was yet another final mark of his laziness, cowardice, and lack of control, making it possible for his political work on the show to be discounted.</p>
<p>Creighton’s lack of control—over his emotions, his work, and finally his own life—echoes those other instances where control was lacking: the failure of the levees, of the government, even of American society to adequately respond to the inundation of New Orleans. Creighton’s character can be read in terms of his “flawed” self-control: he is overweight, overemotional, and finally overwhelmed by his depression; indeed, it is possible, in the neoliberal healthist discourses so prevalent in the United States, to blame him for those flaws, for not better taking himself in hand. The apportioning of blame and the dismissive judgments of Creighton’s character by many <italic>Treme</italic> viewers also finds parallels in the wider conversations about New Orleans following the Katrina disaster. Local viewers also critique the show for the way it appears at times to echo the common stereotypes of New Orleanians as lazy and unmovitated: Mike Miley cites the scene in which Kermit Ruffins’s character doesn’t know or care who Elvis Costello is, even though a connection with Costello could bolster his career outside of the city. Miley wonders, “Is <italic>Treme</italic> correct in portraying New Orleans as an amusing but ultimately slothful swamp? Would its citizens forfeit their future in exchange for another parade?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476411434517">Miley 2011</xref>, 101). Although the show does represent examples of the local myopia that can grow out of a near-fanatical hometown loyalty, <italic>Treme</italic> also provides images that show viewers the ways in which that ferocious love of the city is the only thing that can save it, in the face of national indifference and even hostility. The suicide of Creighton Bernette simply underscores the fragility of that hope for survival. But as John L. Jackson Jr. writes, taking the show as a whole, “<italic>Treme</italic>’s hyper-realism seems almost utopian, as though it imagines that the objective artistry of musicians and their music, if taken seriously, could keep the waters from rising next time around” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476411434517">2011</xref>, 20). Many of the show’s characters love the city and its culture, including its music, and participate in producing that utopia; at its best, <italic>Treme</italic> portrays a city mired in agony yet, thanks to the collective power of its people producing and nurturing its culture, at times able to transcend.</p>
<p>Gisleson writes about the extremes of those post-Katrina months, “Your exhausted heart was always on the verge of something, breaking in despair or bursting with gratitude, and your soul stretched in ways that weren’t pleasant but that made you feel very alive” (2009, 228). Creighton seems to feel alive when he is recording his YouTube rants, and when strangers on the street thank him for them. But, like many who lacked the physical or emotional strength to stretch so much, his exhausted heart simply surrenders. Even righteous anger, as many New Orleanians and outside allies discovered in the weeks, months, and years after the flood, can become toxic if it is allowed to extinguish other important emotions, or to turn inward into despair and self-destruction. The excesses of Creighton Bernette are human imperfections: he is depressed, irritable, self-involved. Yet Goodman’s portrayal also wins many of us over with his heart, even as it is breaking. Creighton loses his struggle with depression, succumbing to suicide in the end by giving his body to the currents of the river, his watery death echoing that flood from which he cannot recover even as his city, haltingly and with great effort, begins to rebuild.</p>
