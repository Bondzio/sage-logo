<abstract>
<p>The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the feasibility of monitoring the primary stability of dental implants using a simple transmission test with acoustic emission. Forty screw-shaped titanium dental implants were installed in the middle of 10 fresh bovine ribs obtained from different animals. The implants were divided into two size groups, 8.5 mm × 3.5 mm and 13 mm × 4.5 mm, and were inserted in either tight- or loose-fitting conditions. For each implant, pulses of acoustic energy were injected at the centre of a customised gold abutment 3 mm in height using a standard pencil lead break source (Hsu–Nielsen source). A total of 30 acoustic emission recordings were made for each implant in which the transmitted energy was measured on the surface of the bone using an acoustic sensor mounted at the middle of the rib. The transmitted acoustic energy for the implants under tight-fitting conditions was significantly higher than for the loose-fitting for both sizes of implant. The acoustic emission energy values for the 13 mm implants were also higher than for the 8.5 mm implants. The results indicate that implants with good primary stability (tight-fitting) had higher acoustic emission energy than implants where primary stability was poor (loose-fitting). The longer and wider implants produced higher acoustic emission energy than shorter and narrower implants. Together, the findings suggest that a simple transmission test, properly calibrated, should be able to assess the quality of the contact between the implant and the bone in the clinical situation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental implants are widely used in the replacement of missing teeth and to support removable dentures. Although implants have high survival rates, failures still occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911428696">1</xref></sup> Mechanically, the implant consists of an engineered component, usually a metal, whose structural integrity can be reasonably assured; an abutment, which is attached to the implant; and an anchorage, usually a screw. The difficult-to-control aspect is the interface between the implant and the bone into which it is inserted. Monitoring dental implants remains challenging as there is no effective and non-invasive way of accurately measuring stability at the bone–implant interface.</p>
<p>Various techniques and instruments have been proposed to test implant stability and osseointegration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428696">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428696">4</xref></sup> including periodontal probing, percussion, radiographic assessment, damping capacity assessment (Periotest, Siemens), resonance frequency analysis (Osstell Integration Diagnostics, Implomate Bio Tech One) and reverse torque. However, none of these is entirely satisfactory as it is difficult to obtain results which are reproducible to the degree of accuracy required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911428696">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911428696">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A commercially available resonance frequency analysis (RFA) detection device (Osstell) has been extensively studied and advocated as a reliable method for determining implant stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428696">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911428696">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911428696">8</xref></sup> The stiffness of the bone–implant interface is calculated from the resonance frequency excited by oscillatory forces applied to the implant/bone. Unfortunately, to date, no clinically conclusive data have been derived from these studies regarding the validity of RFA in the assessment of the implant–bone interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911428696">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911428696">10</xref></sup> In addition, the transducer used in the Osstell system needs to be screwed into the implant with a torque of 10 Ncm, which is almost half that used to install an implant in the first place. This limits its use in the early stages of assessment as such high torques may affect the healing of implants.</p>
<p>The term acoustic emission (AE) is defined as ‘the class of phenomena whereby transient elastic waves are generated by a rapid release of energy from a localised source or sources within a material’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911428696">11</xref></sup> Once released, the waves propagate through the material and are recorded at a suitable (usually piezoelectric) sensor. Most applications of AE are passive, in that the sensor is used to listen for self-generated sources such as the sounds made in an internal combustion engine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911428696">12</xref></sup> AE has also been used in a number of biomedical applications, again in passive applications, such as detecting bone fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911428696">13</xref></sup> and microvascular damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411911428696">14</xref></sup> The AE technique offers the advantages of being a non-invasive and continuous method which can monitor the condition of the material under investigation throughout the test. It is non-localised and has the ability to examine large volume objects provided that a sufficient proportion of the wave energy can propagate to the sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911428696">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Combined AE and ultrasonic evaluation has been used for real-time detection of the initiation and propagation of cement–metal debonding in fibreglass femurs containing a cemented femoral component under cyclic loading under physiological loads. The AE was directly associated both in location and in time with definitive ultrasonic evidence of debonding of the cement–metal interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911428696">16</xref></sup> The AE technique has also been found to be sensitive in monitoring microdamage generated during in vivo tension fatigue testing of cortical bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911428696">17</xref></sup> The current work aims to test the feasibility of using the transmission properties of the implant–bone interface to assess the quality of the connection and is hence complementary to passive AE approaches (which could also possibly be applied in the dental case). To meet the broad aim of feasibility assessment, this paper reports a series of experiments in which the primary stability of dental implants placed in bovine rib was varied using different fitting conditions and the AE transmitted from a standard source measured.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Ten fresh bovine ribs from different animals with similar anatomical characteristics were obtained from a butcher’s shop. The animals were approximately 30 months old. These ribs served as a model of the human edentulous jawbone due to their macroscopic composition of cortical and medullar bone. On receipt, the samples were cleaned of soft tissue residues and immediately immersed in 50% v/v ethanol–saline solution. The testing was performed at room temperature within the first three days of obtaining the ribs. To keep the samples hydrated during the test, they were wrapped in saline-soaked gauze.</p>
<p>Forty bone-level U-Impl (U-Impl Implant System, Biel, Switzerland) titanium dental implants were used for this study, 20 each of two sizes: 8.5 mm long × 3.5 mm diameter and 13 mm long × 4.5 mm diameter. The implants were screwed to their full length into the middle of each rib in rows, one of each size being screwed into a hole of recommended diameter to the recommended torque, Group A (tight fit), and one of each size being screwed into a pre-tapped hole to a lower torque, Group B (loose fit). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428696">Figure 1</xref> shows the arrangement of implants on a given bone and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911428696">Table 1</xref> gives a summary of the test conditions.</p>

<p>AE measurements were made for each implant by stimulating the coronal edge of the customised abutment which was retained on the implant by an abutment screw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911428696">Figure 2</xref>). All measurements were made using a standard source (Hsu–Nielsen source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411911428696">18</xref></sup>) whereby an acoustic emission wave is generated in the abutment by the step unloading brought about by the fracture of a brittle graphite pencil ‘lead’. The AE signals were collected by a sensor mounted on the side of the rib as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428696">Figure 1</xref>. A Physical Acoustics Corporation (PAC) Micro-80D AE sensor was used, having an operating frequency range of 0.1–1 MHz and resonances at 325 kHz and 650 kHz. The sensor was connected to a PAC-1120A preamplifier set at a gain of 40 dB and incorporating a band-pass filter from 0.1 to 1 MHz. Data were acquired using a 14-bit Simultaneous-Sampling Multifunction DAQ card (NI PCI-6115) at a sampling rate of 2.5 MS/s giving a record length of 1 s. A total of 30 records was acquired for each installation in each bone, the data being transferred to a personal computer and analysed with MATLAB software.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428696">Figure 3</xref> shows a typical pencil lead break signal, as acquired in this work. The signals were acquired such that the full bandwidth of the sensor’s sensitivity to the propagating ultrasound is recorded (frequencies between 0.1 and 1 MHz). As can be seen, the signal is of a typical ‘burst’ type, rising rapidly to a maximum amplitude and falling less rapidly as the sensor rings. The duration of the signal was determined by setting a threshold of ± 0.2 V, chosen to be safely above the background noise, and setting the signal duration as being between the first and last crossings of the threshold. The energy of the signal (in relative units of Vs) was obtained by integrating the absolute value of the signal over its duration, which can be seen to be considerably less (typically about 700μ s) than the record length. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911428696">Figures 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911428696">7</xref> show all the resulting energy values, plotted to highlight the data for the tight versus loose fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911428696">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411911428696">5</xref>) for the two sizes and to highlight the effect of size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911428696">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911428696">7</xref>) for the two fits. The data show the mean values plus the standard deviation of the 30 repeats and with the contrasting data sets being represented as triangles and circles. For a given bone, the expected result (better transmission with a larger and/or tighter interface) is clearly shown, although there is considerable variation between bones.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate an AE technique in monitoring the primary stability of dental implants inserted under two different fitting conditions. Each of the 10 ribs used in the study was taken from a different animal and a variety of bone configurations was evident. The distal portion of the ribs was used as it contained a greater proportion of medullary bone with cortical bone. This was considered similar to type-III bone in the classification of Leckholm and Zarb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411911428696">19</xref></sup> Samples were stored in 50% ethanol–saline solution, which causes less than a 4% decline in Young’s modulus of bone tissue for up to 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411911428696">20</xref></sup> That said, it is clear that each rib has a distinct transmission coefficient (Group 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954411911428696">Table 3</xref>) and this means that, for a real application, some type of calibration would be necessary to remove subject-specific variations.</p>
<p>The insertion torque for the tightly fitted implants varied between 20 and 25 Ncm with a mean of 22.9 Ncm (± 2.38). The insertion torque for the loosely fitted condition varied between 2 and 6 Ncm with a mean 4.05 Ncm (± 1.27). The factors affecting the torque required to insert the implant are the bone density and difference in diameter between the implant and the prepared holes. Implants inserted under tightly fitting conditions were placed in slightly undersized holes so that each implant had to remove and/or compress 0.3 mm of bone tissue around the prepared site. The percentage decrease in interfacial pressure associated with loose fitting can be assumed to be approximately proportional to the percentage decrease in insertion torque, i.e. about 80%. The nominal surface area of embedded implant is proportional to the product of the length and the diameter, so that the percentage decrease in surface area in going from long to short implants is about 50%.</p>
<p>The difference in transmission between long and short implants and between loose and tight implants can be quantified by the percentage difference in average energy, and this is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954411911428696">Table 4</xref> alongside the nominal changes associated with insertion torque and surface area. As can be seen, reduced compression and implant contact surface area both lead to reduced transmission, which is in accordance with the findings of Qi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911428696">21</xref></sup> working with orthopaedic implants. The amount of reduction is about 50% for both pressure and surface area, which suggests that increased surface area is more effective in increasing transmission (for a given pressure) than is increased pressure for a given surface area.</p>

<p>Although AE energy has been found to discriminate adequately between the different implant conditions, it suffers from the disadvantage of requiring calibration. It may be that other aspects of the transmitted signal can provide supporting information (e.g. in the frequency domain) where calibration would be less of a problem.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present work has shown that the use of AE transmission tests for implant stability assessment is feasible, in that:</p>
<list id="list1-0954411911428696" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A strong correlation was found between a simulation of primary stability of dental implants and the proportion of AE energy transmitted from a standard source to a sensor mounted on the surface of the bone model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tightly fitting implants transmitted about 50% more AE energy than those which were loosely fitting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Implants with larger diameter and length (i.e. larger contact surface area) transmitted about 50% more AE energy than those with smaller contact surface area.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The effect of the individual animal (i.e. the structure of the bone) was significant, although this did not obscure the effect of primary stability.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For practical applications, a number of other matters need to be considered:</p>
<list id="list2-0954411911428696" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The system requires to be calibrated and the transmission of a number of subjects needs to be established for well-integrated implants in order to provide a baseline variance for transmission in vivo.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The feasibility of applying the technique in vivo needs to be established, particularly with a view to reproducible facial sensor placement where a transmitted signal can be picked up. Some preliminary work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411911428696">Figure 8</xref>) with a subject biting on a hard food has shown that transmission from a tooth through the periodontal ligament and jaw to the face is, in principle, possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pencil lead break technique provided a reproducible and non-damaging source of AE energy, but would not be acceptable in a subject’s mouth. An alternative source therefore needs to be established.</p></list-item>
