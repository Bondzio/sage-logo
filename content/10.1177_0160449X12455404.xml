<p>Joseph McCartin’s <italic>Collision Course</italic> is aptly titled. The book upends the Manichaean frame often used to depict the showdown between the Reagan administration and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Association (PATCO), replacing it with complexity, nuance, and a sense of tragic inevitability. McCartin locates the initial trajectory toward the 1981 strike in a pair of decisions in the early 1960s: John F. Kennedy’s Executive Order 10988 that permitted federal workers to organize and Ronald Reagan’s change of party affiliation from Democrat to Republican. From there, McCartin traces the fateful arc of the two-decade history of PATCO from its formative struggles to its fateful demise that has proved so consequential to organized labor in the United States.</p>
<p><italic>Collision Course</italic> is a narrowly focused book that deserves a broad audience. McCartin hones in on the history of PATCO with the singular goal of facilitating readers understanding the strike. He diverts his gaze to the wider social, cultural, and economic context only so far as is necessary for his readers to understand their impact on the events he describes. Yet the work does not shy away from illustrating the expansive implications of the PATCO strike and should prove compelling to a diverse readership for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is quite simply a great book. McCartin draws the reader in from the tense opening scenes when a motionless radar blip signals to controllers that something is awry. He describes the stifling tension in the control room, which turns to gloom and despondency as the controllers realize they have in a very tangible yet remote way witnessed the worst air traffic collision in aviation history to date. This opening vignette vividly foreshadows the controllers’ own later confrontation and marks the quality of the writing throughout the work. McCartin allows us to feel the stress and strife of the air traffic controllers’ daily existence, their emotional turmoil as they contemplate the implications of the strike, and the heartfelt pride and solidarity they experience in its devastating wake.</p>
<p>A second reason to read <italic>Collision Course</italic> is that it provides a judicious account of a pivotal moment in recent history. This is important, as the strike is frequently reduced to a caricature. McCartin explains the complex considerations of the Reagan administration, its initial conciliatory approach, and the generous contract offer that is rejected by PATCO. While illustrating the ways in which Reagan’s actions defy the simplistic view that he deliberately set out to destroy the union, McCartin does not seek to rehabilitate Reagan. He describes the president’s stubborn, uncompromising stance toward the firing of the strikers once he realized the advantages of his position. PATCO as a union does not escape McCartin’s scrutiny. He highlights its leadership missteps, internal disputes and rivalries, a militant faction hard to control, and decisions made out of frustration and emotion rather than cool rationality.</p>
<p>On a final note, the multifaceted nature of <italic>Collision Course</italic> means it has something to offer both general readers and those with more specific proclivities. McCartin covers race and gender struggles, communication failures, organizing difficulties and internal conflicts, and the critical role of public opinion. As a political scientist with an interest in labor law, I was particularly heartened by his argument about the importance of the legal framework. From the outset, the collective bargaining facilitated by Kennedy’s executive order was limited; wages were not a matter for negotiation, and strikes of course were illegal. This circumscribed the union’s actions in ways that heightened conflict and foreclosed mediation and compromise. These are crucially important insights as we consider the current wave of state-level actions to redefine public-sector bargaining frameworks.</p>
<p>In short, Joseph McCartin has done us all a great service with his book. Read it, and I can guarantee you will gain important insights from a strike that is often highlighted as critical but about which many possess only surface knowledge.</p>
