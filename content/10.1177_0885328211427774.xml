<abstract>
<p>Pluronic® F127 is a biocompatible, injectable, and thermoresponsive polymer with promising biomedical applications. In this study, a chemically modified form, i.e., Pluronic ALA-L with tailored degradation rate, was tested as an encapsulation vehicle for osteoblastic cells. UV cross-linking of the modified polymer results in a stable hydrogel with a slower degradation rate. Toxicological screening showed no adverse effects of the modified Pluronic ALA-L on the cell viability. Moreover, high viability of embedded cells in the cross-linked Pluronic ALA-L was observed with life/death fluorescent staining during a 7-day-culture period. Cells were also cultured on macroporous, cross-linked gelatin microbeads, called CultiSpher-S® carriers, and encapsulated into the modified cross-linked hydrogel. Also, in this situation, good cell proliferation and migration could be observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> tests have shown the formation of new bone starting from the injected pre-loaded CultiSpher-S® carriers.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211427774" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone tissue has a remarkable ability of self-repair, but when a critical size-defect needs to be bridged, complete regeneration frequently fails, resulting in pseudoarthrosis, nonunion of the defect, and even complete loss of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211427774">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the last decade, our research group has built a strong experience in the field of bone tissue engineering using a combination of <italic>in situ</italic> forming biomaterials in combination with cell-loaded microcarrier systems. This approach allows us to completely fill irregular-shaped defects as they can be molded in the shape of the defect. In a previous work done by our group, photo cross-linkable polyesters (methacrylate-endcapped poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone)) were studied <italic>in vitro</italic> and implanted into unicortical defects in tibiae of goats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211427774">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211427774">3</xref></sup> Only a limited amount of bone growth was observed, even when an extra source of bone-forming cells was added to the polymer mixture. The limited permeability and subsequently low nutrient and oxygen flows in the polymer might explain these findings. To overcome this problem, an alternative is the use of injectable biodegradable hydrogels. Hydrogels have the advantages that they can retain a lot of water and biological fluids, and combine the cohesive properties of solids and the diffusive transport characteristics of liquids. They exhibit a high permeability for oxygen, nutrients, and other water-soluble metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211427774">4</xref></sup> These polymers can cross-link <italic>in situ</italic> and form a hydrogel in response to physical triggers including changes in temperature (e.g., agarose), or pH (e.g., chitosan), or an exchange in ions (e.g., alginate).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211427774">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211427774">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>An example of polymers that respond to a change in temperature is a tri-block polymer of poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)– poly(ethylene oxide) (i.e., Pluronics®) (PEO–PPO–PEO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211427774">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211427774">9</xref></sup> Pluronic® F127 and F68 have been approved by the FDA as injectable materials for use in the human body.</p>
<p>In this study, Pluronic® F127, also referred to as Poloxamer 407 or Lutrol® F127, was used. The Pluronic® copolymer is amphiphilic and will form micelles in aqueous solutions at a certain level of concentration and temperature. At a higher level of concentration and temperature, packing of micelles and micelle entanglement may result in the formation of a physically cross-linked gel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211427774">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211427774">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211427774">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211427774">11</xref></sup> Pluronic® F127 will undergo a sol-to-gel transition at a concentration higher than 14 wt% and a temperature of 30°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211427774">12</xref></sup> Consequently, Pluronic® F127 solutions can be injected as a liquid into the body, where it will form a gel without toxic effects after acute and chronic exposures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211427774">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211427774">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pluronic® F127 has been reported as an excellent delivery system for a wide range of drugs, including proteins, due to its amphiphilic character and its thermosensitive sol–gel transition behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211427774">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211427774">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211427774">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the major drawback of this system is the fast disintegration of the gel due to dilution of the hydrogel by body fluids. This limits its use for a long-lasting sustained release of various drugs, including growth factors, analgesic drugs, or even cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211427774">8</xref></sup> One way to overcome this gel-to-sol transition is to convert Pluronic® into a polymerizable derivative.</p>
<p>A method for preparing a cross-linked hydrogel with biodegradable building blocks has been described by Swennen et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup> whereby the hydroxyl end groups were chemically converted to N-methacryloyl-depsipeptides. The depsipeptide building block served as a degradable moiety. Variations in degradation can be obtained by altering the chemical structure of the depsipeptide unit using another α-hydroxy acid and/or combining it with another amino acid. In this study, Pluronic ALA-L (Plu ALA-L) was used, of which the depsipeptide unit consists of <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid in combination with the amino acid alanine. The modifications did not influence the micelle formation process and only slightly increased the gelation temperature. After UV irradiation, a 3D network with tailored degradation rate could be formed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to use this modified gel as a vehicle to immobilize osteoblasts of the MC3T3-E1 mouse calvaria cell line. However, osteoblasts are polarized anchorage-dependent cells that need a substrate for optimal cell activity. For this reason, cells were also cultured on a commercial biodegradable gelatin microcarrier, CultiSpher-S®, and mixed afterwards with the modified polymer. As a control/reference, cells were encapsulated in the nonmodified parent Pluronic® F127.</p>
<p>Cell viability of the osteoblasts, encapsulated in different <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental conditions, was microscopically assessed with a dual life/death fluorescent staining using calcein AM and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent dyes. Bone formation potential of encapsulated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) was evaluated in an <italic>in vivo</italic> pilot study.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211427774"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>For the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, cells of the mouse calvaria cell line MC3T3-E1 Subclone 14 (ATCC CRL-2594) were used. They were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium (αMEM GlutaMAX I, Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 10 (v/v)% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies) in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Upon confluence, the cells were detached with 0.5% trypsine (Life Technologies) and counted in a cell counter with trypan blue exclusion dye.</p>
<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> test, autologous BMSCs were harvested from the iliac crest of the anesthetized goat. The bone marrow was collected in a lithium heparin tube in the presence of an anticoagulant. Blood cloths were removed and the bone marrow was abundantly washed in αMEM medium supplemented with 10 vol% FBS, 0.5 vol% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 1 vol% Fungizone Amphotericin B (Life Technologies). The cell pellet was resuspended in the same culture medium supplemented with 100 µm <sc>l</sc>-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma–Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) and 10 nM dexamethasone (Sigma–Aldrich) and seeded in five T75 culture flasks (Greiner BioOne, Wemmel, Belgium) in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C. After 2 days, the medium was renewed, resulting in the removal of the nonadherent cell population and keeping the adherent stromal cells in culture. These cells were further cultured for a total of 2 weeks, with renewal of the medium 3 times a week. After 2 weeks, the cells were detached and counted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211427774"><title>Microcarrier seeding and expansion</title>
<p>In this method, 0.09 g dry macroporous gelatin CultiSpher-S® microcarrier beads (ø 130–380 µm) (Percell Biolytica, Åstorp, Sweden) were hydrated in calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and autoclaved. The PBS was replaced by culture medium and the microcarriers were divided over 5 wells of a 12-well suspension plate (Greiner BioOne). In this method, 400,000 MC3T3-E1 or BMSCs were brought on each carrier-containing well and allowed to attach to the carriers in static conditions for 2 days in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. For cell expansion and cell ingrowth, the cell-loaded carriers were transferred to a shaker flask and cultured under dynamic conditions (stirring speed 70 rpm) in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The BMSC-loaded CultiSpher-S® carriers were dynamically cultured for 2 weeks, with the addition of β-glycerophosphate (Sigma–Aldrich) in the last culture week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211427774"><title>Modifying Pluronic F127</title>
<p>To prolong the <italic>in vivo</italic> residence time of the commercial Pluronic® F127 hydrogel (BASF, Antwerp, Belgium), the end groups of the polymer were chemically modified in methacryloyl depsipeptides, by a 3-step reaction. First, the hydroxyl end groups of Pluronic® F127 were converted in α-bromo esters through a reaction with 2-brominepropanoylbromide (Fluka, Bornem, Belgium) resulting in a lactate ester as end product. The second reaction was an acetylation reaction to convert the amino acid <sc>l</sc>-alanine (Acros, Geel, Belgium) into a N-methacryloyl derivative. <sc>l</sc>-Alanine was dissolved in an equimolar amount of sodium hydroxide solution (Sigma–Aldrich), whereafter an equimolar amount of methacryloylchloride (Fluka) and sodium hydroxide was added. In a final step, the N-methacryloyl amino acid was coupled to the Pluronic-di(2-bromo ester). The chemically modified Pluronic® F127 end product is referred further on as Plu ALA-L, because of the incorporation of the depsipeptide unit <sc>l</sc>-alanine and <sc>l</sc>-Lactic acid.</p>
<p>By UVA (<italic>λ</italic> = 365 nm) irradiation in the presence of the photo-initiator Irgacure® 2959 (Ciba, Groot-Bijgaarden, Belgium), a radical polymerization of the vinyl side groups of the Plu ALA-L macromer is induced. This resulted in a network structure that contained a short and well-defined hydrolytically labile sequence.</p>
<p>The more detailed description of the different reaction conditions and reagents are described by Swennen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup> The reaction scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211427774">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>The degradation of 20 wt%, 25 wt%, and a 30 wt% hydrogel is determined. To obtain these hydrogels, a 30 wt% stock solution prepared in PBS at 4°C overnight on a mechanical shaker, was further diluted to the respective weight percentages. Before cross-linking, 1 mol% UV catalyst Irgacure® 2959 is added to the solution. This solution was injected into a glass wall of 1 mm thickness and 10 mm diameter, and irradiated with UV light (<italic>I</italic> = 5 mW/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211427774">2</xref></sup>, <italic>λ</italic> = 365 nm) in between two high-performance transilluminators. To monitor the degradation of the hydrogel in time, the gel is incubated in sterile PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4) solution and at different time points, a sample is taken and dried under vacuum and the weight is compared with the weight of a nonincubated gel. The residing gel fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211427774">Figure 2</xref>) was calculated as the ratio of the dry weight of an incubated hydrogel by the dry weight of a hydrogel just after cross-linking without any incubation step, multiplied by 100. All experiments were run in triplicate.

<p>A stock solution of 30 wt/vol% of Pluronic® F127 (Sigma–Aldrich) in MC3T3-E1 culture medium was prepared. This mixture was cooled in an ice bath and placed on a magnetic stirrer in the refrigerator overnight. MC3T3-E1 cells were trypsinized, suspended in culture medium, and counted. In this study, 200 µL of the 30 (w/v)% Pluronic® F127 stock solution was diluted with 100 µL cell suspension and placed in a well of a 48-well plate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

<p>The cytotoxicity of the modified Plu ALA-L was evaluated on MC3T3-E1 cells. All experiments were run in triplicate and according to the ISO 10 933-1 guidelines for the biological evaluation of medical devices.</p>
<p>Different concentrations of Plu ALA-L en parent Pluronic® F127 in culture medium were placed onto a layer of MC3T3-E1 cells to form a thermal gel above the cell layer. For this, 40,000 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner BioOne) and placed at 37°C for 24 h. The medium on the cell culture was removed and replaced by 50 µL of Plu ALA-L or Pluronic® F127 solution (25 (w/v)%, 20 (w/v)%, and 17.5 (w/v)%). After thermal gelation, 200 µL culture medium was gently added on top of the gel. The culture plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 and 24 h, after which cell viability was assessed. The medium was replaced by phenol-red free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10 (v/v)% FCS. MTS solution (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) was added and after 4 h, the absorbance of the formed formazan product was spectrophotometrically measured (Type EL 800, BioTek instruments, Vermont, USA) at a wavelength of 490 nm.</p>
<p>The production of formazan is proportional to the number of living cells. Comparing the absorbance values of MC3T3-E1 cell cultures brought in contact with the hydrogel and those without contact, we obtain data on the cytotoxicity of the gels. The cell cultures that had not been in contact with the hydrogel were considered to have a viability of 100%. The viability of the test samples was calculated as (the absorbance of the test sample divided by mean absorbance of the control cultures) multiplied by 100.</p>

After incubation, the cultures were thoroughly rinsed and cells visualised under a fluorescent microscope (Type U-RFL-T, Olympus, Aartselaar, Belgium). The percentage of viable cells was determined as the number of viable cells divided by the sum of the counted viable and death cells, multiplied by 100.</p>
<p>Cell viability of the encapsulated cells was also assessed by widely used viability assays (MTS, LDH, and ATP release). Due to the amphiphilic character of the hydrogel, the respectively formed formazan, lactate dehydrogenase, and ATP release products stayed trapped inside the gel, making fluorescent microscopic evaluation the only possible technique to screen cell viability inside the hydrogel.</p>

<p>In this study, a chemically modified hydrogel with controllable degradation rate was used to encapsulate cells. The degradation rate was monitored for hydrogels with three different weight percentages. As could be expected, the degradation of the 30 wt% hydrogel was slower than the 20 wt% and 25 wt% ones. In the first 15 days, the 3D networks of the three gels remained together, i.e., plateau-phase for the three curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211427774">Figure 2</xref> with a remaining weight percentage of more than 90%. From then on, the hydrolysis reaction was the same for the three hydrogels, but due to the difference in polymer concentration, the lower the wt%, the faster the degradation occurred.</p>

In general, the thermal-gelated gels showed only a slight but acceptable decrease in cell viability. The chemically modified Plu ALA-L hydrogels had comparable effects on cell viability as the FDA-approved Pluronic® F127.

<sec id="sec19-0885328211427774"><title>Condition 1: cell encapsulation in nonmodified Pluronic® F127</title>
<p>The viability of MC3T3-E1 cells, encapsulated in a thermal-gelated 20 (w/v)% Pluronic® F127 hydrogel, was assessed over a 7-day-culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211427774">Figure 5</xref>). No extra culture medium was added to the parent thermal-gelated hydrogel, since the addition of culture medium resulted in the disintegration of the gel.

However, the majority of cells (roughly more than 80%) remained viable at every evaluation time point, i.e. by stained green (calcein AM positive).

<p>The first aim of this pilot study was to see if this hydrogel could be easily injected and retained into the defect. It was important to hold the polymer mixture just under the gelation temperature just before injection, to decrease the gelation time once inside the body. There was some leaking of the polymer out of the defect just after injection, but with a spatula against the bone, the gelifying polymer could be pushed back into the defect. When the defect was completely filled, the gel was UV cross-linked and the consistency of the gel checked after irradiation by pressure onto the gel with a spatula. The second aim was to evaluate bone formation after 2 weeks of implantation. New bone formation starting from the cells inside the CultiSpher-S® carrier could be easily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211427774">Figure 9</xref>), indicating that the seeded cells onto the carriers were indeed predifferentiated in the osteogenic lineage and that encapsulation into the hydrogel did not influence the differentiation process.

<p>In this study, we evaluated the use of a chemically modified UV polymerizable Pluronic® F127 ALA-L hydrogel as an injectable cell delivery vehicle. To fill irregular-shaped bone defects, the use of <italic>in situ</italic> cross-linkable materials is an attractive approach. Despite numerous research efforts during the last decade, clinical applications of thermoresponsive injectable hydrogels are still scarce. For this reason, a chemically modified form of an FDA approved polymer with thermoresponsive characteristics was investigated in depth.</p>
<p>Different research groups used Pluronic® to facilitate the handling properties of several commercially available bone filling materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211427774">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211427774">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, Pluronic® F127 was also used for cell deposition, whereby cells mixed with this hydrogel were placed as a thin layer on scaffolds. Using this strategy, it became possible to cover prostheses and templates with chondrocytes and bone-forming cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211427774">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211427774">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Weinand et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211427774">1</xref></sup> investigated if hydrogels could facilitate the colonization potential and new bone formation of BMSCs on a preformed porous β-tricalcium phosphate scaffold <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although the tested hydrogels resulted in a uniform cell distribution in the scaffold, bone formation was only observed in collagen I and fibrin glue protocols. Pluronic® F127, which degraded within 1 week in culture, resulted in poor bone formation. The reason for this observation was the fast dissolution of Pluronic®. Indeed, this hydrogel was reported to have a rapid disintegration as well in <italic>in vitro</italic> as in<italic> in vivo</italic> studies due to dilution by, respectively, the culture medium and body fluids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211427774">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increasing the <italic>in vivo</italic> residence time of the parent Pluronic® could be obtained by chemically modifying the hydroxyl end groups of PEO in a polymerizable ester derivative and subsequently radical polymerization. The modification of the hydroxyl end groups with di-acrylates has been described in the literature whereby cross-linking resulted in a stable Pluronic® hydrogel with a very slow degradation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211427774">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211427774">24</xref></sup> To increase the degradation rate, different strategies have been developed. Some research groups incorporated short oligo-glycolic or lactic acid derived esters onto the PEO chain resulting in an increased degradation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211427774">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211427774">26</xref></sup> However, the oligo-blocks do not have a unique and reproducible length; so, the rate of degradation is hard to control. By adding a depsipeptide unit composed of lactic or glycolic acid with the amino acid alanine or glycine, the degradation rate could also be tailored.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chemically modified forms of the Pluronic hydrogels were mainly used as drug delivery systems with prolonged release characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211427774">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211427774">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211427774">27</xref></sup> Reports on the use of these gels for the encapsulation of cells are limited. Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211427774">24</xref></sup> investigated the effect of the encapsulation of NIH/3T3 cells in a 13 wt% di-acrylated Pluronic® F127 gel on the cell viability. Immediately after cross-linking with UV light, no cytotoxic effects on the encapsulated cells were noticed. However, extensive cell encapsulation over a prolonged culture period <italic>in vitro</italic> was yet not studied.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a chemically modified hydrogel with controllable degradation, as an encapsulation vehicle for osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, the hydroxyl end groups of the Pluronic® F127 gel were converted via a three-step procedure into UV cross-linkable N-methacryloyl-depsipeptide units ending in the so-called Plu ALA-L hydrogel. The depsipeptide unit was composed of <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid and alanine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211427774">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a first experiment, we wanted to compare cell encapsulation in the parent <italic>versus</italic> the UV cross-linked modified Pluronic® F127. Initial cytotoxicity tests revealed no difference in cell viability of cells in direct contact with the thermal-gelated Plu F127 and the non-UV cross-linked thermal-gelated Plu ALA-L. On the other hand, large differences were observed over time for the encapsulation of the cells in the two types of hydrogels with the additional chemical cross-linking of the modified Plu ALA-L. In both gel types, cell viability after 1 day encapsulation was high, i.e. above 80%. This viability remained high in the UV cross-linked Plu ALA-L hydrogel during the following culture days. In the parent thermal-gelated hydrogel, however, viability dramatically dropped to around 20% after 5 days of culture. This was a significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> = 0.034) in cell viability in comparison to the encapsulated cells in the UV cross-linked gels.</p>
<p>Khattak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211427774">12</xref></sup> investigated also the encapsulation of HepG2 liver cells in a parent 20 wt% Pluronic® F127 without the addition of culture medium. This group reported a cell viability of 52% after 1 day of encapsulation but viability percentages dramatically dropped to 15% during the following 3–5 days.</p>
<p>Using the modified Plu ALA-L hydrogel, higher viability percentages of the encapsulated cells were found in this study compared to the results reported by Khattak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211427774">12</xref></sup> The reason for this finding can be dual. First of all, the medium could be supplemented to the encapsulated cells, which is not possible when using the parent hydrogel. Second, Khattak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211427774">12</xref></sup> concluded that Pluronic® F127 on its own affected the membrane stability of the cells, explaining the low cell survival. Since in our modified hydrogel the Pluronic® monomers are chemically cross-linked, they cannot interfere with the membrane structure. Moreover, a more stable gel with a controllable degradation rate and longer <italic>in vivo</italic> residence time was preferred for this study.</p>
<p>The anchorage-dependent MC3T3-E1 cells were first seeded on a substrate before encapsulation into the gel in the second experiment. In previous studies conducted by our research group, it was shown that the macroporous CultiSpher-S® microcarriers were an excellent cell culture system for MC3T3-E1 cells and BMSCs since the cells could colonize the entire carrier and the BMSCs could, when supplied with the proper induction additives, differentiate into the osteogenic lineage and produce matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211427774">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211427774">28</xref></sup> In this second experiment, we wanted to evaluate and compare the encapsulation of cells cultured on the CultiSpher-S® carrier with single cells suspended in the UV cross-linked Plu ALA-L hydrogel. However, the evaluation of cell viability was restricted to the use of a dual life/death fluorescent staining since precise quantification of cell viability using classic microscopically techniques were not possible in this 3D nontransparent microcarrier. By increasing encapsulation/culture time, cell viability on the carriers did not decrease, but, on the contrary, the number of viable cells increased. As a result of the observed cell proliferation, the originally single encapsulated carriers clustered together by the formation of cell bridges while remaining encapsulated in the hydrogel. Moreover, by increasing culture time, the gel hydrolyzed, releasing some carriers out off the gel. Within 1 day, the cells on these carriers proliferated on the bottom of the culture dish which was a clear indication of the remaining proliferative capacity of the cells on the encapsulated carriers. On the other hand, cell proliferation in the suspended cells in the UV cross-linked gels was limited. Anchorage-dependent cells need a substrate to attach in order to allow optimal cell proliferation. Consequently, it is justified for clinical applications to seed the cells first onto the microcarriers and to inject these together with the modified gel into the defect. Using this approach, cells can continue to proliferate inside the bony defect, increasing the implanted extra cell source and subsequently helping the regeneration process. The size of these carriers (ø 130–380 µm) still allows injection through a fine 16 Gauge needle. Different <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that these carriers can be safely implanted and will resorb over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211427774">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211427774">30</xref></sup> CultiSpher-S® carriers loaded with osteogenic differentiated BMSCs mixed in a polyester polymer have already been implanted by our research group into standardized tibial defects in goats. However, the bone regeneration capacity was rather limited in these <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211427774">2</xref></sup> The limited permeability of the used polyester polymer was most likely responsible for the hampered bone formation in the defect side. Therefore, the use of Plu ALA-L, an alternative glue, would first of all allow a homogenous distribution of cell loaded CultiSpher-S® carriers in the bony defect. Second, the hydrogel guarantees a sufficient flow of nutrients because it can retain large amounts of fluid. Furthermore, it was reported that the parent Pluronic® supports microcirculation development, which is beneficial for adequate wound repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211427774">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211427774">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>We demonstrated in an <italic>in vivo</italic> standardized goat model that cell-loaded CultiSpher-S® carriers can be implanted in a bone defect and be kept in place by a hydrogel. Furthermore, it was observed that these cells remained viable and it was clearly demonstrated that bone formation started from the injected cell constructs.</p>

<sec id="sec24-0885328211427774" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Chemically modified Plu ALA-L displays a reversible temperature-induced physical sol–gel transition and a UV-activated chemical cross-linking. This creates a condition where the cross-linked hydrogel has a lower and controllable degradation rate compared to the parent Pluronic® F127 and could be justified for clinical applications. This study confirmed that the gel is biocompatible and can be used to encapsulate osteoblasts, whereby a homogeneous spreading of viable cells into the gel was observed. In our opinion, mixing of cell-loaded microcarriers together with the modified hydrogel is a promising approach in tissue engineering. The cells can proliferate on the 3D CultiSpher-S® carriers and mixing the carriers with the gel will introduce an extra source of cells in the defect site resulting in regeneration from the center of the defect, as could be concluded from our pilot <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment in bone defects. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> testing is ongoing to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation potential of cells encapsulated in the modified hydrogel.</p>
