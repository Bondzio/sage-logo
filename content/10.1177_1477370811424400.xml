<abstract>
<p>Public opinion has been studied as an important influence in criminal policy and legislation. Different ways of measuring public preferences have been proposed. The aim of this study is to compare attitudes toward sex offenders when assessed through surveys and deliberative polls. An experimental design was used, with treatment and control groups and multiple observations. The results of the multivariate analyses show that the attitudes measured through deliberative polls are less punitive and more stable over time. The implications of this study for future research and the potential of deliberative polling in informing criminal policy are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past few decades, scholars have studied public opinion as an important influence in criminal policy and legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370811424400">Freiberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370811424400">Roberts and Hough, 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811424400">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370811424400">Roberts and Stalans, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811424400">Simon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370811424400">Wood and Gannon, 2008</xref>). Public views on criminal justice are critical because they are taken into consideration by policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811424400">Green, 2006</xref>). Public opinion regarding policy is said to set the ‘boundaries of political permission’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811424400">Yankelovich, 1991</xref>), that is, the limits or borders within which the public will support or tolerate a policy. It is therefore important to determine the position of the public regarding criminal justice issues.</p>
<p>The first scientific assessment of public opinion was made by George Gallup in the 1930s through the creation of opinion polls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811424400">Green, 2006</xref>). This method of determining society’s opinions and perceptions has been widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424400">Maxfield and Babbie, 2009</xref>), but it has flaws. One of the problems is that respondents are asked to express their opinion about a topic on the spot, without taking into account the information that the respondent has about the topic itself. Another problem is that most polls cannot distinguish the concepts of <italic>mass opinion</italic> and <italic>public judgment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811424400">Yankelovich, 1991</xref>). <italic>Mass opinion</italic> refers to superficial public opinion, characterized by inconsistency, volatility, and non-responsibility; whereas <italic>public judgment</italic> is ‘the state of highly developed public opinion that exists once people have engaged an issue, considered it from all sides, understood the choices it leads to, and accepted the full consequences of the choices they make’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370811424400">Yankelovich, 1991</xref>: 6). Public judgment exhibits stability, consistency, and responsibility. In an early effort to assess <italic>public judgment</italic>, Merton developed focus groups. This qualitative research method involves small groups of respondents who are asked about their perceptions and opinions about an issue through guided discussion by a moderator. It is hoped that such moderated discussion will generate in-depth consideration of a narrowly defined topic. Focus groups can provide a deep understanding of people’s opinions, but generalization of the results is very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424400">Maxfield and Babbie, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370811424400">Fishkin (1995)</xref> created a method of assessing public judgment that combined the advantages of both surveys and focus groups. Deliberative polling measures what the public would think if they were better informed and if they had the opportunity to carefully consider the issues at hand. First, a random and representative sample of the population of a country or region is selected. They are asked to answer a first survey on the targeted issues, and then are invited to a weekend of deliberation in order to discuss these issues. They are given briefing materials that present detailed information about the issues and the pros and cons of the different policy options. The participants engage in debates and dialogue with one another through small group discussions with trained moderators, and those groups compose questions to be asked of competing experts and political leaders in plenary sessions. As noted by Fishkin et al., these discussions are key to the process, since they give the participants the opportunity of ‘discussing issues with others with different experiences, holding different views and representing varied and sometimes conflicting interests. Ordinary people simply do not discuss politics a great deal, and when they do, is chiefly with others like themselves and of a similar cast of mind, for everyone moves in limited social circles and selects conversational partners partly on the grounds that their friends and companions think as they do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811424400">2000</xref>: 658). After the weekend, the sample is asked to answer the same survey again. The resulting changes in opinion reveal the judgments of the public, that is, the conclusions the people would come to if they had the chance to become more informed about the issues.</p>
<p>Deliberative polls have been used on multiple occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811424400">Fishkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811424400">Hough and Park, 2002</xref>) and they have shown statistically significant changes in the views expressed by the public. As Fishkin et al. point out, deliberative polling ‘is especially suitable for issues where the public may have little knowledge or information, or where the public may have failed to confront the trade-offs applying to public policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811424400">Fishkin et al., 2000</xref>: 665). Without any doubt, many criminal justice issues fall into this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811424400">Roberts and Hough, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1477370811424400">
<title>Public judgment and the influence of the media</title>
<p>The media have been proven to be the most important source of information about the criminal justice system for the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811424400">Gray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424400">Indermaur and Hough, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370811424400">Wood, 2008</xref>). For example, around 75 percent of people responding to the British Crime Survey in 2000 reported obtaining their information regarding criminal justice from television and radio, 50 percent from documentaries, local and tabloid newspapers, and 33 percent from broadsheet newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811424400">Mirrlees-Black, 2001</xref>). But the media’s selection and depiction of news related to crime and punishment is not driven by the aim of informing and educating the public. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811424400">Howitt (1998)</xref> points out, the media focus on sensational crimes such as those of a sexual or violent nature, rather than the more mundane property crimes that affect many more people. As a result, the public’s view of crime, sentencing and punishment is based on information about criminal activity that represents a very small percentage of the total crimes committed and of the number of offenders who go through the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Sexual offending is a clear example of this selectivity. The media influence the perceptions and opinions of the public by focusing on the exceptional cases – the extremely violent ones, where the worst harm is inflicted. As a result, public understanding of sexual offending is often based on myths and stereotypes that do not coincide with the real characteristics of sex crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370811424400">Brown, 2008</xref>). It is a topic about which the public tends to have strong opinions but very little knowledge, and an area where public outcry – often based on short-term, emotional responses to high-profile crimes – has had an important impact on criminal policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370811424400">Welch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370811424400">Zgoba, 2004</xref>). These features make sexual offending an excellent choice to test how deliberative processes and the media influence those opinions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stability of public judgment is claimed as evidence of its increased reliability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811424400">Hough and Park (2002)</xref> found that differences in participant views were still evident 10 months after a deliberative poll. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811424400">Jorba (2009)</xref> reports similar results. If public judgment is more stable over time, it may also be more resistant to the influence of the media, because the opinions formed through the deliberative process will help the participants question and filter new information provided by mass media. However, this aspect of public judgment needs to be further examined, since the only study that has analyzed the effects of deliberative processes as moderators of the influence of the media did not find significant results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1477370811424400">
<title>Public opinion about criminal justice policy in Spain</title>
<p>Although most of the research discussed so far has examined public opinion and crime in England and Wales, the influence of public opinion on criminal justice policy has also been widely acknowledged by scholars in Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811424400">Conejo y Mora, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811424400">Díez Ripollés, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370811424400">Larrauri, 2009</xref>). Public outcry, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370811424400">Varona (2008)</xref>, seems to have become one of the origins of criminal policy, because policy makers use social demands as a source for the development of criminal laws. The role of the media in shaping public opinion is recognized in Spanish academic literature. Medina-Ariza reports that ‘the data from the opinion polls of the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS, the official polling agency of the Government) shows that the percentage of Spaniards who rated crime as the most serious problem affecting them remained stable from 1998 to 2001 and only increased in 2002 and 2003, after politicians and the media centered their attention on crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370811424400">2006</xref>: 193). Public opinion in Spain is created by the media, by the victims or associations of victims, and, lastly, by ordinary people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811424400">Díez Ripollés, 2004</xref>), although, as Larrauri recognizes, ‘public opinion depends greatly on the method that is used to measure it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370811424400">2009</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Only two studies have empirically assessed the effects of deliberative processes on public opinion in Spain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811424400">Jorba (2009)</xref> analyzed the attitudes of a sample of 136 individuals toward juvenile night-time leisure activities, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al. (2010)</xref> assessed the attitudes of a sample of 299 college students toward sexual delinquency. Both studies found an important increase in the participants’ knowledge about the issue at hand, as well as significant change in their opinions after the deliberative process. However, Jorba’s results show that the changes in attitudes are stable over time, whereas in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al. (2010)</xref> analyses of the stability over time of the effects of the deliberative process and of its mediator effects on the influence of the media showed only limited results.</p>

<sec id="section4-1477370811424400">
<title>The current study</title>
<p>The current study, an extension of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al. (2010)</xref> study, incorporates a number of methodological improvements, including a larger sample (<italic>n</italic> = 380), a lower attrition rate, and a more reliable implementation of the intervention. The main purpose is to compare public judgment, created through a deliberative process, and public opinion as sources for criminal justice policy-making. The use of a control group reduces the possible influence of external factors. For example, participants in deliberative processes do not live in a vacuum, separated from influences besides the process itself. On the contrary, they continue watching the news and discussing the topic with other people, who might not have participated in the process. This study also analyzes if the attitudes expressed after participating in a deliberative process are stable over time and are more resistant to the influence of the media. If public judgment is characterized by its stability, then it will be more resistant to media influence than public opinion. This project assesses to what extent deliberative processes increase participants’ ability to critically analyze the inputs they receive from the mass media.</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>The research was designed as an experiment, with assignment of participants to the treatment and control groups and multiple observations. In each of three observations, all participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed their knowledge about sexual offending in Spain and their attitudes toward sex offenders.

</fig>
<p>The first questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the project, the second was administered about five weeks later, and the third about five weeks after the second. For example, if the first questionnaire was administered in the first week of October, the second questionnaire was answered around mid-November, and the third at the end of December. After the first questionnaire, half of the participants were assigned to the control group (the public opinion – PO – group) and half of them to the treatment group (the public judgment – PJ – group). Participants in the PJ group participated in a deliberative process about sex crimes and sex offenders before answering the second questionnaire. After completing the second questionnaire, half of the participants of each group (PO and PJ) were selected to be involved in a second intervention. That intervention simulated a mass media feature story about sex crimes. At the third questionnaire (survey 3) there were four groups: public opinion with (1) and without (2) a second intervention; and public judgment with (3) and without (4) a second intervention. Comparisons among these groups address the question about the resistance of public judgment to the influence of the media.</p>

<p>In the second survey there was an increase in students in one of the groups from Barcelona. From these additional 13 students, only those who were present during the sessions of the first intervention were included in the treatment group. The rest were included in the control group. The lack of attrition is due to the fact that the professor told the students that taking part in the survey would be taken into account in their participation scores for the course.</p>

<p>These are convenience samples selected from classes taught by professors who agreed to enroll their students in the study. Data collection and interventions were conducted during normal class meetings. The mean age of students was 24.3 years of age, 74.5 percent of them were women, 5.1 percent of the sample had children, and, with regard to political ideology, 63.7 percent aligned with left-wing or moderate left-wing ideology, 16.8 percent aligned with right-wing or moderate right-wing ideology, and the rest did not define themselves politically. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370811424400">Table 2</xref>, the number of participants decreased from 380 in the first survey to 261 in the third one, which took place in the last weeks of the semester.

<title>Survey</title>
<p>The questionnaire used to assess participants’ knowledge and attitudes toward sexual offending comprised three groups of items: 10 questions on knowledge of sex crimes and sex offenders; sociodemographic items about the participants such as gender, age, and political ideology; and the ‘Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale’ (CATSO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811424400">Church et al., 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370811424400">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The level of knowledge about sexual offending was assessed in two ways: the goal of the first four questions of the survey was to evaluate general knowledge about the prevalence of sex crimes and the recidivism of sex offenders in Spain (for example, ‘Out of every 100 crimes reported, how many are sex offenses?’). The other six questions were used to construct a Scale of Knowledge of Myths About Sexual Offending. This scale included questions such as ‘Most sexual assaults are committed by strangers’ or ‘Most child abusers find their victims by frequenting such places as schoolyards and playgrounds.’ Each question required a true or false answer, and each correct answer scored one point. The total score constitutes a continuous variable, in which a higher score (range of 1–6) indicates more accurate knowledge about sex crimes and sex offenders.</p>
<p>The CATSO scale is specifically designed to measure public attitudes toward sex offenders on four different dimensions: capacity to change, deviancy, social isolation, and severity/dangerousness. This six-point Likert scale consists of 18 items (3 of them with reverse score), and possible answers range from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. Three of the dimensions (capacity to change, social isolation, and severity/dangerousness) are constructed using five items of the scale. Five items, with a maximum score of 6 points each, result in a scale of 5–30 points. The dimension ‘deviancy’ is computed the same way, but consists of only three items, and therefore the scale ranges from 3 to 18 points. Higher scores on the individual factors represent beliefs in which sex offenders are unlikely to change, are sexually preoccupied, are considered to be persons who are loners, and are especially dangerous and commit extremely serious crimes.</p>

<sec id="section9-1477370811424400">
<title>The two interventions</title>
<p>The first intervention (deliberative process) was an adaptation to the setting of the concept of deliberative polling. Participants assigned to treatment groups at both universities (PJ) were provided with scientific data about sex crimes, in the format of a two-hour lecture during one class session, and another two-hour debate among themselves about related topics moderated by an expert on sexual offending during another class session. During the debate, the students were asked to complete two exercises. In the first exercise, students were divided into small groups and each group received a statement from an expert or a politician regarding chemical castration as a treatment for sex offenders. Some statements were in favor of the measure and others were against it. The students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the data mentioned in the statements and on the pros and cons of the measure. After the discussion, all students met in a plenary session where they had the opportunity to hear the arguments of each group and defend their own. In the second exercise, the class as a whole was asked to consider and discuss the following question: ‘If only one of the following two measures could be implemented, which one would be most effective to prevent sexual abuse of children?: (a) In-prison psychological treatment for those who have been convicted of that crime, or (b) Creation of public sex offender registers’. The moderators of all groups reported that there was a lively discussion and opinions from all perspectives were expressed during the debate.</p>
<p>The discussion on the topic and the available policy options following the information session mirrors the format of deliberative polling, as previously described. The participants in the control group (PO) continued with the normal sessions scheduled in their syllabus. The assignment of the students to the treatment (PJ) and control (PO) groups was done as follows: three of the groups (the two in Madrid and one in Barcelona) had two sections each, and one of the sections was assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. The other group from Barcelona had only one section and attendance was not required; therefore, the students who were present during the first intervention were assigned to the treatment group and the rest were assigned to the control group. To ensure that the treatment and the control groups were equivalent, <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the variables of gender, whether they have children, age, and political ideology. Only the variable of age was significant. The mean age of the treatment group was 25.2 years and the mean age of the control group was 23.2 years.</p>
<p>The first intervention – the deliberative process – has much in common with the educational process of delivery of information to students, who are expected to understand and memorize it. For this reason, and as will be discussed in the section about the limitations of the study, the use of a convenience sample of college students limits the generalizability of the results. Characteristics of the sample may also interact with measured change in participants’ attitudes. Students’ attitudes might be easier to change than the opinions of the general public, since college students are used to the learning process and, when presented with new information, may be more ready to absorb it. However, this intervention differs from the traditional educational process. The goal is not to memorize and repeat the information received, but to give participants the resources to form their own opinions about the topic.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the first intervention the students were surveyed for a second time. After the survey, the students in each group (PJ and PO) were randomly assigned to a second intervention. The participants assigned to the media simulation read a news report and watched a graphic video depicting a shocking sex crime that took place in Spain in 1992, in which three female teenagers were kidnapped, raped and killed by two young men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811424400">2</xref></sup> Participants in the control group also read a news report and watched a video, but the topic in this case was illegal drugs in Spain. For three groups of students (UAM1, UAM2 and UB1) the second intervention was done online: students received an email with a link to the documents and the videos, and were asked to read the news report, watch the video, write a small paragraph summarizing the contents and send it to the research team. For the fourth group (UB2), the second intervention was done during a class session.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The use of an anonymous survey to measure the attitudes of the students limits the analysis to comparison of the groups with one another and does not allow to test individual changes in attitudes over the three surveys. A multivariate analysis of the data was conducted to assess differences between the treatment and control groups (PJ and PO) in the first and second surveys, and between the four outcome groups after the second intervention (PJ and PO with and without media simulation). The variables gender, age and political ideology were included in the analysis to control for their effects on attitudes toward sexual offending. The comparisons are conceptually summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370811424400">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Influence of knowledge about sexual offending on participant’s attitudes</title>
<p>The idea behind deliberative polling is that, when people have access to factual information about an issue and have the opportunity to think about a topic, their opinions will change, but such change may show either more liberal or more conservative attitudes toward the issue. For this reason the first step of this project was to test if a higher level of knowledge about sexual offending was associated with more positive or more negative attitudes toward sex offenders. In order to do this, an OLS multiple regression of all the answers collected in Survey 1 was conducted (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477370811424400">Table 4</xref>). The variable ‘Scale of knowledge’ was negatively related to all four dimensions: the higher the level of knowledge, the less the support for ideas such as ‘sex offenders are unlikely to change’ and ‘sex offenders are loners’. Accordingly, the expectation was that, after participating in the deliberative process, the score obtained by the treatment group (Public Judgment) on all four dimensions would decrease, whereas the score of the control group would remain the same.</p>

<p>The first part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1477370811424400">Table 5</xref> displays the means of the answers to the questions about knowledge about sexual offending in Spain. The column ‘benchmark’ shows the correct answer to the question according to the scientific literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811424400">Centro Reina Sofía para el Estudio de la Violencia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370811424400">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811424400">Redondo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370811424400">Secretaría General de Instituciones Penitenciarias, 2009</xref>). If we compare the benchmarks against the answers provided by both groups in Survey 1, we can see that there is a general lack of knowledge about the prevalence of sexual offending in Spain and a tendency to overestimate the number of sex crimes and offenders who recidivate. In the Scale of Knowledge of Myths About Sexual Offending, the students obtained one point for each correct answer, and therefore a score of 6 would show that all the questions in the scale were answered correctly. For all the questions in this section, the answers of the treatment group changed in Survey 2 (after the deliberative process) and were closer to the real data than the answers provided in Survey 1. This change is significant in four of the five items. The mean of the answer to the first question (percentage of reported crimes that are sex offenses) of both the treatment and control groups decreased in Survey 2 and, although there is a greater decline for the treatment group, the difference is only marginally significant. This shows the importance of including a control group when evaluating the effect of deliberative polls; otherwise, we would attribute the decrease in the percentage given by the treatment group to the deliberative process, whereas the change in the control group mirrors that decrease.</p>
<p>The second part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1477370811424400">Table 5</xref> displays the mean of the scores obtained on the four dimensions of the CATSO scale. The value in parentheses is the maximum possible score for each dimension. Scores obtained by the treatment and control groups in Survey 1 in all four dimensions lie around the middle of the scale or even a bit below it, showing that from the start the level of agreement of both groups with propositions such as ‘sex offenders are unlikely to change’ or ‘sex offenders are especially dangerous and commit extremely serious crimes’ is not too high. Obtaining these already low scores in the first survey makes it difficult for the deliberative process to have a significant effect on attitudes, since there is little room for further decline. Two dimensions of the scale (capacity to change and severity/dangerousness) show significant results in the expected direction, while the attitudes of the control group remain similar. The other two dimensions (deviancy and social isolation) do not show significant results; the mean scores of both the treatment and the control groups decreased slightly. This result again highlights the need to include a control group in the study.</p>
<p>The analysis of Survey 1 shows that, at the beginning of the study, the students had a general lack of knowledge of the scientific data on sexual offending, a fact that is consistent with research done in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370811424400">Brown, 2008</xref>), and which confirms that the topic of sexual offending is appropriate to study deliberative polls. The same analysis shows that, from the beginning, the students had moderate attitudes toward sex offenders, which is also consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370811424400">Varona, 2008</xref>) which indicates that a higher level of education translates into less punitive attitudes. Further analysis of the data has shown that the answers of the students in the criminology class were more accurate and their scores on the CATSO scale were generally lower than the answers and the scores of the students of psychology. This suggests that in a sample from the general population the initial level of knowledge about sexual offending would be even lower, and probably the scores on the attitudes scale would be higher.</p>

<p>The statistical analysis of the answers to Survey 3 are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477370811424400">Table 6</xref>. The results show that the effects of the deliberative process did not wear off over time: students who participated in the deliberative process got significantly lower scores than the control group for the dimensions ‘capacity to change’ and ‘severity/dangerousness’ 10 weeks after the implementation of the intervention. With regard to the media simulation, the analysis shows significant effects for the dimension ‘social isolation’. The direction of the coefficients obtained in the multivariate analysis is consistent with the expected results: participation in the deliberative process reduced scores on the scale, and watching the video of the sex crime increased those scores. However, the second intervention did not produce significant results in three of the four dimensions of the CATSO scale. The analysis of the interaction between the deliberative process and the video of the sex crime does not show statistically significant evidence that the deliberative process mediates the influence of the video.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>The aim of this research was to empirically compare public opinion and public judgment about sexual offending in Spain, with the concrete goals of establishing (1) if attitudes toward sex offenders are different if assessed through surveys or deliberative polls, (2) if the effects of the deliberative process are stable over time, and (3) if public judgment is more resistant to the influence of the media with regard to sexual offending.</p>
<p>Regarding the first goal, analysis shows that the deliberative process has an important effect on the level of knowledge of the participants. As expected, in Survey 2 the answers of the participants in the deliberative process reveal a more improved knowledge of the prevalence and myths about sexual offending. If we look at the CATSO scale, this effect is significant on two of its dimensions (capacity to change and severity/dangerousness), and the direction of the change in attitudes is consistent with the expected results: the level of agreement with ideas such as ‘sex offenders are unlikely to change’ and ‘sex offenders are especially dangerous and commit extremely serious crimes’ decreases in Survey 2. It is important to highlight that on the other two dimensions, as well as in the first question about the percentage of reported crimes that are sex crimes, we also find a change in the answers of the treatment group in the same direction, but since the control group shows the same trend the change in attitudes cannot be attributed to the deliberative process. These results are in line with the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al. (2010)</xref>, although in that study the changes in attitudes regarding capacity to change and severity/dangerousness were smaller.</p>
<p>The conclusions can be drawn from these first results. First, the importance of including a control group when conducting deliberative polls is clear. A number of deliberative polls have been carried out in different countries using multiple topics, but to my knowledge a control group has never been used. The reason for this might be that deliberative polls have been conducted at a regional, national or even international level, through the selection of a representative sample of the population to participate in the deliberative process, which is then broadcast to the whole area of the study. This obviously makes it difficult to select a control group. Results from this study indicate that the lack of a control group can produce an overestimation of the impact of deliberative polls on participants’ attitudes, and that part of the change in public opinion might be due to the result of external factors not controlled in the intervention.</p>
<p>Second, the use of the CATSO scale makes it possible to differentiate among the dimensions that measure attitudes toward sex offenders’ <italic>behavior</italic> (capacity to change, severity/dangerousness) and their <italic>personality characteristics</italic> (deviancy, social isolation). The variables included in the model accounted for a higher variability of attitudes toward offenders’ behavior than toward their personality characteristics, and both the treatment group and the control group obtained lower scores on those last dimensions in Survey 2 when compared with Survey 1. One possible explanation is that participants’ attitudes toward sex offenders’ behavior are more malleable and more dependent on the level of knowledge of the surveyed individual, whereas what people think about the personal characteristics of sex offenders is somehow fixed and is less susceptible to change even when confronted with scientific literature on the topic. A hypothesis of reactive testing is also possible. For certain topics such as sex offenders’ personality traits, merely asking the participant twice for his/her opinion generates an effect. In this case, the first time that the individual is asked about the topic he/she is more inclined to answer impulsively, whereas asking a second time generates a brief consideration of the topic before answering. Further research is needed to investigate these differences.</p>
<p>With regard to the second goal of this project, the analyses show that the changes in attitudes detected in the second survey remain stable when the participants are surveyed for a third time, 10 weeks after the implementation of the first intervention. These results are consistent with findings of previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811424400">Hough and Park, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370811424400">Jorba, 2009</xref>) about the stability of public judgment, and reinforce the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424400">Marteache et al. (2010)</xref>, where, despite the lack of significant effects, the direction and magnitude of the coefficients obtained in the statistical analysis pointed at such stability. It can therefore be concluded that the deliberative process is not just another input of information into a person’s life that makes their attitudes fluctuate until the effects of that input wear off; on the contrary, once a participant has the opportunity to become better informed and to think in depth about the issue, the change in attitudes is solid.</p>
<p>The third goal of this research was to determine if public judgment is more resistant than public opinion to the influence of the media. The analysis did not yield significant results, either with regard to the effect of the media simulation by itself on the attitudes of the participants, or regarding the potential mediator effect of the deliberative process on the influence of the media. Two reasons might explain the lack of such effects. First, the reduction in size of the sample may be due to experimental attrition. Some students stop going to class at the end of the semester, which reduces the sample in Survey 3 to 255 participants. That reduced sample is, at that point of the analysis, divided into four groups: public opinion with (1) and without (2) a second intervention; and public judgement with (3) and without (4) a second intervention. Only 43 students belong to the group that participated in the deliberative process and watched the reconstruction of the sex crime. Second, the media simulation, consisting of a news report and a video, might not have been a strong enough intervention to cause a change in attitudes, owing either to its contents or to the fact that, for three of the four groups of students, that intervention was conducted online. These issues should be taken into account in future studies addressing deliberative polling and the ways of creating public opinion that is able to critically analyze and filter the information distributed by the media.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study should be noted and considered in future research. The use of a purposive sample composed solely of college students of criminology and psychology, in which the gender distribution tends to be around 25 percent males 75 percent females, is problematic. College students are used to the classroom environment and this might increase the effect of the deliberative process because the students are predisposed to learn what is taught to them. On the other hand, a higher level of education is often related to less punitive attitudes, which might decrease the effect of the deliberative process by allowing less scope for change. In a topic such as sexual offending, gender may also play a role in attitudes toward sex offenders, although that effect may depend on the specific dimension analyzed. In the analysis, females scored significantly higher on the ‘capacity to change’ dimension but lower on the ‘deviancy’ dimension of the scale.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study are not generalizable to the public at large, they do provide some clues to the potential of deliberative polling as an alternative to the traditional use of simple surveys to measure public opinion in Spain. There is no doubt that the best option would be to carry out this study with a representative sample of the general population, as has been done in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1477370811424400">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, the goal of this study is not to obtain results that can be generalized to the whole body of students in Spain, and much less to the general population, but to explore the potential advantages of using deliberative polling instead of simple surveys or focus groups. One way to improve this study would be to include students from other disciplines (engineering, computer science, etc.) in which there is a higher number of male students and where the study of crime is not part of the content of their courses.</p>
<p>A second important limitation is the fact that the assignment to the control and treatment groups of the first group of students from the University of Barcelona was not done randomly; it was done depending on their presence or absence during the sessions of the deliberative process. However, the inclusion of the sociodemographic variables of gender, age and political ideology in the multivariate statistical tests makes it possible to control for the effect that such variables could have on the outcome, and <italic>t</italic>-tests confirmed that the treatment and the control groups were equivalent with regard to the sociodemographic variables.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to point out that the first intervention consisted of two different activities: (1) delivery of factual information about sexual offending and (2) deliberation about the topic. Following the standard methodology, participants in the deliberative process were not surveyed after the information session and before the debate. It is therefore not possible to determine whether the difference in attitudes between the treatment and the control groups is due to the information given, to the debate, or to both. Previous research has shown that the plain delivery of information does generate some change in attitudes by itself, although the durability of the change has not been explored extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370811424400">Mirrlees-Black, 2001</xref>). Future research should address this aspect, in order to determine the specific weight of each of the two activities in the attitudinal change. However, it should be kept in mind that separating the effects of the two-stage process is not a goal in deliberative polling. The technique involves a package of interventions without trying to sort out individual impacts.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations stated above, this study sheds some light on the differences between public judgment and public opinion as sources for criminal justice policy-making. Future research on public views about crime and criminal policy should focus on the potential of deliberative polling to obtain more informed and reliable public opinion, especially on topics where public opinion and research hold very different positions. Examples include community-based sentencing, crime-prevention strategies or the legalization of certain drugs. As demonstrated in this research, control groups should be used when possible to control for confounding variables. Further tests of the resistance of public judgment to the influence of the media would be useful in determining the real potential of deliberative polling in informing criminal policy. Finally, replication of this study with other populations is needed in order to increase the generalizability of the results, and to explore if the change in attitudes when using deliberative polls depends on the participants’ previous knowledge or involvement in the topic.</p>

<p>The whole country was appalled by the cruelty and viciousness of this crime, which received important media coverage. The video was created by a sensationalist TV show called ‘El rastro del crimen’ (‘The trace of crime’), and is available on the Internet, in two parts: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_01L0AXkU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_01L0AXkU</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPylhD_s2U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPylhD_s2U</ext-link> (accessed 1 June 2011).</p>
