<abstract>
<p>In response to the commentaries on the paper on geographic engagement with grand regional narratives (Murphy, 2013), the author makes four basic points. The audiences for grand regional narratives should not be seen solely as policy elites; by extension, a variety of types of geographic scholarship can contribute to shaping large-scale regional narratives. Second, grand regional narratives necessarily have theoretical underpinnings, and there is no necessary opposition between them and microlevel studies. Third, geographically informed grand regional narratives can be produced that do not fall into essentialist traps, and they have much to contribute to public debate. Finally, there are significant constraints on efforts to shape grand regional narratives, but some effort to challenge those constraints is possible and important.</p>

<body>
<p>I am grateful to each of the commentators for taking the time to respond to the ideas raised in my article on the value of greater geographic engagement with grand regional narratives. The overarching ambition of my piece seemed to resonate with most of them—particularly Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613491215">Rigg (2013</xref>), Noel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613491215">Castree (2013</xref>), and Colin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613491215">Flint (2013</xref>), and each also offered helpful expansions and amendments. Nonetheless—and appropriately—some significant questions and concerns emerge from the commentaries. Four overlapping themes stand out: (1) the ambiguous audience for grand regional narratives, and the related question of whether addressing certain audiences can compromise scholarly independence, (2) the role of theory in the production of grand regional narratives, (3) the question of how to go about producing effective, useful grand regional narratives, and (4) the social and institutional constraints that work against the production of the same.</p>
<p>Turning to the first of these themes, I perhaps should have been more explicit about the audience issue, though Castree clearly understands what I had in mind (see his discussion of various “sub-publics” in the first paragraph of his essay). What Castree appreciates is that the audience for grand regional narratives is not just policy makers and other political and economic elites; broader publics are relevant as well. As I wrote in another context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613491215">Murphy, 2003</xref>), the largely successful effort of the Bush administration to equate the Iraq of 2004 with immediate post-World War II Japan and Germany was predicated on widespread acceptance of a “class of civilizations” weltanschauung that treated countries within the “Islamic World” as possessing an ethnonational homogeneity analogous to the populations of Japan and Germany in the mid-1940s. Political and economic elites may be in the driver’s seat in the sustenance of such grand regional narratives, but at least in quasi-open societies, they have to contend with preexisting and alternative conceptions that come from other sources.</p>
<p>I emphasize this point because it goes to the heart of an audience-related concern raised by a couple of my commentators. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613491215">Agnew (2013</xref>) worries that good scholarly practices may be undermined in the production of grand regional narratives because their appeal is rooted in “the style of presentation, and the possibility of publicity and recognition by elites,” which in turn leads to “dumbing down. (and) conforming to popular prejudices.” James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820613491215">Sidaway (2013</xref>) apparently shares this concern, ending his essay with a quote from Edward Said on the “intellectual duty” to “search for relative independence” from dominant institutions. If engagement with grand regional narratives is largely about writing policy pieces, such concerns might well be warranted. But the kind of work I highlight in a positive vein in my article shows little evidence of deference to prevailing norms because it is of a different sort: books such as Rigg’s study of modernization and development in Southeast Asia, atlases such as the one produced by Amy Glasmeier on poverty in America, and commentaries by Bill Moseley on agriculture and hunger issues in Africa (note that these are not textbooks, which Ron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613491215">Johnston, 2013</xref>, curiously—and wron-gly—cites as my only examples of regional syntheses penned by geographers). What these examples share in common is an effort to provide broad-ranging assessments of developments at the world regional scale—assessments that have the potential to shape generalized regional narratives not just among political and economic elites, but among a broader public, including fellow academics.</p>
<p>My call for greater geographic engagement with grand regional narratives is not a call, then, simply to write for the American Foreign Service Association (<italic>pace</italic> Johnston). Instead, it is an effort to encourage geographers to focus more attention on developments and interpretations at a scale that is arguably underrepresented in contemporary geographic scholarship. Rising to this challenge can and should be accomplished in a variety of different ways: in the pages of academic journals (as Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613491215">Krugman, 2013</xref>, recently highlighted, academic articles can bolster or sustain highly influential narratives), in scholarly monographs and books, in textbooks, on the university and public lecture circuits, in blogs and opinion pieces, and on radio and television. A multifaceted approach makes sense because grand regional narratives take root in complex, hard-to-define ways. Of course, one should always be attuned to the compromises that can accompany addressing certain audiences and make considered judgments about them. But unless one adopts a very restricted view of the audience for grand regional narratives, there is no reason to assume that efforts to contribute to the construction of them necessarily will involve sacrificing fundamental principles of scholarly integrity and independence. I know of no such accusations about Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613491215">Spence’s (1990)</xref> book on the rise of modern China, which I cite as an exemplary piece of scholarship in the grand regional narrative vein.</p>
<p>As for the role of theory in grand regional narratives, such narratives are always rooted in particular concepts and theoretical constructions, whether acknowledged or not. I had been explicit on this point, writing that my effort to promote engagement with such narratives was “decidedly not the same as asserting that those narratives have some authoritative or all encompassing character” (a quote from my article highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613491215">Rigg, 2013</xref>). This is clearly counter to Johnston’s assumption that “Murphy wants authoritative, value-free geographical grand narratives.”</p>
<p>There are, however, complexities to the theory–grand narrative mix noted by several of the commentators. As Agnew properly points out, grand regional narratives cannot be divorced from metanarratives, for the latter influence how the former are approached. In highlighting the conceptual foundations of metanarratives, I did not intend to suggest that grand regional narratives are not also conceptually rooted. I simply wanted to emphasize that grand regional narratives can be more theoretically eclectic and are more explicitly rooted in specific empirical understandings than metanarratives (keeping in mind that to be empirical is not to be empiricist).</p>
<p>My article did not stake out a claim for a particular theoretical approach to grand regional narratives because I agree with Flint when he writes that “a plurality of theoretical frameworks is the most fertile way forward.” Flint’s discussion of the relevance of World System’s Theory is well taken, and indeed (as Flint points out) World Systems’ ways of thinking underlie some of my discussion. However, I made the conscious choice not to foreground any single theoretical approach because I am convinced that efforts to examine regional developments through multiple theoretical lenses can benefit from geographical thinking. In keeping with this idea, it is important to understand that I am not making the claim that the region is the “ultimate or highest” unit of analysis; if I were making such a claim, it would indeed require theoretical justification. My claim instead is simply that broadscale regions are an important frame of reference for people and institutions—a claim that can be substantiated in a variety of empirical and theoretical ways.</p>
<p>As Rigg correctly points out, grand regional narratives can be drawn by theorizing up or theorizing down. As such, I do not see grand regional narratives as sitting in opposition to microscale/local scholarship, as suggested at the beginning of Sidaway’s essay. Most emphatically, nothing in my article should be read as encouraging “choosing between grand theory and its minor other.” My argument is simply that the larger regional scale is worthy of <italic>some</italic> attention. Since understandings of what is going on in different large-scale regions often start from the type of field-intensive, microscale work described by Castree, an oppositional view of the micro and the macro (or the meta) makes no sense. Pushing ourselves more frequently to scale up from the local is not necessarily a bad thing (as highlighted by Rigg). Making such an effort is quite different from privileging one scale over another.</p>
<p>The role of theory in the production of grand regional narratives might be thought of as one aspect of the third theme I want to address: how to go about producing effective, useful grand regional narratives. Several of the commentators offer thoughts on this matter, and I view them largely as supportive extensions of what I was advocating in my initial piece. Agnew suggests that writing grand regional narratives “is a fraught exercise unless the writer is willing to reflect self-consciously on their limits.” Indeed it is, and his cautionary suggestions are well taken. But his effort to critique seems to lead him to find tensions between his approach and mine that are not necessarily warranted. I make no claim, for example, for a separation of analysis and synthesis when it comes to efforts to produce geographically informed grand regional narratives; synthesis devoid of analysis is exactly what led to the downfall of traditional regional geography. Is it possible that the baggage of mid-20th century encyclopedic regional geography is so great that any claim for the importance of engagement at the metaregional scale, no matter how carefully crafted, should be deemed a priori suspicious?</p>
<p>In a somewhat different vein, Rigg is right to point out that my article focuses more on sketching out the general problem and explaining its significance than on the question of “how, where, and in what ways” geographically informed grand regional narratives might be developed. Given length constraints, my goal in writing the article was to promote more consideration of such questions, not necessarily answer them. I did, however, choose the case studies I developed with a view toward illuminating at least the “how” dimension, if not “where and in what ways.” It was heartening to note that, outside of Johnston’s commentary (discussed below), most of the commentaries on my case studies were positive. Of course, Rigg does question whether “Global South” is as problematic as I suggest in my third case study. If that term were indeed used only in the limited manner he describes, I could accept it as a periodically useful “strategic essentialism” (following Eric Sheppard—see footnote 8 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820613491215">Murphy, 2013</xref>). Much of the writing about fair trade, for example, is premised on a North–South dichotomy that ignores fundamental geographical complexities by simplistically equating “North” with consumers and “South” with producers (e.g. the discourse of Fair Trade USA, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820613491215">Raynolds, 2002</xref>: 411).</p>
<p>Johnston’s assessment of my case studies is more critical. He argues that I provide no compelling evidence that a geographical grand regional narrative on the Middle East is much different from prevailing narratives. It is hard to know what he would find convincing, but the fact that the types of geographical points I highlight were being made in a few quarters is hardly an argument against a more vigorous effort on the part of geographers to challenge the stunningly ageographic regional assumptions that have held sway in recent decades (<italic>accord</italic>, e.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613491215">g. Bassin, 2007</xref>). As for my second case study, Johnston may believe that the differences between the present European Union and the postrevolutionary United States are well understood, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Indeed, just a week before I wrote this reply, eminent Paris-based columnist William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613491215">Pfaff (2013</xref>) made the same point I made in a column on the future of the euro that attracted widespread attention shortly after it was published.</p>
<p>Johnston’s critique of my third case study is that it simply draws attention to the proposition that the world is “a more complex place than … simplistic theories suggest.” But my point is not just about paying attention to complexity; it is about recognizing a certain kind of complexity that comes from taking seriously interdependencies within and across places (i.e. the stuff of geographic analysis). My case studies were designed to show how a focus on such complexities at the metaregional scale can advance understandings or challenge received wisdoms about regions. Perhaps I could have chosen more powerful examples than the ones set forth in my article, but my hope is that Johnston’s skepticism does not signal an abandonment on his part of his decades-old call for geographers to embrace the “world as our oyster” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613491215">Johnston, 1984</xref>). And I would hope an argument in favor of promoting scholarship at the larger regional scale would not be dismissed simply because “human geographers have recast their discipline as a social science,” as Johnston suggests. The social science credentials of political science and economics have not kept practitioners of those disciplines from entering the grand regional fray; why should a social science orientation keep geographers from doing the same?</p>
<p>The final theme cutting across several of the commentaries concerns the social and institutional constraints that work against geographic engagement with grand regional narratives. Castree is right that I did not address this issue, and I appreciate his effort to specify some of those constraints. Agnew and Johnston also offer thought-provoking comments along these lines. That I did not specifically discuss the constraint issue is not an indication that I think it a minor matter; it was simply a choice driven by what I thought I could accomplish in one article. Having made this point, it is worth noting that, for all the power and inertia of the social and institutional dynamics working against engagement with grand regional narratives, I think we can and should struggle against them.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that academic practices cannot elude their institutional setting, as Castree points out, but there are no major roadblocks to producing a periodic piece that scales up from individual studies to make larger regional points, occasionally writing an opinion piece for a newspaper, or sporadically addressing public audiences. More generally, it is worth considering whether opening more room for the type of public scholarship I seek to promote in my article, at least from time to time, can represent a type of resistance to dominant structures of feeling and practice that are “insinuated into the systems of progression, reward and recognition that are both our own creation and yet regulatory forces appearing to stand against us” (to quote Castree). One cannot be naive on this front, but there are ways of pushing the boundaries as well.</p>
<p>Among the greatest obstacles to boundary pushing are the relative paucity of good examples and the temporal and resource demands of field research (points made by Castree). Accompanying and reinforcing those constraints is the Anglo-American retreat from regional specialization noted by Agnew. There is no question that my argument carries with it an implied critique of that retreat. I develop that critique more fully elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613491215">Murphy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613491215">Murphy and O’Loughlin, 2009</xref>), but for present purposes, I would simply argue that a reengagement with regions—not in an old-fashioned descriptive fashion, but in analytically grounded ways—is part of what it will take if geographers are to engage more fully and effectively with the grand regional scale.</p>
<p>To conclude my reply, I would simply note that it is always possible to point out potential pitfalls to the kind of engagement I am seeking to promote. However, it is hard to see how an argument challenging the value of greater geographic engagement with grand regional narratives can be logically sustained unless one is satisfied with the grand regional narratives that currently hold sway or is convinced that geographical perspectives have little to contribute to their formulation. Consider Agnew’s first condition for producing informed grand narratives: that the historiography of previous grand regional narratives should be critiqued. Of course they should, and one important point of critique is to question the spatial-cum-geographical assumptions on which particular narratives are based. Will that happen if those in the habit of problematizing spatial constructs are largely absent from the fray? I have my doubts, and I expect many of the readers of this exchange will have their doubts as well. Under the circumstances, there is much to be said for the “heady mix of history and geography” that Castree encountered in the disquisitions of his former Oxford professor, Tony Lemon, on South Africa. We turn our backs on that heady mix, not just at our peril, but at society’s as well.</p>
