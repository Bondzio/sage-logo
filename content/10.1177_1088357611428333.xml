<abstract>
<p>Children with Down syndrome (DS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently have difficulty riding a two-wheel bicycle. The purpose of this study was to investigate an intervention using an adapted bicycle and individualized instruction to teach 71 youth to ride a standard two-wheel bicycle. Youth with DS (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and ASD (<italic>n</italic> = 41) between the ages of nine and 18 years took part in this study. After five days of training, 73.3% of children with DS and 85.4% with ASD successfully demonstrated the ability to ride the bicycle more than 100 feet. Leg strength differentiated riders from nonriders in both groups. For the youth with DS, those who learned to ride were significantly older and heavier than those who did not learn to ride. Participants with ASD who learned to ride were significantly taller and stronger than those with ASD who did not learn to ride a two-wheel bicycle. Implications are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Providing children with a repertoire of physical activities to engage in during leisure time is important, especially in the presence of an overwhelming obesity epidemic in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611428333">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2008</xref>). Two-wheel bicycle riding skills are considered a societal norm in many countries, including the United States. Children usually learn this skill by the age of six to seven years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611428333">Klein, McHugh, Harrington, Davis, &amp; Lieberman, 2004</xref>). For children with disabilities, this motor behavior is often difficult to acquire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357611428333">Ulrich, MacDonald, Esposito, Hauck, &amp; Jeong, 2010</xref>). Many children with disabilities never demonstrate the ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle, or they learn much later than their typically developing peers. Acquiring this physical skill provides a means to engage in developmentally appropriate activities with friends and family and extend social networks while also increasing physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611428333">Klein et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID) and occurs in approximately one in 700 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357611428333">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006</xref>). Individuals with DS are at a higher risk for obesity, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal disorders, and cardiovascular-related health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357611428333">Barnhart &amp; Connolly, 2007</xref>). Health-related comorbidities in individuals with DS are common and may be affected by a lack of active participation in physical exercise. Children with DS often lag behind their age-matched peers in developmental milestones, including motor development. These motor deficits can serve as barriers to physical activity participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357611428333">Jobling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357611428333">Latash, Wood, &amp; Ulrich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357611428333">Menear, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357611428333">Reid &amp; Block, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357611428333">Ulrich, Lloyd, Tiernan, Looper, &amp; Angulo-Barroso, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357611428333">Ulrich, Ulrich, Angulo-Kinzler, &amp; Yun, 2001</xref>). Generally, low fitness levels and phenotypic characteristics, as well as limited social and recreational opportunities, compound barriers to physical activity and further limit participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088357611428333">Rubin, Rimmer, Chicoine, Braddock, &amp; McGuire, 1998</xref>). In spite of these limitations, researchers clearly indicate that with an appropriate amount of practice and a motivating environment, individuals with DS are capable of acquiring new motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357611428333">Latash, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357611428333">Smith, Kubo, Black, Holt, &amp; Ulrich, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive developmental disorders characterized by deficits in social skills, communication, and repetitive or restricted interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357611428333">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). In addition to these disability-specific behaviors, symptoms of movement disturbance appear to be common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357611428333">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357611428333">Leary &amp; Hill, 1996</xref>). School-aged children with ASD have weaker motor skill performance compared with their age-matched peers, both in quality and as measured quantitatively through standardized tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357611428333">Ghaziuddin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611428333">Morin &amp; Reid, 1985</xref>). In addition to motor skill deficits and less-than- adequate physical activity patterns, obesity is common in children with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357611428333">Curtin, Anderson, Must, &amp; Bandini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357611428333">Pan, 2009</xref>). In general, children with ASD prefer individual activities without performance expectations that could influence a team outcome; this excludes activities such as basketball or soccer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357611428333">Pan &amp; Frey, 2005</xref>). It seems likely that two-wheel bicycle riding would meet this preference as an age-appropriate motor behavior without team performance expectations and an activity with the potential of positively influencing multiple areas of the child’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088357611428333">Rosser Sandt &amp; Frey, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For children with DS and children with ASD, demonstrating the ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle takes more time and instruction in comparison with typically developing children. Most children with DS and ASD never learn to ride a two-wheel bicycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357611428333">Ulrich et al., 2010</xref>). Teaching methods for this group of children suggest adapted equipment, a person-centered instructional approach, and appropriate behavior modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357611428333">Staples, Todd, &amp; Reid, 2006</xref>). Acquiring this specialized motor behavior with an adapted two-wheel bicycle and individualized instruction might provide children and youth with high-intensity practice and appropriate feedback to successfully acquire the skill. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an individualized adapted bicycle intervention implemented over five consecutive days to promote the ability of youth with DS and ASD to ride a two-wheel bicycle.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1088357611428333">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Youth with DS and ASD in the age range of nine to 18 years were recruited to participate in the two-wheel bicycle intervention study through DS and ASD parent support groups, community organizations, and local schools. Participants were recruited primarily through email, each with an Institutional Review Board–approved attachment of the flyer. Phone calls also were made to local parent support groups if an email address was not active. The study filled up quickly given the intervention component; therefore, most recruitment occurred via word of mouth once organizations heard of the study. Parent groups often sent out the study flyer to an email group that they had established. Participants were selected based on their inability to ride a two-wheel bicycle independently. The Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board at The University of Michigan approved all procedures. Informed consent was obtained from all parents or guardians of the participants, and assent was obtained from all participants verbally (e.g., saying “yes”) or nonverbally (e.g., head nods or choosing a picture indicating “yes” or “no” for participation).</p>
<p>A total of 35 youth with DS and 43 youth with ASD completed applications for entry into the study. Diagnostic categories were based on a diagnosis of DS or ASD per parental report. There was no attempt to include or exclude participants with DS based on distinction of mosaicism, translocation, or trisomy 21. Participants with ASD were assessed for level of impairment using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357611428333">Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2005</xref>). Individuals were excluded from this study if they demonstrated (a) severe behavior problems in new situations that would limit opportunity for learning within a five-day period, (b) obesity that would make it difficult for their instructor to catch them if they began to fall when riding, or (c) health problems that would preclude them from participating in moderate to vigorous physical activity (e.g., uncontrolled seizures). Five of the applicants with DS and two of the applicants with ASD were excluded from the study based on one or more of the exclusionary criteria, resulting in a total of 30 participants with DS and 41 participants with ASD. None of the youth who participated had a dual diagnosis of DS and ASD.</p>
<p>Preintervention measurements were collected from all participants one or two days prior to the first day of the bicycle intervention. The health-related descriptive measurements included isometric leg strength, standing one-leg balance, height, weight, skinfold indicators, and the <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</italic> (4th ed.; PPVT-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357611428333">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>), which is a nonverbal vocabulary test highly correlated with IQ. These assessments were administered to allow us to look for correlates of successful program completion, and because they are perceived to potentially influence subsequent frequency of riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357611428333">Tsimaras &amp; Fotiadou, 2004</xref>). Parents or guardians of the participants provided demographic information. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088357611428333">Table 1</xref> contains SRS results for participants with ASD as well as race/ethnicity, maternal education level, and paternal education level for participants in both groups.</p>

<title>Measurement Procedures</title>
<sec id="section4-1088357611428333">
<title>Leg strength</title>
<p>Isometric leg strength was measured by an experienced, reliable administrator using a handheld manual muscle tester (MMT) from Lafayette Instrument Company. Practice administering the measure continued until consistency was obtained over three trials. One practice trial was given to each participant followed by three test trials for each leg in isometric knee flexion and isometric knee extension. A seated position was assumed for knee extensor strength. The knee was placed at 120 degrees, as measured by a goniometer (angle formed by the femur and tibia). The MMT was placed on the distal anterior side of the leg, three inches above the ankle. Participants were verbally encouraged to provide maximal force against the MMT for five seconds. Knee flexor strength was assessed with participants lying in a prone posture on a padded athletic table with their arms crossed and their chins resting on their arms. The knee was then flexed to 20 degrees off the table (angle from the table to the tibia), as measured by a goniometer. The MMT was placed on the posterior side of the leg, three inches above the ankle. Force was generated for five seconds intervals and recorded in kilograms. The participant’s best score was recorded from the set of three trials on each strength measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1088357611428333">
<title>Standing balance</title>
<p>Standing balance was assessed through a timed trial for each leg. With shoes removed, participants placed their hands on their hips and stood on one foot for as long as possible. Balance was timed until the standing foot was displaced, the hands were removed from the hips, the raised leg moved excessively, or the raised leg touched the floor. Three trials were administered and the best trial was recorded for each leg. Time was recorded to the nearest 10th of a second, to a maximum of 60 seconds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1088357611428333">
<title>Height, weight, and skinfolds</title>
<p>Height was measured while standing erect without wearing shoes to the nearest 10th of a centimeter with a portable stadiometer (SECA S-214 portable stadiometer). Two measurement trials were administered, and the average of the trials was recorded. Weight was measured (without shoes) to the nearest 10th of a kilogram (Health O Meter H-349KL digital scale). A physician experienced with measuring skinfolds in children with DS used Lange skinfold calipers and standardized procedures to assess skinfold measurements at the triceps and calf locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357611428333">Lohman, Roche, &amp; Martorell, 1988</xref>). Two measurements were taken at each site, and the average was recorded. A gender-specific regression equation for children was used to calculate percentage body fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088357611428333">Slaughter et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1088357611428333">
<title>PPVT-4</title>
<p>Receptive vocabulary was measured using the PPVT-4 and was administered to participants by a clinical psychologist with experience administering the test. This test was selected because it could be administered to all participants, inclusive of those participants who were nonverbal. The PPVT was administered in an area that minimized distractions. Participants selected pictures that best represented a verbal descriptor given by the assessor. The test consisted of 19 sets of 12 items each. A basal set was established once the participant completed a set without any errors. When a basal set was established, the participant completed the subsequent sets until an established ceiling set (the highest set) with eight or more errors was obtained. Age equivalent standard scores were established for each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357611428333">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1088357611428333">
<title>SRS</title>
<p>The SRS is a 65-item questionnaire, which has been validated and is reliable in measuring traits of autism in children and youth with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357611428333">Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2005</xref>). The SRS measures five areas of social development as indicated by the parent: social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication, social anxiety or avoidance, and autistic traits. The SRS provides a standardized score that qualitatively identifies the severity of autism ranging from mild to severe. The parent or guardian of the participant completed the SRS. Standard scores measured at 76 or higher represent the severe range, standard scores between 60 and 75 resulted in a mild-to-moderate ranking, and standard scores below 59 are considered to be normal.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1088357611428333">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The intervention took place in two separate facilities, one in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and one in Marne, Michigan. The facility in Ann Arbor was located at a private school with a large gymnasium and outdoor facility (parking lot). Participants at the Ann Arbor location had not been to the facility previously. The second facility, located in Marne, was on a fairground. This facility also had a large indoor space and an outdoor space (track/parking lot). This facility was unfamiliar to the individuals who participated at this site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1088357611428333">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>For the purpose of this study, successful independent riding was determined when the rider could ride a two-wheel bicycle a minimum of 100 feet independently. Previous researchers have indicated that a distance of beyond 30 feet is warranted for the purpose of independent riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357611428333">Burt, Porretta, &amp; Klein, 2007</xref>). Pilot testing at 30, 40, and 100 feet indicated that the distance of 100 feet was the minimal distance needed to demonstrate mastery. To maximize objective assessment, riding distance was marked and measured in the inside and outside riding areas. The number of participants with DS and ASD who demonstrated the ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle for at least 100 feet in the outside riding area was counted. These participants were considered “riders.” Riders then were taught to brake; mastery consisted of braking independent of verbal cues from the instructor. The final phase consisted of the self-launch, where the riders self-started their two-wheel bicycle. In general, when the rider could self-start, independent riding was achieved. Although not necessary to be considered a “rider,” the number of participants mastering these skills also was counted.</p>
<p>Once participants were divided into two groups (riders and nonriders), the measurements taken prior to the intervention were statistically analyzed to determine if these variables might influence mastery of bike riding. Participants’ age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage fat, PPVT-4 scores, isometric leg strength, and standing one-leg balance were compared for riders and nonriders in each of the two diagnostic categories.</p>

<sec id="section11-1088357611428333">

<p>The training protocol, assessment, and instructional techniques for this intervention were established by Lose the Training Wheels™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357611428333">LTTW, 2009</xref>). LTTW is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to teaching individuals with disabilities to ride two-wheel bicycles. The program uses adapted bicycles that have been engineered to gradually teach participants the necessary skills required to be successful riders. These skills include maintaining appropriate speed, body position, and balance. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357611428333">2009</xref>, LTTW held 62 programs in the United States and Canada. The intervention consisted of five consecutive days of instruction, which lasted 75 min each day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357611428333">LTTW, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were required to wear a bicycle helmet anytime they were on the adapted or two-wheel bicycle. Each training session consisted of eight children enrolled in the intervention, and each child worked one-on-one with his or her own instructor.</p>
<p>All instructional staff had previous experience training children to ride a two-wheel bicycle with LTTW and extensive experience working with children, with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in a movement-related discipline (i.e., physical education, kinesiology, physical therapy, and occupational therapy). Standardized training procedures require that LTTW provide a trained floor manager to supervise the trainers and to insure the fidelity of the bicycle intervention. The floor manager was responsible for making all riding advancement decisions related to the rider. The floor manager met with all of the trainers prior to the start of the intervention and before the start of each subsequent day to answer questions and maximize the quality of training. Furthermore, all staff members were supervised by an established expert in motor behavior for children with disabilities who participated in a formal bike training workshop implemented by LTTW. Various strategies were implemented as needed to promote appropriate behavior. Some of these techniques included, but were not limited to, the use of counting boards (to count laps on the adapted bicycle), water breaks, stickers, and other rewards instituted by the parents of the children (often in the form of edible reinforcers or access to favorite activities at home). Each trainer worked closely with the parent to learn appropriate behavioral strategies that could be used during the training sessions.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Each rider initially used an adapted bicycle engineered specifically with the goal of promoting two-wheel bicycle riding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088357611428333">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611428333">Klein et al., 2004</xref>). Some of the modifications on the adapted bike included a series of eight roller wheels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1088357611428333">Figure 2</xref>) attached to the rear of the bike, which replaced a standard back wheel. Rollers had a wide crowned surface. As the child moved through the series of eight rollers, the rollers became more tapered, requiring the rider to demonstrate better control of the bike.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1088357611428333-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Rollers were changed at the discretion of the LTTW floor manager as the rider demonstrated an increased skill level, which included leaning in the appropriate direction of the turn, engaging in continuous pedaling, maintaining appropriate speed, and demonstrating control of the adapted bicycle. The handlebars were raised to encourage an upright-seated position to promote looking in the direction of motion and minimizing loss of balance. The arm attaching the pedals to the gears was shortened, which reduced the range of motion at the hips in an effort to reduce the loss of balance while pedaling. Pedals were “fixed”; as long as the bicycle was in forward motion, the pedals were in motion, regardless of whether the participant was applying force. This was helpful in establishing a stable pattern of pedaling. The instructors used the handle attached to the back of the bike to prompt riders to turn, encourage speed, and reduce the likelihood of falling over or running into another rider. It should be noted that the handle was used minimally. Verbal encouragement was used as necessary; however, minimal talking was preferred to allow the participants to focus on riding skills. A bicycle technician, also provided by LTTW, was responsible for adjusting the bicycles to meet each participant’s individual needs (height and handle bar adjustment, seat adjustment, etc.). In addition, the bicycle technician was responsible for changing the roller wheels when the floor manager indicated that the rider was ready to progress to the next level. Changing the roller wheel took very little time, which helped to maximize on-task riding behavior.</p>
<p>When riders mastered the final, most tapered roller (Roller 8), they moved to a standard two-wheel bicycle. At this time, the rider was assisted in riding a straight launch of the bike. The straight launch consisted of a push start from the instructor while the rider made an effort to balance the two-wheel bicycle without the anticipation of navigating. The trainer ran next to the rider during a straight launch to help prevent falls. The straight launch was the initial step in balancing and pedaling a standard two-wheel bike independently. The straight launch initiated approximately 50 to 60 feet of independent riding.</p>
<p>When five or six successful straight launches were completed inside without falling, the riders were launched outside (typically in a parking lot). Prior to launching the rider outside, the riders were taught how to use a handbrake attached to the back wheel and to place their feet on the ground when the bicycle stopped. The command “brake” and “feet down” was used to teach this behavior. The launch on the parking lot consisted of riding in a straight or curved path for longer distances, with trainers running beside riders to spot them.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>In this descriptive study, all demographic information and descriptive data were summarized using means and standard deviations. All study participants were divided into groups based on disability (DS or ASD) and further categorized as riders and nonriders based on intervention success as indicated by riding 100 feet independently using a standard two-wheel bicycle. Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests examined differences between riders and nonriders to discriminate factors from those who were successful and those who were not successful in achieving a riding distance of 100 feet or more. Cohen’s effect size also was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357611428333">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Preliminary data analysis found no difference by gender; therefore, gender was combined for subsequent analyses. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When the appropriate adaptations and instructional techniques were implemented, a majority of the youth with DS and ASD in our study successfully demonstrated the ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle independently. With a preestablished success criterion of 100 feet, 80.3% of study participants met the requirements of riding a two-wheel bicycle independently within the five-day intervention, and most of these participants demonstrated the ability to ride more than 100 feet. This successful intervention further supports previous researchers who concluded that individuals with developmental disabilities can successfully demonstrate the ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357611428333">Burt et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We also included two additional criteria for measuring success: braking and self-starting. Both of these skills are important to further establish independent riding and will most likely contribute to the frequency of riding beyond the bicycle-training intervention. A greater proportion of riders with ASD were successful in achieving braking and self-starting. We assume that these higher level skills are influenced by cognitive level, which was generally higher in the ASD group. Self-starting is a more complex skill requiring more coordination and a lot more practice. The participants with DS who learned to ride but did not achieve the ability to self-start may have simply needed more days of practice.</p>
<p>Although only a small proportion of participants were unsuccessful in demonstrating the ability to ride 100 feet (19.7%), interesting trends were observed between riders and nonriders. Riders with ASD and DS had stronger legs. This finding is not surprising; bicycle riding is an activity that requires leg strength to be able to pedal for extended periods of practice. In general youth who fatigued more quickly spent more time resting off of the bicycle. Parents who anticipate enrolling their adolescents with DS or ASD in a bicycle-training program should encourage physical education teachers to work on leg strength during the winter and spring seasons.</p>
<p>Balance was less meaningful between the groups of riders and nonriders. Although two-wheel bicycle riding requires balance, the adapted bicycle-training technology appears to help the rider overcome this weakness. Baseline measurements suggest that both youth with ASD and youth with DS have balance deficits compared with peers without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357611428333">Vernazza-Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088357611428333">Wang &amp; Yun-Heui, 2002</xref>). However, even with these balance deficits, the adapted bicycle technology affords participants an extended opportunity to practice without fear of falling.</p>
<p>Analysis of participants with DS and ASD shows several trends that were not statistically significant but that are still important for describing successful riders. Participants who experienced success were collectively taller and stronger, and had better balance. Successful riders also had higher scores on the PPVT and lower percentage body fat. Although the PPVT is not a direct measure of intellect, it has been highly correlated with intelligence in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357611428333">Campbell, Bell, &amp; Keith, 2001</xref>). The difference in the scores of our participants also may affect the greater success experienced by riders with ASD, as compared with those with DS. There was a trend toward statistical differences in age and weight. This is not surprising in that older children should be more socially motivated to learn to ride. The same was true for youth with ASD, but with a more moderate effect size. Those participants with ASD who learned to ride were a little older than those who did not learn to ride. It could be that older children with ASD enrolled in this study, and they were lower functioning than those younger children. Inclusion criteria for this study suggest that children and youth who participate have a desire to learn how to ride a two-wheel bicycle. Although this subjective criterion is difficult to screen, it is possible that some of the younger children with ASD felt bicycle riding was more relevant to their respective age groups, ultimately providing a stronger desire to want to learn to ride a two-wheel bicycle. It is also feasible that younger youth with ASD and older youth with DS had the physical characteristics necessary to learn this skill in combination with the appropriate motivation.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents with DS and ASD are at risk for developing a stable pattern of physical inactivity due to various disability-specific characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357611428333">Frey, Stanish, &amp; Temple, 2008</xref>). Combating physical inactivity for these children is a primary health objective in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088357611428333">USDHHS, 2000</xref>). By teaching children new skills, such as riding two-wheel bicycles, the resources to be physically active are possible. However, this is just an initial step in a much larger epidemic, as physical inactivity is also a contributor to a shorter life span and higher mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357611428333">Messent, Cooke, &amp; Long, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Characteristics contributing to physical inactivity in individuals with DS are their cognitive impairments, developmental delays, low muscle tone, and poor motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357611428333">Latash et al., 2008</xref>). Individuals with ASD are likely to be physically inactive from a lack of necessary social and motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357611428333">Pan, 2009</xref>). Both groups of children lack opportunities to engage in physical activity. The ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle uniquely addresses many of these concerns and provides a unique opportunity with cultural relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357611428333">Frey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611428333">Klein et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that individuals who were successful in achieving a riding standard of 100 feet or more will continue to ride and to enjoy the positive psychosocial and health benefits associated with this new activity. In a follow-up interview, families were contacted after the summer months to find out whether their children continued to ride at home. A total of 47 families responded (18 DS and 29 ASD). In all, 27 children with ASD (93% of responders) and 11 children with DS (61% of responders) continued to ride at home following the intervention, which further supports the transfer of this skill to the children’s natural environment. Bicycle riding is one activity identified as a source of moderate and vigorous physical activity for children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611428333">USDHHS, 2008</xref>). It is a good activity to help improve physical functioning, with qualities such as being a noncompetitive activity with high accessibility in most areas, and practiced throughout the lifetime by many people. Specific to individuals with ASD, the repetitive and rhythmic nature of pedaling may substitute for other less productive forms of stereotypical behaviors commonly observed in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357611428333">Levinson &amp; Reid, 1993</xref>). However, this hypothesis needs to be evaluated empirically.</p>
<p>Limitations in this study include the lack of a control group. Parents who volunteered to allow their children to be invited to participate were primarily Caucasian. They also were highly educated, which is often associated with higher family income. Although the participants were representative of the geographic region in which the study was conducted, we cannot infer that the results would be similar with greater diversity in ethnicity or parental education levels. Similarly, the small size of the sample of riders who were unsuccessful at riding 100 feet makes it difficult to draw conclusions between variables that differentiate riders and nonriders. In the future, larger samples should be compared. In addition, this intervention was limited to five days. It is possible that more children would acquire the ability to ride a two-wheel bike with additional training days. Unfortunately, LTTW program currently is available for only a five-day training interval.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that the majority of youth with DS and ASD in our study acquired the age-appropriate ability to ride a two-wheel bicycle when appropriate adaptations and instructional techniques were implemented. Future bicycle-training interventions should occur within a school-based program.</p>
