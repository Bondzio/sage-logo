<abstract>
<p>This article uses multivariate logistic regression analyses of the 2005 General Household Survey to assess the impact of parents’ occupational and educational characteristics on occupational attainment in Britain, focusing specifically on the salariat. Differences in outcomes according to family structure are then examined, controlling for such parental characteristics. The results indicate that both parents’ characteristics are relevant, and that their effects interact. A smaller chance of a salariat occupation is evident for those who lived in a lone-mother family, lone-father family, or biological-mother stepfamily as a young teenager, reflecting different features of these family types, but consistently reflecting lower educational attainment. Both number of co-resident siblings and parental worklessness affect the odds of having a salariat occupation, this being relevant to family-type comparisons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines the dependence of attaining a salariat occupation on parental occupational and educational characteristics, and the extent to which family structure has an effect on this outcome stretching beyond these characteristics. Analyses of intergenerational class mobility in Britain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435062">Goldthorpe and Mills, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435062">Kuha and Goldthorpe, 2010</xref>) still tend to focus on father’s occupation or the ‘dominant’ parental occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435062">Erikson, 1984</xref>); however, internationally, authors examining occupational outcomes have highlighted the desirability of taking into account both parents’ characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435062">Beller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435062">Marks, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038038511435062">Schoon, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, studies of occupational outcomes in Britain have examined family-type effects surprisingly rarely, given the prominence of family ‘disruption’ in numerous educational attainment studies, often using longitudinal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435062">Ely et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435062">Ermisch and Francesconi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435062">Ermisch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435062">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435062">Beller (2004)</xref> noted the scarcity, internationally, of research on social mobility variations according to family type (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>); more specifically, she noted an absence of attempts within mobility analyses to integrate both parents plus family type into conceptualizations of family of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435062">Beller, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In Britain, educational attainment studies routinely include both parents’ educational levels; internationally, parental education also increasingly features in analyses of occupational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435062">Beller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038511435062">Korupp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435062">Marks, 2009</xref>), with mother’s education sometimes providing ‘class-related’ information when maternal occupations are not considered. While some authors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>) adopt a ‘dominance’ approach to parental education, parents’ educational levels are more often included separately, even if the ‘dominance’ approach is applied to parents’ occupations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435062">Gayle et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While both parental occupational and educational characteristics have been shown to affect educational and occupational outcomes, there is less clarity regarding what such measures represent conceptually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>: 2.10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038038511435062">Schoon (2008</xref>: 74) views them as indicators of ‘family social position’, citing the view that they can act as indicators of socio-economic resources and cultural characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038511435062">Gershuny, 2000</xref>). From a Bourdieusian perspective, they can be viewed as indicators of various forms of capital, and their impact on occupational outcomes interpreted as reflecting the intergenerational transmission of capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038038511435062">1</xref></sup> Bourdieu’s suggestion that educational systems are increasingly important within this process, provides theoretical support for a greater emphasis on the role of parental education in cross-generational examinations of ‘social position’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038511435062">1997</xref>: 55).</p>
<p>Educational attainment studies have also stretched beyond an emphasis on parental occupational class by focusing on maternal employment and parental or household worklessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435062">Ermisch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). Maternal paid employment impacts on child outcomes in a complex way: negative effects have been identified, perhaps reflecting reduced maternal involvement, but also positive effects; children’s ages and the full-time/part-time distinction appear crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>: 30–1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). However, any negative effects may be less marked, or non-existent, in lone-mother families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). Cusworth notes that maternal <italic>non</italic>-employment underpins lone-mother families’ higher rate of household worklessness, interpreting negative effects of workless households as reflecting both socio-economic differences and also role model and cultural capital shortfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">2009</xref>: 190), reflecting Bourdieu’s influence on her work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">2009</xref>: 24–7).</p>
<p>Some studies using longitudinal data to document family structure effects focus purely on the impact of experiencing a ‘non-intact’ family, perhaps qualified by the child’s initial age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435062">Ermisch et al., 2004</xref>), sometimes resulting in a lack of emphasis on stepfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435062">Ermisch and Francesconi, 2001</xref>). Authors focusing on the impact of family type per se, often with reference to a particular age (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>), stress the need to distinguish between female and male lone-parents and step-parents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435062">Dronkers, 1994</xref>); some also distinguish between family change resulting from separation and from death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>). Sample sizes sometimes lead to lone-father or stepmother families being excluded or not examined separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>), despite the conceptual importance of between-family-type variations in ‘distance from mother’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>: 348).</p>
<p>In UK studies examining the impact of family structure on educational attainment, in which the focus is on parental separation or any experience of a lone-parent family, or in which all ‘non-intact’ families are aggregated, controlling for factors like parental education and financial problems often leaves statistically significant net effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435062">Ermisch and Francesconi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435062">Ermisch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). However, in studies focusing on family type at a particular age, the net effects for lone-parent families tend to be small and non-significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>: 181–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435062">Ely et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>), although net effects for sub-groups are sometimes significant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>). Conversely, such studies typically find significant net stepfamily effects, sometimes contingent upon sex or the stepfamily’s origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>: 181; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435062">Ely et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott, 2004</xref>). Small samples frequently undermine examinations of lone-father family effects. In the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery (1999)</xref> found the lone-mother family effect on educational and occupational outcomes was removed by controls, but found significant net stepfamily and lone-father effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435062">Beller (2009)</xref> notes that controlling for parental class when comparing lone-parent and two-parent families poses problems, given the lack of information about non-resident parents, and their distinctive status; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435062">Scott (2004)</xref> handled the parallel problem for parental education by only using information about the parent common to the family types being compared.</p>
<p>Caution is advisable when attributing causal explanations to family disruption effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>). However, whether viewing them as explanatory mechanisms or controls, authors often consider factors within two broad categories: family economic resources and parental behaviour/involvement. Between-family-type differences in educational outcomes have been attributed wholly to financial resources or disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1997</xref>), or to parenting or family processes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>: 75–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435062">Ely et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435062">Lawson and Mace (2009)</xref> demonstrate that, when mothers are alone, their average ‘parental investment’ is higher, but that in families containing ‘unrelated’ father figures, average investment is lower (for both parents).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038038511435062">2</xref></sup> However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038511435062">Chan and Koo (2011)</xref> suggest parenting styles which affect educational outcomes negatively are disproportionately common among <italic>both</italic> lone-parent families <italic>and</italic> stepfamilies.</p>
<p>Another family structure feature which US studies have consistently shown affects attainment is number of siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey, 1995</xref>). While often included as a control, this is rarely a <italic>focus</italic> of UK studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435062">Iacovou (2001)</xref> excepted. Her findings echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435062">Van Eijck and De Graaf (1995</xref>: 282), who suggest that only children constitute the sole exception to a generally negative effect of increasing family size in western societies. This may be stronger for boys and in lone-mother families, although the evidence is mixed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435062">Dronkers, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435062">Gayle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435062">Iacovou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435062">Jæger, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435062">Iacovou (2001)</xref> shows much of the sibling effect reflects parental characteristics and behaviour (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435062">Jæger, 2008</xref>). Theoretical discussions often foreground ‘Resource Dilution Theory’, which suggests that number of siblings impacts on receipt of various parental resources, confirmed for the USA by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey (1995)</xref>; in Britain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435062">Lawson and Mace (2009)</xref> found negative effects of higher family size on parental investment. Number of siblings is crucial for analyses of family-type effects; if lone-mother families contain fewer children, this ‘advantage’ will weaken any negative lone-mother family effects in studies not controlling for siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>: 328).</p>
<p>In comparing occupational attainment between family types, this article takes account of siblings and also controls, in extensive, methodologically appropriate ways, for parental occupational, employment and educational characteristics. In addition to drawing on and complementing the literature on educational attainment in Britain, it adopts and develops approaches to examining ‘family of origin’ impacts on occupational outcomes advocated and applied in US analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435062">Beller, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435062">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>). The 2005 General Household Survey (GHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435062">ONS, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038038511435062">2007b</xref>) provides the data analysed. Its sample size is sufficient for ‘non-intact’ families to be disaggregated, enabling conceptually meaningful family-type comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435062">Dronkers, 1994</xref>), and its parental education measures are more detailed than those used in earlier studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>); this is crucial, given parental education’s importance as a control within family-type comparisons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0038038511435062">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data and Measures</title>
<p>In 2005, the GHS collected father’s occupation data for the first time since 1992, and also data on mother’s occupation and both parents’ educational qualifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0038038511435062">4</xref></sup> Respondents aged 25–65 completed the ‘Social Mobility’ interview section, hence this range is used here. Occupational attainment is measured using current/last occupation, coded into National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) analytic classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038038511435062">ONS, 2005</xref>), to which parents’ (or step-parents’) occupations, when the respondents were young teenagers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0038038511435062">5</xref></sup> were also allocated. Respondents also reported how frequently their families had financial problems at that time.</p>
<p>For simplicity, this article uses a binary occupational outcome. The distinction between the ‘service class’ and other occupations is conceptually relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435062">Goldthorpe, 2000</xref>: 248–50), gives balanced categories, and is used extensively (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038511435062">Erikson and Jonsson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>). However, the term ‘service class’ seems inappropriate, given that the Goldthorpe schema is not used; here we use the term ‘salariat’, as used in various other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435062">Goldthorpe and Mills, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435062">Kuha and Goldthorpe, 2010</xref>), sometimes specifically to label NS-SEC Classes 1–2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0038038511435062">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>While reducing the number of parameters to be estimated and presented, using a binary outcome ignores variations in the impact of parental characteristics and family structure, for example relating to the professional/managerial distinction, which influences occupational attainment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435062">Bühlmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038511435062">Savage et al., 2005</xref>). However, salariat occupations are consistently advantageous, a key characteristic for this article’s purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0038038511435062">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parental education measures based on highest qualifications were available (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038511435062">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0038038511435062">8</xref></sup> The GHS also provided extensive information about respondents’ educational qualifications. An amended highest qualification variable is used here (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038511435062">Table 1</xref>), with categories aggregated to remove unnecessary detail and adjustments to the hierarchical positions of ‘vocational’ qualifications. Viewed as a determinant of salariat attainment, this measure’s construct validity is evident from marked, monotonic variation in attainment across its categories.</p>

<p>The term ‘two-biological-parent families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>) is used here, in preference to ‘two-parent non-stepfamilies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007b</xref>), although question wording means that the relevant category may include adoptive couples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0038038511435062">9</xref></sup> To allow for non-linear effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey, 1995</xref>: 749), a categorical siblings measure is used. Since this relates specifically to co-resident siblings when the respondents were young teenagers, it is partly determined by birth order and spacing; these influence the period spent sharing resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435062">Jæger, 2008</xref>), and can affect educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435062">Iacovou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435062">Van Eijck and De Graaf, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>GHS2005 interviewed 11,955 respondents aged 25–65. For some, necessary data were unavailable, hence 722 (6.0%) were omitted,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0038038511435062">10</xref></sup> leaving a sample of 11,233. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038511435062">Table 1</xref> shows key variables’ frequency distributions. Within this final sample, insufficient information regarding the father’s occupation was provided in 913 cases (8.1%), the same applying to mothers in 562 cases (5.0%). These cases were retained to avoid distorting the sample, although retaining them reduced the explanatory power of parental class, since potentially diverse occupations are lumped together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0038038511435062">11</xref></sup> All the logistic regression analyses control for gender differences in salariat attainment; age and the age-sex interaction were also included, to control for gendered age and cohort effects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435062">Bühlmann, 2010</xref>). Using age categories allowed for non-linearity; five-year bands significantly increased model fit relative to less detail.</p>

<p>More than two-fifths of the overall improvement in model fit relating directly or indirectly to parental characteristics can be viewed as corresponding to a path from parental education to salariat attainment via both parental class and educational attainment. Furthermore, nearly three-quarters of the improvement both relates to parental education and operates via educational attainment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0038038511435062">13</xref></sup> The impact of parental educational and occupational characteristics on attaining a salariat occupation can thus very largely be viewed as reflecting ‘educational mobility’, or, more precisely, educational inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>: 1.2). The relatively small difference in fit between Models 5 and 8 also highlights the crucial role of educational attainment in transmitting ‘social position’, consistent with the idea that the transmission process operates primarily via qualifications acting as ‘institutionalized cultural capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038511435062">Bourdieu, 1997</xref>: 47–55).</p>
<p>Thus, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard (2007a)</xref>, this article indicates a key role for parental education in the intergenerational transmission of social position. However, the small difference in fit between Models 6 and 8 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038511435062">Table 2</xref>) indicates a relatively small effect specific to parental <italic>class</italic>; both this effect and the overall impact of parental class on salariat attainment are markedly less substantial than in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>: <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038511435062">Table 2</xref>). This may partly reflect the detailed educational measures used here, but the results may also underestimate the explanatory relevance of parental class, other studies having shown a substantial direct impact of class origin on class destination, albeit varying according to the class in question and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435062">Kuha and Goldthorpe, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Part of the discrepancy with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard (2007a)</xref> reflects the sub-sample with parental occupational information that could not be coded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0038038511435062">14</xref></sup> Some of the remainder may reflect a weaker intergenerational relationship for NS-SEC than for Goldthorpe class schema.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0038038511435062">15</xref></sup> Disaggregation into NS-SEC sub-categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038038511435062">Rose et al., 2005</xref>: 51) only removes part of the discrepancy, suggesting the <italic>detailed</italic> allocation of occupations within NS-SEC may adversely affect class mobility analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0038038511435062">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Extensive checks were made for interaction effects. The first identified involves father’s class and child’s sex. Specifically, Class 4 fathers were found to have a significantly greater positive impact on salariat attainment for women than for men, possibly reflecting more sons inheriting their fathers’ Class 4 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038511435062">Breen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038511435062">Erikson and Jonsson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>). Additionally, Class 1 fathers’ positive effect appeared <italic>less</italic> strong for women (at a borderline significance level: <italic>p</italic> = 0.063).</p>
<p>Two further interaction effects are more specifically relevant. Including separate variables for parents’ classes (or educational levels) assumes additive effects rather than any interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435062">Beller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038511435062">Korupp et al., 2002</xref>), contrary to the ‘dominance’ approach to family class measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435062">Erikson, 1984</xref>). Variables were thus added to the model to check whether the impact of parental class (or education) depended more on the ‘higher’ class (or educational level). These interaction terms were statistically significant, and could be represented parsimoniously by focusing on individuals with both parents in Classes 1–3 and individuals whose parents both had (any) qualifications. For the former, the second parent’s class had a weaker effect; however, its additional impact was still substantial,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0038038511435062">17</xref></sup> hence the ‘dominance’ approach would have been inappropriate (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007a</xref>: 4.18). While the additional impact of a second parent with qualifications was weakened to a markedly greater extent by the interaction term, including it alongside both parental education variables nevertheless provided a substantially better model fit than the ‘dominance’ approach.</p>
<p>Thus, the preferred model here for the impact of parental characteristics on salariat attainment is Model 9 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038511435062">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0038038511435062">4</xref>), which includes interactions corresponding to the effects of father’s class and child’s sex, the parents’ classes, and the parents’ educational levels.</p>

<title>Family Type and Salariat Attainment: Two-parent Families</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038511435062">Table 3</xref> shows the effects of family type on salariat attainment when family type is added to a model controlling only for sex, age and their interaction. Having lived as a young teenager in any other context than a two-biological-parent family is associated with lower odds of salariat attainment. With one exception, the comparisons are statistically significant; the exception involves biological-father/stepmother families, a small category with an effect similar in magnitude to other stepfamilies and lone-parent families. The reductions in odds for lone-parent families and stepfamilies are in the range 19%–33%, with more substantial reductions (&gt;42%) for 312 individuals (2.8%) not living with either biological parent, who are henceforth omitted.</p>
<p>From now on, this section focuses on a ‘two-parent sub-sample’: individuals who lived as young teenagers either with both biological parents or with one biological parent and their partner or spouse. In theory, equivalent parental information is available for these individuals, although the <italic>impacts</italic> of step-parents’ and biological parents’ characteristics are not necessarily equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435062">Beller, 2004</xref>: 9). To examine the effect of family type controlling for parental classes and educational levels, Model T1 (i.e. Model 9, plus a variable distinguishing between the three family types) was applied to the two-parent sub-sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0038038511435062">18</xref></sup> In this model, the impact corresponding to biological-mother/stepfather families diminished substantially (compared to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038511435062">Table 3</xref>), becoming statistically non-significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0038038511435062">Table 5</xref>). The effect for biological-father stepfamilies increased in magnitude, remaining non-significant.</p>

<p>A step-by-step assessment of the consequences of controlling for parental classes and educational levels showed the reduction in the biological-mother stepfamily effect was attributable to (step-)father’s education, and, more specifically, to the markedly higher proportion of individuals living in such families as a young teenager who were in the ‘Don’t know’ category. In other words, much of the initial negative effect appears to relate to children’s lack of knowledge about their mothers’ partners’ qualifications, perhaps indicating those partners’ lack of involvement with, or investment in, the children’s education, or perhaps their lack of involvement more generally, although these suggestions are quite speculative.</p>
<p>Taking account of how many siblings respondents lived with as young teenagers indicated that three or more siblings, and especially five or more, reduced the odds of salariat attainment significantly. Including this effect in the model substantially reduced the negative effect for biological-father stepfamilies, which tend to contain more siblings. A significant interaction was found between the sibling effect and sex, the negative effect of three-plus siblings being less marked for women, echoing other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435062">Jæger, 2008</xref>: 221; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435062">Iacovou, 2001</xref>: 44).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0038038511435062">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>If added to Model 1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038511435062">Table 2</xref>), the frequency of financial problems had a significant negative impact on salariat attainment, but there was minimal evidence of an impact net of other family and parental characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0038038511435062">20</xref></sup> Thus the sibling effect identified, controlling for parents’ educational and occupational characteristics, may reflect ‘resource dilution’ but does not operate via (perceived) frequency of financial problems.</p>
<p>Adding educational attainment showed that the effect of a large number of siblings only partially operates via this route (see Models T2–T3); conversely, adding educational attainment removed the remaining negative effect for biological-mother stepfamilies.</p>

<sec id="section6-0038038511435062">
<title>Family Type and Salariat Attainment: Lone-parent Families</title>
<p>Comparing lone-parent and two-parent families poses practical and conceptual problems regarding controlling for parental characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435062">Beller, 2004</xref>), since the number and sex of the (resident) parent(s) for whom data are available vary with family type. To circumvent such problems, we first focus solely on families containing ‘mothers’ (including stepmothers/female partners), and then on families containing ‘fathers’, including in the models in each analysis only the class and education variables corresponding to the sex of parent present in all families.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to construct a single parental class variable and a single parental education variable using all the parental information. However, household or couple-based measures can blur the distinction between the effects of class or education and of family type. In an earlier study, controlling for the class of the ‘Household Reference Person’ (HRP) accounted for some of the difference in educational attainment between lone-mother families and ‘married non-stepfamilies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435062">Lampard, 2007b</xref>: 45–6). However, a problem with this finding is that occupational segregation by sex can induce a greater class difference between the HRPs of different family types than is obtained by comparing mothers’ occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038038511435062">2007b</xref>: 44). Thus the relative class position of lone-mother families may be depressed artefactually, leading to some of the difference in attainment between family types being attributed to class rather than family type. Similarly, the ‘dominance’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435062">Erikson, 1984</xref>) leads to greater differences between the class or educational profiles of different family types than does examining parents of a specified sex, since the ‘second’ parents’ characteristics raise the classes or educational levels of (some) two-parent families, while those of lone-parent families are unaffected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0038038511435062">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, a parent’s departure may genuinely ‘change’ a family’s class position. Note, then, that the approach taken here controls for the <italic>broad</italic> positioning of families in the class structure, but retains within the family-type effect any indirect effect of family disruption on salariat attainment operating via its impact on family class position.</p>
<p>To contextualize the following sex-specific lone-parent analyses, note that adding educational attainment to the ‘baseline’ model, containing family type and age, sex and their interaction, results in odds ratios of very close to one for the comparisons of each form of lone-parent family with two-biological-parent families. The overall differences in salariat attainment between lone-parent and two-biological-parent families thus appear to reflect educational attainment (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref>: Models M3/F3).</p>

<p>The remainder of this section consists of narrative accounts of the sequential addition of various independent variables within the two sex-specific analyses, starting in each case with the ‘baseline’ model and ending with one containing all the independent variables, except educational attainment (Models M2/F2: see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref>). Consequently, quoted parameter estimates sometimes come from ‘intermediate’ models, not included in the tables. The concluding paragraph highlights a key difference between the lone-mother and lone-father analyses.</p>
<p>Restricting attention to families containing a mother (or female partner), adding mother’s class and mother’s education to the baseline model only slightly reduced the difference between lone-mother and two-biological-parent families, compared to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038511435062">Table 3</xref> (the odds ratio rising to 0.82, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). However, the difference might reflect lone-mother families experiencing more financial problems. Further controlling for the frequency of household financial problems experienced as a young teenager significantly improved the model fit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0038038511435062">22</xref></sup> The difference in salariat attainment between lone-mother and two-biological-parent families was substantially reduced, leaving an odds ratio of 0.88, still substantively interesting but statistically non-significant (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>A check for interaction effects identified a substantially and significantly greater negative impact of non-employment for lone mothers, echoing other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>), and suggesting that controlling for parental worklessness might be pertinent. Indeed, it significantly improved the model fit, with no interaction evident between the parental worklessness and family-type effects. The inclusion of parental worklessness rendered the difference in salariat attainment between lone-mother and two-biological-parent families negligible (an odds ratio of 0.97). There was surprisingly little overlap between the financial problems and parental worklessness effects, parental worklessness appearing to affect salariat attainment irrespective of financial problems.</p>
<p>However, when number of siblings was added to the model, the effect of the financial problems measure decreased, suggesting that large families do not simply induce financial problems. The larger difference in attainment between lone-mother and two-biological-parent families in Model M1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref>), compared to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038511435062">Table 3</xref>, reflects the inclusion of number of siblings, since fewer lone-mother families included three-plus siblings, highlighting that sibship size is a crucial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>: 337–44). No interaction between the sibling effect and family type was apparent. Unlike the financial problems and parental worklessness effects, the sibling effect remained statistically significant net of educational attainment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref>: Models M2–M3).</p>
<p>We now compare lone-father and two-parent families, restricting the analysis to families containing a father (or male partner). The results partly mirror those for lone-mother families: adding father’s class and father’s education to the baseline model only accounted for a small proportion of the difference between lone-father and two-biological-parent families in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038038511435062">Table 3</xref> (the odds ratio rising slightly to 0.71, <italic>p</italic> = 0.030). However, the impact of controlling for other factors on the difference between lone-parent and two-biological-parent families varies between the lone-mother and lone-father analyses. In the latter, when the financial problems measure was added, only the comparison between frequent problems and no problems was significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05); consequently the difference in salariat attainment between lone-father and two-biological-parent families was only slightly reduced, and stayed significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Adding parental worklessness did not improve the model fit significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0038038511435062">23</xref></sup> When number of siblings was added, the financial problems measure became statistically non-significant, and the difference between the odds of salariat attainment for lone-father and two-biological-parent families increased, since fewer lone-father families included three-plus siblings. Overall, the other factors in Model F2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref>) explained little of the difference between lone-father and two-biological-parent families.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038038511435062">Table 6</xref> facilitates comparisons between the lone-mother and lone-father family findings. Models M1 and F1 include the age, sex and age-sex interaction controls, together with family type and number of siblings. The odds ratios comparing lone-parent and two-biological-parent families are 0.79 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) for lone-mother and 0.64 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) for lone-father families. However, the corresponding values from Models M2 and F2, which also include mothers’ or fathers’ characteristics, the financial problems measure and parental worklessness, are 0.93 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.360) and 0.70 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.025). Thus, factors accounting for most of the difference between the odds of salariat attainment for lone-<italic>mother</italic> and two-biological-parent families account for little of the (larger) difference between lone-<italic>father</italic> and two-biological-parent families.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article demonstrates that someone’s likelihood of obtaining a salariat occupation depends on the occupational and educational characteristics of <italic>both</italic> their parents, with the effects of the two parents’ characteristics interacting. These effects largely operate via educational attainment; viewed in combination with the important role of parental education, this suggests that class mobility is best viewed as one facet of a broader intergenerational transmission of social position.</p>
<p>The lower likelihood of salariat attainment for various forms of ‘non-intact’ family is also shown here to vary in origin, since the impact of the inclusion of some specific independent variables on this deficit varies according to family type. Among lone-mother families, the findings suggest that the shortfall reflects financial problems and non-employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>), whereas among biological-mother stepfamilies and lone-father families one might speculate that it relates to reduced parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435062">Lawson and Mace, 2009</xref>) and mother absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>) respectively. However, for all these three family types, lower educational attainment is the vehicle of their negative impact; something about them thus seems either to reduce the amount of capital that can be converted into institutionalized cultural or educational capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038511435062">Bourdieu, 1997</xref>), or to make the process of ‘transforming’ it less effective. Nevertheless, broad generalizations about the negative impact of ‘non-intact’ families seem unjustified; such an effect may not exist, for example, among working-lone-mother families with no financial problems. Concerns about the impact of family structure per se may be more justifiable with reference to ‘large’ families; these appear related to marked reductions in salariat attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435062">Downey, 1995</xref>), particularly for men, even when educational attainment and the other factors considered here are taken into account.</p>
<p>In addition to extending the previously limited research evidence relating to family-type effects on occupational outcomes in Britain, this article also paints a more detailed picture of differences between family types than most of the recent literature on educational attainment in Britain, resonating with the US findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery (1999)</xref>, but controlling for parental characteristics in a more satisfactory, sophisticated way. However, social change can reduce the salience of results based on past behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038511435062">Kiernan, 1996</xref>);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0038038511435062">24</xref></sup> fortunately, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery (1999</xref>: 348–9), we found little evidence of any changes in <italic>effects</italic> over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0038038511435062">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The findings’ implications for policy debates are highly dependent on one’s causal assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435062">Ní Bhrolcháin et al., 2000</xref>: 67–8). More specifically, the findings may seem to resonate with a widely held positive view of lone mothers taking up paid work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435062">Biblarz and Raftery, 1999</xref>: 353; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435062">Cusworth, 2009</xref>: 194–5). However, employment may not, in itself, enable lone mothers to act as effective role models or to increase their children’s educational capital, and may instead reduce levels of parental contact or involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0038038511435062">26</xref></sup></p>
