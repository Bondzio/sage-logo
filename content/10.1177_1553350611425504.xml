<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is characterized by difficult evacuation of stool because of pelvic floor alteration. The evidence that patients treated with recto-proctopexy for hemorrhoidal disease with circular stapler have benefited with defecation improvement suggests the role of recto-anal prolapse in the genesis of the obstructed defecation symptomatology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611425504">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The constant evolution of techniques and surgical devices and the variety of the same surgical approaches proposed confirms the difficulty in treatment standardization for this functional disease. The rectal prolapse-regulated transanal resection STARR,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611425504">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611425504">3</xref></sup> introduced by Longo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611425504">4</xref></sup> and studied by others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611425504">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611425504">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611425504">6</xref></sup> uses 2 circular PPH-01 staplers (Ethicon Endo-Surgery; Cincinnati, OH) and is considered a safe, effective, and extremely convenient surgery for the treatment of ODS, accompanied by rectocele and rectal prolapse. The need to perform such an intervention with an instrument even more suitable and proportioned to the rectal prolapse to be resected has called for the introduction of the mechanical stapler Contour Transtar CCS30. The STARR intervention performed with such a staple is a (full-thickness) rectal resection that allows ablating a larger amount of the rectal wall compared with the resection executed with circular staplers PPH-01.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Sixty-four patients operated for ODS in the Coloproctology Division at the private health facility Eretenia, from January 2007 to June 2009, were prospectively observed.</p>

For each patient a specific medical record was prepared that contained preoperative data, diagnostic exams undertaken, surgical data, and follow-up data. In addition, an informatics database was created for the collection of presurgical and follow-up data. The medical history was redacted by using dedicated questionnaires on constipation and fecal incontinence: for constipation, ODS score recently proposed by Longo (range = 0-40; questionnaire not yet statistically evaluated but widely used in clinical trials) and the ODS score proposed by Altomare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611425504">7</xref></sup> were used; for fecal incontinence, the Wexner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611425504">8</xref></sup> and the SS scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611425504">9</xref></sup> were used to classify the symptom severity score (score available in the European STARR registry).</p></list-item>

<title>Surgical Operation</title>
<p>From January 2007 to June 2009, 32 patients consecutively underwent the STARR procedure with the circular PPH-01 double stapler (STARR group), and 32 patients consecutively underwent STARR with CCS30 Contour Transtar stapler (Transtar group).</p>
<p>Both operations were performed for all patients under spinal anesthesia according to the original techniques by Longo with use of the “parachute traction system” of rectal prolapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611425504">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the end of each surgical operation, the resected portion obtained was weighed and measured, and these data were then inserted in the informatics database together with the quantity of hemostatic stitches positioned during the procedure. The suggested home therapy consisted of supply of pain medication and prescribing of adequate hygienic rules.</p>

<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>Patients were reevaluated during outpatient care for control at week 1, at month 1, and 3 months after the operation; subsequently, they have been followed-up including a proctological examination and evaluation of symptoms through questionnaires at 6 months and later annually. Data were collected from the filled in paper medical record, which consists of a datasheet for medical history, and dedicated questionnaires that are reported in the informatics database.</p>

<p>Every patient of the STARR group (32 patients) showed rectoanal prolapse and anterior rectocele; 63% showed descending perineum. None of them showed fecal incontinence in the preoperative stage; in only 1 patient a moving enterocele during the perineography was recorded.</p>
<p>All patients of the Transtar group showed a descending perineum with anterior rectocele and rectoanal prolapse.</p>
<p>The average operating time for the STARR group was 28 minutes (range = 20-45 minutes), whereas for the Transtar group it was 43 minutes (range = 32-65 minutes); there is statistically significant difference between the 2 techniques with regard to operative time, in favor of the STARR group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The average in-hospital postoperative period was 2 days (range = 1-3 days) for the STARR group patients and 4 days (range = 3-7 days) for the Transtar group patients; this difference is also statistically significant in favor of the STARR group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>The average weight of the resection in the STARR group was 10.4 g in total (range = 8-13 g), 5.2 g (range = 4-6.6 g) for the anterior resection and 5.1 g (range = 4.8-6.9 g) for the posterior resection.</p>
<p>The average weight of the resections for Transtar group was 28.1 g (range = 17-46 g). The resections obtained show major dimensions and weight for the Transtar group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>No intraoperative complications appeared in the STARR group; however, 2 posterior floor partial dehiscences of the suture occurred in the Transtar group and were solved with manual intraoperative suture with no consequences in the postoperative period.</p>
<p>With regard to early complications, rectal bleeding was reported in 4 cases in the STARR group: 2 within 24 hours, 1 within 36 hours, and 1 within 48 hours of the operation, all of which were solved with surgical revision. In the Transtar group, the following occurred: a hemoperitoneum that was treated with (synchronous) colostomy and subsequent recanalization and 2 partial dehiscences of suture rim that were treated conservatively.</p>
<p>With regard to late complications, in the STARR group, urgency in the postoperative period was shown by 29 patients (29.8%) at 1 month and at 3 months and by 23 patients (23.7%) at 6 months but absent in all at 1 year (3 patients were treated with pelvic rehabilitation). In the Transtar group, urgency was shown by 6 patients (18.7%) at 1 month, which persisted at 3 and 6 months, and disappeared at 1 year in all patients except in 1 patient (3.2%). Four patients (4.1%) in the STARR group and 1 patient (3.2%) in the Transtar group showed hematochezia for granuloma due to agraphes, 2 patients in the STARR group developed rim suture stenosis that was solved with manual suture, and 1 patient in the STARR group shown fecal incontinence that was solved with postoperative pelvic rehabilitation. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of both early and late complications.</p>
<p>The postoperative symptoms recorded through the questionnaires improved statistically significantly in both groups without any difference expressed by the 2 methodologies: the Longo ODS average score changed from 12.4 preoperative to 1.6 postoperative at 6 months to 1 at 1 year in the STARR group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and from 15.6 preoperative to 1.5 postoperative at 6 months to 1 at 1 year in the Transtar group. The ODS score changed from 13 in the preoperative period to 1.8 in the postoperative period at 6 months to 1 at 1 year in the STARR group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), and from 15 in the preoperative period in the Transtar group to 2 in the postoperative period at 6 months and to 1 at 1 year (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The SS score instead changed from 12 to 2 at 6 postoperative months to 1 at 1 postoperative year in the STARR group, and from 14 to 2 at 6 postoperative months to 1 at 1 year in the Transtar group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1553350611425504" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The theory that currently better explains the ODS pathogenesis is that of the rectal prolapse (unitary theory of prolapse) that would represent the first alteration from which would originate all the alterations of the ODS. If the prolapse is the first cause, the issue concept of the ODS theory is represented by the excision of rectal prolapse. This is why the scientific research is currently focused on transanal treatment for ODS with the creation of new surgical and more dedicated devices. Actually, the focal points most discussed refer indeed to the dimensions of the rectal prolapse. Are the ODS symptoms related to the amount of rectal prolapse? And consequently, are the functional postoperative results better when it is achieved to remove a major quantity of the rectal wall? And concerning the complications, does a more dedicated tool favor the surgeon to perform a more physiologic and user friendly suture, decreasing therefore preoperative and postoperative complications?</p>
<p>According to our experience, the 2 surgical techniques have demonstrated equal effectiveness with regard to the symptomatology that has actually recorded a statistically significant improvement for both groups, with no difference between the 2 techniques. We did not observe statistically significant differences for intraoperative complications also, suggesting the safety of both techniques if performed correctly by an expert surgeon.</p>
<p>In terms of postoperative complications, we have not observed statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to the complications seen, but after a qualitative analysis, Transtar complications are to be considered more critical (hemoperitoneum and suture dehiscence) than those obtained with STARR (rectal bleeding). Long-term postoperative complications have been shown to be similar. In particular, fecal urgency appears in all groups with no record of statistically significant differences. In accordance to literature data, such symptoms decrease until almost disappearing at 1 year after the operation. It has to be outlined though that such symptomatology is incapacitating for the patient’s quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1553350611425504" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Obstructed defecation syndrome is an important clinical reality in a coloproctologic outpatient department and often requires a complex diagnostic and therapeutic treatment.</p>
<p>The 2 surgical approaches evaluated have demonstrated a similar incidence of complications and consisted with the data reported in literature and are therefore to be considered as safe techniques when performed by a surgeon with enough experience in the use of the devices.</p>
<p>The absence of statistical differences among clinical results obtained through the 2 methods confirms the hypothesis that a good preoperative study and an accurate selection of patients with severe criteria are the fundamental condition for a successful operation apart from the adopted technique.</p>
<p>Probably, the prolapse amount removed is not important, but the adoption of the right technique is important, measured not only on the prolapse degree but also on the symptomatology and the preoperative clinical situation. STARR and Transtar still show some inconveniences that we are not able to comprehend and solve, such as the urgency and the postoperative bleeding (even though minimal). Further neurophysiopathological studies could perhaps clarify these aspects.</p>
