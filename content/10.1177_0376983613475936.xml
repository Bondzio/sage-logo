<p>Professor P. L. Mehra’s scholarship is well known to students and researchers of frontier studies and especially Tibetan studies. He has given us numerous books and research papers on different aspects of the northern frontiers of India in all its sectors and has even written on the north-western frontier of Pakistan. His generosity knows no limits, as we see from the latest collection of his writings on Tibet which, as he tells us, were published over the last half a century. Nor is this a mere collection of old papers. It is a distinct kindness to have made available to researchers papers which are not easily available to them. There is a fresh introduction running into fifty pages, a conclusion in eighteen pages, and an epilogue in four pages. Every paper is heavily referenced.</p>
<p>The present collection is a welcome addition to literature on the subject. It has been a pleasure to run through this rich collection of twelve papers which deal with many aspects of Tibetan history. It would have been a privilege to take a close look at every one of the essays but on the present occasion we limit ourselves to only a few, entitled ‘The Last Decade of Qing Rule in Tibet (ca. 1902–12)’, ‘Independent Tibet’s Foreign Policy, 1898–1950: A Brief Conspectus’ and ‘Tibet and Its Political Status’. These three essays have as their centrepiece the question of the status of Tibet during the first half of the twentieth century. On this question turn several other questions, for example, the legality of the exchange of notes between McMahon and Shatra in March 1914 which constituted the agreement about the McMahon Line and the attitude of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government towards that line, which in turn is central to the factors that must govern the settlement of the boundary in the eastern sector.</p>
<p>There is much new ground in the account of the handling of Tibet by China in the waning years of the Qing dynasty. It brings out the rivalries and animosities between Chinese officials, mostly Han but some Mongols, who had been assigned to the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan to deal with the ‘pacification’ of Eastern Tibet. Some of these officers acquired an unenviable reputation for perhaps unnecessary cruelty, for instance the ‘butcher Zhao’ who ordered massacre of thousands of Tibetans, including lamas. Nor was he the only one: others too distinguished themselves with their highhanded treatment not only of ordinary Tibetans but of the Dalai Lama XIII himself during his barely two months in the Potala after his return from his first flight to Mongolia and China (1904–10) and his setting out on his second flight, this time southwards to British India (1911–12). The author takes us through the intricacies of negotiations and provisions of several agreements and regulations—1890, 1893, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1914. He concludes: ‘The strife over the highlands of Tibet remained, and sadly still remains, unresolved’ (p. 155). This is a masterly summing up of a debate concerning events in Tibet.</p>
<p>It is difficult to share the author’s description of the ‘foreign policy’ of Tibet, much as we speak of, say, British foreign policy or Indian foreign policy. For the most part the chapter deals with the events of 1900–15, with some sprinkling of information about what passed in Tibet in the next three decades. It brings out in stark actuality the events when Dalai Lama XIII (b. 1876, r. 1895–1933, d. 1933) attempted to seek foreign support for Tibet <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> China but did not succeed in enlisting the support of either Britain or Russia/Soviet Union. Some familiar figures flit across the pages, for example, Dorjiev, Roerich, and then we are treated to inter-Tibetan rivalries of Kumbela and Lungshar and the activities of the regents Reting (1934–41) and Taktra (1941–50). The treatment of the post-Simla Conference period of Tibetan history leaves one thirsting for more information about what the Dalai Lama and the regents tried to do in their relations with other countries, or perhaps they did not attempt much except that the regents tried to keep themselves in office as successfully as they could. Even then we recall the so-called ‘Reting conspiracy’—he was said to have tried to seek Chinese support. This chapter is full of details about the murky rivalries between Tibetan officials, which does not reflect much credit on them or advantage to Tibet and the Tibetan people. There is some treatment of the Simla Conference, which the author has treated at much greater length elsewhere. For some reason, the author does not seem to have alighted on Shatra’s account of the proceedings of the Simla Conference: it would have been available in Tibetan at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala, which he mentions graciously in the opening pages of the volume. All said and done, one can hardly speak of a Tibetan foreign policy: it turns on the question of the status of Tibet and whether Tibet had an international personality.</p>
<p>The last essay that we shall consider here deals with the recent writings on the status of Tibet. This essay considers the writings of Richardson, Lamb, Addy, van Praag, Grunfeld, Levenson, and the two autobiographies of the Dalai Lama XIV (b. 1935, r. 1950–). In sum, these works do not quite succeed in establishing the view that Tibet was always independent and sovereign or the opposite view that Tibet was always a part of the Chinese empire. Both views have been argued at great length: one can choose to be convinced by one or the other. Objectively speaking, however, we have to remember that in this day and age possession is nine-tenths of the law, and there is hardly any doubt that China has had effective control of Tibet since 1950. The Tibetans have not reconciled themselves to Chinese overlordship, as we can see from frequent demonstrations and self-immolations to this day, even if the Dalai Lama himself does not speak about the independence of Tibet outside the PRC. The Tibetans doubtless are entitled to their view of their history and to their aspirations. China’s sixty-two years of control of Tibet is but a speck for a country that has a history of several millennia: there is no such thing as finality in history.</p>
<p>The author also takes us through most of the major writings on Tibet in several bibliographic surveys and mentions several works, some of which we have only seen in footnotes of other people’s writings. Those interested in the subject would do well to take a serious look at these bibliographic guides and choose works according to their needs and interest, among them also perhaps Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, <italic>The CIA’s Secret War in Tibet</italic>, Kansas, University Press of Kansas, 2002. There is an unending stream of writings on Tibet that has been coming for the past hundred years or more, especially in recent years.</p>
