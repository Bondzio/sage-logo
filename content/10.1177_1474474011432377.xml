<abstract>
<p>This article is concerned with the narration of earth processes in stories of a younger world. It centres on <italic>A Land</italic> (1951), the most notable published work of Jaquetta Hawkes, archaeologist, prehistorian, writer and journalist. The land under examination is Britain, and its island story becomes her story too. The book unfolds as an unconventional geological history of regional scenery, prehistoric life and rock formations that is at the same time an impressionistic portrayal of self through the ecstatic physical apprehension of earth forces and environmental fields. For Hawkes the storyteller, mineral memories and body memories are unlocked in tandem. This article shows how such an experimental narrative is enabled through unexpected temporal shifts, suggesting a continuum of consciousness across diverse life forms, and explores the cultural conditions, psychological theories and personal circumstances that served to inspire Hawkes the author. In the closing stages of the article, the author enters into the spirit of Hawkes’s narrative style, featuring as protagonist as well as commentator.</p>

<title>Introduction: out back</title>
<p>Unusually for a book about what the earth is made of, where it came from, how it works, and in substantive ways has given shape to life on earth, and the growth of human consciousness, <italic>A Land</italic>, written by Jacquetta Hawkes, does not start at the beginning of time. Instead, this narrative work of deep time and geological history falls open, in an airy and carefree mood, on a summer night, in 1950. The author is to be found in the small, secluded back garden of her townhouse in London’s fashionable Primrose Hill. Escaping desk-bound labours but resisting the lure of bed she has ventured outside, seeking a place to ‘rest awake’. The capital still radiates with the heat of the day. She lies flat on her back. Staring at the night sky above, her writerly attentions tap an emotional connection with what lies immediately beneath: ‘This ground presses my flesh against my bones and makes me agreeably conscious of my body’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474474011432377">1</xref></sup> As opening statements go, the words speak well of Jacquetta Hawkes’s heightened, cosmological sense of self, of her non-conformist, sensual, even primal, appreciation of geological processes in deep time, and through those, of a tale of human history configured according to a radical interpretation of the archaeological and landscape record.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474474011432377">2</xref></sup> The land with a story to be told, and regional scenery to be described, was Britain, top to bottom, by its length and by its breadth.</p>
<p>These prefatory remarks give early indications of a book that defies easy categorization. Though the phrase has suffered from overuse – both as a form of literary endorsement and indictment – its application to this particular work is entirely apt. Laid out in short summary, it is difficult to do proper justice to its inner workings, or interdisciplinary attitude. The book’s publisher made a valiant effort:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>A Land</italic> is in a sense a biography of Britain. The shape and scenery of our island have been fashioned by the elemental forces of erosion and glaciation. Many strange forms of organic life have developed upon its surface, and the evolution of a human race can be traced from as far back as Swanscombe Man. The geologist, the archaeologist, the social historian can each give us a specialist’s narrative of the emergence of Britain from pre-history to civilization; but Jacquetta Hawkes, a poet as well as a scholar, has sought and found a unity in what the scientists and historians have discovered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474474011432377">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a writer, Hawkes was keen to demonstrate intellectual versatility, on each and every one of the book’s 209 pages. Contained within there are polemics, purple passages, philosophy and political comment. There is art criticism, aesthetics and ethics. There are dreamscapes, wellsprings of desire and dramatic riffs. There are future prospects for scenery, architectural heritage and community life. The book’s historical axis stretches back somewhere over three billion years, encompassing prehistoric processes that are, for the most part, too slow, and too alien, to ever fully fathom. Appealing always outwards to the universal, Hawkes’s geological history of regional scenery is brimful of feeling and sentiment: humanistic, lyrical, impressionistic, atmospheric, intuitive and emotional. What the reader finds is a book experimental in composition, serious and cerebral in tone, yet at the same time imaginatively and intimately conversational. For the sake of context, the briefest sketch of the author’s intellectual sensibility will be an aid to the unacquainted reader.</p>
<p>Hawkes was a graduate of archaeology and anthropology, Newnham College, Cambridge (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474474011432377">Figure 1</xref>). Her formal studies were followed by field excavations. She joined digs in Palestine, France, Ireland and many English sites (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1474474011432377">Figure 2</xref>). The career that blossomed afterward was that of a polymath. Hawkes produced poetry, novels, novellas, essays, an archaeological atlas, a Shell field guide to antiquarian sites and many articles for <italic>The Observer</italic> newspaper. She published in academic journals, and lectured and broadcast on archaeological subjects. Hawkes was resistant to scientific tradition, one binding ever tighter the conduct of mid-century modern archaeologists. While wishing everywhere to avoid errors of known fact, she set her writing at an angle against the bank of scientific detail that enabled precision of description or explanation. Her calculation was simple. What was lost by being ‘altogether unscientific’, was gained in the form and expression allowed by a narrative-driven approach. On first publication in 1950 <italic>A Land</italic> was well received, boasting healthy sales. Reviews in the <italic>New York Times</italic> and <italic>Country Life</italic> praised Hawkes’s imagination and eloquence, combining accuracy of historical account with a sense for the mysteries of deep time, and a storyteller’s gift for narrative. Writing in the <italic>Observer</italic>, Harold Nicolson found in her words a ‘weird beauty’ and prophetic quality. <italic>Time and Tide</italic> confidently predicted ‘this will become a famous book’. The award of <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> non-fiction prize followed in 1951. The book found widest readership once re-published (in 1959) as a paperback title.</p>

<p>One measure of Hawkes’s island story is to position <italic>A Land</italic> alongside cultural interests widespread in post-war society, when studies of scenery were pursued diversely by British artists, composers, filmmakers and writers. The period also saw academic voices gain greater public notice in the field. W. G. Hoskins’ <italic>The Making of the English Landscape</italic> appeared in 1955. At the same time, Dudley Stamp produced two grand synthetic surveys of British Natural History for William Collins’ New Naturalist Series. Read as a pair, <italic>Britain’s Structure and Scenery</italic> (1946) and <italic>Man and the Land</italic> (1955) cover the same arc of prehistory and history, and broadly speaking encompass the same intellectual themes as those found in <italic>A Land</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474474011432377">4</xref></sup> There, any comparison must largely end.</p>
<p>The creative tension Hawkes sought actively to exploit was between different social functions attributed to scientist and storyteller, between the science of testing and the art of telling. Some celebrated writers of the former world have elected to go down the route of popularization in print.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474474011432377">5</xref></sup> Others’ works of geological description find common cause in stylized literary expression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474474011432377">6</xref></sup> For reasons both of popularization and prose-style, <italic>A Land</italic> is the central focus and pivot point of this article, one seeking critically to explore the configuration of deep geological time and geophysical forces in the modern literary exercise of ‘narrating landscape and environment’. A critical re-reading of this seminal – though to date generally overlooked – text raises questions of wider notice and interest, all falling within the compass of this issue’s theme of ‘Narrating Landscape and Environment’. Namely, is it the generalist or the specialist who is best equipped to story the earth into shape? What kinds of cultural authority are ascribed to those storytellers who consciously re-design narratives of landscape and environment? How is such cultural authority accrued, or challenged? How are historical narrative and experiments in expression valued relative to original, scholarly analysis? Must stories, artfully constructed and deeply imagined, be pitched against empirical observations, robustly researched and authoritatively judged? Is it a simple choice between fact <italic>or</italic> feeling? And finally, how far have literary experiments scrambled such epistemic categorizations?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474474011432377">7</xref></sup> The search for answers demands that attention be variously directed in this article. It is structured as follows: First, attention is directed towards an understanding of how Hawkes’s personality took expression as an authorial voice; next, the focus falls on the specific geographical and cultural contexts of the book’s production, thereby enabling more detailed examination of the styles of narrative deployed within the text; finally, aspects of the book’s embedded landscape heritage, and its literary legacy, are considered by the author in exploratory mode.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474474011432377">
<title>Narrative voice: experimental subjectivities</title>
<p>In Hawkes’s world of words, the private life of the author and the domestic realm were not off limits. Rather they were placed front and centre. It is telling to revisit the inviting voice that offers a welcome in the opening passages of <italic>A Land</italic>, where readers are ushered into a north London home, and immediately taken out back. We are met with a daring proposition: lie down, under the stars. Wonder at the union of the night sky above and the earth below. Writer and reader, cosmos and planet: sources of purposeful energy, twinned, each sustaining and bearing up the other. Superimposed over outline forms of prehistoric worlds, and of the British Isles, is <italic>her</italic> map, as yet only partially drawn, of the internal geography of the mind; for which the mother country was a looking glass. The book demands our consideration as an ode to geological description and as self-portrait. We might consider this experimental earth writing, with a twist of domesticated psychodrama. Work in cultural geography has long been concerned with the ways that subjectivities take expression through a relationship with landscape. Oftentimes, appreciation focuses on topographical surface, how meaning is found in shapes and forms. Less fully considered are those instances when geology – the deep structure of the landscape – is fused with the project of self-understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474474011432377">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hawkes had already exhibited a willingness to occupy the sort of emotional space where interior and exterior worlds might be allowed to converge. Her collection of poems, published as <italic>Symbols and Speculations</italic> in 1949, showed off a keen enthusiasm to deploy imagery and vocabulary as a portal to the ‘microcosmos’ of the unconscious:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now from my rock I heard the passing bell,</p>
<p>Silence fell back behind the silent feet,</p>
<p>And as towards the moon I bared my face</p>
<p>From those full tears that hung below each lid</p>
<p>There sprang a track, straight-sided, into space</p>
<p>A shining track that through my vision slid</p>
<p>To span all reaches of the universe.</p>
<p>It seemed, as under me the great globe swung,</p>
<p>I knew some answer, unambiguous –</p>
<p>But that was long ago, and I was young.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474474011432377">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Published at the time that Hawkes was writing <italic>A Land, Symbols and Speculations</italic> gives expression to a medley of tones, reveries, dreams, yearnings, desires and affects. It succeeds in delivering the odd jolt of self-understanding, often through heavily saturated imagery. Though her poetry never quite sings free, it did signal intent that was fulfilled in prose.</p>
<p>In <italic>A Land</italic>, appearing two years later, relations between the spiritual and substantial flicker faster, slips between the psychic and the physical keep occurring. Hawkes the writer is happy to create personal disturbances, delving deep into the vast structure of recollection. The sensations of childhood, memories of youthful experiences and incidents from family life are treated much like finds from an archaeological dig site; as pieces of evidence to be sifted through, and eventually fitted into a matrix of theories concerning symbolic power, cultural meaning, social change, agency and creative expression. Parenting styles, feelings of attachment and alienation, phases of early learning and child development, and emotional investment in objects, are subjected to open interpretation and uninhibited analysis.</p>
<p>In this exercise of self-definition, readers learn of formative lessons on walks taken with her nurse, and of Frederick Hopkins’s starched and studious manner, which figured him as renowned scientist first, and father a distant second, all through detailed recall of a family cycling trip to the Cambridgeshire village of Abingdon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474474011432377">10</xref></sup> There are memories too of mother Lavinia’s old-fashioned ideas of instruction and the proper tools for learning. Readers are invited to picture Jacquetta the infant girl, and to journey in her family’s company on various outings. She is the diminutive figure set up as to stand out in contrast with the grand scale of coastal scenery: in Cornwall and the cascades falling through Rocky Valley; under the chalk cliffs at Lyme Regis (following in the footsteps of renowned child fossil collector Miss Mary Anning); and on the friable eastern edge of England, where she stands awed at signs of disturbance left by a slip of land into the sea:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am certain that my terror was not so much due to the thought of being crushed – the fall had happened some days before, as by some inkling of impermanence. It was the same knowledge, though in a sadder and less brutal form, that came stealing in from the submerged forest, a dreary expanse of blackened tree stumps exposed at low tide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474474011432377">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Innocent credulity and observational intensity, personal qualities first shaped in childhood, are presented as the sensibilities especially suited to coping with the sheer immensity of deep time, and the strange improbabilities of life in younger worlds:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The arithmetic is simple, but the reality of the fact hard to grasp. If, enjoying the sun, a child leans against the cliff at Folkestone, his small figure will span the accumulation of one hundred and twenty thousand years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474474011432377">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The child’s-eye view becomes the measure of all things.</p>
<p>If Hawkes’s memories speak of predictable English sensibilities and of values forged in a scholarly household, they do not present harbingers for scarring injury or unassimilated trauma. The past was not a troubling place to revisit, it was where spiritual solace might be sought. Nor was it her ambition to assemble a clinical diagnostic outcome. For Hawkes, the psychic unconscious remained relatively benign, a space of refuge and adult adventure. Remembering was to make of the inner eye a healthy creative faculty. Out of former experience might be levered new sorts of artistic expression and creative force. A ‘strengthening of consciousness’ was not something only undertaken for personal gain, but as a kind of collective advancement, for the formulation of a new society:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If in <italic>A Land</italic> I have often recalled my own childhood, it has not been so much from egotism as from a wish to steal that emotion which uses our own early memories for a realization of the most distant past. Certainly, for myself, in recalling the experiences of that remote, unknown child, I find I am being led back far beyond the bounds of personality and of my own life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474474011432377">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474474011432377">
<title>Presenting the past</title>
<p>One incentive to investigate the artistic world existing immediately beyond this book derives partly from its unusual beginnings, as a project emerging out of a world of theatricality rather than of words, bound to the desk. For Hawkes, drama and performance were an escape from the constraints identified in modern scholarship; the dust-jacket of <italic>Symbols and Speculations</italic> boasted of a ‘warmth of sensibility [that] resisted and survived the cold, intellectual east wind of Cambridge in which she was brought up’. <italic>A Land</italic> took the shape it did through Hawkes’s work at the South Bank Exhibition of the 1951 Festival of Britain. As a ‘Theme Convenor’ she was heavily involved in the creative design of displays for the two major historical pavilions, titled ‘The People of Britain’ and ‘The Land of Britain’ (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1474474011432377">Figure 3</xref>). In a retrospective review of exhibition techniques, written for <italic>Museum</italic>, a UNESCO publication, Hawkes explained designs for rousing interest among the public touring the pavilions’ displays, and unveiled a show-woman’s awareness of theatricality and dramaturgical design. She offered thoughts on, variously: managing the passage and flow of pedestrians; holding the attention of large parties; the balance struck between education and entertainment; diverse efforts to create mood, evoke atmosphere and build dramatic effect; strategies for charging excitement and wonder or ushering in contemplation; all through careful design of site, set, landscape, layout, scenery, costume, illumination, concealment and exposure, and the arrangement and sequencing of imagery and attraction. She describes the placement of visual devices – loops of film, colour projections, peep shows, photographic panels, animated maps, specimens of brightly coloured ores and minerals – noting everywhere the play of sightlines, in a hall where, we are told, the ‘faintness of the light gave a cavernous and slightly mysterious quality’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474474011432377">14</xref></sup> Something approaching a geo-pageant was promised. But for all the use of latest technology, it was fluency and coherence of narrative, Hawkes maintained, that was of paramount importance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474474011432377">15</xref></sup> During design phases at the South Bank site, an interdisciplinary spirit governed, bridging arts and sciences, provoking creativity and innovation. She worked with painters (Graham Sutherland), poets (Laurie Lee wrote caption text for displays), dramatists and wardrobe designers, to integrate a geo-historical vision, with Britain’s rich endowment from the past presented as star of the show.</p>

<p>For the Festival Organizing Committee, Hawkes’s commitment to public education and to a new show-culture moving beyond the lanternslide was compelling. She could boast real visual literacy and a cinematic eye. Previously she had served as Editor-in-Chief in the newly formed Film Unit at the Ministry of Education. Under her charge, the unit made a series of documentaries on subjects such as the origins of writing and alphabets, the development of printing, the evolution of the domestic house, and the exploration of the globe, intended as a ‘loose nexus illustrating the development of culture and the continuity of human history’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474474011432377">16</xref></sup> The project with which she was involved most closely was a pioneering 45 minute documentary about Britain’s pre-historic past. ‘The Beginning of History’ was sequenced as a film tour of ‘time-capsule sites’, providing audiences with a story of earliest habitation and movement. Hawkes, the scriptwriter, was able also to explain the style of camerawork:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The lens slides down the walls of Cheddar Gorge and penetrates its caves to find the home of palaeolithic man, it twists along a Skara Brae alley-way and ranges across one of the houses, it explores every corner of the Little Woodbury farmstead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474474011432377">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The farmstead was a set, constructed for purpose at Pinewood Studies, and to footage recorded on location was added animated maps and diagrams, and close-up enactments of various technical processes: flint-knapping, bronze-founding, wood-witling; the last of these demonstrations of handcraft by Hawkes’s son, Nicolas. Though animals populated the farmstead, no human figures were included, the full challenge of historical re-enactment being thought too great.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474474011432377">18</xref></sup> Hawkes offered a measured appraisal of the venture’s success, and a defence of the demands that storytelling made of the viewing audience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Probably it has attempted far too much, but it has also achieved something. As it goes round the schools together with the photographic panels, the models and film-strips designed to amplify and strengthen its message … it may be that the majority of children will not be roused, though we hope otherwise. But should it be so, it is not always only some 10 per cent who are the source of inspiration for the rest, and who matter not less, perhaps most of all, in this promised century of the Common Man?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474474011432377">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Giving consideration to the ways in which a public culture of geological science was shaped during the first decades of the 19th century, Ralph O’Connor divides its study into two-parts, examining <italic>as</italic> literature the scientific texts written by geologists, and, the staging of science as popular spectacle. He shows how the literary projection of ancient landscapes, and associated public spectacles or performance, were enabling forms in the accumulation of cultural authority, reaching ‘an increasingly variegated audience’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474474011432377">20</xref></sup> David Matless too has examined the present-ation of prehistoric landscape in 20th century Breckland. Hawkes figures in that local story, as an expert voice engaged in the quest to mould an expanded and enriched public culture of pre-history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474474011432377">21</xref></sup> By most general orientation, her peers were the ‘Romantic Moderns’, whose visionary imaginings of the British landscape and lively social milieu have been recently recounted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474474011432377">22</xref></sup> In Hawkes’s case, fellow travellers and companion topophiles were Robert Graves, Ben Nicolson and Henry Moore. Their cultural import could be given only oblique and muted expression on London’s South Bank. In the print version of <italic>A Land</italic>, that swiftly followed, their influence could be fully celebrated, or elaborated upon. Nicolson and Moore allowed permissions for the reproductions of artwork used as illustration. Graves – with whom Hawkes holidayed in Deja, Mallorca – founded his brand of mythopoetics around the White Goddess, figurehead of ancient matriarchal society. The Goddess was a talismanic figure, and spiritual guide for Hawkes’s own beliefs about the world, ancient and modern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474474011432377">23</xref></sup> Another more private world, existing in parallel with the book, now demands attention.</p>

<title>Speculative theory: time, memory and society</title>
<p>While being everywhere alert to the frame created by a perceiving self, writing in 1943 Hawkes’s explanation of our processual apprehension of time remained fairly conventional:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is no break in the procession of events. For myself, I always see them as it were threaded on a taut line, which stretches from the present near my eyes back and back into the distance of the past – a line which is in fact the historical time-sequence, the long line of the passing years. Because we are so conscious of this thread of time running through history, we have…held to it as a guide…a pedestrian method certainly, but one which keeps the vast complex story in good order and helps to convey the sense of continuity between the past, present and future of humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474474011432377">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This explanation of structure given to temporal experience is excerpted from <italic>Prehistoric Britain</italic>, a book co-authored with her then husband Christopher. Jacquetta wrote the greatest part of the text. Christopher’s contribution was primarily editorial: ‘his exacting scholar’s eye scanned my text and allowed nothing dubious or inaccurate to pass. For this the reader will be more grateful than I was’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474474011432377">25</xref></sup> The creative tension here exposed by comments on domestic methods of composition, reflected diverging paths, professionally and personally. Christopher represented a subject growing sober and scientific, sure in the social and academic status afforded by the label ‘archaeology’. By contrast, Jacquetta’s vision for prehistoric studies was interdisciplinary, humanistic (inclining towards an antiquarian tradition), such that new kinds of conciliation might be found between the mythopoetic and geological. The stones had stories to tell. By decade’s end Hawkes had freed herself from a failing marriage and the strains of combining intellectual effort, so that those stories might be told. And she was at greater liberty to build free-spirited theoretical explanations about our experience of time.</p>
<p>In the preface to <italic>A Land</italic> she tantalizes with philosophical meditation about the nature of time and the development of consciousness. It is unfinished yet universalizing:</p>

<p>I see modern men enjoying a unity with trilobites of a nature more deeply significant than anything at present understood in the processes of biological evolution; I see a land as much affected by the creations of its poets and painters as by changes of climate and vegetation. The nature of this unity cannot be stated, for it remains always just beyond the threshold of intellectual comprehension. It can only be shown as a blurred reflection through hints coming from many directions but always falling short of their objective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474474011432377">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unity with environmental surroundings is one thing. It speaks to broad ideas of moral good bound up with organicism and holism on a living planet. But lining up in Hawkes’s mind was a greater speculation: namely, that the textures of experience apprehended by the human psyche and intellect in the present moment were the result of biological consciousness reaching all the way back to primitive life-forms existing in deep time. By this reasoning, she <italic>could</italic> write a memoir <italic>for</italic> the earth. This required a considerable imaginative leap, only made possible by resisting the pull of ideas based on the sovereignty and distinction of an individual organism. Hawkes experimented through self-description, charting her own beginnings according to a distributed biography of collective life:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Starting from a single cell, I passed one period of my life with gill slits inherited from my fishy ancestry, then for a few weeks sported a tail and was hard to distinguish from an unborn tree shrew. The protest of the flesh is reasonable. Why think of viruses or pre-Cambrian organisms when inside this delicate membrane of my skin, this outline of an individual, I carry the whole history of life. I am a community of countless units, from cells to complex organs, living unconscious lives, yet supporting their king the invisible power that is enthroned in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474474011432377">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From the comfort of Fitzroy Road, Hawkes granted herself the narrative freedom of the literary time-traveller and the liberty to fictionalize experience. The journey taken from deepest origins of a younger world towards the present offers general direction to the book and its sequence of chapters, but simultaneously the reader’s sense of linear time and earth structure is buffeted and splintered. Digressions are a defining feature, tableaux many. The recognized episodic arrangements of the geological column, organized according to periods (Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, etc.) and eras (Pleistocene, Holocene, etc.), is subject to repeat knocks and blows. Sometimes the effect is jarring, sometimes dramatized to a point more surreal than uncanny. Consider, for example, Hawkes’s transitional account of processes of decay and sedimentary accumulation in a Carboniferous swamp. The effort to create a lush and steamy depiction of the inundated habitat induces drowsiness in the author. Matter oozes off the page. Much attention is given to mud and slime. Adrift in a hypnogagic state, her thoughts are preoccupied with the mental image of <italic>Loxomma</italic>, one of the earliest amphibian reptiles. In fossilized form, its elongated ribcage suggests a vista of arches, along which other strange creatures move each ‘with a single eye shining in its head’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474474011432377">28</xref></sup> The dreamscape morphs as she swims back to consciousness and a dawning realization. ‘I am stupid, they are only lamps’, she gently chides:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And the roaring in my ears is nothing but a drill, one of those confounded drills. ‘Christ, look at that blighter,’ someone says, and I notice that <italic>Loxomma</italic> is there again (perhaps he had never gone) and they have excavated him with their drill. ‘Makes your spine creep a bit, don’t it? Christ, look at that hand…’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474474011432377">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fearing disorientation, or perhaps that such psychic disturbance demands greater explanation, later she murmurs a confession into the reader’s ear:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes when I am tired and consumed by a longing for sleep, a gentle but irresistible invasion from the outer world seems to take possession of me, and I feel that consciousness wishes only to flow back into the world and dissolve there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474474011432377">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hawkes the narrator must, of course, recover her reason. Stylized slips or jerks in conscious state were favoured tricks of this literary adventurer. So too were flashbacks and other time-shifts, or the experimental passages where she shifts shape to inhabit the experience of ancient organisms.</p>
<p>A memory-keeper and necromancer with a difference, in philosophical terms Hawkes drew inspiration from studies emerging out of parapsychology. Principal here were visionary ideas of human consciousness advanced by time theorist John William Dunne. Dunne’s most notable publication <italic>An Experiment in Time</italic> appeared in 1927.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474474011432377">31</xref></sup> Other titles followed, each expanding on the original conceptual preposition: <italic>The Serial Universe</italic> (1934), <italic>The New Immortality</italic> (1938) and <italic>Nothing Dies</italic> (1940). The first of his studies explores the phenomenon of predictive or precognitive dreams as the means to devise a new concept of time. Hawkes grew acquainted with Dunne’s dream studies after a recommendation from Walter Turner, poet, critic and General Editor of Collins’s ‘Britain in Pictures’ book series, for whom Hawkes produced the volume on Early Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474474011432377">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dunne’s name is not especially well known today. However, in the 1930s and 1940s <italic>An Experiment in Time</italic> was widely read, sparked debate in literary culture, and fired the public imagination. It had a wider readership than Henri Bergson’s theorization of time, which appealed to more specialist tastes among the modernist avant-garde.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474474011432377">33</xref></sup> For a work explaining an unorthodox metaphysical theory on the perception of time this might still surprise. In the leading cultural survey of the interwar period, Dunne merits a mention in the context of a wider discussion on the impact of Einstein’s new physics of relativity and its place in public life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474474011432377">34</xref></sup> Dunne also finds a fit with what Elizabeth Gagen and Denis Linehan – following the work of Nikolas Rose – label ‘psy knowledge’, a modern complex of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474474011432377">35</xref></sup> Theirs is an intellectual survey of some of the ordinary sites where the psy complex took root, and the diverse sorts of spatiality it produced. Here the search is widened, so to draw attention to literature and associated creative arts as another space of experiment. In English studies, Victoria Stewart has described how those writers drawn to Dunne’s psychological work were ‘largely middlebrow authors, writing in a realist idiom’, and of how his influence is ‘discernible principally in structural rather than stylistic factors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474474011432377">36</xref></sup> H.G. Wells invoked his ideas as plot, and so too John Buchan. Aldous Huxley and J.W.N. Sullivan – popularizers of the new physics – gave serious consideration to Dunne’s configuration of mental life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474474011432377">37</xref></sup> Wyndham Lewis was less persuaded, taking a swipe at the too excitable imaginations of the ‘time-romancers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474474011432377">38</xref></sup> But it was in J.B. Priestley that Dunne found a most vocal champion. He endorsed <italic>An Experiment in Time</italic> as: ‘one of the most fascinating, most curious, and perhaps the most important books of this age’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474474011432377">39</xref></sup> What in the nature of Dunne’s time-experiments did Priestley, Hawkes and other writers find so very appealing?</p>
<p>Unsettled by his experience of premonitions in dreams (or what might alternatively be termed ‘memories of the future’) Dunne had been forced to re-evaluate their meaning and significance as pre-cognitive episodes blending past and future events, so posing fundamental questions about the generally accepted linear model of time. The dreams included his anticipation of events as dramatic as a volcanic eruption on Martinique. Predictive episodes, according to Dunne’s philosophical presupposition, offered evidence that in reality all time is present, such that past, present and future actually happen contemporaneously. Human consciousness, he contended, created the illusion of linearity in our perception of time. Only in dreams was experience sufficiently instinctive for past and future to be co-present. The consequences were profound, in existential terms as much as philosophical: time-space was multidimensional.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474474011432377">40</xref></sup> In order to verify his claims, Dunne undertook a long-running program of psychical experiments into precognitive dreams and induced precognitive states. Self-presentation according to the protocols of scientific experiment mattered to Dunne; by training he was an aeronautical engineer. He was anxious to stress that ‘this is not a book about “occultism”, and not a book about what is called “psycho-analysis”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474474011432377">41</xref></sup> Stewart argues that Dunne’s empiricism, grounding psy theory in practical self-experiment, encouraged a greater level of public interest during the interwar years, than would Freudian interpretation or Jungian theory respectively. More generally, she offers the observation that the psychic power to foretell accurately of events yet to come was a desirable capacity in an era of mounting cultural anxiety. In the arts, Dunne’s ideas fed directly into three of what are commonly referred to as Priestley’s ‘time-plays’. The best known, ‘An Inspector Calls’, had its first production in Britain in 1946, and used the device of multidimensional time to arrange a family drama that takes place over the course of a single night. Dunne’s influence on Jacquetta Hawkes has been less remarked upon. Here literary biographies, personal lives and land lines finally loop back together.</p>
<p>In 1947, Hawkes was hard at work on her manuscript for <italic>A Land</italic>, daring to compress a narrative of Britain’s 3 billion-year history into the long arc of just one night. That year, she and Priestley first met. They were both on a British delegation to Mexico City at the invitation of UNESCO (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1474474011432377">Figure 4</xref>). On a literary and intellectual level each found in the other an emotional connection. The foreign fling resulted fairly quickly in marriage. What were they to each other? Christine Finn and Diane Collins, respective biographers, have explored the courses that partnership took for Hawkes and Priestley.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474474011432377">42</xref></sup> More specific to the concerns of this article is their shared passion for speculative theories about temporality and subjectivity, and designs for the future of the creative community in British society. For playwright and for prehistorian combined, Dunne’s time-theory troubled the model of individual subjectivity such that it lay in tatters. ‘“Me” is a fiction’, Hawkes proclaimed, ‘though a convenient fiction and one of significance to the consciousness of which I am the temporary home’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474474011432377">43</xref></sup> Jack and Jacquetta preferred to imagine a matrix of interiority and exteriority. Submergence was, of course, the signature motif of the psy complex. More than simply a discursive formation, for Hawkes submergence had material resonance, a sensibility tapping into the archaic and the topographical. Depth was not just the measure to be taken of one’s mental and emotional life. Greater intimacies were to be exposed through knowledge of what lies hidden beneath, what was buried, most deeply rooted, of everything piled up on the bedrock.</p>

<p>O’Conner notes how at this time in European thought, ‘psychological models were taking on stratigraphic forms’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474474011432377">44</xref></sup> For the psy-explorer, exciting interpretive possibilities arose from a heightened sense of ‘the future anterior’; where technological, utopian or artistic dreams, long since gone to ground, surface again as relics of a time to come that we can no longer fully imagine. Hawkes regarded earth forces and psychic powers as conjoined. ‘Volcanoes speak of insecurity, of our participation in process’, she declared, echoing Dunne’s dream of Martinique, ‘they are openings not any longer into a properly appointed hell but into an equally alarming abysm of thought’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474474011432377">45</xref></sup> <italic>A Land</italic> was self-portrait and memoir with a difference, at once neural and terrestrial: sliding between living tissue and mineral hardness, her investigations peeled away the top layers, sinking boreholes to explore inward for signs of earlier life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474474011432377">46</xref></sup> In post-war Britain, Hawkes was anxious about what kinds of social change the project of national reconstruction would bring. In one literary essay considering ‘Art in the Crystalline Society’, she expressed fears about the effect of an increasingly individuated and atomised lifestyle on the creative arts, suggesting that it signalled a ‘mental revolution…from the intuitive and mythopoeic to the analytical method of thought’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474474011432377">47</xref></sup> This was the same British society onto which C.P. Snow would soon project the powerful discourse of two cultures. Hawke’s and Snow’s concerns were perhaps exaggerated to a degree. A new sort of attention had been trained, a different level of literacy too, and new maps of the mind existed in their words.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474474011432377">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>On Primrose Hill: vitalisms old and new</title>
<p>The undertaking of quests to cardinal points on the map of literary Britain is not always advisable, or entirely rewarding. Sometimes, it unfolds as an exercise in disappointment, more than anything else. Soon after arrival I can end up wondering what the search is really for. Vexed as to why the spirit of a place can be evasive, why the past fails to come tumbling in. A recent trip to Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, only partly bucked that trend. No. 39 is a semi-detached residence. A narrow lane allows access to the rear of the property. Two rusting nails poking out from the red brick garden wall offer toeholds to the nosy parker. Long straggles of ivy proved a pain as I perched, struggling to change the camera’s settings (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1474474011432377">Figure 5</xref>). “Can I help?” enquired the proprietor of Primrose Hill Studios. ‘Too early for pap-snapping’, I quipped, ‘…and I’m not from <italic>Homes and Gardens</italic>!’ Jumping down I pulled a dog-eared copy of <italic>A Land</italic> from my bag. Paperwork in support of my dubious claim to pilgrim status proved more convincing than wise cracks. We got chatting. I spoke a little of Jacquetta Hawkes’s cherished resting place, entirely covered over, and of the compressed texture and temperature of London clay now also entombed. Apparently the wooden decking, brick steps and paving slabs were only two or three years old; a mundane emblem of the boom times. Earth moved, makeover complete, No. 39 last changed hands right before the market met its high noon. And now the ‘For Sale’ signs were out front once again. The estate agent’s website was expectant of offers over £1.5 million. We strolled, to the end of the road where parkland trees let out onto the open common. ‘Shall we carry on?’ ‘No’. She’d ‘been up and over already. Exercising the dogs’. The polite escort job from the premises was obviously complete. We said our farewells, she with a promise to read <italic>A Land</italic>, me with the standard academic courtesy that I’d email the finished paper. I carried on, ascending among the morning joggers. The Hill is no true eminence, more a low-slung, grassy rise; properly primrose pastoral. So the size of view that awaits came as a surprise. To the east and south a Thames Valley panorama unfurled. Muffled against the chill, and stray spats of rain, I found a bench to re-re-read the closing chapter, ‘A Prospect of Britain’. From here, Hawkes wrote, ‘I can summon piecemeal before my inner eye the Britain amassed, shaped and peopled during the course of these memoirs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474474011432377">49</xref></sup> Accepting for marked shifts in regional fortune, and several kinds of financial climate, the basic island geography remains recognizable. But what sorts of affinity are to be found with her popularizing of the idea of landscapes of time internalized, and of the stories issuing up from the earth’s deep past?</p>

<p>In the sullen grey light of any 21st century morning, Hawkes’s interpretations of the life of dreams, of her intensely physical encounter with the geological past, and associated radical time-theories, can all begin to seem off-kilter, more than just a little bizarre, batty or preposterous. Or, by more kindly judgement: simply fantastic, and popularly so. The ‘present prehistoric’, as David Matless observes ‘shows credibility and credulity as categories with a culturally complex overlap’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474474011432377">50</xref></sup> The notion of disturbing sedimented memories of a younger world pushes at the limits of belief, hovers on the borders of science fiction. And such ambiguity would be most apt. <italic>A Land</italic> is, by one kind of reckoning, itself a compelling premonition of <italic>The Drowned World</italic>, J.G. Ballard’s first novel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474474011432377">51</xref></sup> Appearing 11 years after <italic>A Land</italic>, Ballard’s fantasy-turned-21<sup>st</sup>-century ecological prophecy kick started another sci-complex. Its central characters are propelled (forwards <italic>and</italic> backwards) into an ‘emerging past’; ‘the paradisal sun-filled world of a second Triassic age’. Here they must endure an oppressive hothouse atmosphere in ‘an immense half-submerged city (formerly London) overgrown with tropical vegetation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474474011432377">52</xref></sup> In a 1963 interview on the subject of ‘Time, Memory and Inner Space’, Ballard offered his thoughts on an emerging fictional genre for which he preferred the label ‘speculative fantasy’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The dream worlds invented by the writer of fantasy are external equivalents of the inner world of the psyche, and because these symbols take their impetus from the most formative and confused periods of our lives they are often time-sculptures of terrifying ambiguity. This zone I think of as ‘inner space’ the internal landscape of today that is a transmuted image of the past, and one of the most fruitful areas for the imaginative writer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474474011432377">53</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A fictional version of that revelation, awful and profound, breaches among the dwindling population of <italic>The Drowned World</italic>. Bodkin, an old stager, explains to Robert, the novel’s central character, how total is the process already underway inside his system:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These are the oldest memories on Earth, the time-codes carried in every chromosome and gene. Every step we’ve taken in our evolution is a milestone inscribed with organic memories – from the enzymes controlling the carbon dioxide cycle to the organization of the brachial plexus and the nerve pathways of the Pyramid cells in the mid-brain, each is a record of a thousand decisions taken in the face of a sudden physico-chemical crisis. Just as psychoanalysis reconstructs the original traumatic situation in order to release the repressed material, so we are now being plunged back into the archaeopsychic past, uncovering the ancient taboos and drives that have been dormant for epochs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474474011432377">54</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this realization, Hawkes’s transitional, hypnagogic dream <italic>was</italic> fulfilled, at least in fictional terms. <italic>Loxomma</italic> had never gone. As the world of the novel drowns, Bodkin and Robert return to a former biological state. They take on reptile form. Founded on a shape of subjectivity, stretched far enough to accommodate the existence of ‘pre-uterine memory’, Ballard’s countercultural version of geo-science owed a great deal to the same warped ecologies of mind-environment being dreamt up by Hawkes, Priestley and earlier time-theorists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474474011432377">55</xref></sup> Between Hawkes and Ballard it is possible to see literary experiment in earth writing forming a span between different cultural periods. Other chronological continuities show up, only working in the opposite direction. The watery inundation of London, and southern England, had been fictionalized once already by Richard Jefferies; and since then returned to by novelist Will Self.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474474011432377">56</xref></sup> ‘Some of the narrative tropes associated with literary Modernism’ notes O’Conner,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>find striking analogues in early-Victorian geological literature: the visionary juxtaposition of civilised present with primeval past, the reliving of the past in fragmentary moments of heightened consciousness, the collapse of time and space, the extinct monster as emblem of technological modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474474011432377">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In closing, consideration should be given to the ways in which Hawkes’s geo-physical vision of distributed agency – of a willingness to write a memoir <italic>for</italic> the earth – anticipates the vital worlds of vibrant materiality currently being defined by geographical, literary and political theorists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474474011432377">58</xref></sup> In her efforts to give a voice to earth forces, and to active things most ancient, she strove for radical forms of thought, where time-bending social and material relations would stretch all the way back to the future. For Jane Bennett, realizing the elasticity of vibrant ecologies is not so much about challenging the accepted idea of a temporal arc, instead is more a project of radical ontology where the spatial limits of body and environment dissolve, since:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The consistency of the field is more uneven than that: portions congeal into bodies, but not in a way that makes any one type that privileged site of agency. The source of effects is, rather, always an ontologically diverse assemblage of energies and bodies, of simple and complex bodies, of the physical and the physiological.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474474011432377">59</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If here there is an obvious rapport with Hawkes’s ideas, contemporary veins of speculative theory pose more fundamental philosophical challenges of her generously, inclusive configuration of materiality, one that kept faith in the power of the human consciousness. Appropriately enough, the figure of the <italic>arche-fossil</italic> has been deployed by Quentin Meillassoux to show how a principled position of anti-humanism demands that we trouble any claim to know the existence of physical phenomena <italic>before</italic> life, since it was devoid of human consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474474011432377">60</xref></sup> Respectively, these claims from vital materialism and speculative realism offer new points of philosophical departure, and at the same time are a reminder that vitalism is an ancient sensibility into which contemporary theorists are breathing life. Jacquetta Hawkes’s <italic>A Land</italic> can lend different cultural authority to such concept-driven debate, earthed by its attentions to the felt life of deep time and to depictive accounts of material landscapes.</p>
<p>Hawkes’s cultural stock is back on the rise. A new re-print of <italic>A Land</italic> is immanent, in a series edited by nature writer Robert Macfarlane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474474011432377">61</xref></sup> This latest publishing development confirms Hawkes’s presence in contemporary narrative configurations of landscape and environment, though as she undoubtedly would maintain, she was always already here in the first place (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1474474011432377">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Evidence of any greater engagement between the two writers is slim. Stamp included Hawkes’s co-authored volume <italic>Prehistoric Britain</italic> in his bibliography, though no specific reference was made to it in the text. Hawkes was more direct, fishing out of <italic>Structure and Scenery</italic> a single quotation: ‘We are fortunately living in one of the quiet periods of the earth’s history’. Diplomatic <italic>and</italic> acidic, she attributed the line to a ‘well known geographer’, then judged Stamp’s treatment of sub-surface processes complacent and lacking for dramatic effect: ‘[his] nonchalance suggests that if St Paul’s were suddenly raised ten thousand feet in the air we could all go tobogganing down the Strand’.

<p>Generally regarded by publishers as a staple subject category, with reliable sales return, geological literature has, of late, enjoyed a creative resurgence. Re-branded as earth writing, the works of popular science writers promise to tell the life story of the planet and to answer the fundamental questions of our existence. For example, see: B. Bryson, <italic>A Short History of Nearly Everything</italic> (London, Doubleday, 2004); R. Fortey, <italic>The Earth: An Intimate History</italic> (London, Harper Perennial, 2005); and J. Zalasiewicz, <italic>The Planet in a Pebble: A Journey into Earth’s Deep History</italic> (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010). The localization of earth writing to the British scene has continued in works such as: R. Fortey, <italic>The Hidden Landscape: A Journey into the Geological Past</italic> (London, Bodley Head, 2010); I. Vince, <italic>The Lie of the Land; An Under-the-Field Guide to the British Isles</italic> (London, Boxtree Books, 2010).

<p>Numerous seminal examples of rock and stone work in words might be suggested; a quartet is flagged here. All too aware of how the very idea of primordial ancientness of age undermined a cornerstone of his faith, Hugh Miller, Ross-shire stonemason, celebrated autodidact and newspaper editor, gave poised though understated expression to geological wonderment in his personal celebration of the science, <italic>The Old Red Sandstone</italic>. Though evidently a stylist of stone, Miller sounds a note of caution against over elaboration: ‘no man who enters the geological field in quest of the wonderful need pass …from the true to fictitious’. A different literary approach is taken by Kenneth White, whose self-styled project of geo-poetics seeks to animate the stories of stones. White is a writer whose words ensure that readers attend closely to the <italic>manner</italic> of his description. He finds a kindred spirit in Tim Robinson who, having turned over what seems like every stone on the Aran Islands, shows a love for all things lithic and local. Nan Shepherd’s mineral meditations on the granite expanse of the Cairngorms, re-configures plateau geography into one, single living mountain mass. H.

<p>The figure of the White Goddess was commonly invoked in Hawkes’s descriptions of the cultural life of early British peoples, lending weight to Robert Graves’s theory of the existence of ancient matriarchal world civilizations. During the 1950s, Graves’s ideas were accepted as orthodoxy among the archaeological community. Today, his revisionist historical formulation of social organization is regarded as largely imaginary, the product of complex personal passions and desires. R.

<p>The other works of psychology that had significant influence on Priestley were those of E.A. Abbott and P.D. Ouspensky. <italic>Flatland</italic> (London, Seeley, 1884) Abbott’s satirical novel postulates that human experience of the world may have more dimensions than we are ordinarily able to discern. Should we be able to perceive this more complex topology then its multiple dimensions would appear to us as movements in time. In <italic>New Model of the Universe: Principles of the Psychological Method in its Application to Problems of Science, Religion and Art</italic> (London, Routledge, 1931; translated, R.R. Merton) Ouspensky offers the theory that time exists around a circle so that all happenings of a person’s life are, theoretically, repeatable. The possibility raised by this idea is that we continually relive our lives.</p>

<p>Narrative comparisons can be drawn with the fantasy novel by W.S. Burroughs, <italic>The Ticket that Exploded</italic> (New York, Grove Press, 1962) which posits the idea that deep beneath the earth there exists a vast mineral consciousness thinking in slow formations of crystal.
