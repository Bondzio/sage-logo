<p>Hunston’s book, published as part of the <italic>Routledge Advances in Corpus Linguistics</italic> series, explores the role of corpus linguistics in the study of phraseology and evaluative language. Hunston has devoted much of her research to the interface among evaluation, phraseology and corpus linguistics and has co-edited previous collections in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612466496">Charles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612466496">Hunston and Thompson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612466496">Thompson and Hunston, 2006</xref>). Thus, she brings a strong background to writing this book.</p>
<p>In the first of nine chapters, Hunston provides a detailed explanation for the three key terms in the title: evaluative language, corpus linguistics and phraseology. They are the foundation for the reader to better understand the rest of this book.</p>
<p>The second and third chapters focus on evaluative language as a discoursal, rather than a corpus, phenomenon. Chapter 2 discusses the consensus on evaluation and outlines the different approaches, but puts priority on a discourse-based approach which stresses that evaluation is an action performed in discourse and it is a set of contextually conditioned meanings. Chapter 3 presents a summary of the concept of evaluation of status, investigating the language resources it draws on, its connection with attribution and with multi-modal texts, and also its relationship to the Engagement systems in Appraisal theory.</p>
<p>By contrast, Chapters 4 to 8 focus on corpus studies of evaluative language. Chapter 4 is a literature review of studies of evaluative language which are computational or corpus-based. Hunston points out that all of the work combines the quantitative and the qualitative, although the emphasis in each case is different. The arguments in the following chapters similarly draw on both quantitative information and qualitative interpretation. Chapter 5 is devoted to the role of phraseology in the expression of modal meaning. Corpus analysis shows that some verbs co-occur with modal meaning more frequently than others do, and that modal meaning can be expressed by a large number of grammatically varied phrases as well as by traditional modal verbs. Chapter 6 deals with the status nouns which are used to evaluate the epistemic status of proposition. The analysis reveals that status nouns can themselves be observed to co-occur differently with phrases that evaluate them in one respect or another. Chapter 7 discusses the possibility of devising a local grammar of evaluation, based on the co-occurrence of words and grammatical units. Most significantly, Hunston argues for the primacy of pattern in identifying meaning, the mutability of semantic categorization and the desirability of taking pattern rather than word as the starting point for a local grammar. In Chapter 8, the author examines the role of phraseology in expressing the strength of evaluation and observes that some phrases are frequently associated with evaluative meaning and are sometimes able to bring about semantic reversal and imply a meaning that would be otherwise missing from a text.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, the conclusion of the book, reiterates the concepts of evaluative language, phraseology and corpus linguistics, and gives special attention to the theory, method and technique of corpus linguistics. Then Hunston illustrates how each of the main chapters suggests possible applications and further research. For example, Chapter 7 discusses the feasibility of establishing local grammars, but taking this project further would have a number of potential applications. More rigorous and complete local grammars of evaluation could be an additional resource for sentiment analysis. Moving beyond evaluative language, an ‘intelligent pattern grammar’ could offer a resource to language learners that would approximate to a thesaurus of functions.</p>
<p>These suggestions presented in Chapter 9 for future research concerning different topics in each chapter are, in my view, the most thought-provoking part of the book. Readers may find research directions that interest them or research methods that suit their own research studies. For example, I have benefited from Hunston’s discussion of ‘local grammar’ in Chapter 7. As Hunston states, the combinations between evaluation and corpus linguistics will open up avenues of investigation beyond the investigation of evaluative language itself (p. 171).</p>
<p>By presenting various research studies which focus on the combination of evaluation, phraseology and corpus linguistics, the book has shown the following points: 1) evaluative language plays a very important role in persuasion and construction of knowledge; 2) corpus linguistics is particularly suitable for studying evaluation; 3) phraseology investigation opens up an avenue beyond the investigation of evaluative language itself; and 4) the combination of close attention to individual instances and interpretations of large quantities of data can bring about novel insights into how evaluative language works.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this book is an excellent presentation of Hunston’s dedicated interest in evaluative texts and her continuing work on the interface of corpus linguistics and academic evaluation in the past decade. It will provide guidance for newcomers to this field, and also will be attractive to researchers already in the field because the studies presented in this book will provide them with useful suggestions for possible applications and further research. In sum, in this book readers may find that the combination of the three concepts will give them insight into how evaluative language works and new investigation directions. The book will be attractive to a large body of readers.</p>
