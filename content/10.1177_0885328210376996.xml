<p>Septic loosening of cemented implants represents an unresolved long-term problem of total hip endoprostheses. Common treatments of infected prostheses involve the use of temporary antibiotic-loaded PMMA spacer-implants or antibiotic-loaded cements. The latter are either provided by a manufacturer or are obtained by simply mixing specific antibiotic powders according to a microbial sensitivity test with PMMA cement. This study is aimed to investigate the antibiotic release behavior and mechanical properties of novel modified PMMA cements, which were bioactivated by chemical modification of commercial cements with either 0.5% hydroxyethylmethacrylate-phosphate (HEMA-P) or 0.5% hydroxyethylmethacrylate-phosphate + calcium chloride and sodium carbonate as buffer. Tobramycin release experiments from the cements were performed statically by immersion of the drug-loaded samples in PBS buffer following liquid change after different periods of time or during cyclic mechanical loading of the cement samples. Cement modification did not significantly alter the mechanical properties of the cements, but affected the release rate from the matrix. While the unmodified cement released approximately 0.33 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> tobramycin after 48 h independent of the testing regime, modification with both HEMA-P and salt buffer increased the antibiotic release to 37–50 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> when tested under cyclical mechanical loading.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328210376996" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The most common indications for the implantation of total hip replacement prostheses are osteoarthrosis, rheumatic arthritis, and fractures of the femoral neck. The fixation of endoprostheses in the femur is performed cement-free or by the use of polymeric bone cement based on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210376996">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210376996">2</xref>]. The methacrylate cement serves as space filler and bonding agent, which adapts the surface unevenness of the surrounding bone and the prosthesis surface and fixes the implant shortly after implantation. PMMA cements are commonly two component systems consisting of a powder phase of pre-polymerized PMMA particles with radio-opaque ceramic fillers (e.g., BaSO<sub>4</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>) and a liquid of various methacrylate monomers. Since their development in the 1960s, research on PMMA cements has been mainly focused on the improvement of the bone-cement interface by chemical cement modification with less toxic initiator systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210376996">3</xref>] and a hydrolytically stable link between cement and metallic implant surface. While the latter is obtained by modifying either the metal surface or the cement liquid with bifunctional compounds like 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376996">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376996">5</xref>] or methacryloxy-propyltrimethoxy silane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210376996">6</xref>], the bond between cement and bone could be enhanced by adding water-soluble calcium salts and phosphate-based monomers to the cement mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210376996">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210376996">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Septic and aseptic loosening of cemented implants represent an unresolved long-term problem of total hip endoprostheses. Despite different pathological mechanisms, both processes result in the formation of a pseudo-membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210376996">9</xref>], which surrounds the loosened prosthesis such that revision surgery is required. The primary infection rate in total hip and knee arthroplasty (cemented and cement-free) was found to be approximately 1–3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210376996">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210376996">12</xref>] and the rate of re-infection after revision of infected hip prostheses is up to 14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210376996">13</xref>]. The reason for a post-operative infection is mainly due to contamination of the implant surface during implantation with the formation of a resistant biofilm as well as a haematogenic bacterial spreading (e.g., after tooth extraction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210376996">14</xref>]. Chronically infected endoprostheses have to be explanted. Common therapies involve the use of temporary antibiotic-loaded PMMA spacer-implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210376996">15</xref>] or antibiotic-loaded cements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210376996">16</xref>]. The latter are either provided by the manufacturer (e.g., Refobacin® bone cement/Palacos® gentamicin, both containing 1.25% gentamicin sulfate; antibiotic Simplex® containing 2.44% tobramycin sulfate) or could be obtained by simply mixing specific antibiotic powders according to a microbial sensitivity test with PMMA cement. However, admixed antibiotics may decrease the mechanical properties of the hardened cement at higher concentration and it is recommended by various authors not to exceed an amount of more than 4 g antibiotic per 40 g cement powder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210376996">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210376996">18</xref>]. A major problem with antibiotic-loaded PMMA cements is their low drug release capacity; long-term investigations by van de Belt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210376996">19</xref>] showed that approximately only 5–8% of gentamicin were released from a PMMA cement matrix. Another study from Tunney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328210376996">20</xref>] found an initial burst within the first 6 h with 15 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> released gentamicin, after which a much smaller dose of 3.02 ± 0.08 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> was released within the following 72 h.</p>
<p>In an approach to increase the bioactivity of conventional PMMA bone cements it could be demonstrated that the addition of anionic monomers in combination with water-soluble calcium salts and alkaline buffering compounds leads to a mineralization of the cement surface upon incubation in simulated body fluid and cell culture media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210376996">21</xref>]. The <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of this modification is presently under investigation. This study is aimed to investigate the influence of this bioactivation approach on antibiotic release behavior and mechanical properties of PMMA cements, which were modified by the addition of either 0.5% hydroxyethylmethacrylate-phosphate (HEMA-P) or 0.5% hydroxyethylmethacrylate-phosphate + calcium chloride and sodium carbonate as buffer to a commercially available bone cement formula. Release experiments were performed according to various regimes: (1) statically by immersion of drug-loaded samples in PBS buffer following liquid change after different periods of time or (2) during cyclic mechanical loading of the cement samples.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328210376996"><title>Preparation of Cement Samples for Antibiotic Release and Mechanical Testing</title>
<p>A constant powder to liquid ratio of 2 : 1 was used for preparing all samples. After mixing 3 g powder and 1.5 mL liquid on a glass slab with a spatula for 30 s, the paste was filled in silicone rubber molds with 9 mm diameter and 12 mm height (static release) or 9 mm diameter and 20 mm height (dynamic release under mechanical load). Samples were removed after 24 h setting at 37°C.</p>
<p>The compressive and four-point bending strengths of the modified cements were tested according to ISO 5833 after 24 h storage at 37°C. Cylindrical samples for compressive strength (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were prepared using stainless steel molds (6 mm diameter, 12 mm height) and tested in compression with a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The compressive strength was calculated by dividing the maximum strength and the cross-sectional area of the sample. Samples for bend strength (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were prepared using a polyethylene mold with a size of 3 × 10 × 100 mm<sup>3</sup> and tested with a four-point bending regime with a cross-head speed of 10 mm/min with a 5 kN load cell. The bending strength was calculated according to:

where <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> (N) is the failure load, <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub> (<italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>) (mm) is the distance between the outer (inner) rolls, <italic>b</italic> is the width (mm), and <italic>h</italic> is the height (mm) of the samples.</p>
<p>The biomineralization behavior of the cements was studied by soaking the samples for 7 d at 37°C in a tris-buffered SBF solution (pH = 7.4) prepared by dissolving 313 mg MgCl<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, 353 mg NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 226 mg K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>·3 H<sub>2</sub>O, 300 mg KCl, 166 mg Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·10 H<sub>2</sub>O, 7.99 g NaCl, 373 mg CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 26,7 mL 0.5 M tris-buffer in 1 L deionized water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328210376996"><title>Drug Release Experiments</title>
<p>Drug release was studied using two different immersion regimes: (1) samples (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were stored in 10 mL PBS solution, respectively, and the medium was changed after every 10 min within the first hour, after every 30 min until the third hour, every hour until 7 h, then after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 21 days. (2) Release under cyclic mechanical load (<italic>n</italic> = 2) was performed by placing the samples in 10 mL PBS solution while applying a dynamic load of 100–1500 N with a frequency of 1 Hz using a dynamic mechanical testing machine (Zwick, Ulm, Germany). The liquid was changed in intervals of 30 min (1800 cycles) for the first 2 h, then every hour (3600 cycles) until 6 h and finally after 24 and 48 h (86,400 cycles, respectively). The amount of released tobramycin was measured using absorbance measurement against standard solutions at 332 nm using an UV-Vis spectrometer (Cary 13, Varian, Australia). The cumulative release profiles were modelled using the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation as pharmaceutical release model. Because lower release rates are statistically no longer significant, the profiles were fitted by the time where release was higher than 0.1% per day, for example, for the reference and cement with 0.5% HEMA-P up to 168 h. Due to comparability all release profiles were fitted until 168 h immersion time.</p>

<p>Mechanical performance of cements after modification and 24 h storage in PBS are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210376996">Figure 1</xref>. The unmodified cements showed a compressive (bending) strength of 82.3 (45.4) MPa (Surgical Simplex, no tobramycin) and 73.1 (43.9) MPa (Antibiotic Simplex with tobramycin). Although cement modification with HEMA-P and calcium/sodium salts slightly reduced compressive strength values, the differences were insignificant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The four-point bending strength as well as the E-modulus was not significantly affected.

<sec id="sec8-0885328210376996"><title>Release Experiments</title>
<p>The modification of PMMA cements with HEMA-P and soluble salts affected the release kinetics quantitatively as well as qualitatively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210376996">Figure 3</xref> shows the cumulative release kinetics of modified PMMA cement under static conditions. While the addition of HEMA-P reduces the quantitative release of tobramycin from 15% to 10% compared to unmodified cement until complete release after 168 h, modification of cement with both HEMA-P and soluble salts increased the release time up to 336 h for 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> addition with a final tobramycin release of 14%. Adding 2.5% CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to the polymeric matrix, cumulative elution of tobramycin was found to be approximately 18% after 672 h. The release kinetics during mechanical loading is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210376996">Figure 4</xref>, a comparison between both release regimes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210376996">Figure 5</xref> with cumulative released doses after 48 h being normalized by the surface of the test samples. The cyclical stress did not influence the normalized cumulative released amount for unmodified cement; however, the modification of PMMA cements lead to an increasing drug release with increasing salt quantity. Comparing modified PMMA cements under static condition and dynamic loading an increasing cumulative release of tobramycin of 36% for HEMA-P modification to 63% for HEMA-P/2.5% CaCl<sub>2</sub> modification after 48 h under cyclical stress could be shown, whereas the cumulative release amount rises with increasing CaCl<sub>2</sub> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210376996">Figure 5</xref>).

<sec id="sec9-0885328210376996"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The release of antibiotics from PMMA cements is a common procedure to prevent or treat implant-associated bone infections. In contrast to microporous calcium phosphate biocements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210376996">22</xref>], PMMA cements are dense monolithic materials with only a marginal porosity such that drug release is limited to the implant surface and total release amount is mostly lower than 10% of the antibiotic load. The antibiotic elution takes place in three stages: (1) an initial burst within the first 24 h, (2) a phase in which the elution rate decreases (1–14 days) and (3) a final phase (&gt;14 days) with the elution rate being very slow and attaining a constant value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210376996">23</xref>]. Experimental release regimes commonly are based on simple immersion of cement samples in physiological solution (static condition), such that biomechanical conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> are not properly simulated by this testing regime. Since during normal daily activities the cement is subjected to cyclical mechanical stress when used in load bearing applications, the release rate is likely to increase by the formation of microcracks and porosity. Various studies have been reported on the elution rate of an antibiotic from a cement specimen comparing cyclical loading and static conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210376996">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210376996">25</xref>]. The authors found no differences in gentamicin release rates for <italic>CMW1 Radiopaque G</italic> and <italic>Palacos R1G</italic> cements subjected to the mechanical conditions during drug release, whereas for <italic>Palamed G</italic> specimens, drug release under mechanical loading conditions was significantly higher. This was explained by the higher bulk porosity of the latter cement. In another study it was shown that cyclical loading of antibiotic-loaded <italic>VersaBond AB</italic> implant results in a significantly higher drug release due to an increasing surface area by microcracking during cyclical-loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210376996">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The current study is aimed to investigate the effect of bio-activating PMMA cement by the addition of HEMA-P and soluble calcium and sodium salts on the drug release behavior. These bioactivated cements showed no changes of the mechanical properties after 24 h storage in PBS buffer; a loss of mechanical integrity over a longer ageing period is not expected to occur according to a study of Cho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210376996">26</xref>] who found no influence of the ageing time on the mechanical performance of bioactivated PMMA cements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210376996">26</xref>]. The hypothesis of the current study was that by dissolving salt particles, the drug release will be increased due to both a higher bulk porosity and surface area. The release kinetic was tested under static and dynamic conditions, showing no differences in tobramycin release for the unmodified cement. The modification of PMMA with HEMA-P leads to a reduced release of tobramycin under static conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210376996">Figure 3</xref>) within the first 48 h, while further modification of PMMA cement with soluble salts shows no significant difference compared to unmodified cement. This can be probably explained by two effects: first there is likely a strong electrostatic attraction between the (cationic) tobramycin molecule and the (anionic) phosphate groups of HEMA-P retarding release. Secondly, the acidic phosphate groups of HEMA-P decrease the pH value within the cement (pH of a HEMA-P/PMMA polymer (5 : 95 wt. ratio) in aqueous suspension is approx. 4.2) and it is known from bioceramic coatings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210376996">27</xref>] that the release of tobramycin depends on the pH value, for example, Stigter et al. showed a lower release of tobramycin under acidic conditions (pH = 5) than in a physiological environment (pH = 7.3). Further modification of PMMA cement with buffering salts increase both pH and the cumulative tobramycin release to the reference level. Although the same effect occurs under mechanical load, cumulative tobramycin release was found to be approximately 36–63% higher than under static conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210376996">Figure 5</xref>). This is likely the effect of both surface crack formation within the modified cements originating from salt particles or the HEMA-P modification combined with creation of higher bulk porosity by dissolving of salt particles. At the same time, cyclical mechanical loading may result in a ‘pump’-effect in the surface near pores leading to an enhanced liquid exchange and hence a faster antibiotic release.</p>
<p>To identify the release mechanism, the experimental data were fitted using the Peppas model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1077546310395966">Equation (2)</xref>), which was developed on the basis of water-soluble drugs from polymeric matices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328210376996">28</xref>]:

with <italic>M<sub>t</sub>/M<sub>∞</sub></italic> (%) being the cumulative release, which is proportional to a release constant <italic>k</italic> (% h<sup>−1</sup>) and follows a time to the power of <italic>n</italic> relation with <italic>n</italic> being the release exponent correlating to the release mechanism.

For cylindrical samples <italic>n</italic> ≤ 0.45 indicates Fickian diffusion as release process due to a concentration gradient. Since this is fulfilled for all cement samples in this study, a diffusion controlled process can be concluded for all cements independent of their modification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328210376996">Table 2</xref>). Although there is only a marginal deviation between <italic>n</italic> of the different release profiles, a higher burst release is attended by a higher release exponent <italic>n</italic>.

<sec id="sec10-0885328210376996"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>To enhance osteointegration of PMMA cemented implants or PMMA space fillers, a commercially available tobramycin-loaded PMMA cement was bioactivated and investigated with regard to the release kinetic and mechanical properties. The bioactivation of PMMA with HEMA-P and calcium/sodium salts did not significantly affect compressive strength or the E-modulus, but increased the antibiotic release to 37–50 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> when tested under cyclical mechanical loading. Increasing antibiotic release under quasi <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions as well as inducing biomineralization of the implants surface by release of soluble salts without loosing of the cements mechanical stability would be beneficial to reduce septic and aseptic failure rates of surgical implants.</p>
