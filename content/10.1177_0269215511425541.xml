<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To evaluate whether early mobilization after acute ischaemic stroke is better than delayed mobilization with regard to medical complications and if it is safe in relation to neurological function and cerebral blood flow.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Randomized controlled pilot trial of early versus delayed mobilization out of bed with incidence of severe complications as the primary outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Acute stroke unit in the neurology department of a University Hospital.</p>
<p><bold>Participants</bold>: Fifty patients after ischaemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &gt;6 were recruited.</p>
<p><bold>Intervention</bold>: All patients were treated with physiotherapy immediately after their admission. In the early protocol patients were mobilized out of bed after 52 hours, in the delayed protocol after seven days.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Eight out of 50 randomized patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because of early transfer to other hospitals. There were 2 (8%) severe complications in the 25 early mobilization patients and 8 (47%) in the 17 delayed mobilization patients (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.006). There were no differences in the total number of complications or in clinical outcome. In the 26 patients (62%) who underwent serial transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, no blood flow differences were found.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: We found an apparent reduction in severe complications and no increase in total complications with an early mobilization protocol after acute ischaemic stroke. No influence on neurological three-month outcomes or on cerebral blood flow was seen. These results justify larger trials comparing mobilization protocols with possibly even faster mobilization out of bed than explored here.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early mobilization and initiation of a rehabilitation schedule may limit the development of medical complications such as broncho-aspiration, deep venous thrombosis and urinary tract infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511425541">1</xref></sup> To date, no controlled study has investigated the impact of the timing of mobilization on complications, cerebral blood flow and intermediate-term outcome. Up till now, the potential decrease of cerebral blood flow in critically hypoperfused regions with altered vasoregulation has been the usual argument for leaving patients on bed rest in a flat head position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511425541">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511425541">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The terms ‘early mobilization’ and ‘early neurorehabilitation’ after stroke are not well defined. They comprise various medical and paramedical interventions from day one up to three months after stroke onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511425541">4</xref></sup> Moreover, the word ‘mobilization’ is used for any physical activity of the body initiated either by the patient or through therapy of the paramedical staff, independent of the body position (during bed rest in supine position before getting out of bed the first time, while sitting or standing).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511425541">3</xref></sup> This definition is somewhat different from the very early mobilization concept, where patients get out of bed very rapidly, as per Bernhardt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511425541">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current international guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511425541">6</xref></sup> recommend early mobilization as soon as possible after stroke. This mobilization concerns the head position and neurorehabilitation during bed rest before the first verticalization out of bed in stimulating the sensorimotor deficits, for example, through interdisciplinary concepts such as Bobath.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511425541">7</xref></sup> However, few scientific data for such recommendations are available and little research has been carried out with regard to the manner in which to proceed with heterogeneous stroke patients. Similarly, data on the impact of mobilization protocols on cerebral blood flow are lacking. The optimal position of the head and the optimal moment to get out of bed to prevent secondary complications are still controversial in acute stroke. In some stroke units, getting the patients out of bed after 24 hours is thought of as ‘conventional’, whereas for others this is ‘early’. It is generally assumed that early verticalization after stroke can provoke an enlargement of the size of the ischaemic lesion due to the drop in cranial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure in areas of decreased cerebral autoregulation. In contrast, other authors are of the opinion that there is less risk of a significant blood pressure drop for patients who get out of bed in the first few days after stroke because there is a strong reaction of the sympathetic system in response to the stress of the ischaemic lesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511425541">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The very early phase II rehabilitation trial for stroke (AVERT) by Bernhardt et al. showed no significant effect of early mobilization on death and dependency at three months and confirmed that early mobilization (upright position) in the first 24 hours after stroke is safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511425541">9</xref></sup> Moreover, early mobilization can diminish the cost of hospitalization and be associated with a better outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511425541">10</xref></sup> However, there still remains insufficient evidence to make any recommendation in clinical practice, as suggested by a recent Cochrane Library review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511425541">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study aims to compare early mobilization protocol moving the patient out of bed at 52 hours with a delayed protocol of mobilization over six days in acute ischaemic stroke patients. The main hypothesis of this study is that earlier mobilization is better than delayed mobilization with regard to medical complications. Secondly, we were interested in showing that early mobilization is safe with regard to neurological scores and cerebral blood flow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511425541" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patient inclusion criteria were as follows: age &gt;18 years old, moderate to severe stroke (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &gt;6), ischaemic stroke confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, inclusion within the first 12 hours of admission to the stroke unit and patient/family consent obtained. Given that this was a pilot trial looking at clinical and biological efficacy of a specific treatment, we used a per protocol analysis, analysing only the patients who completed the treatment they were assigned to. Patients with transitory ischaemic attack, intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage were excluded because they may have had other cerebral haemodynamic responses to acute injury and therefore to mobilization.</p>
<p>The study protocol was accepted by the ethics committee of our region.</p>
<p>The patients were randomized into two groups: one group following the protocol of ‘early mobilization’ and the other group following the protocol with ‘delayed mobilization’. Randomization was performed using a computer generator of random numbers of statistical software (STATA 10.1) with the group assignment written in sealed envelopes that were opened after inclusion in the study, immediately upon admission of the patient to the stroke unit. Patients were admitted by a physician not involved in the treatment and were kept blind to group assignment.</p>
<p>Both groups were mobilized during bed rest by physical therapy (for instance passive or active exercises, sensorimotor stimulation or hemi-neglect therapy, according to Bobath). The patients in the delayed mobilization protocol had the heads of their beds progressively elevated over six days, and were then moved out of bed. The patients in the early mobilization protocol remained at 0° during the first 24 hours after stroke onset. Then the head position was raised to 45° for 24 hours. Both protocols were applied in the same stroke unit but there was no contact between patients. The patients’ blood pressure was continuously monitored in the stroke unit. In the case of NIHSS worsening by at least two points or systolic drop of more than &gt;20 mmHg, the physician was consulted in order to confirm a worsening of at least 2 points related to head raising. Although a &gt;4 point change of the NIHSS is regarded as clinically significant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511425541">12</xref></sup> we wanted, for this study, to be sure not to miss minor worsening as well. Therefore we instructed nurses to call the physicians even for a 2-point worsening. In this case, the head position was again lowered to 0° for 24 hours, and the protocol restarted. In the absence of worsening, the head position was raised after 48 hours to 90° for 4 hours, again watching for clinical worsening. After that, the patient was moved out of bed (onto a chair or to a standing position) by physiotherapists.</p>
<p>While blinding of the treatment protocol was not possible, bloodflow measurements and a three-month post-stroke clinical assessment were conducted by physicians not involved in the randomization and patient care and unaware of the patient group. Both patient groups were treated with the same interdisciplinary early neurorehabilitation programme (twice a day for 30 minutes) beginning during bed rest with passive and active mobilization, for example, by physiotherapy following the Bobath concept and, if needed, help with swallowing and ergotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511425541">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>As primary end-points, the incidence of severe complications during hospitalization, defined as complications that potentially have vital consequences, was analysed. Such complications include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hospital-acquired pneumonia and acute coronary syndrome.</p>
<p>The secondary end-points were minor complications that did not influence the autonomy of the patients and that are not usually considered as life threatening and did not prolong hospital stay in a significant way. These included, for example, urinary tract infections, superficial vein thrombosis, minor allergic reactions and bed sores. A study physician interrogated the patients and the medical staff in charge of the patient for new symptoms each working day and briefly examined the patient in order to detect the pre-specified complications. These were diagnosed according to published criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511425541">1</xref></sup> The complications were noted by the doctors without blinding. Other secondary end-points were a difference in neurological deficit measured by the NIHSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511425541">12</xref></sup> and the modified Rankin Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511425541">14</xref></sup> and modifications of cerebral blood flow measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. NIHSS was measured in an unblinded fashion on admission (NIHSS 0), after two days (NIHSS 2) and after five days (NIHSS 5). After 10 days the modified Rankin Scale was also measured in an unblinded way and three months later in a blinded way. A clinical deterioration was defined as a modification of 2 or more points on the NIHSS.</p>
<p>For assessing potential changes in cerebral blood flow during the study, we chose various transcranial colour duplex flow imaging or transcranial measurements over several days, although a correlation with clinical outcome is not known to date. The following ultrasound devices, equipped with a 2 MHz transducer, were used for transcranial colour duplex flow imaging or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography: (1) ATL 5000 Advanced Ultrasound Instrument (Phillips Medical Systems SA); (2) Acuson Sequoia 512 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA); and (3) Multi-Dop T2 instrument (DWL) with a 2 MHz pulsed-wave transducer (DWL Elektronische Systeme GmbH, Sipplingen, Germany), with reproducible results in all instruments. Measurements were performed at 24 hours and between 72 and 96 hours post stroke. The middle cerebral arteries were insonated using the temporal bone window at a depth of 50, 55 and 61 mm. The measurements were performed while the patients were recumbent, with head positions dependent on the stage of mobilization. Samples from right and left middle cerebral arteries according to the mobilization protocol are shown at the representative 55 mm depth. Peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were measured at each depth of insonation. Mean velocities were calculated using the formula (peak systolic velocity + (2× end-diastolic velocity)/3). The pulsating index (peak systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity/mean velocity) quantifies the shape of the transcranial Doppler waveform and is inversely correlated to cerebral vascular resistance (resistivity index; (peak systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity).</p>
<p>NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale were calculated from a clinical evaluation at our stroke outpatient clinic at three months by physicians certified in these scales.</p>
<p>Differences between the two mobilization protocols in the number of complications were analysed with the Exact Fisher Test. Doppler ultrasonography data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) and analysed with two-way (mobilization versus time) analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests (95% confidence interval) using Graph-Pad Prism 4 software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences in age and mean length of hospital stay were analysed using the Wilcoxon Test; differences in NIHSS score were analysed with repeated measure analysis of variance using STATA software. Data are presented as mean (standard deviation).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke were recruited to this prospective randomized trial from the stroke unit immediately after admission.</p>
<p>Patients had a mean age of 71.5 years, with no significant difference between the two mobilization protocols (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511425541">Table 1</xref>). Out of 50 randomized patients, eight were considered off-study and were excluded from the per protocol analysis because of early transfer from our stroke unit to other acute care services or hospitals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511425541">Figure 1</xref>). These eight patients all lived in areas covered by other hospitals and, following our University Hospital policy, had to be transferred to their local hospitals once they no longer required the specialist treatment of our acute stroke unit. Only patients in the delayed mobilization group were concerned because their length of stay had been increased in order to follow the protocol. These transfers were not at all due to any deterioration in the patients’ condition. As all the drop-outs were in the delayed protocol, 17 patients of the delayed and 25 of the early mobilization protocol were included in the per protocol analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511425541">Table 1</xref>). The mean length of hospital stay was similar for both groups. For 23 males and 19 females, mean (SD) NIHSS scores at admission (NIHSS 0) were 14.4 (7.4) in the early mobilization protocol patients and 17.1 (4.9) in the delayed mobilization protocol (not statistically different). For all patients, the day when a patient got out of bed corresponded to the protocol (early protocol: median of 2.0, and delayed protocol: median of 6.0).</p>

<p>Of all the patients, 15 (36%) presented a complication (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511425541">Table 2</xref>). In the delayed protocol, eight (47%) presented severe complications: five patients developed pneumonia (one on day 1, two on day 3, one on day 4); two patients acute coronary syndrome (days 3 and 7) and one patient died on day 6 after pulmonary embolus which was the only death in the whole study during the three-month observation period. Death rate was therefore 0% in the early mobilization protocol, and one person (5.9%) in the delayed mobilization protocol. In contrast, only two patients (8%) in the early mobilization protocol had severe complications which were both pneumonias (one patient on day 1 and one on day 3).

No significant differences in mean peak systemic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility index and resistivity index of middle cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511425541">Table 2</xref>) were found at 24 or 72–96 hours between early and delayed mobilization protocol (respectively, peak systemic velocity: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 1.3; end-diastolic velocity: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.005; pulsatility index: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.25; and resistivity index: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.58). Doppler flow measurements and indices did not vary significantly over time (respectively, peak systemic velocity: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.6; end-diastolic velocity: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.04; pulsatility index: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.09; resistivity index: <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 0.14).</p>
<p>Overall, no significant difference was detected in the neurological deficit (NIHSS/modified Rankin Scale). At 52 hours, NIHSS day 2 scores were 14.2 (6.8) in early mobilized and 14.6 (7.8) in delayed mobilized patients (patients of both groups being still confined to bed). On day 5 (with early mobilized patients out of bed and delayed mobilized patients still in bed), NIHSS day 5 scores were 13.1 (8.9) in early mobilized and 15.7 (4.2) in delayed mobilized patients. At discharge, NIHSS scores were 13.7 in early mobilized and 11.7 in delayed mobilized patients. In each group, two patients had a significant NIHSS score worsening of &gt;4 points between admission and any of the following seven days. This did not occur at the time of changing head position. After three months, 10 patients (40%) of the early mobilization protocol and six patients (35%) of the delayed mobilization protocol showed a modified Rankin Scale between 0 and 2 (non-significant).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This randomized controlled study investigated the effect of a strict protocol of progressive head elevation with early getting out of bed at 52 hours compared to a delayed protocol over seven days. This early protocol showed an apparent reduction of severe medical complications with early mobilization and safety of such a protocol on neurological scales and cerebral blood flow on transcranial Doppler.</p>
<p>The results of this study concur with other observational studies showing that pulmonary, venous embolic and infectious complications after stroke increase with prolonged bed rest after acute stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511425541">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511425541"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511425541">17</xref></sup> This confirms the current recommendations of getting the patient out of bed as early as possible after acute stroke followed by an intensive multi-interdisciplinary and coordinated approach in a specialized stroke unit. This is in line with the results of the AVERT-II trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511425541">9</xref></sup> which demonstrate the safety of early mobilization after acute stroke.</p>
<p>According to recent studies, 6–7 days of bed rest certainly seem excessive. When we planned and started our study, however (2006), the international recommendations were quite vague, specifically about how quick ‘early mobilization’ is. Furthermore, our stroke unit’s philosophy was indeed to get patients out of bed very slowly, often over 4–7 days, especially in more severe strokes and in patients with arterial occlusions and stenosis. This attitude was explained with theoretical worsening of perfusion in critically hypoperfused tissue, although little experimental and clinical evidence exists to support this hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511425541">18</xref></sup> Therefore this study adds a complementary and important set of data to Julie Bernhardt’s Cochrane Review of studies comparing very early mobilization after 24 hours to standard care showing a reduction in minor complications and no difference in death and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511425541">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sorbello et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511425541">19</xref></sup> compared an out-of-bed activity with intensive (at least twice per day, in addition to usual care) interdisciplinary care to standard care and the complications during the following three months. They found longer mean length of stay but no statistically significant difference in the complications between the two groups. According to the authors the reason for this could be attributed to the small sample size studied.</p>
<p>Langhorne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511425541">20</xref></sup> randomized patients into four groups: (a) standard stroke unit care, (b) early active mobilization, (c) automated monitoring and (d) combined early active mobilization and automated monitoring. The patients in the early active mobilization group were given even more intensive treatment with at least four times per day sitting, standing or walking. One notable result was the lower rate of complications of immobility in the early active mobilization group. As opposed to this trial, the protocols of our study focused on the progression of the head position over 52 hours or seven days.</p>
<p>The recent AVERT study showed that earlier and more intensive physical therapy and getting out of bed within 24 hours after stroke may fast-track a return to unassisted walking and improve functional recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511425541">21</xref></sup> As compared with the AVERT study, our ‘early’ mobilization protocol moved patients out of bed later (52 hours), the mobilization protocol during the in-bed phase was better defined in both treatment groups (twice daily physiotherapy including sensorimotor stimulation or hemi-neglect therapy according to Bobath), and our primary end-points were different.</p>
<p>The theoretical reason for keeping patients in bed after ischaemic stroke is to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure in the penumbra region, which usually shows decreased autoregulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511425541">3</xref></sup> Hypothetically, the horizontal body and head position could increase intracranial blood flow to ischaemic tissue and ultimately reduce brain infarct volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511425541">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511425541">18</xref></sup> However, in some studies, no significant difference of blood flow was reported for different head positions: the sample size was small and the authors did not report any relationship with the outcome. Novak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511425541">22</xref></sup> used transcranial Doppler in larger patient samples to compare cerebral vasoregulation at two months post minor ischaemic stroke in subjects with hypertension and normal blood pressure. This study showed that cerebral vasoregulation may still be altered two months post stroke depending on the head positioning. No study, however, evaluated the infarct growth or neurological evolution in relationship to elevation of the head position during bed rest or when moving the patient out of bed.</p>
<p>The limitations of our study were several: the small number of patients limits the statistical power, increases the risk of type II errors, and does not allow for any statistical adjustment for baseline differences. The admission NIHSS seemed somewhat higher in the delayed mobilization group, for example. Although this is not statistically significant, the small number of patients limits the reliability of our findings. Second, there was clearly an unequal drop-out rate in the treatment groups because, due to our University Hospital policy, some patients who were still confined to bed rest, in accordance with our protocol, but whose condition was considered stable had to be transferred from our stroke unit to their local hospital or rehabilitation centre and were lost to follow-up. Given that this is a pilot study where we would like to find early signals of possible harm or benefit of two alternative treatments, we preferred to perform an on-treatment analysis rather than an intention-to-treat analysis. Third, it was not possible to measure the primary outcome (complications of bed rest) in a blinded way, given that complications were looked for daily and prospectively which required clinical examination of the patient. Finally, transcranial Doppler was performed in only about 60% of instances planned, and therefore may not be a true reflection of cerebral blood flow in the entire patient population.</p>
<p>In the present study, no significant differences in mean peak systemic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility index and resistivity index of middle cerebral arteries were found at 24 hours or 72–96 hours between the early and delayed mobilization groups, independently from the vascular territory or presence of (pre-cerebral or intracranial) arterial stenosis. Furthermore, elevation of blood pressure with orthostatism has been reported in acute stroke and attributed to sympathetic nervous system over-activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511425541">21</xref></sup> Upright position and mobilization, as part of early rehabilitation following mild-to-moderate stroke would therefore not predispose to detrimental postural reductions in blood pressure.</p>
<p>This study found no increase in complications and an apparent reduction in severe complications with a protocol that carefully controlled the head position and allowed out of bed activity at 52 hours post stroke. The results of this study justify larger trials with different mobilization protocols, with possibly even faster mobilization out of bed than explored here.</p>
