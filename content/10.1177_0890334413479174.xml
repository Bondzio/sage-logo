<sec id="section1-0890334413479174">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Tongue-tie or ankyloglossia is a congenital condition that negatively affects breastfeeding. The thickened, tightened, or shortened frenulum affects the infant’s ability to suck and frequently results in sore and painful nipples. Although several studies have investigated outcomes associated with treatment of tongue-tie, none have investigated mothers’ experiences of breastfeeding an infant with tongue-tie.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334413479174">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>This study aimed to understand the breastfeeding experiences of women whose infants have tongue-tie.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334413479174">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A hermeneutic phenomenological design was employed. Data were collected using focused interviews and, following transcription, were analyzed in the phenomenological tradition. Ten women who presented at a breastfeeding clinic with feeding problems, and were diagnosed with tongue-tie, were interviewed on 2 occasions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334413479174">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The analysis revealed a common story of tension between the mothers’ expectations and the breastfeeding challenges they faced. Their journey was characterized by 6 distinct phases described in the following themes: <italic>Expectations; Something is wrong; Questioning, seeking advice, no real answers; Symptoms and perseverance; Approaching the wall—it’s all too much</italic>; and finally, <italic>Relief</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334413479174">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The women in this study described a somewhat harrowing journey, which was at odds with the natural experience they had anticipated. They encountered health professionals who were found to have limited knowledge of tongue-tie and its potential effect on breastfeeding and were unable to provide appropriate advice concerning their breastfeeding difficulties. However, following treatment with frenotomy, their breastfeeding experience improved dramatically. The reported incidence of tongue-tie is significant, and early identification and prompt and effective management would contribute to improved breastfeeding.</p>

<title>Well Established</title>
<p><italic>Tongue-tie has been reported as occurring in between 2.8% and 10.7% of all infants. The condition limits movements of the tongue and can affect activities such as breastfeeding. Frenotomy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment.</italic></p>

<sec id="section8-0890334413479174">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Major literature reviews confirm the overwhelming evidence that breastfeeding and breast milk provide optimal nutrition and protection against illness and disease for both mothers and infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413479174">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413479174"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413479174">3</xref></sup> Despite this, Australian breastfeeding rates fall significantly during an infant’s first 6 months: although 80% of infants are fully breastfed at 1 week, only 14% remain so at 6 months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413479174">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a congenital condition with an unusually thickened, tightened, or shortened frenulum (membrane under the tongue).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413479174">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413479174">6</xref></sup> The frenulum may vary in length, elasticity, and placement along the underside of the tongue to the floor of the mouth, which can affect infants’ breastfeeding skills in different ways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413479174">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tongue-tie may restrict movement of the tongue and, as a result, the mother may experience painful, bleeding nipples from the friction caused by abnormal tongue movements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413479174">8</xref></sup> Some infants with tongue-tie are unable to attach to the breast, whereas others are able to attach but are less efficient at breastfeeding, due to reduced tongue mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413479174">5</xref></sup> Some infants fail to transfer enough breast milk for adequate growth, whereas poor attachment due to tongue-tie may reduce stimulation of the breast and lead to reduced milk supply.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413479174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413479174">10</xref></sup> Despite frequent feeds, the infant may have poor weight gain due to poor milk intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413479174">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413479174">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413479174"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413479174">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent review of research evidence demonstrated that tongue-tie is negatively associated with breastfeeding for infants and mothers and that frenotomy (tongue-tie separation) is a safe and simple procedure that offers significant benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413479174">14</xref></sup> No qualitative research describing mothers’ experiences of breastfeeding an infant with tongue-tie was found.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to understand and describe what it was like for women to breastfeed an infant with tongue-tie, with a broader aim of using this information to inform the development of clinical practice guidelines for health professionals working with breastfeeding mothers.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This qualitative research study focused on description and interpretation of the breastfeeding experiences of women whose infants have tongue-tie using hermeneutic phenomenology, which explores the meaning, examination, and description of the human experience to therefore gain an understanding of what has occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413479174">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413479174">16</xref></sup> Ethical approval was received from West Moreton South Burnett Health Service District (reference: 46/08) and Australian Catholic University (reference: Q200708 42) Human Research Ethics Committees.</p>

<sec id="section11-0890334413479174">
<title>Subject Selection Criteria and Recruitment</title>
<p>A purposive sample of 10 women who attended a public health service breastfeeding clinic was selected for interview. Women were invited to participate at their initial clinic visit when their infant was diagnosed with tongue-tie.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334413479174">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected over a 10-month period. In-depth interviews employed open-ended questions, which are ideally suited for the exploration of participants’ experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413479174">17</xref></sup> Broad questions such as, “What has breastfeeding been like for you?” “Can you describe this for me?” and “Please, can you tell me a story that illustrates what it has been like for you?” enabled participants to describe their experiences fully.</p>
<p>To capture women’s experiences before and after their children’s diagnosis, 2 interviews were conducted. The first interview occurred when the mother first presented to the clinic, and it explored her experience of breastfeeding since her infant’s birth. The second was conducted approximately 2 weeks later and explored her experiences following receipt of the clinic’s advice and support. Each interview lasted around an hour and concluded when participants felt they had nothing further to say. At the time of the second interviews, 7 of the 10 infants had undergone frenotomy, one mother was advised by her doctor that her infant did not have a tongue-tie and therefore did not need a frenotomy, one had an appointment for her infant to be assessed for frenotomy, and the third did not believe that tongue-tie was the cause of her breastfeeding difficulties. All 3 continued to breastfeed with some improvements and ongoing difficulties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334413479174">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using the phenomenological approach described by Van Manen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413479174">18</xref></sup> Following immersion in the data, through reading and re-reading the transcripts, and extensive discussion among the 3 researchers, several themes emerged that captured the meaning of the women’s experiences. These themes, described below, reveal what it was like to breastfeed an infant with tongue-tie. Pseudonyms are used to preserve anonymity.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-0890334413479174" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Ten women, whose infants were between 3 days and 3 weeks old, participated. For 8 women, this was their first baby. Seven women had birthed their infants by normal vaginal delivery, 2 had ventouse extractions, and 1 had an elective cesarean section.</p>
<p>The themes that emerged from the analysis tell a common story of the expectations, challenges, disappointment, and frustrations that the women felt during the initial period when they started to breastfeed their infants. Consistent with hermeneutic phenomenology, the findings are presented within several themes.</p>
<sec id="section15-0890334413479174">
<title>Expectations</title>
<p>The theme <italic>Expectations</italic> describes the women’s breastfeeding intentions; all had planned to breastfeed and none had anticipated they would encounter problems that might prevent this. They were well informed, having read or heard that breastfeeding was the optimal way of feeding a baby, and believed it was very important for their child’s early development and growth. On this basis, they had determined this was what they were going to do. On the whole, because it is “natural,” they expected it would be easy to latch and breastfeed their baby. This is illustrated by Merri who stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t even think I would have trouble. I thought I would be able to just plonk her on and we’d be happy, but no. . . . I just thought that all babies would be able to breastfeed or I didn’t even think anything would go wrong, wouldn’t be able to breastfeed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As demonstrated in the following statement from Kim, formula feeding was not considered:
<disp-quote>
<p>I always wanted to breastfeed. There was . . . nothing else ever entered our mind. We didn’t even want to buy bottles because we were just so prepared to breastfeed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other mothers discussed how breast milk was superior to breast milk substitutes and this was why they wanted to breastfeed. The idea that breastfeeding was natural was common, but the women’s overriding concern was the welfare of their children, and they shared the conviction that breastfeeding provided nutritional and immune advantages and was therefore the best way of feeding a baby. This was very important to them and they appeared to link the two concepts, in the view that “natural was best.” As emphasized by Rosie, “You just think, well, it’s natural, it’s better for the baby.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0890334413479174">
<title>Something Is Wrong</title>
<p>This theme describes how the women’s breastfeeding experience started to unravel when unanticipated problems developed. Although the women were aware of problems, such as difficulties latching their babies to the breast and cracked nipples, they did not understand why they were happening. This is illustrated by Debbie:
<disp-quote>
<p>And I knew . . . I was having problems. . . . Feeding was hurting and they’d bleed. . . . In hospital I said to them that it had bled a little bit and they said that was OK as long as it was not pouring [excessive bleeding]. . . . I obviously had cracked nipples or that. But I didn’t really pick up on it until I got home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All persisted with breastfeeding, because this was what they wanted to do, but they kept encountering difficulties. This affected how they felt about breastfeeding, and many described the anticipatory dread they felt prior to breastfeeding due to pain they were experiencing. Kyra explained,<disp-quote>
<p>I ended up with cracked nipples, both sides, both very sore. . . . Sometimes it can take me up to half an hour to get the courage to get him on ’cause it hurts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some of the women, tongue-tie was identified prior to their presentation at the clinic. However, the expectation from the health care professional looking after them was that they should just keep trying to breastfeed, despite their pain and difficulties. Yet, as demonstrated in the following quote from Debbie, tongue-tie was not identified as the cause of breastfeeding difficulties:
<disp-quote>
<p>I knew there was an extra bit of skin and they couldn’t stick their tongue out . . . but I didn’t know it could affect feeding or anything like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0890334413479174">
<title>Questioning, Seeking Advice, No Real Answers</title>
<p>This theme describes how the women started to ask questions and seek advice about their breastfeeding difficulties. They wanted to have the breastfeeding relationship with their infant that they had imagined, and wanted to understand why they were having problems and how they could be fixed.</p>
<p>Debbie, a second time mother, developed cracked nipples soon after her son was born and told her private obstetrician about this while still in the hospital, but tongue-tie was not identified as a possible cause: “I’ve got cracked nipples and he said, ‘That’s fine—put pawpaw [papaya] ointment on it.’” Despite severe discomfort, she continued to breastfeed, with more problems developing. When breastfeeding was not working as expected, some women tried different ways to make it work, as described by Mary of her hospital experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, different times they couldn’t really get her to latch. On two occasions . . . they hand expressed some milk and used a syringe to feed . . . her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eventually, Mary was able to use a nipple shield to help with breastfeeding but was unable to latch her daughter directly onto the breast. All participants recalled asking for help. However, they often received different advice from different staff. Mary stated, “With the amount of different advice and instructions that we received, it was all really confusing.” Bonny, too, revealed her uncertainty: “In the hospital was weird ’cause every midwife had their own sort of way of dealing with it, so by the time you left the hospital I kinda just went by the last midwife.”</p>
<p>For some of the women, tongue-tie was identified by the nursing staff; however, it was rarely identified as a potential cause of breastfeeding problems. Mary was told that her baby had a tongue-tie but was advised not to seek any treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>A few people mentioned it but no one really said too much about it. Yeah, my pediatrician said that we would get advice that you should get it cut but he wouldn’t worry about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0890334413479174">
<title>Symptoms and Perseverance</title>
<p>This theme describes how the women continued to strive to achieve their goal of breastfeeding their infants despite increasing difficulties. Their stoicism is illustrated by Kim:
<disp-quote>
<p>I got very grazed nipples . . . even though he is attaching well now. It’s just not going away . . . sometimes his bottom lip still curls up and you know I grin and bear it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the often intense pain they were experiencing, the women persevered with breastfeeding. Rosie described her discomfort and her determination to succeed:
<disp-quote>
<p>Every time he sucked, it was like someone was sticking a pin into my nipple. . . . I think the nipples were so bad [because] I kept trying to feed him. . . . They weren’t improving, so after days of still struggling, still having pain . . . well, my mother and Rod [pseudonym] just said, “It’s not working. Stop! Get a rest!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The women’s sheer determination to succeed is illustrated by Kyra:
<disp-quote>
<p>The amount of tears I’ve shed, the crying that we’ve both had sitting there anxious, wound up. . . . It can take up to half an hour to latch . . . get up the courage to put him on and then you almost feel like you are shooting through the ceiling.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A common driving force for the women was their belief in the value of breastfeeding and the importance of breast milk. They continued trying to breastfeed despite the frustration they and their infants experienced, as described by Hilary:
<disp-quote>
<p>He would eventually get quite frustrated because I was struggling to get him on as well. . . . It might take me 4 times to calm him down and bring him back, and he’d get frustrated, calm him down, bring him back.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some women, breastfeeding difficulties affected relationships with their partners, as Anna described:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean, there’s some times I really resented him in going, you know, “You’ve got to put your breast this way,” ’cause it’s quite easy for him to say ’cause you’re not the actual one doing it. You know, you’ve got hot needles going through your nipple and, like, he just laughs and says, “Yeah, I know, I’m really sorry.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0890334413479174">
<title>Approaching the Wall—It’s All Too Much</title>
<p>This theme describes when the women reached a point where they felt they could not deal with any more breastfeeding difficulties. They had persevered despite pain with breastfeeding and difficulties latching their infants to the breast, yet breastfeeding had not turned out to be the natural process they had imagined, which was very distressing. The following quote from Debbie demonstrates the desperation they felt:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just started crying because . . . it was really painful. . . . I had just had enough . . . like, I can’t do this anymore. . . . I will never forget that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The women started to feel overwhelmed with all their difficulties and found they could not manage breastfeeding anymore. Mary revealed, “It just got really overwhelming and I started to get upset.” And Debbie described how she reached a breaking point:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was kinda like, I can’t do this anymore. Ross [pseudonym] said, “OK, we’ll get some formula the next day.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other mothers started to question themselves and ask if this was what they really wanted to do; breastfeeding had been much more difficult than anticipated. Kim began to question her ability to cope: “I started getting a little bit teary at one stage ’cause I was thinking I just don’t know whether, I can’t keep up with him.” They believed in the value of breastfeeding, however, they had gotten to the point where they could not take any more pain. Merri eventually resorted to formula feeding. She said,<disp-quote>
<p>I was really stressing out . . . really, really worried that she wasn’t feeding. . . . We got her tongue-tie snipped and I did breastfeed for a couple of days but she was still, like, uneasy and I felt like I wasn’t giving her much milk so I just gave her the bottle.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Merri’s breastfeeding experience made her feel inadequate as a mother. Her feelings, and her sense of failure, are summarized in her statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>My partner was saying that she [daughter] could feel the stress from me and so I was trying not to stress out. . . . I really wanted to breastfeed her and I thought that might bring us closer. . . . I thought I would be breastfeeding her right until she was 6 or something. . . . It feels like I’ve lost that bond with her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0890334413479174">
<title>Relief</title>
<p>This theme relates mostly to mothers whose infant had a frenotomy for tongue-tie. It describes the sense of relief for the women when tongue-tie was identified as the probable cause of their breastfeeding difficulties, with frenotomy providing resolution of pain with improvement in breastfeeding for some women. The realization that these difficulties were not due to something they had done wrong was uplifting for them. They now felt their problem could be fixed, their breastfeeding experience would improve, and they would start to enjoy being a mother again. Debbie was very emotional as she described how she felt after tongue-tie was identified:
<disp-quote>
<p>We went and got his tongue cut . . . and then pretty much from then everything has been fine. It doesn’t hurt like it did before . . . and it just feels normal. . . . My nipples have started to heal. . . . I think we are getting a better bond now because I am not scared of him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was a sense of urgency to treat the tongue-tie, as described by Anna:
<disp-quote>
<p>The lactation nurse actually spotted his tongue-tie and, oh gosh! So . . . basically, she got us an appointment straight away and we went down and got it done and he has been a different kid . . . and just latching on, which has been fantastic.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The profound sense of relief that the cause of their breastfeeding difficulties had been identified, that tongue-tie could be treated, and their difficulties would be resolved is apparent in the following quotes from Anna and Kyra:
<disp-quote>
<p>Like . . . this little dark cloud was over me and now it’s yeah . . . it’s 100%. . . . We’re both more confident in doing it. . . . I think too because your nipples aren’t as painful . . . it’s a lot easier now and . . . a better experience too.</p>
<p>It was sort of a relief. . . . There was something else that was causing the problems. It wasn’t just that we weren’t doing it right. . . . I know I have the milk, I knew that wasn’t a problem this time around, so it was something didn’t feel right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most women described the release from pain they felt after their infant’s tongue-tie had been separated. Rosie described, “I can feed without pins and needles and the anxiety within myself,” and Kim recalled,<disp-quote>
<p>As soon as we had it done, they . . . brought him in and said give him a quick feed. It was almost instant relief because he could attach so well afterwards.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section21-0890334413479174" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the women in this study being committed to breastfeeding, they found that breastfeeding an infant with tongue-tie led to disappointment and frustration, rather than the natural experience they had anticipated. A key finding was that tongue-tie was not always identified in the hospital by medical and nursing personnel. If identified, it was rarely linked to breastfeeding difficulties. One reason for this may be that many health professionals have limited knowledge surrounding tongue-tie and its potential effect on breastfeeding. This lack of knowledge had a significant effect on the women in this study, as they did not receive appropriate advice concerning their breastfeeding difficulties.</p>
<p>The women in this study were assured that it was normal to have breastfeeding problems such as sore and cracked nipples, as well as difficulties latching their infant to the breast. Their stories paint a picture of health professionals’ lack of knowledge about breastfeeding and tongue-tie. A recent UK prospective study examined tongue-tie and breastfeeding difficulties. Researchers concluded that assessment for tongue-tie should be integrated routinely into all neonatal checks, with immediate referral for tongue-tie separation if initial management of breastfeeding difficulties is unsuccessful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413479174">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order for breastfeeding to be successful, any problems the mother is experiencing should be identified early. The women in this study stated that they were having problems, including poor infant latch to the breast and pain with breastfeeding, but were not given appropriate advice and support, and tongue-tie was not identified as a possible cause. This is significant when prior research is considered. A prospective cohort study undertaken in Brazil examining factors associated with early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months found that poor latch was associated with increased risk of reduced duration of exclusive breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413479174">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The women in this study identified that they received conflicting advice in relation to their breastfeeding. Ongoing education of health professionals about normal breastfeeding processes would help reduce the amount of conflicting information that women receive. Until ordinary problems are recognized by health professionals, there is very little scope for referral for specialized problems to a lactation consultant. Breastfeeding difficulties should not be seen as a normal process, especially for women whose infants have tongue-tie.</p>
<p>Differences of opinion among health professionals concerning the management of tongue-tie were also identified by women in this study. This is not an unusual finding; previous research has identified and examined these differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413479174">14</xref></sup> A large survey among health professionals, examining beliefs, management, and treatment of tongue-tie, found significant differences of opinion concerning its management and treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413479174">21</xref></sup> Further education of health professionals would help inform them of potential difficulties that mothers may experience when breastfeeding an infant with tongue-tie.</p>
<p>In the clinical setting where the women in this study gave birth, there was no identified assessment or diagnostic tool for infants with tongue-tie and no “usual care” management or treatment processes available. A prior literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413479174">14</xref></sup> found that identification of an appropriate diagnostic tool and implementation of this into hospitals would help prevent some of the breastfeeding difficulties that women in this study experienced. Prompt management, through introduction of a service where tongue-tie could be separated while the infant is in the hospital, would also help reduce breastfeeding problems.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This research has some limitations. As with all qualitative research, findings are context dependent and should not be generalized in the traditional sense. However, theoretical generalization is possible, as the findings are relevant to other settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413479174">22</xref></sup> The interviews were conducted close to the events experienced by the women, minimizing recall difficulties.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Prior to this study, there had been no qualitative research undertaken to examine the effect of tongue-tie on the breastfeeding experiences of women in the immediate post-partum period. This study explored what it is like to breastfeed an infant with tongue-tie. Despite the women being committed to breastfeeding, they found that having an infant with tongue-tie did not initially transpire to be the natural experience they had anticipated. Health professionals had limited knowledge surrounding tongue-tie and its potential effect on breastfeeding, which had significant effects on women in this study, as they did not receive appropriate advice in regards to their breastfeeding difficulties. Early identification and prompt and appropriate management of tongue-tie, including frenotomy, would contribute to increasing breastfeeding rates, which are currently below Australian government targets.</p>
