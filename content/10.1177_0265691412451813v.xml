<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813v"><title>Enrique A. Sanabria, <italic>Republicanism and Anticlerical Nationalism in Spain</italic>, Palgrave Macmillan: Basingstoke, 2009, viii + 258 pp.; 9780230613317, £45.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This important work by Enrique A. Sanabria deals with two key areas in which there has been a wide-ranging revision over the past two decades. The first is the history of the Spanish Left, and the second the analysis of nationalism and national identity in modern Spain. In the first case, as against the traditional picture of a socially and cultural divided Left, with the workers linked to the revolutionary Anarchists and Socialists, and the Republicans backed by the urban middle classes, historians have more recently emphasized that leftist Republicans and workers’ associations shared overlapping social and cultural milieu, in which anticlericalism played the role of a bridge. With respect to nationalism and national identity, the focus on the rise of Basque and Catalan nationalism has given way to a broader concern regarding the extent to which in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the Spanish State – when compared to its western European counterparts – played an effective role in constructing the liberal Spanish nation.</p>
<p>Sanabria intervenes in both these areas of debate. Rather than focusing on the conservative liberals (who largely controlled the Spanish State between the mid-1830s and 1923), he analyses the nationalist discourse of left-wing Republicans between the 1880s and 1910s. He stresses that a key tool in the Republicans’ nationalist armoury was anticlericalism. Through the 1851 Concordat with the Vatican, the Spanish State reached a <italic>modus vivendi</italic> with the Church, even though the latter tended to see this as a marriage of convenience and maintained strong anti-liberal elements in its world view. Given the liberal-rationalist roots of their philosophy, the Republicans denounced the Church as holding back the modernization of the country by propagating outmoded ideas which were in conflict with modern science and philosophy. Furthermore, the regime was attacked for its complicity with the Church, which had allowed the latter to wax rich and powerful. These factors, they maintained, were at the root of what they perceived as Spain’s decadence. In Republican discourse anticlericalism and Spanish nationalism therefore became intertwined. Only a secular republic which would cut the Church down to size would, they argued, allow Spain to progress and join the western European mainstream.</p>
<p>Sanabria focuses, above all, on the figure of José Nakens, a Republican journalist who published the anticlerical weekly paper, <italic>El Motín</italic>, between 1881 and 1926 the year in which he died. He was originally a follower of the former army officer, Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, who aimed to overthrow the Restoration regime through a military coup. However, unlike the patrician Republican leaders of the 1860s and 1870s Nakens adopted a more plebeian, virulent anticlerical discourse, in connection with the new populist and radical Republicans who emerged in the 1890s, like Alejandro Lerroux and Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. These republicans certainly showed the greatest capacity to mobilize at the turn of the century, but Sanabria could perhaps have noted that there was a alternative federal Republican discourse which laid stress on political decentralization and cultural heterogeneity, a sector of which in Catalonia forged a liberal Catalan nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Sanabria’s analysis cannot be said to be totally new. However, no previous work matches its analytical richness. It is particularly good at placing Spain within its broader western European context. As he points out, the clerical/anticlerical divide was in no way unique to Spain. In all western European countries with a strong Catholic heritage, the secularization of society in the nineteenth century provoked a clerical reaction, which in turn stirred anticlerical agitation. Nevertheless, the political and cultural mix was different in Spain, with the Church in a notably more powerful position by the end of the century, and a particularly vociferous and radicalized anti-clerical movement.</p>
<p>Sanabria argues in this respect that the radicalism of the Republicans’ anticlerical message, by casting the Church in its entirety as the enemy, served further to polarize society. In addition, he maintains that anticlericalism was not a particularly effective way of spreading Spanish nationalism amongst the masses, given that many workers interpreted it as an attack on the Church’s privileged position but did not take on its more constructive nation-building component. This became clear during the anticlerical riots of Tragic Week, in which large numbers of Church buildings were burnt to the ground, and the fear provoked both militated against the use of anticlericalism as a tool by the more reforming sectors of the regime and also drove the military to the Right. This perhaps needs some qualification. During Tragic Week workers certainly believed that in attacking the Church they were undermining the regime and so opening the way to a secular republic (which even most committed Anarchists saw as infinitely preferable to the Restoration).</p>
<p>The book also contains a particularly illuminating chapter on the gendered language of Republican anticlericalism, in which Sanabria analyses the fear and loathing engendered in Republican circles by the Church’s influence over the country’s female population. Republicans adopted a bourgeois, patriarchal discourse, and saw the Church’s supposed hold over their womenfolk as both a threat to their authority in the home, and also as a roadblock thrown in the way of Spaniards’ cultural modernization. Sanabria is critical of this patriarchal language. On the other hand, in this the Republicans merely reflected what was at almost all levels still a deeply <italic>machista</italic> society (with women themselves in general, it seems, accepting patriarchal values), so new feminist perspectives were not likely to come from male political activists and would have been little understood by much of their base.</p>
<p>Overall then, Sanabría’s monograph represents a significant building block in our understanding of early twentieth-century Spanish republicanism. This is important for our broader understanding of modern Spain. During the Second Republic it was largely under republican auspices that an attempt was made to build a more modern secular state and spread liberal nationalist ideology, and such republican values played a significant role in building the new post-Francoist Spain. Hence, this work should provide the stimulus to more wide-ranging studies of the republican movement, in which its attempt to construct a modernizing alternative to oligarchic liberalism and traditional Catholicism would be at the centre of concern.</p>
