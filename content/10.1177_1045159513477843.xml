<abstract>
<p>Stories matter, and the stories we tell ourselves matter most. Truth has many layers and narrative helps us makes senses of our multilayered reality. We live a personal narrative that is grounded in our past experience, but embodied in our present. As such, it filters what we see and how we interpret events. Attachment theorists tell us our early experiences with caregivers flavor interactions with others; we engage, avoid, become overanxious, or behave inconsistently based on the story formed in childhood interactions. In other words, we can become stuck in a childhood story that no longer serves a survival purpose. Narrative psychologists report we can grow into a secure adult attachment mode by bringing new meaning to the old story. Thus, how we interpret those stories through retelling can help to heal the past. Adult learners bring their life stories into the classroom and the nature of those stories either enhance or impede learning. The purpose of this article is to share current research and practice in narrative psychology and critical theory, as applied to adult learners, and to suggest ways to bring healing through story retelling and story-editing processes within personal narrative papers. Adult learners bring new meaning to their life stories by (a) recognizing other stories as alternatives to the stuck story, (b) addressing the <italic>magic question</italic>, and (c) practicing multiple perspective taking. The facts do not change, but how learners view the facts makes a difference in how they embrace new learning challenges.</p>

<p>Everyone comes to the learning community with baggage. Sometimes the baggage impedes academic, social, and vocational growth. How can mentors and teachers facilitate the healing process through the age-old process of storytelling and story framing? The purpose of this article is to share current research and practice in narrative psychology and critical theory, as applied to adult learners, and to suggest ways to bring healing through story retelling and story-editing processes within personal narrative papers. Let’s begin with three stories.</p>
<p>I (lead author) chose my favorite jacket for the final interview. After flying in for one last round of questions with board representatives, I immediately sensed something was wrong. Formerly friendly search committee interviewers would not look me in the eye at breakfast. The board’s questions to me seemed perfunctory. Then, in a small group meeting, the director announced, “I’m sorry, but we’ve decided to extend our search . . . ” I was out. I never wore that jacket again. When I look at it, I feel a flash of pain.</p>
<p>Recently a friend shared the story of how she wrote poetry during her journey through an emergency hospitalization episode. She noted she cannot bring herself to write poetry again. To her, poetry equals pain.</p>
<p>Justin’s wife of 10 years died suddenly from a heart attack. Six months later, Justin died in a motorcycle accident. Known as the widowhood effect, losing a spouse increases mortality risk in the months and years following a spouse’s death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045159513477843">Martikainen &amp; Valkonen, 1996</xref>). Memories of shared experiences and thoughts of people we have lost cue pain, too.</p>
<p>In these three stories, a jacket, poetry, and a spouse are innocuous victims of what happened around them. However, they symbolize and can cue deep underlying pain that continues to shape lives. The events of our lives—the facts—do not change, but the <italic>interpretation</italic> of the events will hinder or help future growth. Viewpoint must change and viewpoint is housed within the stories we tell ourselves. When we become stuck in a personal harm-filled story, it rules our lives, predicts our actions, and keeps us from living our potential.</p>
<sec id="section1-1045159513477843">
<title>The Stories We Tell Ourselves</title>
<sec id="section2-1045159513477843">
<title>Harm Happens</title>
<p>The facts do not change as we remember the harm, but the way we interpret the facts can change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045159513477843">Siegel, 2012</xref>). Often, however, we live a story as if it cannot change. Attachment theorist, Mary Ainsworth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477843">Ainsworth, Blehar, Walters, &amp; Wall, 1978</xref>), proposes we develop one of four life-ruling stories based on early experiences with caregivers and these continue to inform our decisions throughout life. These include secure, avoidant, disorganized, and ambivalent attachment.</p>
<sec id="section3-1045159513477843">
<title>Secure Attachment</title>
<p>If your needs were taken care of with consistency and safety, you develop a secure attachment. Such early attachment prompts an engaged, relationship-oriented life, just what is needed to live respectfully in this world. In educational contexts, you are likely to welcome a challenge, stick with a task, and wisely use constructive criticism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1045159513477843">
<title>Avoidant Attachment</title>
<p>If your needs were ignored, you may develop an avoidant attachment. Such attachment moves you to flee what matters when the going gets tough and ignore the harm being done around you. As a learner, you are more likely to drop out of school, procrastinate, and shy away from group work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1045159513477843">
<title>Disorganized Attachment</title>
<p>If caregivers inconsistently met your needs, you <italic>can</italic> develop a disorganized or anxious attachment, which produces anxiety, fear, and clingy behavior that sucks the life from relationships and detracts from work and family success. You may get anxious in class when you do not understand the content or instructions and constantly seek instructor feedback.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1045159513477843">
<title>Ambivalent Attachment</title>
<p>If caregivers abused or used violence in the home, an ambivalent attachment can result, which can foster angry outbursts or risky behavior. You may be quick to blame others for personal failures and push people away when you do not trust them. Psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159513477843">Daniel Siegel (2010)</xref> notes we can <italic>earn</italic> a secure attachment later in life by intentionally designing a new framing story, one that challenges our avoidant, anxious, or disorganized thoughts. For example, abused children often blame themselves for causing the abuse. They tell themselves stories of how they incited the abuse with words or actions. With counselors, they learn no matter what they do as children, no one deserves to be abused. With that knowledge, they create a new framing story, one that affirms their goodness and right to be treated with respect. The new story can free them to engage life in healthier ways.</p>

<sec id="section7-1045159513477843">
<title>Stories Matter</title>
<p>Dominant life stories shape our past, present, and future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045159513477843">White, 1986</xref>). Every person carries painful stories into the learning context. When such stories become unhelpful, a critical lens can help us reconceptualize the source of power in our lives. Critical theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045159513477843">Michael Foucault (1980)</xref> proposes knowledge and power are inseparable and, thus, our collective and individual past and current stories must be mined for the power they wield in our lives. Narrative therapists use story as the vehicle for changing harmful ways of thinking, believing storytelling is a sense-making process that informs healthy identity formation and life work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477843">Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045159513477843">McAdams, 2004</xref>). Growth comes from remembering the locus of control within ourselves by first externalizing life problems and then discovering aspects of our lived experience that birth alternative stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159513477843">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>With many adult learners, beliefs housed in the stories they tell themselves must be discarded, reshaped, or transformed before learning can flourish. Simply avoiding the triggers that dredge up emotional baggage seems logical but may be impossible or unhealthy for some persons. For example, within the three introductory stories, not wearing a perfectly good jacket is trivial, but still wasteful; ignoring poetry limits the writer’s genre access; and sharing a lifetime with a spouse means even daily routines become reminders of the missing partner. Furthermore, we know depression and bipolar episodes seem to have multiple environmental triggers and we cannot always identify them, perhaps because they are ubiquitous in our daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159513477843">Siegel, 2010</xref>). Reducing the impact of beliefs, or transforming them in some way, is key to long-term healing. The task of healing, then, may lie in re-storying the goodness of the symbol itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045159513477843">McAdams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045159513477843">White &amp; Epston, 1990</xref>). What can educators learn from counselors and psychologists to redirect the framing stories that frame our lives?</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavior psychologists often pair a positive cue with a more negative cue—replacing one trigger with another or neutralizing the negative one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045159513477843">Hofmann, 2011</xref>). For example, holding hands with a loved one or looking at a picture of that person reduces the amount of physical pain experienced by the person. Also, body relaxation techniques, such as slow, deep breathing, seem to be incompatible with sustaining anxious thoughts and thus reduce them. By using gradual desensitization strategies that link <italic>good normal</italic> with a progressive introduction of the negative cue, phobias are reduced and a new norm re-visioned. An analogous process occurs in storytelling.</p>
<p>Educators are not therapists, but they know the power of story. Children clamor for stories as soon as they can talk and bedtime stories prompt calmness for good sleep. We cannot escape story because we live one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045159513477843">Witherell &amp; Noddings, 1991</xref>). Danish writer, Isak Dinesen (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159513477843">Parry &amp; Doan, 1994</xref>), observes “to be human is to have a story to tell” (p. 6). Even logic-driven scientists publish results in story-form. They set the stage with a report of what has already happened in their particular specialty through a <italic>literature review</italic> and then identify a problem or area of need in the <italic>introduction.</italic> A plot or plan of action forms via a <italic>design</italic> and the <italic>results</italic> become the resolution. The final scene is a <italic>discussion</italic> that points to new direction or insight.</p>
<p>Religions, too, have their stories of creation and acts of a divine being(s) that inform human acts in the present. Stories are ubiquitous and, as such, prime the best or worst in us; they offer strategies for problem solving and allow us to freely choose to accept or reject the ending. They provide a framework for understanding the world around us. We identify with certain characters and understand our experiences based on the stories we know. As such, story may be a natural means to healing. So, when our stories begin to harm us, it seems prudent to examine the nature of the stories we tell ourselves. In <italic>Story Re-Visions</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159513477843">Parry and Doan (1994)</xref> report “people do what they do because they are constrained from doing otherwise” (p. 17). How can we reduce the constraints of stuck stories that continue to rule lives in harmful ways?</p>

<title>Paths to Story Reframing</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045159513477843">Wang and Sarbo (2004)</xref> review multiple roles and philosophies present in adult education and propose a <italic>contextual philosophy</italic> motivating critical reflection in learners. Adult educators need to know the philosophies, needs, styles, motivation, and experiences of learners to teach for transformation. Hearing their life stories is both a means of understanding learners and a teaching tool. Drawing from narrative practice, three paths to story reframing are examined in this article: (a) recognize other stories as alternatives to the <italic>stuck story</italic>, (b) address the <italic>magic question</italic>, and (c) practice multiple perspective taking.</p>
<p>Within the first path, narrative therapists help clients remember positive, but related, stories in their lives that have taken a back seat to the stuck story—the one that holds the pain and anger. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045159513477843">Shelley Taylor (2002)</xref> of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) proposes we have two types of instincts within us: fight/flight and tend/befriend. The latter is largely unrecognized, but actually dominates in many families and communities. In times of stress and high negative arousal, people often turn to their families and friends to care and be cared for, not to fight or avoid them. Therefore, it is possible that healing could come by priming a tending and befriending instinct, rather than the fight/flight one. Discovering a related story of caring that neutralizes or changes the stuck story in some significant way helps break the rule of the old negative story. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045159513477843">Winslade and Williams (2012)</xref> use <italic>double listening</italic> to hear both the pain and promise within a story. Often the promise is couched in a <italic>but</italic> that follows a tale of harm. For example, an adult might share stories of bullying and then add, almost as an afterthought, “but I had a grandfather who thought I was the strongest person he ever knew.” The last phrase leads to a discussion of how the storyteller showed strengths then and now. Of course professional counseling is warranted in cases of abuse and trauma, but adult educators can encourage learners to re-vision their actions to include life-giving elements, thus shaping a healing path.</p>
<p>Attachment styles formed in childhood can be modified through story editing. Let us look at how an avoidant attachment story might interfere with learning and how an alternative story could invite a new approach. Procrastination is a learner’s nemesis. The implicit story we tell ourselves when faced with a complex task might read something like,<disp-quote>
<p>It’s good to delay an action if you don’t know exactly what to do because that’s what happened in my home when I was young. If I do something right now it won’t please anyone, so it’s best to do nothing until the heat is turned up. Then you get attention.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An alternative, competing story to tell might be,<disp-quote>
<p>I’m competent even though someone might not be affirming me right now. What I do now will pay off later. If I need help, I’ll ask for it right now. I remember a time when I finished a task on time and felt good about it just because I chose to do it on time.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The new story trumps the old one.</p>
<p>Our ability to imagine and project into the future also provides a path to healing. When we recognize stories of hope and moments of secure attachment in story, we connect them to what might be possible in our own lives. Counselors sometimes offer the <italic>miracle question</italic> to prime such memories and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477843">deShazer, 1988</xref>): “Imagine you woke up today and the issue was gone—how would you act? What would you think about?” Or, “Imagine a time before this happened—what did you do? What did you think about?” Then, “How are you currently doing some of what you’ve imagined? How could you do today or tomorrow more of what you have imagined? Could you do it from now on?” We answer these questions with stories that ultimately contribute to a new framing narrative that guides the future. For a person with an avoidant attachment story, the re-visioned responses might be<disp-quote>
<p>I am in charge of my life. I start right now and divide the project into smaller tasks taking an hour each day. I see myself finishing the project before it’s due. Then I go see a movie and visit my mother. I’d feel relaxed and proud of myself.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When an incident is viewed from <italic>multiple perspectives</italic>, new insight also emerges. What story would an outside observer tell in the situation? How might he or she see it differently than your story? What elements of their story might you include in your new story? What difference would this make in your life? Or, write about your story in third person and then notice what could be incorporated into your first-person story. With our procrastinator, another perspective story might sound like “I wonder what it’s like for my colleagues when I don’t meet deadlines? Do they worry that the job will never get done? Do they want to help but don’t know how?”</p>
<p>Another perspective-shaping strategy, offered by psychiatrist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045159513477843">Daniel Siegel (2010)</xref> in <italic>Mindsight</italic>, is the use of metaphor to encourage balanced thinking in troubled times. A procrastinator might use Siegel’s ocean metaphor with these thoughts,<disp-quote>
<p>I imagine myself as an ocean. At the deepest part I am very calm. When I look up from the depths of my calm place, I see the surface waves, the tsunami wave of a worrisome task that I’ve been avoiding. Now I see that task as one part of my current situation, but one that I, from my deep place, can view with an eye of care and an empowerment to keep the task in perspective. Working from my deep, quiet place, I see myself taking small steps to finish the task at hand.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The storm passes and you adapt because you calmly took on the task as just another part of your life. The ocean story becomes your story and primes you to face and solve problems from a wiser place. A barrier to learning and growing has been dismantled. Adult learners can increase their capacity by looking back, within self, and into the future.</p>
<p>How can this process be integrated into adult education? Many adult learning programs ask for personal narrative papers. From a critical theory perspective, mentors and educators could use these assignments to empower individuals to critique and change their thoughts, feelings, and actions. Learning is situated in a social and political context, and narrative inquiry can be a means to reconceptualize, reinterpret, and reanimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045159513477843">Kincheloe &amp; McLaren, 2005</xref>). The assignment, when framed within critical pedagogy, would attend to the personal, social, and historical influences that contributed to or detracted from their personal well-being. The adult educator’s role is to use inquiry to guide the writing process and provide feedback to invite clarity, challenge unsupported assumptions, and highlight evidence of changing perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477843">Conle, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Adult educators must provide a safe space for such story sharing. Writing, rather than telling, allows confidential disclosure and opportunity to reflect on the assigned guiding questions over time. The educator can also create trust by sharing his or her own lived experience story and responding to the guiding questions. A counselor or therapist can visit the class or be available for further conversation.</p>
<p>To begin, learners write a personal life story from their current perspective and then use guiding questions to examine and challenge aspects of the story that could be interpreted differently. The second viewpoint does not change what happened, but only how we look at it. Thus, the new story we tell ourselves reshapes how we view future events in our lives. The questions used to guide personal narratives help learners find alternative ways to frame painful events that may constrain their life work.</p>
<p>Narrative counselors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045159513477843">Parry and Doan (1994)</xref> offer a variety of invitation tools with sample questions to ignite the reframing process. The following draws heavily on their work in re-visioning narrative toward reshaping personal narratives:</p>
<list id="list1-1045159513477843" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What title would you give to the story you’ve written at this time in your life? What social forces influenced your choice of titles? What purpose did your story serve earlier in your life and what different purpose does it serve now? Is the current purpose meeting your current needs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can you see another version of your story that includes an opportunity for growth? What would be the title of that story?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How would you know when it is time to abandon some aspects of your old story? What signs of becoming ready for a new story would you need to see?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you could create two more versions of your story, what would they be? Create at least two new versions of the same events, perhaps by viewing it from another’s perspective. These stories should include interpretations and implications of the re-visioned events.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which version feels most life giving, most useful, because it leads to your desired outcome?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How could you now live your life <italic>as if</italic> this chosen story were true in your current context? What sort of new things could you imagine doing in your new story? If you pretended that you could do these actions, what would happen?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imagine acting out your reauthored story in front of a video camera. What would be captured in that movie? What sociocultural influences or supports would be present?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can you think of a time when you could have chosen the old story to guide you, but instead decided not to? What did you do instead?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can you think of a time when you reduced the old story, even though you didn’t escape it entirely? What happened in that process?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does triumph through this new story tell you about yourself?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Now that you find the new story more freeing and life giving, what do you think you will find yourself doing in the near future?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What will you do differently as a learner? How will your new story guide your educational path?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>By weaving storytelling and re-visioning into our adult learning programs, we can build capacity for learning and healthier communities. Adult educators would do well to use action research methods to assess the effectiveness of a narrative approach, and the guiding questions, within their unique contexts. Rubrics could be developed in consultation with therapists to guide and assess the learning process.</p>
<p>The story does not end here. Healthy stories need to be sustained with the same care given to creating them. They too need to be fed to flourish. We sustain and strengthen re-visioned stories by sharing them with others who need them, too. In the children’s book, <italic>Crow and Weasel</italic>, author <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045159513477843">Lopez (1990)</xref> writes,<disp-quote>
<p>Remember this one thing, the stories people tell have a way of taking care of them. If stories come to you, care for them. And learn to give them away where they are needed. Sometimes a person needs a story more than food to stay alive. That is why we put these stories in each other’s memories. This is how people care for themselves. (p. 54)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As we celebrate the freedom we achieve through story re-visioning, we strengthen the new story. If we share our new perspectives, we not only encourage others, but build our own capacity to adapt and grow.</p>
<p>In the end, old stories never really go away. Our past, which is always organized in story-form, shapes the present and thus rules the future. In a re-visioned story, the three symbols introduced in the first paragraph—jacket, poetry, and spouse—still carry a memory of loss, but now take their place within a larger story of success and sound relationships. In other words, a reauthored story provides a new, more encompassing framework that fosters trust, curiosity, and healthy relationships—sure signs of secure attachment and learning success. In the end, re-visioning our stories does not deny the truth of old stories. We honor their place within our larger story. We do not forgive and forget; we remember from a different place.</p>
