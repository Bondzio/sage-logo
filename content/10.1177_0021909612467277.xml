<abstract>
<p>Frantz Fanon, the Afro-French revolutionary and psychiatrist, developed a theory as to how and why the socially marginalized, the abused, the dregs of humanity, The Other!, eventually rose up in an attempt to reclaim their lost humanity. Fanon’s political writings dealt primarily with the colonial situation, the colonizer and the colonized and the question of race, especially as it unfolded in the Algerian war for independence (1954–62). <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is a Nigerian jihadist group that has engaged the Nigerian state in all-out warfare since 2009. We use Fanon’s concept of the ‘wretched’ to explain the emergence of <italic>Boko Haram</italic> in a post-colonial situation in which the issue of a ‘racial foreigner’ is completely irrelevant and, in so doing, argue for the continued relevance of Fanonist thinking.</p>

<title>Introduction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909612467277">2</xref></sup></title>
<p>In our post-colonial universe it is often claimed that Frantz Fanon has become irrelevant, that his understandings of the colonizer/colonized dichotomy, mediated by race and racism, are no longer relevant. The slaves have all been freed and the Other has returned to whence he came. It is a central argument of our work that one need not have a racially and geographically bifurcated society in order to see the continued relevance of Fanon’s thought. From how far away must the Other, he who comes from elsewhere and is absolutely unlike I am, originate? Must he come from across oceans, from a different continent, from a different ‘race,’ or may he originate from down the street, the next village, the same village?</p>
<p>We argue that Fanon’s entire concept of the wretched of the earth extends far beyond racially bifurcated societies. Just who were the wretched in Fanon’s mind? Written in the wake of the destruction of the Paris Commune in 1871, <italic>The Internationale</italic> became the anthem of the insurgent European, then the global working class movement. It opens ‘Debout, les damnes de la terrre’; ‘Rise up, ye wretched of the earth.’ While Fanon was clearly concerned with questions of race and colonialism, his theoretical understanding of the consequences of domination and subordination was much broader than a mere racial dichotomy. In France after the Commune, at the beginning of the Third Republic, both oppressor and oppressed were European.</p>
<p>Fanon was a revolutionary socialist, a committed internationalist who saw himself as part of a global anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, progressive, secular, socialist movement. <italic>Jama’atu Ahlis Sunnah Lidda’awati wal-Jihad</italic> (People for the Propagation of the Teachings of the Prophet and Jihad), popularly known as <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, is, on the other hand, traditionalist, exclusivist, millenarian and fanatically theocratic. Its conception of the future ideal society is a return to an entirely imagined, 7th century (CE) desert, Arab theocracy. Is this a Fanonist insurrection cum revolution? Hardly! At the same time, <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is an entirely logical and unsurprising consequence of, and response to, the same post-colonial society about which Fanon warned so presciently more than half a century ago. It is our argument that, within this broader understanding of Fanon’s work, the rise of a radical political Islam in northern Nigeria can be understood and analyzed. Here we are primarily interested in understanding and explaining where <italic>Boko Haram</italic> came from and why.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909612467277">3</xref></sup> In what sort of an economic, political, social and cultural environment does such a phenomenon gestate, emerge and grow? We think simply branding <italic>Boko Haram</italic> members as demonic terrorists, pre-occupied with a fanatic religious delirium as the Nigerian authorities have done, does not explain a great deal. Perhaps it tells us more about the nature of the Nigerian state and the predator class that dominates it than it does about <italic>Boko Haram</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section2-0021909612467277">
<title>Frantz Fanon</title>
<p>Beyond a rather narrow circle of French existentialist philosophers during the 50s, on the one hand, and a small Pan-Africanist intelligentsia, on the other, Frantz Fanon first became known internationally with the publication in 1961 of his <italic>magnum opus, The Wretched of the Earth</italic> and, especially, the translation of this work into English in 1965. For the most part it was ignored in France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909612467277">4</xref></sup> In English his work achieved an iconic status among an entire generation of 60s civil rights activists, black nationalists, new left radicals and third world revolutionaries. At the same time he was demonized by Western liberals scandalized by his scathing critique of Western civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909612467277">Hansen, 2011</xref>). Fanon thus became the personification of a blood curdling cry by the atavistic global black and brown masses against the imperiled redoubt of Euro-American civilization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909612467277">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fanon’s reputation as an avatar of bloody retribution was often achieved through a very selective reading of a few particularly incendiary passages from <italic>The Wretched of the Earth</italic>’s first chapter, ‘On Violence.’ A more careful and nuanced reading of that chapter would show that an overwhelming amount of the violence discussed and dissected by Fanon was, in fact, the <italic>institutionalized physical</italic> but, far more importantly, <italic>psychological</italic> violence inflicted systematically on the ‘native’ – the Algerian Muslim – by the French for more than a century in pursuit of their alleged <italic>mission civilisatrice</italic>. It was, however, these few widely misunderstood paragraphs (by both supporters and detractors) in which Fanon advocated a radical rejection (in the original sense of the word radical; a total, absolute uprooting) of, and resistance to, the subordination that was the lot of the colonized and, more broadly, any dominated class of people. That this could and did involve retributive physical violence was obvious. What was (and remains) so often ignored is that Fanon placed far greater emphasis and importance on the ‘violence’ he saw as necessary for the Subordinate to use on herself/himself in uprooting and casting out in a radical way the damage that had been done to her/his personality, to his/her psyche by years of subordination. ‘Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery! None but ourselves can free our minds,’ sang Bob Marley … and Fanon was deliberately and emphatically talking about self-redemption<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909612467277">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909612467277">Marley, 1979</xref>). The four substantive chapters of <italic>The Wretched</italic> – on violence, spontaneity, nationalism (here ‘religiosity’),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909612467277">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909612467277">Berman, 2012</xref>: 42) and culture – spell out how Fanon understood this process, using the Algerian insurrection in 1954 and subsequent war that continued until 1962 as the case study for his much larger argument.</p>
<p>The chapter on violence details the manner and mechanism by which the Dominant creates a society in which the Subordinate is abused and denigrated in multiple ways – most prominently on the psychological level – to such a degree that her/his very personality is threatened with destruction. The victim, the Subordinate, begins to accept her/his degradation as part of the natural order of things. She/he is, indeed, inferior, unworthy, without value. The Dominant seeks to establish in the Subordinate an acceptance of her/his inferior status, an utter lack of Hegelian ‘recognition,’ what John Stuart Mill referred to as a ‘willing slave.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909612467277">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the very edge of utter capitulation to the demands of the Dominant, a flicker of self-recognition occurs in the psyche of the Subordinate at which point he, spontaneously, begins to resist. In a revolutionary situation this spontaneity becomes all encompassing and is the topic of Fanon’s second chapter: ‘The Grandeur and Weakness of Spontaneity’ (‘Strengths and Weaknesses’)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909612467277">9</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>). The grandeur of spontaneity is that it reflects the mighty, exploding pent-up rage of the victims as they begin to purge (cleanse, detoxify?) themselves of their inferiority through acts of mental and physical resistance. Though admirable and glorious, this paroxysm of resistance is woefully inadequate in bringing about the desired end – liberation. This ‘weakness’ requires organization that can coordinate and channel this mighty torrent of rage.</p>
<p>In ‘The Trials and Tribulations of National Consciousness’ (‘Pitfalls of’) Fanon moves on to the next level and begins to dissect the organization he had previously indicated was necessary to turn the magnificent, though by itself insufficient, spontaneous resistance into a long-term threat capable of bringing about real systemic change. Fanon was clearly a dialectical thinker deeply influenced by both Hegel and Marx. Each synthesis produces its antithesis, the consequence of which must be resolved at a still higher level. In Fanon’s vision these dialectical contradictions will only be resolved when man moves beyond petty religiosity/nationalism into the realm of a universal humanism and humanistic consciousness: ‘For Europe, for ourselves and for humanity, comrades, we must make a new start, develop a new way of thinking, and endeavor to create a new man.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 239)</p>
<p>The demonstrable failure of most revolutionary third-world regimes (or even the non-revolutionary ones) to live up to the exaggerated expectations articulated by themselves and others in the period of emergent anti-colonial nationalism has often led to criticism of thinkers like Fanon as being naïve, romantic, utopian and, thus, simply out of touch with reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021909612467277">10</xref></sup> Algeria’s (National Liberation Front (FLN) clearly did not lead to a socialist paradise in which everyone, including women, were transformed and liberated. In fact, the FLN degenerated into a series of autocratic, mostly military regimes that quickly dispatched women back to their pre-revolutionary (well, not completely) roles as mere supplements to males. The Algerian <italic>wretched</italic> remained locked for decades in wretched conditions where they continue to exist to this day; no longer dominated by a racist French Other who comes from ‘elsewhere,’ but by fellow Algerian Muslims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021909612467277">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marie-Josephe (Josie) Fanon, Fanon’s French-born widow, continued to live in Algeria after her husband’s death in 1961 until she committed suicide in 1989. Shortly before her death, street riots by unemployed Algerian youth had broken out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909612467277">Tlemcani and Hansen, 1989</xref>). The security forces of the Algerian state cracked down brutally. These were not French security forces from ‘elsewhere’ brutalizing young Muslims. Watching these events from the balcony of her Algiers apartment, Josie Fanon is alleged to have told her friend, the writer, Aissa Djeber, over the phone, ‘Once more, oh Frantz, the wretched of the earth.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909612467277">Djeber, 2003</xref>: 92) These spontaneous street demonstrations in Algiers gave birth to several militant Islamist organizations including the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) which engendered the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the Salafist Group (GSPC) and, eventually, Al-Qaida of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) which, it would appear, might have contacts with various radical Islamist groups in northern Nigeria, including <italic>Boko Haram</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021909612467277">12</xref></sup> Where secular nationalism and socialism were seen as the guiding principles of earlier revolutionary periods, more recent upheavals have sought salvation in religious mysticism as alternatives to the decadent modern state and society<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021909612467277">13</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909612467277">Berman, 2012</xref>: 11). ‘Religious suffering,’ observed Marx more than 150 years ago, ‘is at the same time an expression of real suffering and <italic>a protest against real suffering</italic>’ (Marx in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909612467277">Tucker, 1978</xref>: 54).</p>

<title>Fanon and Post-colonial Nigeria</title>
<p>In a famous passage at the very beginning of the chapter ‘On Violence,’ Fanon vividly captures the nature of the bifurcated colonial city:<disp-quote>
<p>The ‘native’ sector is not complementary to the European sector … Governed by a purely Aristotelian logic, they follow the dictates of mutual exclusion. The colonist’s sector is a sector built to last, all stone and steel. It’s a sector of lights and paved roads, where the trashcans overflow with strange and wonderful garbage, undreamed of leftovers. The colonist’s feet can never be glimpsed … They are protected by solid shoes in a sector where the streets are clean and smooth, without a pothole, without a stone. The colonist’s sector is a sated, sluggish sector, its belly permanently full of good things. The colonist’s sector is a white folks’ sector, a sector of foreigners.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contrast this with the ‘native’ sector:<disp-quote>
<p>… the ‘native’ quarters, the shanty towns, the Medina, the reservation, is a disreputable place inhabited by disreputable people. You are born anywhere, anyhow. You die anywhere, from anything. It’s a world with no space, people are piled one on top of the other, the shacks squeezed tightly together. The colonized’s sector is a famished sector, hungry for bread, meat, shoes, coal, light. The colonized sector is a sector that crouches and cowers, it’s a sector on its knees … It’s a sector of niggers, of towelheads [‘dirty Arabs’ in the Farrington translation]. The gaze that the colonized subject casts at the colonist’s sector is a look of lust, a look of envy … The colonized man is an envious man. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 4, 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Remove the words ‘colonist’ and ‘colonized’; remove the words ‘white folks, foreigners’ and replace them with rich (black) people and you could be – you would be – describing any bifurcated post-colonial city in Nigeria and many other places in Africa as well. If one wanted to find an accurate description of modern Lagos one could not find a better one than that of Engels describing an all-white working class Manchester in the 1840s:<disp-quote>
<p>In one of these courts there stands directly at the entrance … a privy without a door, so dirty that the inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through foul pools of urine and excrement … the only entrance to most of these houses is by means of narrow, dirty stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth. (Engels in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909612467277">Tucker, 1978</xref>: 580, 581)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This and the following pages describe unspeakable Dickensian squalor and misery in mid-19th century industrial Manchester. Lagos, Kano and Maiduguri are overflowing today with these veritable heaps of wretched humanity where ‘…people are piled on top of the other.’ Surrounded by this sea of human misery are high walls topped with razor wire and massive metal gates that open occasionally to allow the privileged to enter or leave safely ensconced in their massive Range Rovers, Mercedes or Land Cruisers accompanied by armed retainers. The briefly opened gates reveal space – sheer unoccupied, open space – with palatial homes surrounded by grassy lawns and meticulously cared-for gardens with lush flowers. The mango and papaya trees stretch lazily in the sun and soar over the tops of the walls to give a tantalizing hint to the <italic>wretched</italic> outsider of what fantastic green treasures lie within. These walled fortresses have armed and uniformed guards making sure that only the privileged are permitted inside this <italic>sanctum sanctorum</italic>. The wretched often congregate near the front gate to beg for scraps from ‘their betters.’ Pass by the now-closed iron gates and one is again confronted with heaps of destitute humanity. The wretched of the earth lived in all-white Manchester in 1844 and live in all (mostly) black Lagos, Kano and Maiduguri today. Domination and subordination may be racially segmented or they may not be. The phenomenon remains essentially the same, despite the racial character of either the Dominant or the Subordinate. Fanon, in fact, appears to have realized precisely this when he wrote: ‘You are rich because you are white, you are white because you are rich.’ The cause, suggests Fanon, is the consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Nigeria is often described as Africa’s ‘Troubled Giant.’ Vast and comprehensive corruption, graft and venality at all levels of the Nigerian government have been well-documented for decades. Even the return to ‘democratic rule’ (itself more of an illusion than a fact) in 1999 has not fundamentally altered that reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021909612467277">14</xref></sup> The late military regimes – those of Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha – featured some of the great thieves of modern history but both men, for example, remain honored by having major thoroughfares in the capital Abuja named after them. Olabode George, the former head of the Nigerian Ports Authority and the only major political figure actually to be convicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after a trial, was released from prison after a nominal confinement to be greeted as a persecuted but conquering hero by the leadership of the governing (from 1999 to the present) People’s Democratic Party (PDP).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021909612467277">15</xref></sup> Unfortunately, civilian-led, supposedly democratic governments have changed very little in the practice of venality on a grand scale that has long characterized Nigerian politics. Since 1999 alone an estimated US$380 billion has been squandered and stolen by the predator class that dominates the Nigerian state and ‘Endemic corruption has continued since then … corruption is at the heart of Nigeria’s most serious human rights problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909612467277">Human Rights Watch, 2011</xref>: 6, 7). It is also at the heart of the conditions of misery and impoverishment that have led to the rise of anti-systemic groupings in Nigeria of which <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is currently the most important, the most violent and the most feared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021909612467277">
<title>Boko Haram</title>
<p>The group made its first public appearance at the very end of 2003 when it was involved in a dispute with the police that turned violent in the small village of Kanama on the Niger border in Yobe State. It appears that a faction had left their original center in Maiduguri with the intention of emulating the original <italic>Hijra</italic> of 622 (CE) by withdrawing from a modern society characterized by corruption and apostasy and living communally under a strict <italic>shari’a</italic> regimen. This group was referred to colloquially as the ‘Taliban’ and was led by a Muhammad Alli (perhaps Ali or Lawal); not Muhammad Yusuf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909612467277">Muhammad, 2010</xref>: 27; Salkida, <italic>Genesis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612467277">Walker, 2012</xref>: 3). Whether the dispute was in response to repeated military/police harassment is not clear although, given the history and aggressive nature of the Nigerian police, such would not be an unreasonable question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909612467277">Amnesty International, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909612467277">OSI Justice Initiative, 2010</xref>). It appears that the ‘Taliban’ were able to seize some police weapons after which they holed up in their mosque which was laid siege by the police. The consequence was the death of most of the ‘Taliban’ members (around 70 people) including Muhammad Alli. The logical question is whether they were actually defending themselves from a police attack. There were more raids, fighting and killings in 2004 in various places in the northeast, after which there was a four-year hiatus of relative quiet (2005–2008) in which <italic>Boko Haram</italic> re-organized and re-grouped (<italic>IRIN News</italic>, 7 October 2011).</p>
<p>The group irrupted violently and rudely into the Nigerian national consciousness in late July 2009 when it attacked several police stations and prisons in Bauchi, Yobe and Borno states, all in the far northeast of the country. The purpose of the onslaught, according to <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, was to free hundreds of its members from prisons where they had been arbitrarily detained by the Nigerian police force (NPF) without trial. These attacks were accompanied by pitched gun battles resulting in numerous deaths. Several days later the special, paramilitary combat units of the NPF, along with elements of the army, mounted a coordinated attack on <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s main compound in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Upwards of 800 people, including family members (noncombatants) living in the compound, were killed in the attacks. Muhammad Yusuf, the group’s leader, was captured by an army unit which turned him over to the NPF in good physical condition as was shown on numerous photographs and news videos. Several hours later, the bullet-riddled body of Yusuf was filmed lying on the ground in a Maiduguri police compound. The NPF announced that he had been killed while trying to escape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021909612467277">16</xref></sup> Several days later Yusuf’s father-in-law, Ba’a Fugu Muhammad, also a leader, turned himself in to the NPF when he heard they were looking for him. He never left custody alive. The Nigerian government defended its actions as being legally and ethically justified as the attacks by <italic>Boko Haram</italic> on its institutions – notably the NPF – had been entirely unprovoked. This assertion is widely disputed, not only by <italic>Boko Haram</italic> members themselves, but also by independent observers and even some of its critics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021909612467277">17</xref></sup> Shehu Sani has argued, in fact, that <italic>Boko Haram</italic> under Muhammad Yusuf was not violent prior to 2009 when the ‘unprovoked killing of its leader’ and continuous jailing of its members caused violent retaliation (Oditta, 28 January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909612467277">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the Nigerian government announced in summer 2009 that the ‘terrorist’ organization had been crushed, <italic>Boko Haram</italic> struck back with a vengeance in September 2010. The nature of <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s organizational structure is murky at best. Walker notes that its cell-like structure leads to independent actions on the part of its various units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909612467277">Walker, June 2012</xref>: 1). Whether this entails actual splits in the organization, it’s difficult to say. It would appear, however, to have developed separate factions after the murder of its leader, Muhammad Yusuf, with each pursuing different agendas. One faction, at least, appeared to be ready to enter into negotiations with the government. In September 2011 the former Nigerian president, Olesugun Obasanjo, met with members of the slain Yusuf’s family. The meeting was mediated by the Nigerian civil rights activist, Shehu Sani, and apparently included a discussion of compensation for the killings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021909612467277">18</xref></sup> Several days later Muhammad Yusuf’s brother-in-law, Babakura Fugu, was himself assassinated, apparently by a separate <italic>Boko Haram</italic> faction that objected to his attempt to speak and negotiate for the group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021909612467277">19</xref></sup> In early March 2012 two kidnapped European hostages were killed in Sokoto during a failed rescue attempt carried out by a joint British-Nigerian team. The BBC reported that British anti-terrorist officials speculate that this event reflects the possible influence of AQIM, which has kidnapped Western hostages in the past, on one <italic>Boko Haram</italic> faction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021909612467277">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Located in the ‘Fanonist context,’ as explained earlier, we attempt to understand this growing <italic>Boko Haram</italic> phenomenon that has both mesmerized and terrorized Nigeria over the past several years. The predatory Nigerian state class has been forced to recognize that the group has become far more than an annoyance, but instead constitutes a serious threat to the continued capacity of that class to pillage and loot with impunity. Can the impoverished and desperate people of northern Nigeria – especially young, unemployed, males devoid of any meaningful future – who are attracted to a ‘liberatory message,’ however delusional it may seem to rationalist, secular intellectuals, be said to constitute a <italic>wretched of the earth</italic>? <italic>Boko Haram</italic> argues that the modern, secular (Western, non-Islamic?), democratic state in which so much hope has been vested and in whose name so many promises have been made (and broken), has failed the people of Nigeria. <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s anger and resentment is especially directed at the corrupt and venal Muslim ruling political class in the north whom they view as apostates. Western secular democracy is seen as a grotesque illusion creating a narrow class of unconscionably bloated, consumption-addicted plutocrats perched atop the vast majority that is forced to live in grinding poverty and squalor while watching as the national patrimony is looted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021909612467277">21</xref></sup> This is not an argument that is easily refuted. Aside from the supernatural promises and expectations regarding the hereafter made by most religiously inspired groups, <italic>Boko Haram</italic> would seem to be promoting a more mundane immediate solution to the problems of modern Nigeria. While there are definitely religious, sacred and transcendental implications to this, it seems to be essentially a secular and mundane solution to a secular and mundane problem.</p>
<p>At first glance this may sound contradictory! Is <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s millenarian vision a ‘mundane’ solution? We make this claim for the following reason: without going into any individual theologies, but referencing primarily the Abrahamic religions, all of them claim an afterlife in union with God as being the reward for following God/Allah’s dictates during one’s terrestrial journey. Judaism, Christianity and Islam have all contained historically esoteric, fundamentalist movements that have eschewed politics – indeed, part or even all of the external world – in favor of contemplation and prayer in the expectation of eventual paradise. <italic>Boko Haram</italic> does not ignore this afterlife reward, but its primary effort would appear to be waging a war against the modern mundane (blasphemous?) state with the intention of replacing it with something modeled after their interpretation of the early Islamic society established by the Prophet in the 7th century (CE). Dr Aliyu Tilde, a close Nigerian observer of <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, has argued that the key to understanding the group is its dedication to these principles and a desire to re-create in northern Nigeria a society that replicates that of the first three generations of Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021909612467277">22</xref></sup> Any deviation from this pristine model, even by a Muslim government, constitutes something akin to blasphemy.</p>
<p>It appears the name <italic>Boko Haram</italic> was attached initially to <italic>Jama’atu Ahlis Sunnah Lidda’awati Wal Jihad</italic> by the media as a jocular reference to their complete antipathy to the state-run educational system. The name caught on with the public and became the accepted terminology, so much so that few people know that is not the reference they use for themselves. <italic>Boko</italic> is a widely used, derogatory popular reference to the public school system. The etymology of <italic>boko haram</italic> would appear to be in some dispute and different explanations abound. The most common, the one that appears regularly in the press, is that the two words should be translated as ‘Western education is forbidden.’ According to Aliyu Tilde, in classical Hausa the term <italic>boko</italic> has to do with deceit or deception and had come to refer to something that is fake as in <italic>amaryar boko</italic>, the ‘fake bride’ customary in some traditional Hausa weddings. Tilde goes on to write: ‘So, when Western education came to Hausaland, the learned rejected it and gave it a derogatory connotation, <italic>ilimin boko</italic>, “fake education.” Sadly this name has remained the standard translation of “Western education” among all Hausa speaking people of West Africa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909612467277">Tilde, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909612467277">Muhammad, 2010</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>What is referred to as Western education has long been a contentious issue in Nigeria and, in an indirect way, can be said to be at the basis of many of the ethno-religious tensions in the country. Brought first by the slave trade and much more emphatically by colonialism, Western education, along with the English language, first appeared in what is today Nigeria among the ethno-national groups of the south: Yoruba, Ijaw, Efik, Igbo, and so on. In the colonial onslaught the ‘traditional’ religions practiced by these southern peoples gave way rather quickly to Christianity and to the English language. It soon became obvious that the way to prosper under the new dispensation was to adopt wholesale the colonialists’ language, religion, culture and learning. Mission schools quickly spread the new way of life and the people adopting it became positioned to take advantage of multiple new opportunities.</p>
<p>When the colonial wave reached the north in the late 19th century to occupy the old Sokoto Caliphate it was met by long-established Islamic societies far better equipped culturally to resist the foreign influences. They met immediate resistance from many of the Caliphate’s religious figures – the <italic>ulama</italic> – who objected to the British attempt to impose their own ways of doing things upon the population; ways the <italic>ulama</italic> considered to be ‘false’ (that is to say <italic>boko</italic>) from the point of view of the <italic>Qur’an</italic>. Aware that their positions of power and influence within traditional Hausa society were going to be threatened by these ‘new ways,’ it is also true that the <italic>ulama</italic> opposed the new forms of modern education out of self-interest.</p>
<p>The British began establishing schools and jettisoned the old <italic>ajami</italic> (Hausa written in the Arabic script) system that had served for centuries as the regional vehicle of communication for literature, poetry, commentary and personal communications along with royal and legal rulings. Beginning around 1910, the British imposed the adoption of the Latin script that is used to this day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909612467277">Aliyu Musa, 2010</xref>). This led, not without reason, to suspicions that young Muslims were being taught in this incomprehensible script false, theologically suspect ideas designed to convert them to Christianity. <italic>Ulama</italic> conservatives began to reject Western education altogether as contradictory to the <italic>Qur’an</italic> and, therefore, deceitful and fake. These forces resisted school education (first secular British and, after independence, secular Nigerian) in many parts of northern Nigeria until well into the 80s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021909612467277">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The result was that Western ways, including education, made far more headway and penetrated local society far more thoroughly among the southerners than in the north. Aliyu Tilde is scathing in his analysis while describing a culture that is deeply conservative and resistant to change:<disp-quote>
<p>So glaring is our <italic>Boko Haram</italic> attitude that many state governments recently preferred to import farmers from southern Africa and support them with free land … and heavy subsidies … Our general contempt for knowledge is outstanding, making us to prefer ignorance as a companion … Our entire political ethos is built on ignorance such that hardly would anyone succeed except if he is ready to put aside the correct thing he knows and behave as, or obey, the ordinary or ignorant who has never [seen] the four walls of a high school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021909612467277">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909612467277">Tilde, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is widely accepted throughout Nigeria that southerners are far better educated than northerners and, therefore, far better prepared to compete in the modern world. It was common in the 60s for Muslim children to refuse to go to Nigerian schools on the grounds that what they would learn was <italic>boko</italic> and to harass those children who did attend the schools by chanting:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Yan makarantar bokoko/Ba karatu ba Sallah/Ba’ a bin hanyar Allah/Sai yawan zagin Malam</italic>. [Children of Western schools/You neither study nor pray/You don’t follow God’s path/You only abuse your teachers].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021909612467277">25</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such resistance continues in the present and is justified by the palpable failure of the modern Nigerian state to deliver on the promises made to the Nigerian people. Many northerners who have received a Western education have been unable to find jobs and have, therefore, provided eager recruits for militant, anti-systemic organizations such as <italic>Boko Haram</italic>. In fact, much of the leadership would appear to come from a partially educated, completely disillusioned and thoroughly alienated youth (Salkida, <italic>Religious Fundamentalism and Militarism</italic>).</p>
<p>A perfectly legitimate question is to ask ‘What is the point of a modern, secular education?’ if there are no jobs to employ people when they have completed their schooling. Poverty, unemployment, crime, disease, theft of the national patrimony, corruption, ostentatious consumption by the predator rich and other forms of social degeneration are the legacy of the secular state after a half century of independence. It is no longer acceptable to the Nigerian people to explain Nigerian backwardness and poverty in terms of the ‘evils of colonialism’ – an argument that Fanon would have understood all too well. As has been noted earlier, northern Nigeria is among the more backward and poverty-stricken areas in the world.</p>
<p>Ironically, Maiduguri has been well known in the Islamic world for centuries as an educational center famed for its madrassahs and Islamic learning. There are 5,000 religious schools registered in Borno State, with most of them in Maiduguri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909612467277">Knaup, 3 March 2012</xref>). Parents from surrounding areas, including Chad, Cameroun and Niger and even further afield, send their young children to these schools, sometimes children as young as five and six. Often from very poor families, these children cannot afford any tuition and thus must survive on their own. This comes down, ultimately, to begging and young beggars flood the streets of Maiduguri, especially in the areas around large mosques. The word <italic>almajiri</italic> initially referred to these youngsters: religious students at the various madrassahs. Over the years the word began to acquire a second meaning: beggar. Since young madrassah students crowded the streets of the city with their ubiquitous plastic bowls pleading for food money, the two terms merged. It is these religiously inspired youngsters, devoid of any income or education other than <italic>Qu’ranic</italic> memorization and no future to speak of, who provide a fertile recruiting base for groups such as <italic>Boko Haram</italic>. Referring to Muhammad Yusuf and <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, Ahmed Salkida, who had close contact with the murdered leader, has written, ‘His followers are in their hundreds of thousands, most of them <italic>almajiris</italic>, school dropouts, renegade civil servants and parliamentary staff’ (Salkida, <italic>Good Governance</italic>).</p>
<p>Salkida claims he never heard Yusuf say that all education, or even all Western education, was <italic>boko</italic> and, therefore, <italic>haram</italic>. Instead, he argues Yusuf only condemned teachings that were contrary to the <italic>Qur’an</italic> as, of course, interpreted by Yusuf. This may be so excessive a fine point as to be irrelevant. Nevertheless, he goes on to say, Yusuf had plans to start schools, a hospital and markets to go along with <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s already successfully functioning micro-finance scheme (Salkida, <italic>Good Governance</italic>). These sorts of programs, of course, are perfectly reasonable but it is clear that, in beginning, to implement them <italic>Boko Haram</italic> was standing in for the secular state and usurping its functions: social services the state was either unwilling or unable to deliver to the impoverished masses. The logical next step is to ask: if the modern state is unwilling or unable to fulfill its declared functions, what is its purpose, its justification? The conclusion intrudes: abolish it, overthrow it.</p>
<p>Originally, it seems, the people of Maiduguri sympathized with <italic>Boko Haram</italic> and its ‘pro-poor’ policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021909612467277">27</xref></sup> <italic>Boko Haram</italic> had begun social programs endeavoring actually to help the impoverished, the indigent – something completely foreign to Nigerian public policy. <italic>Boko Haram</italic>’s rhetoric was populist in that it defended the common man against the rapacious depredations of the rich as represented by the state itself. Borno State was governed then by Ali Modu Sheriff, who was (and remains) widely reviled as a violent, barely literate brute whose manner of dealing with his enemies was having them murdered by a gang of paramilitary goons in his employ called ‘ECOMOG.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021909612467277">28</xref></sup> One of Sheriff’s favorite ploys was driving through shantytowns with his entourage and tossing handfuls of cash out the car window and watching with glee as the impoverished residents fought each other for a pitifully few naira.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021909612467277">29</xref></sup> Similarities and coincidences! Fanon reported he was in Oran in 1944 as a young Free French soldier preparing to take part in the invasion of southern Europe, when he and his Antillean colleagues witnessed French sailors throwing table scraps from the ship’s deck to the dock below and laughing as the starving Algerian children savaged each other for a bite to eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 231).</p>
<p>Met with stiff resistance by <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, the security forces began running amok.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021909612467277">30</xref></sup> <italic>Boko Haram</italic> would recruit unemployed young men between the ages of 15 and 35 and promise them a good life, not only in the hereafter but in the here and now if they would fight against the apostate state and help overthrow it. In this war zone, the security forces were by far the most feared. They were wont to enter neighborhoods said to be inhabited by civilians sympathetic to <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, cordon it off and begin indiscriminately shooting people, looting their shops and burning down their homes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021909612467277">31</xref></sup> A doctor in the emergency room at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital was treating a wounded officer for a gunshot wound when he heard his patient order his men to, ‘Kill them all. Just shoot everyone.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021909612467277">32</xref></sup> It was not uncommon for the forces of the state to pursue a fleeing citizen into his house and simply gun him down in front of his family. Gun fights could be heard at all hours. The consequence of this running urban warfare was that entire neigborhoods were emptied of their residents; tens of thousands fled to safe areas in other cities. The security forces – the police and the army – became the focus of intense hatred on the part of the people of Maiduguri, a hatred that exists to this day.</p>
<p>Nigerian authorities try to blame everything from global warming and HIV/AIDS to bank robberies, kidnappings and squabbles between neighbors, to post-election violence on <italic>Boko Haram</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021909612467277">33</xref></sup> – anything to deflect scrutiny from their own malfeasance, culpability and venality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021909612467277">34</xref></sup> <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is hardly ubiquitous, but it does seem to be a movement of growing anti-systemic importance. Normally <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is viewed by the Nigerian state (publically at least) as well as most of the media as a more or less monolithic organization with a unified leadership. Furthermore, for different reasons, both the Nigerian state and the international media like to suggest that <italic>Boko Haram</italic> has ‘links with’ a variety of international groups such as AQIM and Al-Shabab associated with a radical, jihadist Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021909612467277">35</xref></sup> Exactly what is meant by ‘links and contacts with’ is never defined. These groups are claimed to be part of a shadowy international terrorist network to which the United States and its allies, having vanquished global communism, have turned their attention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021909612467277">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Nigerian state authorities thus have a singular view of <italic>Boko Haram</italic>. They are terrorists pure and simple and can only be dealt with in that way: with murderous overwhelming force. Political solutions brought about through compromise, discussion and negotiation are not typical of Nigerian politics. Instead, in the words of Human Rights Watch, politics in Nigeria ‘more resemble(s) criminal activity than democratic governance’ (Human Rights Watch, 2007: 1). In the words of Olly Owen, they feature a ‘thuggish, winner takes all’ attitude in which the winner totally decimates the loser and, of course, takes home the spoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909612467277">Owen, 2012</xref>). The instinct to employ overwhelming force with its attendant ‘collateral damage’ alienates even more the non-combatant population. Writing on the op-ed page of the <italic>New York Times</italic>, the former American ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, made precisely this point. <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is a ‘political’ issue that demands a political solution but, as he suggests, such a solution is unlikely because it would require a ‘restructuring of Nigerian politics,’ a prospect that would threaten the viability of the entire political system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021909612467277">37</xref></sup> Government terminology reflects its contempt for <italic>Boko Haram</italic> and, in fact, all dissident groups. <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is labeled terrorist and religious fanatics as well as a laundry list of names such as vermin, rats and other sub-human forms that need to be – will be – exterminated as the vermin they are by the forces of law and order. Fanon made a similar observation indicating the way in which the colonizer used ‘zoological’ terms to describe the native, the wretched; ‘slithery movements … the hordes, the stink, the swarming, the seething and the gesticulations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909612467277">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 7). The state claimed triumphantly after Yusuf’s execution that <italic>Boko Haram</italic> had been stamped out; that is, until it reappeared with a vengeance slightly more than a year later with what seemed a new <italic>modus operandi</italic>. By then the Nigerian state seemed confused, now confronted with a full-fledged, well organized, anti-systemic terrorist organization prepared to go to extreme lengths to bring down the state.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fanon has been seen by many to be a child of his time and <italic>only</italic> of his time; relevant to a particular period and a particular set of historical circumstances but no longer a thinker whose words have any import. One could suggest that he is in good company. How many times in the past century-plus has Marx been declared dead only to rear his shaggy head yet one more time? Fanon clearly was a man of his time and was emphatic in insisting on that. A creature of racism and colonialism, it is clear that his entire consciousness was formed by that experience. David Caute, one of his earliest biographers wrote: ‘Marx was created by capitalism, Garibaldi by Sicilian poverty, Lenin by the Russian aristocracy, Gandhi by British imperialism. Fanon was created by the white man’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909612467277">Caute, 1970</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>We argue, however, that Fanon, admittedly couched in terms of race and colonialism, transcended his particular time and place and articulated a ‘universalist’ argument. As mentioned in the introduction, his choice of a title for his testament work could neither have been accidental nor coincidental. Yes, he was reminding European radicals that not merely the European working class constituted the wretched of the earth in <italic>The Internationale</italic>, but he was also going beyond that sort of specificity. He speaks of ‘humanity’ in general, not black or Algerian or African or colonial humanity. As long as there are wretched people forced to survive in wretched conditions, as long as there are two ‘species’ of mankind, one that dominates and abuses and one who must accept that domination and abuse, Fanon will remain relevant.</p>
<p>The vision of a post-revolutionary society cherished by <italic>Boko Haram</italic> is significantly different from anything that Fanon could possibly have envisioned. The <italic>Boko Haram</italic> of this essay has been the <italic>Boko Haram</italic> of the spontaneous explosion of rage and desperation that led to its birth a decade ago; a period theorized by Fanon in his discussion of violence in chapter 1. Without the advantage of years of hindsight, we suggest that this period ended with the police attack on the <italic>Boko Haram</italic> compound in 2009 that ended with nearly one thousand dead and the execution of its leader, Muhammad Yusuf. It would seem that the surviving inner core determined that spontaneity itself was insufficient, fraught with weakness as it were, and a far more aggressive organization and strategy was needed. Where that might lead <italic>Boko Haram</italic> in the future we are unable to say.</p>
<p>That should not prevent us from using Fanon’s insights to understand such phenomena. In the case of <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, we would replace ‘national’ with ‘religious’ consciousness. Religion, like nationalism, is an identity that can supersede all others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909612467277">Berman, 2012</xref>: 42). Nigerian national identity has long been extremely fragile. In some areas ethnic identities predominate. In northern Nigeria religious identities have replaced ethno-national ones as the focus of ultimate loyalty. As FIS and its various descendents emerged from a spontaneously combustible situation in Algeria, so has <italic>Boko Haram</italic> from a similar situation in Nigeria: ‘Once more, oh Frantz, the wretched of the earth.’</p>

A word of caution about references: Nigerian journalism is not noted for its accuracy or capacity to separate factual reporting from opinion. Often we are unable to establish authenticity or source, fact from opinion, truth from allegation. Contradictory statements often appear in news accounts or on the internet. One account will carry a statement attributed to a <italic>Boko Haram</italic> spokesperson taking responsibility for a particular act while another source contains a denial of the same event.

<p>It is a telling commentary on how the dominant form of our collective memory is racialized when we realize that, when the term <italic>French existentialism</italic> is used, we think of Sartre, Camus, Lansman, Merleau-Ponty, and so on. Over the past two decades Simone de Beauvoir has been admitted into the group after having been ‘gender ignored’ as a mere ‘feminist’ writer (and Sartre’s long-time partner) for decades. Fanon is simply placed outside the canon even though his work was the essence of the existentialist dilemma; the insistence that man is alone and free and that an individual is responsible and obligated to moral action, the absence of which is ‘bad faith.’ Furthermore, he was born French and died French and even received the <italic>Croix de Guerre</italic> for being twice wounded fighting for France.

<p>The degree to which Fanon can be described as utopian is debatable.

<p>‘Shot while trying to escape’ is a common and widely disbelieved excuse given by the NPF when it decides to execute a prisoner extra-judicially. Nigerian police regulations effectively give the police vigilante/lynch mob rights. The police commonly use this regulation as an excuse to carry out extra-judicial executions.

<p>Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently acknowledged that over 100 million Nigerians live in what it calls ‘absolute poverty’; that is, 61% of the population. The figure has nearly doubled since 2004 and is almost certainly understated. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909612467277"><italic>BBC Online News</italic>, 12 February 2012</xref>. Other figures claim that 80% of the Nigerian population lives on less than $2.00 per day. The NBS goes on to say that poverty is most egregious in the north, the home of <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, where it affects more than three-quarters of the population. In Sokoto in the northwest it is nearly 87% of the population. The same <italic>BBC</italic> article: ‘BBC Africa analyst Richard Hamilton says it is perhaps no surprise that extremist groups such as <italic>Boko Haram</italic>, continue to have an appeal in northern parts of the country, where poverty and underdevelopment are at their most severe.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909612467277"><italic>The Economist</italic>, 14 January 2012</xref>, asserts that ‘nearly three-quarters of northerners live on less than $200 a year.’ Such a figure would suggest something well below $1.00 per day; more like 60 cents. By contrast poverty in the south is significantly less although still affecting more than half the population. <italic>The Economist</italic> says ‘the oil-rich south is booming.’ That may contain some hyperbole, but the point is made. The relative well-being of the non-Muslim south exacerbates the sense of relative isolation, deprivation and resentment.</p>

<p>Examples abound. In mid-January 2012 there was a series of attacks: a meeting, a church, and a beauty parlor in Mubi and Yola, Adamawa State (where the American University of Nigeria is located) resulting in more than a dozen deaths. The masked attackers reputedly shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ as they opened fire. The victims were Christians and <italic>Boko Haram</italic> was immediately blamed. According to Adamawa governor, Murtala Nyako, the Mubi killings were by kinsmen as a result of a business dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909612467277"><italic>National Mirror</italic>, 2012</xref>). In early March 2012 a British and an Italian hostage, having been held for ransom for nearly a year, were killed during a rescue attempt. <italic>Boko Haram</italic> was blamed. The next day an alleged spokesman for <italic>Boko Haram</italic> denied that the group had been involved. Both these events were decidedly unlike what might be called the ‘normal’ <italic>Boko Haram modus operandi</italic>. However, the first week in March (2012) a high ranking customs inspector who had been tightening controls to constrain illegal arms trafficking in the north was assassinated in his home in Potiskum. The same week the head of the Yola unit of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was assassinated by men on a motorcycle as he was getting out of his car. SARS units of the Nigeria police force are infamous for their proclivity for brutality, torture and murder. The Potiskum and Yola events certainly fit the <italic>Boko Haram</italic> method. However, Lionel Rawlins, an American security consultant and professor of criminology in the California State University system who is involved in police training in Yola as well as training AUN’s security force, told one of the authors (Hansen) that the Yola SARS killing was almost certainly a ‘contract killing,’ not <italic>Boko Haram</italic>.</p>

<p>For example, the Middle Belt city of Jos (Plateau State) has been a hotbed of reciprocal Christian–Muslim conflict and violence for years. Thousands have died in these recurring, episodic convulsions of attack and counter-attack. In the past two years these events, when it is a Muslim attack, have routinely been blamed on BH without any evidence. In fact these disputes have little to do with religion and much more to do with land, political power and the all-important access to the state. The peculiarly Nigerian concept of ‘indigeneity’ lies at the root of the question. Hausa-speaking Muslims have been moving into the area since early in the 20th century, initially because of economic opportunities associated with the Jos tin mines. The so-called ‘indigenes’ of Plateau State are Christians (becoming such during the colonial period) and have stubbornly clung to a monopoly of political power, arguing that the Hausa Muslims are ‘settlers’ despite the fact that all are Nigerian citizens and may well have been in the area for four or five generations. Unscrupulous politicians (in this case mainly Christians) constantly raise the specter of an ‘Islamic threat’ in order to mobilize their co-religionists and, in so doing, allowing themselves freedom to loot the public exchequer. Muslims and Christians share the resulting poverty but stay at each other’s throats instead of the real enemy; exactly the results desired by the predator class. It is, of course, quite possible that the future will see something of a self-fulfilling prophecy and some (many?) Muslims will find refuge in <italic>Boko Haram</italic>.</p>

<p>The interest of the Nigerian state in the ‘war against terror’ has several strands. First, it fully expects to be counted as an ally of the West and thus able to share in the lucrative windfall that will be spent by, especially, the United States. The predator class that rules Nigeria is always on the lookout for new income streams to increase their already bloated resources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909612467277">Doyle, 2012</xref>). Second, being part of an anti-terrorist alliance also serves to deflect external criticism of their malfeasance and abuse of the Nigerian people; another Cold War, as it were, with its attendant financial benefits for client states. For the most part the international media stays in comfortable hotels in Lagos or Abuja and dutifully reports government statements, especially those that claim ‘links with’ international bad guys. As best we can tell there is little evidence for these claims, but they are made nonetheless. For example, as far as we know not a single member of the international media (print or TV) has been to Yola despite the attention by them to the bombings and shootings the second week of January 2012. Despite arguments to the contrary, the government claimed the perpetrators were <italic>Boko Haram</italic> so <italic>BBC</italic>, the <italic>New York Times, CNN, Al-Jazeera</italic>, and so on, dutifully reported the government’s claims before repairing to the hotel bar for a late afternoon gin and tonic.</p>
