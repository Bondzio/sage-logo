<abstract>
<p>Among the green technologies that are currently investigated in industry, power ultrasound constitutes an emerging one with a good potential to produce and/or enhance a variety of processes. Lately, a series of power ultrasound systems for applications in the food industry, environment and manufacturing have been developed at laboratory and semi-industrial scales. In order to scale up these systems and their associated processes, elimination and/or control of detrimental modal couplings between tuned and undesired modes are necessary. In this study, the vibration behaviour of a tuned system for defoaming made up of a sandwich transducer of the Langevin-type driving an amplitude concentrator attached to a circular radiating plate was experimentally investigated. A three-mode interaction affecting the performance of the studied power ultrasound system was detected, characterized and classified. The information gathered through this study may be useful for the development of more efficient ultrasonic devices and processes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406212440791" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years<bold>,</bold> there has been a growing awareness of the environmental impact of industrial processes which have resulted in a stricter legislation. In order to comply with the new regulations, industries are trying to find environmentally friendly technologies capable of providing efficient solutions for large-scale applications.</p>
<p>Due to its sustainable characteristics, power ultrasound (PU) technology is currently investigated in order to prove its suitability to industry. Ultrasonic energy produced at high intensity may cause changes in the propagation media which can be exploited in food processing, environmental treatments, manufacturing, health, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440791">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212440791">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The idea of using ultrasonic energy in industry and medicine is not new, as the first commercial PU devices were introduced in the 1950s. Nevertheless, the initial belief of applying ultrasonic vibrations of high intensity in a wide range of applications did not have the expected success. There are various technical reasons which can explain the underuse of PU technology up until recently. Magnetostrictive transducers which were initially adopted to generate ultrasonic waves had a low electromechanical efficiency. Driving electronics used for the activation of power systems was basic. Moreover, the design of tuned components relied on analytical modelling or trial and error approaches, which only allowed successful development of systems with simple geometries.</p>
<p>During the last few years, the advent of powerful packages for tuned component design based on the finite element method, the availability of electronic methods to drive and control vibrating systems, along with the need of green technologies for industrial processing, have all contributed to resuscitate industry attention towards PU. An important factor in the renaissance of PU can be associated with the introduction of a new generation of ultrasonic transducers capable of driving extensive plate radiators (and corresponding driving electronics) which find application in fluid and multi-phasic media treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440791">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212440791">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main processes within which the applicability of plate transducers has been proven at laboratory and industrial scale encompass ultrasonic defoaming, dehydration of foodstuff, extraction of substances with supercritical fluids, particle agglomeration, cleaning of textiles, solid–liquid separation in the treatment of sludges, atomization and elimination of bubbles from paint coatings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440791">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there exists a wide range of ultrasound-assisted processes that are still in an intermediate stage between laboratory and industry. In order to scale up PU systems to full industrial level, one of the most important problems to control is their nonlinear behaviour exhibited at high power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440791">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212440791">7</xref></sup> In this study, a three-mode interaction typical of autoparametric systems has been detected and characterized in a plate transducer for defoaming applications.</p>

<p>Fluid and multi-phasic media (fluid with particles, bubbles or suspended drops, and porous solid with a fluid inside) have low specific acoustic impedance and high acoustic absorption. In order to obtain an efficient transmission of ultrasonic energy through these media obtaining a good impedance matching between the radiation source and the medium, high vibration amplitude and high-directional or focused, beams for energy concentration is necessary. Besides, for industrial applications of large scale, high power and large radiators are required. Ultrasonic plate transducers may achieve all these requisites in one device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440791">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212440791">4</xref></sup> This type of radiators can incorporate rectangular or circular geometries with stepped and/or grooved profiles by means of which tailoring the radiated field is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440791">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212440791">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212440791">8</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406212440791"><title>Ultrasonic defoaming</title>
<p>Foam is an unwanted by-product occurring in a large variety of processes in diverse industrial sectors. Among these sectors, we name food industry (bottling and canning lines, fermenting vessels, meat and dairy processes, etc), chemical and pharmaceutical industry (production of antibodies, vaccine and biotechnology), mine industry (floatation processes), energy (biofuels), etc. Classical methods to control foam are based on the use of anti-foaming chemical agents which may contaminate the products. Other procedures such as thermal and mechanical ones are not always effective.</p>
<p>PU offers an effective and clean way to break foam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212440791">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212440791">4</xref></sup> In particular, ultrasonic transducers with circular plates have demonstrated to control efficiently foam excess produced in fermenting vessels, and filling processes of carbonated beverages in high-speed lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212440791">Figure 1</xref>(a)).
<fig id="fig1-0954406212440791" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(a) Ultrasonic defoaming in a canning line and (b) ultrasonic plate transducer for defoaming applications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212440791-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The mechanism of ultrasonic defoaming is a combination of the following effects: high acoustic pressure, radiation pressure, resonance of bubbles and acoustic streaming. Other factors, such as atomization of bubble surfaces, may also contribute to foam rupture.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212440791">Figure 1</xref>(b) shows a plate transducer with a circular radiating face for defoaming liquids developed by the Power Ultrasonics Group of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research and commercialized by PUSONICS SL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pusonics.com">www.pusonics.com</ext-link>). The basic structure of this new transducer emitter essentially consists in a piezoelectric vibrator driving a circular radiator with a stepped/grooved profile in one of its flexural modes of vibration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212440791">Figure 2</xref>(a) shows schematic distributions of the longitudinal vibration piezoelectrically generated in the vibrator and of the flexural oscillation excited in the radiating plate.
<fig id="fig2-0954406212440791" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic of the plate transducer for defoaming: longitudinal vibration distribution (blue line); flexural vibration distribution (red line). (b) Focused acoustic field generated by plate radiation measured by microphone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212440791-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In defoaming applications, it is necessary to focus the radiated acoustic energy onto a focal area. The area whereby the emitted energy concentrates is centred on the axis of symmetry of the disk radiator at a distance of 40–50 cm from its surface, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406212440791">Figure 2</xref>(b). Acoustic radiation in air can reach very high pressures in the order of 170 dB over an area of few square centimeters. Plate transducers are excited through an electronic power generator which tracks the tuned resonant frequency during operation. Commercial ultrasonic defoaming systems typically work at a frequency of about 25–26 kHz.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406212440791"><title>Nonlinear vibration behaviour</title>
<p>Ultrasonic systems when are excited at high (nominal) powers exhibit a wide range of nonlinear phenomena, such as tuned frequency drops, multi-modal responses, frequency and amplitude modulations and hysteretic responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212440791">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212440791">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212440791">9</xref></sup> Tuned frequency sudden drops and hysteretic responses similar to those of a Duffing resonator are exhibited by PU systems. Former experimental and theoretical studies have shown that softening response characteristics of ultrasonic devices are mainly due to the inherent nonlinear behaviour of the incorporated piezoelectric elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212440791">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406212440791">10</xref></sup> Piezoelectric, dielectric and elastic losses of piezoelectrics have demonstrated responsible for modal frequency shifts and temperature increases within ultrasonic devices. At high power driving levels, frequency shifts of the tuned frequency may be so extensive to cause jump phenomena around tuned responses which makes difficult to maintain constant vibration amplitude via electronic methods. At such powers, bifurcations and even chaotic responses may occur in PU systems.</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors of this study have previously shown that multi-modal responses typical of autoparametric systems may occur in multi-component ultrasonic systems excited above specific power thresholds. In particular, principal parametric resonance and three-mode interactions have been observed in tuned systems for cutting applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440791">5</xref></sup> Moreover, the measured multi-modal responses showed to be qualitatively similar to those calculated in analytical models of simple autoparametric systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406212440791">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406212440791">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>These nonlinear mechanisms may detrimentally affect the efficiency of PU assemblies causing high noise levels, when low-frequency modal responses are internally excited, amplitude saturation, low reliability and component failures if endurance limits of constitutive materials are exceeded when modal interactions are underway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440791">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406212440791">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although basic design principles of power ultrasonic devices can be found in the literature, specific recommendations to eliminate/reduce their nonlinear behaviour at high power are lacking. As a result, although commercial devices made up of extensive and/or multiple tuned units for large installations are lacking, the number of companies developing PU systems has increased during the last few years. In order to progress in the design of system solutions which could enhance the applicability of PU to industry is therefore necessary to understand the dynamics of tuned devices driven at high power. In particular, in ultrasonic plate transducers which resonate in a composite mode of vibration and are characterized by thin and stepped profiles, nonlinear dynamic phenomena may occur. Slender components and/or thin radiating surfaces tuned to resonate in a specific mode of vibration exhibit many untuned modal frequencies besides the operating frequency, which may satisfy resonance conditions resulting in modal energy leakages.</p>

<p>In order to detect, characterize and classify the nonlinear dynamic effects limiting, the correct functioning of ultrasonic power transducers, first it is important to identify modal frequencies of the systems through low power tests conducted over wide frequency ranges. Subsequently, the response of the transducers needs to be measured at high power with the aim of obtaining information on the level of system nonlinearity and on the specific effects which this involves during operation.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0954406212440791"><title>Modal testing</title>
<p>In this study, the modal data of the plate transducer of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406212440791">Figure 1</xref>(b), which was designed to resonate in a longitudinal–flexural composite mode at about 25.6 kHz, were collected over a 1–80 kHz frequency range through a combination of electrical and vibrational measurements taken using an impedance analyser (HP 4192A) and a laser vibrometer (Polytec CFV055). These low power measurements were carried out to identify the largest number of modal frequencies of the tested system in order to detect possible resonance conditions which could result in undesired modal interaction at nominal powers. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440791">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212440791">4</xref> show admittance and vibration velocity obtained applying a sinusoidal excitation of 1 V between the piezoelectric elements of the transducer. Both electrical and vibrational measurements were employed to detect the largest number of modes of the assembly. To achieve this aim, admittance measurements were not sufficient as they provided information only upon those system modes involving the deformation of the piezoelectric elements. Some system modes, especially certain plate modal families, did not involve sufficiently high strain levels at piezoelectrics’ locations to be detected and therefore resulted unperceived in the admittance plot.
<fig id="fig3-0954406212440791" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Admittance curve measured in the 1–80 kHz range under 1 V excitation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212440791-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig4-0954406212440791" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Vibration velocity response measured in the 1–80 kHz range under 1 V excitation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212440791-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Besides, piezoelectric elements incorporated in PU systems are typically polarized in the axial direction, thus vibrational modes involving transverse motions of the vibrator are difficult to excite through an external voltage. Responsiveness of transverse modes might, however, change at high power if they are excited via specific resonance conditions.</p>
<p>During low power tests, vibration velocities were measured optically on a point on the plate edge in a direction parallel to the axis of symmetry of the plate, therefore out-of-plane respect to the plate surface. Such a measurement location was chosen as a measurement point because most modal families involved plate edge oscillations.</p>
<p>By looking at Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406212440791">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212440791">4</xref>, it can be observed that the vibrational and electrical responses measured in the considered frequency range revealed the presence of modes with high- and low-response amplitudes. Large-response modes were generally detected by both measurement methods; however, only optical measurements allowed detection of low-amplitude modes, which despite being weakly responsive under low power driving, could still be strongly excited at high power, if excitation frequencies satisfied existing resonance conditions. In this case, internally excited transverse modes may exhibit response amplitudes of the same order, or even higher, than the externally excited mode.</p>
<p>The tuned mode of the investigated PU system corresponded to an axis symmetric flexural mode of the radiating plate with seven nodal lines. Such a mode occurring was excited through the axial movement of the piezoelectric vibrator operating in its second longitudinal mode at about 25.6 kHz. The nearby modes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406212440791">Figure 4</xref> involved other modal families characterized by larger plate edge displacements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954406212440791"><title>High power vibration testing</title>
<p>In order to investigate the dynamics of the selected plate transducer with power, an experimental work of characterization was conducted by increasing the sinusoidal voltage applied to the ultrasonic assembly.</p>
<p>The electric excitation was provided using a function generator (Agilent 3322A) and amplified via a power amplifier (QSC RMX 4050HD), while current and velocity measurements were taken across the transducer ceramics and on the edge of the circular plate, respectively. Measurements were conducted over a 40 Hz interval centred in the tuned frequency of the system. The entire experiment was coordinated using LabVIEW. The block diagram of the experimental rig developed for the characterization of the dynamic behaviour of power ultrasonic systems is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406212440791">Figure 5</xref>.

The highest excitation voltage level set for the vibration tests of the PU device was 300 V in order to prevent it from fatigue failure. Responses at other driving voltages between 10 and 300 V were also collected, but for clarity are not shown in the figures. Looking at Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440791">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440791">7</xref>, it can be observed how electric and vibrational responses of the plate transducer varied with the applied voltage level. In particular, during high power tests, both current and velocity exhibited differences between the values obtained through upward and downward sweeps. The shifts to the left of the high power response curves measured during the sweep down of the driving frequency, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440791">Figures 6</xref>(b) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440791">7</xref>(b), were due to temperature increases occurring within the piezoelectrics as well as their inherent elastic softening behaviour.

<p>The modes with frequencies <italic>ω</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>ω</italic><sub>2</sub>, known as internal modes, were excited when the tuned system was externally driven at high power inside a 5 Hz frequency range near <italic>ω</italic><sub>o</sub>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212440791">Figure 9</xref> reveals the normalized velocity response associated with one of the internally excited modes whilst the plate transducer was driven in the 25.6–25.64 kHz interval via bidirectional frequency sweeps performed under a 300 V excitation signal. For driving frequencies enclosed within the V-shaped region highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406212440791">Figures 6</xref>(b) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406212440791">7</xref>(b) (identified as primary responses), the internal mode of the ultrasonic system responded following the U-shaped curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212440791">Figure 9</xref>(a) and (b) (referred to as secondary responses). For excitation frequencies below and above the U-shaped region, the secondary responses associated to the selected internal mode were null; outside the V-shaped region of the primary responses, no modal interaction occurred, and the ultrasonic assembly vibrated only in the externally excited (tuned) mode.
<fig id="fig9-0954406212440791" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Normalized velocity (secondary) response of an internal mode of the plate transducer excited via frequency sweeps around the tuned frequency under a 300 V drive: (a) sweep up and (b) sweep down.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406212440791-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Finally, in line with what expected from the measured primary responses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406212440791">Figure 9</xref>(b) reveals that the investigated internal mode was more responsive during the downward sweep of the driving frequency. The secondary responses associated with the other internally excited frequency mode were not measured; however, it was expected that internal modes qualitatively followed the same trends.</p>
<p>The investigated three-mode interaction was the only modal coupling detected inside the tested power range applied to the ultrasonic assembly around its tuned mode. Hence, it appear evident that at high power the system performed as an autoparametric system.</p>
<p>When a modal interaction is underway in an airborne ultrasonic radiator as the one investigated, the acoustic field produced by the device may undergo a distortion with a consequent reduction of the acoustic focusing effect.</p>
<p>Since the aim of this study was the experimental characterization of the dynamic behaviour of a novel plate transducer for defoaming, no analytical modelling of the assembly behaviour was performed. However, from what observed during the campaign of performed measurements, it was assumed that the parametric excitation responsible for the multi-modal response stemmed from in-plane stresses of the plate radiator. Such stresses, conceivably due to the transverse vibrations of the stepped plate, would have caused the modification of the plate stiffness.</p>

<p>There exist a variety of industrial applications that already benefit from the installation of power ultrasonic systems. In order to make use of PU cheaper and more widespread, the design of multi-component tuned systems with slender thin profiles driven by a single piezoelectric vibrator is required. The phenomenon of unwanted modal energy transfers is common in large and/or multi-component ultrasonic devices tuned in a single mode of vibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212440791">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406212440791">11</xref></sup> In the presented work, a three-mode interaction between the operating mode of an acoustic emitter for defoaming and two internal modes, whose summed frequencies are almost equal to the operating modal frequency, was experimentally detected and characterized.</p>
<p>Suitable strategies for the design of ultrasonic devices which can respond in a single mode when operated at high power are necessary. A possible idea to reduce the occurrence of modal interactions of the autoparametric type consists in avoiding that untuned modal frequencies have near integer relationships with the tuned frequency. The achievement of this aim relies on performing design methods, such as the finite element method which allows the prediction of modal parameters of tuned systems, and offers a means of shifting untuned modal frequencies to avoid resonance conditions.</p>
