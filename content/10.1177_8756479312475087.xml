<body>
<p>Cor triatriatum sinister is a rare congenital condition in which the left atrium is partitioned into two chambers by a fibromuscular membrane. The role of echocardiography is to determine whether the membrane is found to be obstructive or nonobstructive, which, in addition to patient symptoms, will determine surgical intervention. Although 2D transthoracic echocardiography (2DTTE) and 2D transesophageal echocardiography (2DTEE) are the tests of choice for the assessment of function and physiology, evaluation of specific structures may be limited. With the use of 3D transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE), we were able to delineate the anatomical features of the membrane in a comprehensive way not possible by conventional 2D imaging. In addition, cross-modality comparison with cardiac computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a linear structure located in the left atrium consistent with the echocardiographic findings. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two cases of nonobstructive and obstructive cor triatriatum sinister evaluated by multiple imaging modalities, including 3DTEE.</p>
<sec id="section1-8756479312475087">
<title>Case 1 (Nonobstructive Cor Triatriatum Sinister)</title>
<p>A 66-year-old man with known nonobstructive cor triatriatum sinister and a history of recent biological aortic valve replacement presented to the echocardiography laboratory for postoperative evaluation of a suspected prosthetic perivalvular leak. The 2DTTE examination confirmed a solid linear membrane dividing the left atrium into two chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-8756479312475087">Figure 1</xref>). Continuous-wave Doppler demonstrated no significant pressure gradient across the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-8756479312475087">Figure 2</xref>). A 2DTEE was ordered to further evaluate the severity of a suspected perivalvular leak.</p>

<p>As expected, 2DTEE imaging of the left atrium showed a continuous linear hyperechoic structure partitioning the left atrium into two discrete chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756479312475087">Figure 3A</xref>). Because 2DTEE angulation does not enable “en face” or direct frontal viewing of the membrane, we were limited in obtaining accurate delineation of the anatomical features of the perforations. Doppler color flow imaging demonstrated laminar flow and no significant aliasing consistent with the absence of obstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-8756479312475087">Figure 3B</xref>). This was confirmed with mitral and pulmonary venous inflow evaluation (not shown).</p>

<p>A 3DTEE full-volume data set was obtained of the left atrial structure, including surrounding valves. Using examination-specific orientation and cropping techniques, the base of the left atrium was cropped away and the membrane was isolated and fully appreciated. This permitted improved visualization of the membrane’s attachments and area of perforations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756479312475087">Figure 4A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-8756479312475087">B</xref>). In Video 1A,B (available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jdm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jdm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>), the floppy movement of the membrane is appreciated in addition to the transparencies in the fibrous tissue where flow likely would pass through, as seen by the color Doppler imaging.</p>

<title>Case 2 (Obstructive Cor Triatriatum)</title>
<p>A 27-year-old woman with a past history of transient symptoms of asthma presented with increased dyspnea on exertion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation; upon clinical exam, auscultation detected a significant holodiastolic murmur (3/6 Levine’s scale) heard at the cardiac apex. A 2DTTE was ordered to assess potential origins of these findings. The echo findings showed a linear hyperechoic region across the left atrium most consistent with cor triatriatum sinister (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-8756479312475087">Figure 5A</xref>). Color Doppler imaging demonstrated an obstructed appearance with aliasing across the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-8756479312475087">Figure 5B</xref>). Using an off-axis apical long-axis view, spectral Doppler was aligned parallel to membranous flow demonstrating a mean gradient of 17 mmHg across the membrane consistent with obstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-8756479312475087">Figure 6</xref>). Because of the patient’s symptoms and identification of obstruction, surgery was performed to remove the membrane. In the operating room, transesophageal echocardiography was performed using both 2D and 3D imaging techniques.</p>

<p>Similar to the previous case described as nonobstructive, the membrane appeared as a continuous, linear structure transecting the left atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-8756479312475087">Figure 7A</xref>). Evidence of color Doppler aliasing typical of turbulent flow was noted laterally and adjacent to the left atrial appendage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-8756479312475087">Figure 7B</xref>). An echolucent gap or opening was seen superior to the aortic valve, which indicated further obstruction from an extended fibrous linear structure. Color Doppler imaging demonstrated aliasing of color flow through the opening of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-8756479312475087">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast to the nonobstructive case, 3DTEE delineated the triatriatum membrane with improved accuracy in anatomical appearance compared with conventional 2DTEE imaging, including the en face view of the membrane visualized from the left atrium toward the left ventricle (Video 2, available online). The movement and echolucent properties seen in the middle of the membrane were not evident, as was seen in the nonobstructive images (see Video 1A,B). The appearance of an opening or “tunnel” at the end of the membrane proximal to the aortic valve was noted. With the ability to orient the 3D image, the orifice was visualized through the membrane (Video 3, available online). The postoperative surgical report described the membrane as highly calcified with an opening about the size of a nickel (approximately 20 mm), correlating well with the 3DTEE images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756479312475087">Figure 9A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-8756479312475087">B</xref>).</p>

<p>For comparative assessment, contrast-enhanced CT was also performed in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-8756479312475087">Figure 10A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-8756479312475087">B</xref>). The CT images confirmed the presence of cor triatriatum defects with a membrane crossing the left atrium and secondary atrial dilation. In the obstructed case, the perforation or hole was described as a highly calcified small fenestration between the membrane along the superior aspect of the left atrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-8756479312475087">Figure 10B</xref>). No other structural abnormalities were noted.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cor triatriatum, first reported in 1868, was described as a congenital anomaly in which the left atrium (cor triatriatum sinister) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum) is divided into two parts by a fibromuscular band.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8756479312475087">1</xref></sup> This anomaly is rare, occurring in 0.1% to 0.4% of patients with congenital heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312475087">2</xref></sup> Although most often detected in children and young adults, individuals can present in adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8756479312475087">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312475087"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8756479312475087"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756479312475087">5</xref></sup> Both cases presented here involve cor triatriatum sinister, formed as a failure in the development of the common pulmonary veins, resulting in a left atrium divided by a fibromuscular diaphragm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756479312475087">6</xref></sup> The right valve of the sinus venosus divides the right atrium. Its persistence can develop into a complete septation of the right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8756479312475087">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8756479312475087">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the complexity of this defect, several classifications have been suggested. In 1949, Loeffler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8756479312475087">8</xref></sup> classified cor triatriatum into three groups: group 1 has no opening where the left atrium drains into the right atrium, group 2 has one or more small openings resulting in high obstruction, and group 3 has a single, large opening typically with little or no obstruction. Groups 2 and 3 best describe both obstructive and nonobstructive cases presented in this report.</p>
<p>When obstructive, surgical intervention is necessary as symptoms may mimic that of mitral stenosis, causing pulmonary venous congestion and pressure overload of the right heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8756479312475087">5</xref></sup> Symptoms may include exertional dyspnea, arrhythmia, and fatigue. Cor triatriatum is often associated with additional cardiac anomalies, including atrial septal defects, persistent left superior vena cava, and unroofed coronary sinus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312475087">3</xref></sup> Other associated but less common anomalies include aortic regurgitation with dissecting aneurysm and anomalous pulmonary venous connection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8756479312475087">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although both 2DTTE and 2DTEE imaging are often the initial imaging modalities of choice when assessing anatomy and physiology in congenital heart disease, adjunctive 3D imaging may improve diagnosis of cor triatriatum and visualization of the culprit membrane in a way not possible by standard 2D imaging. The addition of 3D imaging offers the ability to view both sides of the membrane. As 3D imaging is primarily used for anatomical assessment with limitations of color Doppler assessment, it is necessary to incorporate conventional spectral Doppler imaging to determine the presence and severity of obstructive disease across a restrictive orifice. Further testing with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and CT may be used to confirm the presence or absence of cardiac malformations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital anomaly that should be considered by the sonographer when a linear hyperechoicity is seen traversing the left or right atrium. These two cases, although rare, highlight the spectrum of cor triatriatum that may be seen in clinical practice. The combined 2D and 3D imaging provided superior interrogation of this rare congenital anomaly and should be considered a standard approach in echocardiography laboratories that have these technological capabilities.</p>
