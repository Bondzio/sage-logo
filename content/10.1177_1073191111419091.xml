<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the measurement equivalence of a five-factor measure of personality across two groups applying for jobs, who completed the same questionnaire using either a paper-and-pencil (<italic>n</italic> = 429) or a web online answer format (<italic>n</italic> = 651). The data were collected using the Big Five Questionnaire–2 (BFQ-2; which is a measure of the Five Factor Model) of personality traits. Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to test for the equivalence of factor covariance and mean structures of the BFQ-2. Findings suggested that the Five Factor Model scales have the same measurement unit and origin across applicants using different administration modes. However, latent means were slightly higher for applicants who responded in a web and unproctored condition than for applicants who completed a paper-and-pencil version of the same test. Practical implications for personality assessment are discussed.</p>

<p>In the past two decades, the use of personality measures for personnel selection has undergone a major revival. The development of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111419091">John, 1990</xref>) has led personality theorists and researchers to reevaluate the utility of personality tests for industrial and organizational psychology (I/O psychology). A parallel increase in attention has been paid to the use and the implications of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111419091">Bartram, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191111419091">Lievens &amp; Harris, 2003</xref>), so web-based assessment can be considered as one of the most important current topics in I/O psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111419091">Meade, Michels, &amp; Lautenschlager, 2007</xref>). Only a few studies have focused on the psychometric properties of the FFM-based questionnaires obtained via the web in a personnel selection context and/or their comparability with traditional administration formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111419091">Buchanan, Johnson, &amp; Goldberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111419091">Salgado &amp; Moscoso, 2003</xref>). Most of these studies were based on samples of students, with the obvious consequence that their results may not generalize to applicant populations, because of the different demand characteristics of the testing context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111419091">Meade et al., 2007</xref>), and/or failed to examine the measurement invariance of the FFM scales using appropriate methodologies. In sum, it is apparent that more research is needed to ascertain the equivalence of web-based Five-Factor measures with analogous paper-and-pencil (P&amp;P) versions. The current study is aimed to assess the equivalence of factor covariance and mean structures of an FFM-measure across two groups of individuals applying for business agent jobs in the same Italian organization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine different forms of measurement invariance (configural, metric, and scalar) across P&amp;P and web-based versions of an FFM measure in an applicant setting.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Two samples were used in this study. A first group (<italic>n</italic> = 429, 32% males) is composed of job applicants (mean age = 28.59 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 5.00), who provided their responses during a selection process, using a P&amp;P version of the Big Five Questionnaire–2 (BFQ-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111419091">Caprara, Barbaranelli, Borgogni, &amp; Vecchione, 2007</xref>). A second group of applicants (<italic>n</italic> = 651, 35% males) completed an identical web-based version of the test (mean age = 29.93 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 4.38). Participants who completed the web-based test were logged on to company computers connected to the Internet. Respondents completed the test in an unproctored setting, without the direct supervision of a test administrator. Participants were assigned by human resources managers to one of the two administration conditions, based on the first letter of their surname. The procedure was aimed to create normative data for test scoring in both conditions, controlling for self-selection biases and other confounders. It resulted in roughly equivalent groups in terms of basic sociodemographic characteristics, as attested by their highly similar age and gender compositions.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The five factors of personality were assessed via the BFQ-2. The instrument contains 120 5-point Likert-type items that form five domain scales. To reduce the number of indicators, items were combined into 20 parcels of 3 to 9 items, which represent specific facets of the five domains. As recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111419091">Bandalos &amp; Finney, 2001</xref>), items were grouped into facets based on their content (i.e., we parcel items together that represent similar facets of a construct). This allows to preserve the unidimensionality of each parcel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191111419091">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111419091">Table 1</xref> reports the descriptive statistics and alpha reliability coefficients of global traits and facets in both samples.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>A multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the 20 facets of the BFQ-2. Typically, the five-factor measures are not simple-structured and showed inadequate fit when evaluated by CFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111419091">McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, &amp; Paunonen, 1996</xref>). The analyses were thus conducted using the “unrestricted factor analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191111419091">Jöreskog, 1979</xref>), by means of maximum likelihood robust estimation. This approach takes full advantage of classical CFA restricted model, allowing examination of different forms of measurement invariance across groups, without assuming that the variables are factorially pure. Model fit was evaluated using the χ<sup>2</sup> likelihood ratio statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191111419091">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The hypothesized five (oblique)-factor model fits in applicants group using either a P&amp;P χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>n</italic> = 429, <italic>df</italic> = 100) = 329.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, CFI = .936, RMSEA = .073 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .064, .082), SRMR = .030, or a web-based test χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>n</italic> = 651, <italic>df</italic> = 100) = 381.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, CFI = .946, RMSEA = .066 (95% CI = .059, .073), SRMR = .026. This is a prerequisite to test for the equivalence of constructs across groups. All the primary loadings were significant, with a mean standardized coefficient of .66 within each group. The secondary loadings were low, ranging in average from .11 (web) to .13 (P&amp;P). The baseline model was fitted to the data on <italic>both groups</italic> simultaneously, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>n</italic> = 1080, <italic>df</italic> = 200) = 711.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, CFI = .942, RMSEA = .049 (95% CI = .045, .053), SRMR = .028, supporting the configural invariance hypothesis. Constraining the loadings between the groups yielded a nonsignificant increase of the chi-square, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(15) = 11.75, <italic>p</italic> = .70, providing support for metric invariance. Constraining the intercepts between the groups produced a significant increase of the chi square: Δχ<sup>2</sup>(15) = 31.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. However, a small decrease in the CFI was observed (ΔCFI = .006). In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111419091">Cheung and Rensvold’s (2002)</xref> guidelines, the observed decrease in fit can be attributable to sampling error rather than to a lack of equivalence. Thus, the hypothesis of scalar invariance can be accepted and meaningful interpretation of latent mean differences across administration modes can be performed. To this aim, the P&amp;P sample served as reference group, with the means of the latent factors fixed to zero. The latent means of the web-based test were freely estimated and thus scaled on the latent means of the P&amp;P group. Results indicated that, on average, the latent means were significantly higher in the web-based test for Energy (mean difference = .18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), Agreeableness (mean difference = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), Emotional stability (mean difference =.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and Openness (mean difference = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Scores on Conscientiousness, instead, were not significantly different across groups (mean difference = .02, <italic>p</italic> = .45). To assess the magnitude of the differences, standardized effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>) were computed by dividing the difference between latent means by the within-groups pooled standard deviation. Effect sizes ranged from .00 (<italic>Conscientiousness</italic>) to .23 (<italic>Emotional stability</italic>). These results, according to Cohen’s guidelines, indicate a small difference between the groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study adds to the literature by examining the effects of different modes of administration in an applicant setting, by investigating the extent to which the use of an Internet online administration procedure may introduce systematic biases compared to a traditional P&amp;P format. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111419091">Bartram (2005)</xref>, “when a test is presented in some medium other than the one in which it was developed, it is necessary to check the equivalence of the new form” (p. 33). Empirical demonstrations of such equivalence are recommended by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191111419091">American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, and National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999</xref>). Results supported configural, metric, and scalar equivalence of the BFQ-2 across administration modes. This is in accordance with literature showing that the psychometric properties of P&amp;P and online Internet administered questionnaires are substantially comparable in neutral settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111419091">Fouladi, McCarthy, &amp; Moller, 2002</xref>). The same conclusion seems to hold in evaluative settings, where people may have considerable motivation to present themselves in a favorable light.</p>
<p>A potential limitation of the study is that random assignment was not carried out in a strict sense. Random sampling requires the use of procedures that ensure that each case has the same probability of being assigned to a particular group or condition (as occur, for instance, when trained researchers assign random numbers to each participant). As this study has been planned and realized within a real organizational context, it was not possible to exercise a complete degree of control over all potential confounding effects as in experimental settings. However, if confounding effects exist, these are at least the same as those that occur in practice. At the same time, the use of field data represents a strength of the study as it preserves the <italic>ecological validity of findings</italic>. A further limitation arises from the fact that participants come from a single country (Italy) and are restricted to the “business” culture. Before a definitive conclusion can be drawn, findings from the current study need to be replicated in different samples, cultural contexts, and organizational settings.</p>
<p>These results may have implications for practical applications in personnel assessment and selection. When test scores provide the basis for complex organizational decisions, as candidate admission and resources allocations, the issue of measurement invariance represents a matter of fundamental importance. Organizations can collect personality data for <italic>employment</italic> purposes relying on P&amp;P tests or on their online versions, depending on a number of practical matters. Findings from the present study revealed that the FFM scales tap the same underlying factor structures within each administration mode, maintaining approximately the same measurement unit and origin across conditions. However, applicants who respond in a web condition without the direct supervision of a test administrator reported slightly higher means than applicants who completed a traditional and controlled P&amp;P version of the same test. Thus, unless different normative scores are used for each administration mode, combining data from both conditions can lead to biased test results, which may in turn affect hiring decisions.</p>
