<abstract>
<p>Research into human trafficking for sexual exploitation often conceptualizes the experience
through the lens of migration and/or sex work. Women’s bodies are often politicized and the
corporeal experiences of trafficking are neglected. The gendered stigma attached to women who have
been trafficked for sexual exploitation is clearly evident across cultures and requires further
analysis as part of wider societal responses to sexual violence. Through the analysis of letters
written by women who have been trafficked and sexually exploited from post-Soviet countries to
Israel, this article argues that conceptualizing women’s bodies as bounded spaces allows an
investigation of the transgression of those boundaries and opens up a thought-provoking framework
for theorizing experiences of, and social responses to, sexual violence, stigma and social
exclusion. It explores themes of pollution and dirt as ways to communicate social exclusion through
references to boundaries crossed and spaces rendered abject. Women’s narratives of trafficking are
examined utilizing the theory of abjection, and the embodied effects of sexual violence and body
boundary transgression are elucidated. This analysis shows that the women in this study articulate
an embodied narrative of trafficking that is experienced in relation to body boundaries and
expressed through motifs of dirt, smell, disgust and pollution.</p>

</disp-quote>Trafficking for sexual exploitation (hereafter simply ‘trafficking’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X12462251">1</xref></sup> has remained undertheorized as gender-based
violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X12462251">2</xref></sup> The stigma attached to
women who have been trafficked is clearly evident across many cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12462251">Andrijasevic, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462251">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1357034X12462251">Poudel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X12462251">Richardson et al.,
2009</xref>) and the need for its further analysis, as part of a wider societal response to sexual
violence, has been highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X12462251">Stephen-Smith,
2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1357034X12462251">Zimmerman et al., 2006</xref>).
Addressing these theoretical deficiencies, this article argues for a more nuanced understanding of
how stigma is anticipated, embodied and articulated. More specifically, it seeks to illustrate how
the themes of pollution and dirt can be utilized as ways to communicate social exclusion through
charting the correspondences between boundary crossing and expressions of pollution. In doing this,
the article not only contributes to current understandings of the experience of trafficking, it also
aims to transcend the confines of the legislation and policy-oriented, disembodied research
currently dominating trafficking discourse. Integrating the concept of ‘abjection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva, 1982</xref>) into the analysis of
trafficking narratives, I argue, allows the focus to be returned to the body.</p>
<p>It is proposed that identifying the interconnections between body boundaries and abjection in
trafficking narratives will forge links between research agendas on trafficking and allow a gendered
reading of embodiment theory that speaks to debates around bodily integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1357034X12462251">3</xref></sup> This will demonstrate the potential harm of the
idealization of the notion of the closed-off body for women who have experienced sexual violence.
Rather than placing a focus on hetero-normative conceptions of sexual violence by emphasizing
boundary crossing and penetration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12462251">Campbell,
2007</xref>), this article will trouble both theories of the body that argue for fixity of
boundaries and the alternative position that highlights the fluidity and permeability of body
boundaries. It will demonstrate that while a more fluid model may be a more accurate representation
of embodiment, the gendered construction of the body prioritizes the hetero-normative masculine
impermeable idealized body, which positions the body identified as female in society as an
embodiment of the failure to live up to this idealized norm. This experience of embodied
permeability is nowhere more apparent than in the acute suffering and social exclusion of women who
have been trafficked and sexually exploited.</p>
<p>This article focuses on representations of the embodied experience of trafficking by analysing
women’s descriptions of the time during which they were forced to sell sex. It identifies a series
of boundary crossings that speak to the experience of abjection, the loss of bodily autonomy, and
the transgression and fragmentation of body boundaries. First there is an assessment of the notion
of pollution as a way to express the conversion that takes place when a boundary is crossed and that
which is inside the boundary is rendered abject. This leads the discussion to the articulation of
pollution through notions of dirt, disgust and smell. The article concludes with an evaluation of
the response women who are trafficked have when they feel the body is inherently polluted and its
boundaries penetrated, and a reflection on what these insights might mean for further research.</p>

<title>Trafficking</title>
<p>To date research into trafficking for sexual exploitation with the narratives of female
respondents at its core has either looked at the routes and experiences of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1357034X12462251">POPPY Project, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12462251">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X12462251">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X12462251">Stephen-Smith, 2008</xref>) and
the health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1357034X12462251">Zimmerman et al.,
2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1357034X12462251">2006</xref>), or focused on the
production of a politicized victim identity that denies women their agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12462251">Andrijasevic, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462251">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X12462251">Kelly,
2003</xref>). Indeed, the dominant preoccupation in the fields of development studies and political
science are often ‘migration/asylum concerns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X12462251">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>: 262).</p>
<p>‘Trafficking’ is a term that has emerged to define an experience which contains within it
numerous complexities that are rendered invisible through the inherent presumption of homogeneity in
the term ‘trafficking’. Between the years 2000 and 2008 an exponential increase in interest in
trafficking meant that ‘the parameters of the way in which it [trafficking] was being understood
were being defined’ through the dialogues happening, particularly in the West, in response to media
and political interest in the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X12462251">Jobe,
2008</xref>: 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12462251">Agustín (2006</xref>: 40) argues
that the definition of trafficking ‘expresses women’s presumed greater disposition (along with
children) to be deceived, above all into “prostitution”, and their lesser disposition to migrate’.
Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1357034X12462251">Laczko (2002</xref>: para. 5) counters
such claims, suggesting that to ‘harmonise the approach’ to trafficking ‘a common definition has
become vital’. Thus the construction of ‘trafficking’ creates an ‘object of knowledge that can be
subsequently governed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X12462251">Aradau, 2008</xref>: 15).
Yet, by accepting and implementing this definition one may argue the inherent gendered reading of
trafficking is now normalized, assumed and unquestioned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X12462251">4</xref></sup> A more suitable term that represents the spectrum of
experience, while still allowing legal and academic classification, currently eludes us.</p>
<p>Further debate has been generated in feminist circles which remain divided on the conflation of
women who have been trafficked and sexually exploited with migrant sex workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12462251">Agustín, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X12462251">O’Connell-Davidson, 2006</xref>) and the response to trafficking as a
thinly veiled method for migration control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12462251">Andrijasevic, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462251">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X12462251">Aradau, 2008</xref>). While trafficking is clearly a
form of gender-based violence, it has not been engaged with theoretically to the extent that other
forms, such as rape during warfare, have been (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12462251">Bracewell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12462251">Campbell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12462251">Diken and Laustsen, 2005</xref>). In even shorter supply is research
into the stigma and the social exclusion experienced by women who have been trafficked (with the
exceptions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12462251">Andrijasevic (2010</xref>) who
focused on gendered migrant identity and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X12462251">Richardson et al.’s (2009</xref>: 259) examination of citizenship), emphasizing the contradictory
position that ‘many aspects of sexual trafficking remain poorly understood’, despite it being
claimed to be ‘a priority issue for many governments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X12462251">Richardson et al., 2009</xref>: 259).</p>

<sec id="section2-1357034X12462251">
<title>Body Boundaries</title>
<p>The body can be conceptualized as an idealized bounded space (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X12462251">McDowell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X12462251">Rich, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1357034X12462251">Shildrick, 1997</xref>). While the western body is often conceptualized as ‘individuated and
discrete’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X12462251">Ravenscroft, 2008</xref>: 207), on a
cognitive level, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst (2001</xref>: 5)
reminds us, the body will always be experienced within a framework of conceptions of inside and
outside and troubled by ‘the liminal places where the exteriority and interiority of bodies merge’.
The transgression of women’s body boundaries has been articulated in numerous, often gendered, ways
from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">Grosz’s (1994</xref>: xii) sense of
‘uncontrollable drift’ through to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1357034X12462251">Shildrick’s
(1997</xref>) ‘leaky bodies’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst’s
(2001</xref>) ‘fluid boundaries’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12462251">Knott
(2005)</xref> points out, the boundaries that are imposed upon the body are not simply those of the
bounded flesh defined by skin but are part of the spatial ordering of the body in society.
Transgression, then, is reliant on a pre-existent spatial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12462251">Cresswell, 1994</xref>). This ‘spatial ordering’ of boundaries can be
felt in purity and pollution behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas,
2002 [1966]</xref>), the demarcation of outside and inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1357034X12462251">Anttonen, 2005</xref>) or in the creation of ‘complex cultural
processes whereby the human body, psychic forms, geographical space and the social formation are all
constructed within interrelating and dependent hierarchies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1357034X12462251">Stallybrass and White, 1986</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>The body boundaries I will examine are socially policed and part of a ‘woman's’ identity. While
the ‘male body’ is also subject to boundary-marking regimes that men must also enact ‘in order to be
seen as “normal”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X12462251">Holliday and Thompson,
2001</xref>: 5), in contrast the ‘female body’ (a socially ascribed gendered embodiment) is
conceptualized as a boundary under threat. This is rarely seen in discourse relating to heterosexual
male bodies, but can be identified in relation to homosexual male bodies having the potential to
corrupt and pollute (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X12462251">Bersani, 1996</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1357034X12462251">Elder, 1998</xref>), demonstrating the close
associations between body boundaries and hetero-normative boundaries of gender and sexuality.
Indeed, to establish the boundaries of a ‘male’ body ‘the notion of hardness and impenetrability’ of
the idealized normative heterosexual male body must be evoked ‘as a symbolic, phallic defence
against homosexual anxiety’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1357034X12462251">Llinares,
2011</xref>: 139–40), the fear of penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1357034X12462251">Wooden and Parker, 1982</xref>) and thus the loss of control over boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1357034X12462251">Connell, 1995</xref>). I suggest that combining an analysis of
trafficking with an analysis of body boundaries facilitates the examination of the ways in which
border crossings impact on body boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X12462251">Russell, 2010</xref>), while avoiding the error that would be treating ‘bodily margins in isolation
to all other margins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva, 1982</xref>:
69).</p>
<p>When women who are trafficked cross outside the boundaries of their countries, other boundaries
are transgressed and redefined: boundaries of national identity, boundaries of agency and control
and boundaries of the body. While geographical movement and physical boundary crossing are important
issues, this article concentrates on the boundaries of the body. Crossing from inside to outside is
often experienced as an acutely felt boundary crossing. Some transgressions are set apart and
forbidden, others are regulated through social taboos and ritualized behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1357034X12462251">Anttonen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas, 2002 [1966]</xref>). As will be detailed in this article, an
examination of the nature of these transgressions throws fresh light on how an understanding of
abjection can be a valuable insight into the embodied and social effects of trafficking and, more
broadly, sexual violence.</p>
<p>Abjection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva (1982</xref>: 4) asserts,
is the breakdown of boundaries, being neither object nor other, that which ‘disturbs identity,
system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules.’ The abject provokes disgust because
it is formless and ill defined, and attempts are made to cast the abject out, to exclude it so it
can no longer threaten the boundary it has transgressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas, 2002 [1966]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva, 1982</xref>). Kristeva’s use of abjection is engaged with
here as it responds to the criticism that writing concerning the body neglects the fleshiness, the
excreta and fluids of the human body (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>). Kristeva returns the analytic attention to those very fluids as the
substance of analysis. It must be remembered that responses to bodily fluids are so often culturally
coded that any approach to the analysis of embodied narratives must be an embodied approach, where
both the physical and the social coalesce. This is done in this article through a psycho-social
reading, without losing sight of the very flesh and fluids of embodied experience. Thus this
analysis combines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva (1982</xref>) and
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas (2002 [1966]</xref>) to explore
connections between the body, psyche and society.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This article is based on qualitative research undertaken for a broader project analysing 12
anonymized applications for a one-year Right to Remain visa made by women who have self-identified
as ‘trafficked’. The analysis focuses on the part in each application where the woman was encouraged
to ‘tell her story’ in its entirety (referred to as ‘letters’ or ‘narratives’ in this article). One
of the non-governmental organization (NGO) employees working with the women writing the applications
described being unable to assist them in writing this section because the organization had been
warned that applications would be rejected if the letters section appeared too formulaic or showed
signs of assistance. These sections often included childhood experiences, recruitment, assisted
migration and exploitation, as well as hopes for the future. The aims of the study were to explore
the ways the experiences of human trafficking and sexual exploitation were articulated from an
embodied perspective. It was from this analysis of embodied experience that the themes of this
article emerged.</p>
<p>The applications were from women from post-Soviet countries who were trafficked to, and forced to
sell sex in, Israel. Israel is primarily a destination country for trafficking, unlike the other
countries that border it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1357034X12462251">US State Department,
2006</xref>). The 1980s saw significant numbers of people (over 100,000) migrating to Israel from
the former Soviet Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1357034X12462251">Raijman and Semyonov,
1998</xref>). It can be argued that this migrant trajectory set a pattern of chain migration from
the former Soviet Union to Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1357034X12462251">Raijman and
Semyonov, 1998</xref>). Publications on trafficking from the two predominant gender and/or migration
NGOs in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1357034X12462251">Chaikin and Safran,
2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12462251">Levenkron, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X12462251">2007</xref>) have provided the majority of research on
trafficking to Israel to date.</p>
<p>The applications analysed in this article were obtained in collaboration with an Israeli NGO.
Consent was gained by the NGO for the use of the applications for research into trafficking on the
understanding that participant confidentiality would be maintained. All identifiable details were
removed from the letters, including age and country of origin. Each woman’s application was given a
name (Lena, Anja, Magdalena, Hannah, Louise, Alina) and their letters are referred to by name to
retain the personalization of the data and to also protect the participants’ identities. The
applications were analysed with attention given to emerging themes. The data contained multiple
expressions of boundary transgression, both embodied and of territory. Themes of pollution and dirt
recurred in the majority of the applications and were explored for their potential as expressions of
the moral and social transgressions involved in trafficking, as well as articulations of sexual
violence and physical harm.</p>
<p>Women who have been trafficked and sexually exploited are an ‘extremely vulnerable’ group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X12462251">POPPY Project, 2008</xref>). When conducting research,
those organizations that support women who have been trafficked aim to avoid re-traumatizing their
service users and often take information from case files, pre-existent data and through discussions
with Outreach Workers, rather than interviewing women about their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X12462251">POPPY Project, 2008</xref>). In addition to the Right to Remain visa
applications, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals from NGOs working with
women who had been trafficked. To further contribute to the crystallization of the data collected,
other representations of trafficking were thematically analysed including NGO webpages and an art
exhibition created by women who had been trafficked. The applications highlight the suffering caused
by trafficking, which is not unexpected in a visa application. What was unexpected was that much of
the narrated damage of sexual exploitation was expressed through the language of boundary crossing,
pollution and abjection.</p>

<title>Boundaries and Pollution</title>
<p>Body boundary violation and control exists throughout trafficking narratives. If dirt, pollution
and smell are, as I argue, to be read as expressions of embodied experiences of transgression it
must first be established what boundaries are at work. Here, body boundaries are shown to be closely
linked to the delineation of the physical outside of the body and to physical autonomy. This can be
conceptualized in multiple ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1357034X12462251">Schneider
(1996</xref>: 76), for example, describes this space as ‘zones of inviolability – a sociophysical
space into which we do not intrude without permission’. He goes on to demonstrate the link to bodily
autonomy, between one’s status and one’s body boundaries, suggesting that ‘low status means that
one’s zone is penetrable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1357034X12462251">Schneider,
1996</xref>: 77). Yet people may only become acutely aware of their body boundaries when those
boundaries are transgressed.</p>
<p>Pollution is an articulation of boundary crossing and the contamination of the inside of the
boundary, the creation of the abject. Pain and pollution are often linked in the narratives. Anja
writes that when she first found out what she was expected to do, ‘I cried at night, I thought it
would be painful and dirty.’ Her fears are both physical from the pain she will suffer and social
from the expectation it will be dirty, interpreted to mean shameful and polluting. Pollution
functions as both a metaphor and a reality in the lives of women who have been trafficked. Many
women who are trafficked are forced to take part in unsafe sexual acts and contract a variety of
STIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X12462251">Stephen-Smith, 2008</xref>: 21). These
illnesses come from outside the body but manifest within it, demonstrating that the body boundary
has been penetrated and is not sufficient protection for the body. However, physical pollution is
only one way of understanding the effects of trafficking on the body. The lasting effects of
trafficking are often felt as a contamination of the self, which may have physical symptoms but may
not be an illness of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1357034X12462251">Bamber,
2008</xref>). The feelings of pollution mark the body boundary as transgressed and create a sense of
the abject body, the other that is the ‘boundary to the healthy and normal selves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1357034X12462251">Hansen, 2008</xref>: 470).</p>
<p>Magdalena’s narrative is littered with references to pollution, contamination and dirt. Twice she
mentions oral sex and sex ‘without a condom’. The use or lack of use of condoms is spoken about by
Magdalena and Hannah, and is reported to be another common experience in trafficking for sexual
exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X12462251">Stephen-Smith, 2008</xref>: 5).
Condoms function as a barrier method that continues to separate the penis from the vagina. While it
cannot reduce the symbolic, emotional and social implications of rape it can lessen the actual
physical pollution from illness. Condom use is also a key negotiation tool for women who sell sex
and one way they assert power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12462251">Cusick,
1998</xref>). It is also argued that condom use is a metaphorical barrier in itself that
‘demarcate[s] private from commercial experiences’ because, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12462251">Cusick (1998</xref>: 134) argues, ‘some symbol is necessary to
separate one form from the other’, thus suggesting that sex without a condom is a marker of a
private relationship. Thus commercial sex without a condom increases the emotional violation
experienced by women who have been trafficked. Thus the condom is ‘an object which by itself confers
meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12462251">Cusick, 1998</xref>: 134).</p>
<p>While pollution naturally sits in contrast to purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas, 2002 [1966]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1357034X12462251">Miller, 1997</xref>: 63), when we discuss ideas of the body becoming
abject it is not a discussion that comes from a theoretical understanding of the ‘female body’
occupying some previously ‘pure’ or bounded state in lived experience. Rather, abjection serves to
trouble a symbolic understanding of certain boundaries that are seen to be immutable. As such, the
space within these boundaries can be interpreted on one level as pure or without pollution because
of the assumption made about the fixed nature of these boundaries. However, to ascribe to the notion
that the inside of the boundary is pure or unpolluted is to neglect the way the boundary is always
perceived as under threat. This precarious status is that which enables the experience of the
abjection as ambivalence and in a constant state of tension (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X12462251">Russell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Menstruation taboos are common in many cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1357034X12462251">Miller, 1997</xref>). The idea that blood, which is understood as
life-giving and necessarily internal for life to exist, to be experienced externally, appears to
invert understandings of the human body and instils a sense of pollution. This can be seen in
advertising for ‘sanitary’ products, where a blue liquid is used to test tampons and sanitary towels
because red liquid would evoke feelings of ‘dirtiness, disgust and even death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>: 10). This is comparable with
the late stages of pregnancy, where the body creates ‘border ambiguity’ which may, for some, become
‘a threat to their own borders and they may react with feelings of loathing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>: 41). Such repulsion and loathing is an
exercise in separating and distancing the self from the abject matter; in this example it is
menstrual blood.</p>
<p>When women enter into these ‘anomalous stages’ of menstruation and the latter stages of pregnancy
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1357034X12462251">Anttonen, 2005</xref>: 195), they encounter the
feigned notion of gender-neutrality in concepts of impermeability. Equally, they problematize their
own impermeability through the reality of their bodies, bodies that are not closed off and do not
respect boundaries. The ‘female body’ is perceived to be a series of boundaries, made and remade,
transgressed and restored. Damage is done to those boundaries when they are imbued with a symbolic
sense of impermeability or entirely negated. Each pole of this dichotomy is equally destructive to
embodied self-identity. In this way women menstruating, women who experience sexual violence and
women in the latter stages of pregnancy do not simply repel, but simultaneously attract and repel
others, creating a tension, an awareness of their own permeable boundaries, which can be
conceptualized as an awareness of the potential of the abject within that person. This troubles
other boundaries in other individuals, the community and the woman who is symbolically constructed
in this way.</p>
<p>Louise comments: ‘They <italic>even</italic> made me work when I had my period, they didn’t care
about my health, girls were like machines for him’ (my emphasis). Her statement is supported by
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1357034X12462251">Stephen-Smith’s (2008</xref>: 20) findings that
91 (77%) women in her sample of women who had been trafficked to the UK did not see a health care
professional at any point during the time that they were trafficked. Louise is not alone in drawing
attention to this practice, and her use of the word ‘even’ resonates with the idea that this is
unacceptable and that if she were being regarded as human she would not be made to do this, but she
is seen as a ‘machine’ and thus has no taboos to transgress. Magdalena reports when she first
arrived at the brothel: ‘I was left with the other girl, she had a period and she wasn’t working
yet.’ However, later, when she is moved to a new brothel, she reports the trauma she felt when ‘we
were forced to work while we had our period’.</p>
<p>Louise also mentions ‘health’ as an issue when she is forced to sell sex during her period. This
may be due to ideas that it is unhealthy (as well as unclean) to have sex during menstruation. It
may also be based upon the idea that the flow can be two ways and while menstruating one is more
likely to contract illnesses as one’s body boundaries are open.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X12462251">5</xref></sup> Menstruation is commonly conceptualized as ‘a chaotic
disintegration of form’, the ‘result of necrosis, or death of tissue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X12462251">Martin, 1991</xref>: 486). Martin’s idea of formlessness echoes with
notions of the breakdown of body boundaries, of menstruation subverting notions of inside and
outside. Magdalena recounts how she is forced to work during her period and is made to insert a
sponge into her vagina to stem the flow of blood so the ‘client’ does not know, <disp-quote>
<p>First time I had to put a sponge in, I was crying, I thought I wouldn’t be able to pull it out. I
was always afraid I would be pulling out something else, not the sponge.</p>
</disp-quote>There is a fear expressed in Magdalena’s narrative that she will pull out something
more than the sponge she is using to stem the flow of her period. Her fear could be read as simply a
biological confusion. However, it appears she fears the inside will be inverted and become the
outside, that her inner organs, that which is internal to her, will not only be damaged and abjected
by this act but also exposed and expelled from her, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed (2004</xref>: 86) reflects, ‘the abject turns us inside out, as
well as outside in’. The damage that trafficking does to the perceived inside of a woman is
expressed through motifs of pollution and the abject. For there to be a breakdown of inside and
outside in this way the boundary must have been transgressed between the two and the inside polluted
by this transgression.</p>
<p>Magdalena envisions her body boundaries as weakened and her confidence in those boundaries
falters. She demonstrates feelings of helplessness and fear associated with her body. The term
‘forced’ is used only twice in the narrative, despite her constant coercion, once in reference to
working during her period and once when a client forces her to have anal sex. Both acts are socially
taboo and by using the term ‘force’ Magdalena is expressing the violence of the transgressive act.
Her body becomes a site of contested values. This transgressive and taboo act requires her to state
that she has been forced to make it known that she would not have willingly done something so
socially taboo.</p>
<p>Behaviour toward menstruation can be considered boundary affirming behaviour as cultures
construct taboos and spatial divisions in response to it. Equally, we can read women’s distress at
being forced to work/sell sex during their periods as distress caused by a transgression of these
boundaries, forcing the body to act against the mind’s culturally constructed understandings of
appropriate behaviour. Selling sex means the menstruating body is exposed to the scrutiny of a
stranger, crossing the boundary between private and public. This humiliating scrutiny may be seen as
a further step toward the alienation of mind and body (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1357034X12462251">Russell, 2010</xref>). Menstruation, while cloaked in taboos, is also
spatialized by the idea that it has a ‘proper place’ and is a ‘private phenomenon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12462251">Cresswell, 1994</xref>: 46).</p>

<sec id="section5-1357034X12462251">
<title>Dirt</title>
<p>As the previous section has shown, pollution is a way to articulate boundary crossing. Dirt is
also an identifiable trangressive substance. It can often be associated with morality (in relation
to actions or behaviour designated ‘dirty’). In both contexts it carries a social and psycho-social
meaning. When a boundary that is perceived as impermeable is troubled and transgressed the abject,
as an object of transgression, is identified so that it may be cast out to restore the boundary.
Dirt functions in the application letters as abject matter. However, the way dirt, and the preceding
theme of pollution, are used in the letters suggests that the process of boundary restoration is not
as simple as casting out abject matter. By its nature, abject matter is never truly separate from
the individual that attempts to cast it out. It remains as a constant reminder that the boundary is
permeable. Dirt is conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12462251">Douglas
(2002 [1966</xref>]) as ‘matter out of place’, yet when used in relation to women it ‘takes on a
more specific significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12462251">Cresswell,
1994</xref>: 44). Cresswell argues that women are supposed to both keep the home and their
surroundings clean and ‘in addition they are supposed to be the <italic>epitomes of cleanliness
themselves</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12462251">1994</xref>: 44, emphasis
in original). Two women, Alina and Magdalena, speak about the dirt in their own experiences: <disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes at night I have nightmares I can see all the ugly faces all the filth and the dirt.… I
just feel like I’m a human of a lower state now, a lower level. I feel filthy. (Alina)</p>
</disp-quote>Alina is expressing not only a feeling of pollution but a fear that her pollution will
be seen by others. She is also articulating the power that her memories have upon her current
perception of herself and how she is reminded of her interactions with men who buy sex<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X12462251">6</xref></sup>, a memory which then further pollutes her.
Her use of the idea of dirt is also important as she is expressing something which normally happens
externally, to the skin, to reflect her internal disposition.</p>
<p>When Magdalena arrives at a brothel where she will be imprisoned her first comments are that it
was ‘an ugly grey building’ where ‘the walls were grey from cigarette smoke’. She also remarks about
the working conditions, ‘when we finished a shift we had to go and sleep on the same bed [where] we
were receiving clients’. The bed is not a place to sleep in, it is a place of repeated sex, and one
can also read into this that it isn’t clean. The brothel creates an abject space within which she is
confined. It is a space where men inevitably sweat and ejaculate, each demonstrating the
‘fraudulence or impossibility of the “clean” and “proper” body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">Grosz, 1994</xref>: 194). Through the multiple body boundary
transgressions the spaces become liminal zones: ‘these zones and their articulation in language, may
cause us to feel uncertain, uncomfortable, confused and/or maybe repulsed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>: 131). The language of dirt, pollution and
disgust allows for a description of the liminal spaces of trafficking, while still articulating the
feelings of repulsion inherent in their experience.</p>
<p>The need to be alone to wash is also denied to Magdalena; <disp-quote>
<p>Also the cashiers, were cruel to us. They would wake us in the morning and shout at us that
there’s already clients at the salon/living room/the reception and she didn’t give a damn if we had
a shower or not. She said you could take your shower with the client if you want. After shifts we
usually wouldn’t shower because we were too exhausted to move and in the morning again they didn’t
let us. We would get the shower only after the first client.</p>
</disp-quote>If we conceptualize the sex that takes place during trafficking as acts that render the
‘female body’ abject, we can read attempts to wash and be clean as a way to reverse or limit this
experience, a ritual restoration of boundaries and cleansing of the body. Magdalena’s focus on her
desire to shower can be read as both a practical desire to clean herself as well as a symbolic
desire to be cleansed and fend off pollution. Washing can be seen as an agentic act in the face of
reduced bodily autonomy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1357034X12462251">Raphael (2003</xref>:
60) suggests that in concentration camps during the Second World War, ‘women’s acts of care for
bodies – washing, holding and covering them – were acts of separative purification’.</p>
<p>In the narratives of women working in prostitution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12462251">Cusick (1998</xref>: 141) reports that when condoms break, women make
‘frantic efforts … to clean themselves’, while also expressing feelings of ‘disgust and anger’. If
dirt is abject matter, matter out of place, then washing is the separation of self from the abject,
the reassertion of boundaries. This process is done in private and cannot be done when the potential
contaminant (i.e. the client) is present, as their mere presence is contaminating in the context of
what should be the private ritual of washing. When we think of washing we imagine the surface of the
body is touched, the outline of the body redrawn. Soap is then applied and the soap takes away any
matter from the skin. Any dirt that may ‘cling’ or be thought of as remaining when it should have
been removed can be seen as potentially attempting to sink into the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">Grosz, 1994</xref>: 194). Dirt may be perceived as ‘sticky’ and
attract further substances which also problematize the impermeability of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 91). Through washing, the skin is
restored to the barrier through which nothing will pass and body boundaries are reasserted. The
ritual cannot be performed if the agent of contamination is in proximity. A ‘client’s’ proximity
threatens the boundary and impedes attempts to reassert boundaries and remove ‘matter out of place’.
By their presence in the shower the men are matter out of place, as they are contaminants in a
cleansing space, they are watchful eyes where privacy should be and they are perceiving a sexualized
body alone while she would reassert the embodied self through showering and reconnect with her
embodiment through touching the body, washing it, maintaining and caring for it.</p>
<p>When Magdalena needs a towel to either place on the bed (to keep the sheets, where she then
sleeps, clean), or to dry herself after a shower, or possibly to clean a client, she writes ‘on the
weekend there usually wouldn’t be enough clean towels’ and she would ‘take a towel from the used
ones and go to the client’. There is the unwritten suggestion that these towels and the sheets of
the bed contain stale semen, bodily fluids that are not contained and instead contaminate everyone
who touches them. One ‘field report’ on Punternet<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X12462251">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1357034X12462251">2008</xref>: Report 84911)
states ‘no towels on the bed meant that we all used the same sheets.… The place was dirty no towel
on the bed for each customer.’ Rather than a concern for the woman involved and her working
conditions this statement can be read as part of what Longhurst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">2001</xref>: 69) describes as ‘a fear of (homosexual) contamination by
“circuits of fluids” … men often fear being contaminated by other men’s seminal fluid’. The male is
seen as the ‘active agent in the transmission of flows’ (Grosz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">1994</xref>: 201) rather than the ‘passive receptacle’ (Longhurst,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">2001</xref>: 72). However, if we assume that
over half of trafficked women are unable to request condom use for every sexual encounter<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X12462251">8</xref></sup> they become the ‘passive receptacle’ of male
bodily fluids and become part of the contaminating ‘circuit of fluids’ (Longhurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">2001</xref>: 72). As such the status of the trafficked
woman’s body is lowered even further because disgust, caused by pollution and that which
contaminates, ‘is crucial to power relations’ (Ahmed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">2004</xref>: 89).</p>
<p>We must then ask, what is it about the body with broken boundaries that both attracts and repels
at the same time? Prostitution, and with it trafficking, are stigmatizing experiences in society and
yet they are also highly visible in the media and prostitution is glamorized through narratives like
<italic>Secret Diary of a Call Girl</italic>. Images of often objectified and sexualized ‘trafficked
women’ accompany newspaper articles and appear on NGO websites. Their bodies are both sexualized and
simultaneously taboo, alluring and potentially contaminating. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">Grosz (1994</xref>: 194) suggests there is an order to things, and
fear and disgust come from ‘fear of being absorbed into something which has no boundaries of its
own’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed (2004</xref>: 90) analyses that which
is sticky, it threatens to cling to you and yet it is only made sticky by contamination from
something else in the past. The duration of the contamination affects all future interactions. She
argues that by recoiling from the object of disgust one makes it a sign for disgust because ‘disgust
works performatively’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 92).
Thus the ‘female body’ with fragmented body boundaries can contaminate others through contact. She
becomes a ‘socially infectious body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1357034X12462251">Russell,
2007</xref>: 16) and must be excluded to inhibit her contaminatory potential because she has been
rendered abject.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1357034X12462251">
<title>Disgust and Smell</title>
<p>The previous sections have explored expressions of boundary transgression and the identification
of the abject in the trafficking setting and in the self. This section further develops the response
to the process of abjection by arguing that smell is a way in which boundary crossing can be
articulated. However, its close alignment with disgust positions them as both the detection and
response to transgressive substances. I would argue that smell is a way the penetration of the body
by the proximity of another can be articulated without communicating the experience of sexual
violence. Disgust is the body’s response to contamination and an attempt to restore body
boundaries.</p>
<p>Smell is ‘especially contaminating’ and has the power to transform our conception of the thing
that is smelt through the act of smelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1357034X12462251">Miller, 1997</xref>: 66–70). The website of the Helen Bamber Foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X12462251">Bamber, 2007</xref>) quotes one woman as saying she remembers the
bedroom where she was forced to sell sex: <disp-quote>
<p>I remember the smell. It was disgusting. We bought these little pine-tree cut outs ‘to freshen
the air.’ It was cheap. We had to pay for it out of our ‘pocket money.’ The smell mixed with the
stink of the men. I cannot bear that smell. It’s toxic and it makes me vomit.</p>
</disp-quote>The contaminating smell of the room passes into her body and her reaction is to want to
vomit, to expel the abject matter. Equally, the smell she is reporting may include the smell of
stale semen, ‘the stink of the men’, which serves as a reminder of the sex act itself as well as the
power of pollution from semen, especially if she is unable to request to use condoms. There is also
a sense that through this speech act she is distancing herself from the ‘circuit of fluids’, that
which is disgusting, by defining it as other (Longhurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">2001</xref>: 72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1357034X12462251">Probyn, 2000</xref>: 131).</p>
<p>In the installation ‘The journey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X12462251">Bamber,
2007</xref>) visitors walk through a series of shipping containers that are made to represent the
stages of the ‘trafficking journey’, one of which recreates a multi-sensory bedroom in a brothel
(complete with undulating squeaky bed). They experience the sight and the smells of trafficking and
gain a greater understanding of trafficking as an embodied experience. One reviewer commented: ‘An
outstanding visual and sensory journey which allows you to experience the torture of sexual slavery.
The smell of that room will linger with me forever’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12462251">Harris, 2007</xref>). The smell creates a further sense of the
abjection of the space; bodily fluids that have been expelled and are as such abject remain and
linger in the senses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed (2004</xref>: 87)
describes such things as ‘border objects’, provoking disgust through their transgressive
potential.</p>
<p>Smell is an important factor in experience. On an atomic level smell penetrates the boundary of
the outside of the body and is experienced first in the nose and then interpreted in the mind. Smell
is linked to ingestion; just as the smell of food can make one salivate, disgusting smells make one
feel sick. While visual images are seen and can ‘imprint’ upon the mind, smell is felt more
intimately and can evoke memories that sights and sounds cannot. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1357034X12462251">Tankink (2006</xref>: 3) reports the story of one woman who ‘has
hardly any memories of the rape she experienced, but she continues to suffer from the intrusive
smell of her perpetrators, a mix of the sweat of unwashed men, alcohol and cigarettes that makes her
very often vomit’. The smell has imprinted on her body in a way her mind has been unable to remove,
while the memory – the image, touch and sound – have been repressed. While the memories are
suppressed, the body responds to subconscious stimuli; the body remembers when the mind will not and
this causes the disjuncture between the two, which remains after the violence.</p>
<p>Disgust links to the writing on dirt and pollution because ‘anything which has had contact with
disgusting things itself becomes disgusting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 87). Yet when reflecting on that which is sticky, and thus disgusting, Ahmed
comments ‘what sticks “shows us” where an object has travelled through what it has gathered onto its
surface, gatherings that become part of the object and call into question its integrity as an
object’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 91). By touching the
object one becomes part of its history, part of what made it dirty and disgusting. Abjection, as a
breakdown of boundaries and thus the potential to be contaminated and to contaminate, functions to
give an individual the ambivalent position of the polluter and the polluted. Thus, through the
identification of abject matter, the writers of the letters are also identifying with abject
matter.</p>
<p>If we are to conceptualize trafficking as an encounter where women’s bodies are abjected, we can
better conceptualize women’s own understanding of this process if we incorporate the notion of
disgust. The spaces of trafficking are represented in the applications as abject, dirty and causing
disgust. From their discussion of the smell of stale semen, dirty beds where sex takes place which
must be slept in, or unclean towels, we can read feelings of disgust which are usually not
articulated toward the individuals (men who buy sex and pimps) but to other material objects. Each
association provokes feelings of disgust in the female narrator and links her to those ‘border
objects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 87) and spaces,
contaminating her by her contact with the disgusting object. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12462251">Grosz (1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst (2001</xref>) remark that there is very little literature on
men’s bodily fluids, and when they are discussed it is usually in the context of homosexual men and
AIDS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1357034X12462251">Strong, 2009</xref>), enabling men, as
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst (2001</xref>: 67) argues, to ‘retain
their position as rational and untainted by the messiness of corporeal flows’. Thus by constructing
the women who ‘receive’ these corporeal flows as polluted by them, the men involved are freed of
their responsibility for their own bodily fluids and distance themselves from them by stigmatizing
and abjecting her.</p>
<p>Disgust is a socially constructed response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12462251">Ahmed, 2004</xref>) to a threat to body boundaries. The ‘female body’ is then constructed on a
symbolic level in response to the potential pollution through the transgression of body boundaries.
As such, ‘the feelings a thing arouses in us are spontaneously transmitted to the symbol that
represents it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1357034X12462251">Durkheim, (1965 [1912]</xref>:
221), creating a collective notion of the ‘female body’ as both pure with closed-off boundaries as
well as liminal and precarious in response to threats of penetration and pollution. If we return to
Ahmed’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12462251">2004</xref>: 91) statement that disgust
calls ‘into question its integrity as an object’, we better understand that pollution can call
fundamental boundaries into question, causing a reaction in the self and others.</p>
<p>It is useful to note that in the two quotes about smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1357034X12462251">Bamber, 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1357034X12462251">Tankink, 2006</xref>) each individual responds to the unwelcome smell
by stating they want to vomit. There is a desire to cast out the abject matter that is troubling the
boundary of the body by entering through smell. Yet, if the individual believes they are inherently
contaminated and thus have become contaminating then they cannot cast out the abject matter from the
body. The solution is then to cast out the body from the sense of self. Patricia writes: <disp-quote>
<p>I got to a stage where my brain, my soul was separate from my body. I didn’t feel what he was
doing to my body. The pain, the humiliation, the shame without end caused me to feel as if I’m not
on earth any more. I’m in hell and there’s no way back from it.</p>
</disp-quote>When one loses freedom, choice and bodily integrity one returns to a contingent
existence in the ‘anarchism of pre-objectal relationship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12462251">Kristeva, 1982</xref>: 10). The solution many women employ is to
reject the body that is fragmented and to reassert the bounded self of the incorporeal mind, thus
removing the opportunity for further pollution but destroying a sense of embodied identity. This
then means that the project of rebuilding the body’s boundaries is rendered even more difficult when
a woman exits trafficking, especially if she chooses to try to reconstruct body boundaries along
conventional gendered understandings incorporating idealized impermeability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Narratives of body boundary control and transgression have been shown to be articulated through
notions of dirt, smell and pollution. The stigmatizing incident is then experienced as a
transgression of a boundary and the social exclusion it anticipates is articulated through ideas of
disgust and a desire to expel the threatening object, reflecting how the authors of the letters
anticipate that their bodies will be socially constructed as polluting to social cohesion. Women who
have been trafficked are subject to both fascination and condemnation; they simultaneously attract
and repel, embodying the ambivalence and threat to boundaries that is a marker of abjection. The
trafficked woman is desirable, as she has little control over her body or the sexual practices she
is forced to engage in. Yet she is simultaneously a figure of disgust because the lack of control
she has over her body and its boundaries means her body is perceived as contaminated and
contaminating. This also speaks to the ambivalence of the social classification of women who have
transgressed multiple boundaries. By rendering women socially contaminating, through stigma, this
ambivalence is responded to and yet it is not acknowledged. Such a response is inherently gendered
and relies on a particular construction of ‘female body’ boundaries to operate. While I have
problematized the very distinction of a ‘female body’, this article has demonstrated that the
constructions of embodiment that occur in trafficking (and in other forms of sexual violence) can
have real and tangible effects on lived experience.</p>
<p>Due to the prioritization of masculine notions of the closed-off body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12462251">Longhurst, 2001</xref>), the ‘female body’ is constructed to always
fail to achieve the impenetrable status of the ‘male body’ (for the few male exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1357034X12462251">Elder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1357034X12462251">Sinfield, 1998</xref>). The juxtaposition of gendered bodies places
the onus on women to maintain their body boundaries, allocating blame to them if they fail. Yet if
this ideal of the closed-off body did not have primacy in our understanding of body boundaries, the
taboos around transgression would not have the power to socially displace an individual and cause
such levels of emotional harm to them. This analysis demonstrates how the taboos around
transgression operate to exclude certain ‘female bodies’ while rendering the role of the men who buy
sex from women who have been trafficked as an ‘absent presence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1357034X12462251">Shilling, 1993</xref>) in their narratives. A clear focus on body
boundaries, and the articulation of their transgression through the language of pollution, exposes
the fallacy of the bounded body and the inherent gendered power imbalance that maintains it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64a-1357034X12462251">Tyler, 2009</xref>). When boundary crossing is
reconceptualized through the concept of abjection, it opens up a thought-provoking framework for
theorizing experiences of, and social responses to, sexual violence, stigma and social exclusion.
Future research will be able to conceptualize sexual violence or any act of body boundary crossing
(see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X12462251">Harris, 2009</xref>) through this
framework. If we accept that the body understood as female by society, by definition cannot and will
not ever be the embodiment of closed-off boundaries, then we can critique the prioritization of
impermeability that still remains part of the way society responds to bodies and conceptualizes body
boundary transgression.</p>
