<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Postgraduate medical education faces mounting pressures that threaten to permanently disrupt the hospital-based apprenticeship model, which has been in place for nearly 100 years. One inexorable pressure relates to the sweeping economic constraints across the world that are driving greater restrictions on the process of medical care delivery and correspondingly less tolerance for inefficiencies related to postgraduate medical education. Physicians are being asked to see more patients, in a shorter period of time, and to synthesize more diagnostic and therapeutic information. As a result, physicians have less time to provide educational activities for trainees. Therefore, the requirement that academic physicians teach medical trainees is becoming more challenging to accomplish. It is especially difficult to utilize current educational practices of structured didactic lectures at set times, which often creates inconvenience in clinical patient flow. Society demands that the medical profession restricts trainee duty hours, further disrupting the existing educational structure. Thus a reexamination of current educational activities is needed.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, with the emerging pressures on postgraduate medical education is the emerging technologic innovation, as the Internet continues to broaden its profound impact on all phases of society, including medicine. Internet-based learning may hold some of the keys to successful medical education reform. In less than 20 years, medical education has been transformed from one devoid of significant computer-based resources to the present time where recent surveys reveal that nearly all medical students, residents, and fellows have utilized computer-based resources at some time during their training, and many report Web-based learning as helpful toward their educational advancement.<sup>

</sup> Harbingers of this transformation are that the sales of textbooks have fallen significantly in the past 5 years; the utilization of medical e-textbooks has risen significantly, outnumbering the use of printed medical textbooks; and the number of Internet-based medical education e-learning platforms and Web sites have risen dramatically.<sup>

</p>
<p>By providing unparalleled access to knowledge and information across the world, while being uniquely suited to meet the needs of individualized learning, the Internet has the potential to dramatically transform all forms of education, including postgraduate medical education. The objective of this review article is to summarize evolving concepts in postgraduate medical education, including in the field of critical care medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0885066611429539" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed a MEDLINE/PubMed search from January 2000 to July 2011 using the search terms: “e-learning,” “Web-based learning,” “computer-aided instruction,” “adult learning,” “knowledge retention,” “medical education,” “intensive care,” and “critical care.” We limited articles to those written in English language. We reviewed articles that were reviews, meta-analyses, and original articles reporting results of specific interventions in medical education in general as well as in different medical specialties such as critical care, emergency medicine, surgery, pathology, etc. Additional articles were identified by hand searching the reference lists of included articles.</p>

<title>Defining Internet-Based Learning</title>
<sec id="section4-0885066611429539">
<title>Basic Definitions</title>
<p>Internet-based learning is also frequently referred in the literature as e-learning, computer-assisted instruction, Web-based learning, or online learning. The educational content of Internet-based learning may be provided at the same time as it is delivered from an instructor, termed “synchronous learning” (such as a teleconferencing or live Internet chat forum), or disconnected from the actual time of instruction, termed “asynchronous learning” (such as recorded and saved audio, video, or text presentations, with communication between students and instructor via e-mail, blogs, or online bulletin boards).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066611429539">1</xref>
</sup> Content can also be provided as a stand alone educational resource or as an adjunct or complement to traditional instructor-led teaching, termed “blended learning.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0885066611429539">
<title>Web 1.0/2.0</title>
<p>Since its release to the public in 1991, commentators describe the Internet as evolving through 2 phases, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, describes Web 1.0 as the “read-only Web.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066611429539">13</xref>
</sup> Users were able to search for information and then read text, view images, watch videos, listen to audio clips, answer multiple choice questions, or interact with games or simulators that behaved exactly as the webmasters programmed. These sites provided a relatively passive experience for the user. Most of the currently available medical educational Web sites utilize Web 1.0 technologies. Web 2.0 is described by Berners-Lee as “read-write Web” and refers to the concept that Web 2.0 is more of a participatory platform.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066611429539">13</xref>
</sup> Users generate Web site content and are able to interact and collaborate through technologies such as wikis, blogs, podcasts, video-sharing, and social networking Web sites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066611429539">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066611429539"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066611429539"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066611429539"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066611429539"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066611429539"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066611429539">20</xref>
</sup> These recently developed innovations allow for a more active user experience with multiple mechanisms for information sharing and collaboration in an interactive format and allow the exchange of information to occur not only from computer to user but also between users. This multiuser experience can occur in real time, as in game play, in which information generated is not stored for later reference, or through updating and modification of online information as occurs in wikis or blogs. However, Web 2.0 has not simply replaced Web 1.0. Despite recent development and growth of Web 2.0 technologies, Web 1.0 technologies continue to exist. Most currently available Internet Web sites are comprised of Web 1.0 technologies, while many new Web sites are being developed to incorporate the benefits of both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 technologies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885066611429539">Figure 1</xref>

<p>Web 2.0 capabilities include wikis, blogs, podcast- and video-sharing Web sites, and social networking. A wiki is a Web site containing user-written text that can be edited and revised freely by other users. The most familiar and widely used wiki Web site is Wikipedia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</ext-link>). OpenAnesthesia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openanesthesia.org/">http://openanesthesia.org/</ext-link>) is an example of how the medical field is utilizing wikis. The strengths of wikis include the utilization of the collective expertise of the users and the ease with which it can be revised. A theoretical weakness is the lack of an external validation measure such as a peer review process for ascertaining or confirming the accuracy of information. However, a 2005 investigation by <italic>Nature</italic> found similar rates of accuracy between Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Brittanica.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066611429539">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A blog is a Web site that contains text written in a journal-like format, often by a single user, organized chronologically. It may include links to videos, articles, other Web sites and is usually targeted toward a specific audience. Other users can often comment or add their opinion to the posted information. The strengths of a blog include the ease to add content and the frequent posting of new information. The major weakness includes the bias related to single blogger’s content. Blogger (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.blogger.com/">http://www.blogger.com/</ext-link>) is a popular example of a blog Web site, while the American College of Chest Physicians Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chestnet.org/accp/blogs">http://www.chestnet.org/accp/blogs</ext-link>) demonstrates blogging use in medicine.</p>
<p>Podcast-sharing Web sites allow users to upload and share their own podcasts with others. Podcasts are digital media files of recorded spoken interviews or lectures that are archived for later listening. The major strength is that they can be listened to from a computer or a mobile MP3 device. The weakness is that there are no visual aids or interactivity features. iTunes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/</ext-link>) offers a large selection of podcasts including some medical podcasts. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sccm.org/Publications/iCritical_Care/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.sccm.org/Publications/iCritical_Care/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>) maintains a large selection of podcasts relating to critical care topics, although not technically a Web 2.0, as users are not able to upload their own content.</p>
<p>Video-sharing Web sites allow users to upload personal videos to share with other users. Benefits of video sharing include the ability to utilize the collective knowledge and innovation of its users. Similar to wikis, a major weakness is potentially the lack of accuracy. However, the ability of other users to comment on the videos and therefore “police” the uploaded videos makes this weakness less significant. This potential for errors or inaccuracy makes video sharing in medicine risky because of potential medical–legal problems that could arise. YouTube (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</ext-link>) is the most popular video-sharing Web site, and it contains many videos of medical lectures and hands-on demonstrations of procedures with varying quality.</p>
<p>Social networking Web sites allow users to create profiles to interact and network with friends, colleagues, organizations, or potential employers. One major benefit includes the ability to quickly link people together as a community and to stay connected via postings, messages, or Tweets (140 character-limited messages posted via the Web site Twitter [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.twitter.com]">http://www.twitter.com]</ext-link>). Facebook (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com/</ext-link>) and LinkedIn (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.linkedin.com/">http://www.linkedin.com/</ext-link>) are examples of popular social networking Web sites. Many hospitals and professional organizations maintain accounts on Facebook and LinkedIn as a way to link their community together via the Internet. A major weakness limiting its usefulness in medicine includes the inability to post patient information because of confidentiality concerns. Additionally, many hospitals around the country have banned the use of Facebook or other social networking sites at work to prevent staff from using it during the time that they should be caring for patients. Also, some hospitals have created standards for use, encouraging their staff to refrain from posting inappropriate pictures or comments on their employees' pages, or from entering into relationship with patients via the social networking sites.</p>
<p>Most current medical education Web sites feature Web 1.0 technologies. Some examples include UpToDate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uptodate.com">http://www.uptodate.com</ext-link>), which provides online peer-reviewed text and image information about specific diseases and topics; BESIM–Simulator of Respiratory Mechanics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jicu.de/BESIM/">http://www.jicu.de/BESIM/</ext-link>), which is an interactive mechanical ventilator simulator; and Pulmonary Catheter Education Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pacep.org/">http://www.pacep.org/</ext-link>), which is a tutorial on Pulmonary Artery Catheter Interpretation with pretesting, slide presentations with audio, case questions, and posttesting components. A comparison between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 technologies in medical education Web sites can be noted when comparing these Web 1.0 Web sites to Web 2.0 Web sites that have capability for multiuser participation and creation of content. Some examples of Web 2.0 medical education Web sites include MedEdPORTAL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aamc.org/mededportal">http://www.aamc.org/mededportal</ext-link>), which allows users to upload and share educational resources that they have developed with other medical educators, and The American College of Chest Physicians has a section on their Web site called ACCP Blogs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chestnet.org">http://www.chestnet.org</ext-link>), which allows an author to write about a topic and members can add comments to contribute to an online discussion of that topic.</p>

<title>Key Concepts in Internet-Based Learning</title>
<sec id="section7-0885066611429539">
<title>Advantages</title>
<p>Internet-based learning potentially offers many advantages over traditional educational methods. Learning delivery is greatly enhanced by being readily available 24 hours a day, by having the ability to be easily updated as clinical information changes or improved as new Web technologies are developed, and by the ability to include more subjects and topics than could typically be taught via didactic lectures, especially in a busy clinical environment. E-learning also allows for improved collaboration and knowledge sharing within and between medical schools, hospitals, and countries. As the Internet continues to evolve, new technological advances offer flexibility to provide diverse learning modalities to support many different types of learning styles. Finally, Internet-based learning, by potentially providing a vast repertoire of expert content on demand that could not be provided within the confines of a single program under the conventional training model, can potentially accelerate the educational process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0885066611429539">
<title>Efficacy</title>
<p>Studies in the nonmedical environment, principally in military, engineering, science, and math education demonstrate that e-learning is more efficient and effective in teaching complex tasks and concepts and demonstrate superior learning outcomes when compared with traditional classroom instruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066611429539">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066611429539"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066611429539"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066611429539">25</xref>
</sup> Despite the rapid and ubiquitous utilization of computer-based medical learning resources and the theoretical advantages for more efficient and effective individual learning, there are relatively few studies in the literature to date, which demonstrate that medical school or postgraduate e-learning is superior to traditional medical education methods. Rather, many studies have attempted to evaluate the benefit of Internet-based learning compared to no control or as part of a blended-learning model. While it is difficult to combine findings across studies because of differences in methodology and outcome measures, a recent meta-analysis by Cook and colleagues attempted to answer the question about the effect of Internet-based instruction for health care providers. They evaluated the effect of Internet-based instruction compared to either no intervention or to non-Internet interventions for 3 types of outcome effects: knowledge, skill, and learner behaviors and patient effects. In total, 2193 studies were identified and 201 studies were included. Learners were students, postgraduate trainees, or health professions in human or veterinary medicine. A variety of interventions were used such as Internet-based instruction or conferencing in a wide variety of environments such as classroom versus practice settings. The outcomes included learner satisfaction with the course, self-reported or objective (ie, multiple choice questions) knowledge assessments, self-reported or objective (ie, faculty rating or demonstration of procedure) testing of clinical skills, and self-reported or objective (ie, chart audit or medical error reporting) assessment of behaviors or effects on patients. There was a significant heterogeneity in results across studies but a clear trend emerged. In studies that compared an Internet-based intervention to no intervention, Internet-based interventions had a significant benefit on learner’s satisfaction, knowledge, skills, and learner behaviors and effects on patient care. In studies that compared an Internet-based intervention to a non-Internet intervention, there was a trend toward benefit on learner’s knowledge, skills, and learner behaviors and effects on patient care, but it was not statistically significant, likely related to heterogeneity between the studies from differences such as different types of learners, instructional methods, or outcome measures. Overall, this meta-analysis seems to describe that the current strategies in Internet-based learning are more effective than no intervention but are likely similar in efficacy to traditional educational methods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885066611429539">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Because of the heterogeneity between different studies, it is likely that the type of instructional methods and outcome measures may impact the efficacy of Internet-based learning. Another recent meta-analysis by Cook and colleagues investigated how differences in instructional design affected learning outcomes. Fifty-one studies were evaluated that compared an Internet-based intervention versus another Internet- or computer-based intervention. The studies were divided into 22 different Internet-based instruction research themes such as interactivity, feedback, discussion, patient cases, games or simulation, audio, and blended online with face-to-face formats. Again differences in methodology and small study size limit the findings, but Internet-based resources incorporating features of interactivity, practice exercises, repetition and spacing, and feedback were associated with improvement in learning outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066611429539">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0885066611429539">
<title>Adult Learning</title>
<p>Internet-based teaching is aptly suited for the adult learner. It allows learners to take control over their own desired educational objectives by giving options for content, pace of learning, and type of educational modality or learning object used. This complements the evolving paradigm shift in medical education from instructor-centered education to learner-centered education, in which the learner must play a more active role in the transfer of knowledge by actively seeking out resources to meet the learner’s own practical- or problem-centered educational needs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066611429539">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066611429539">29</xref>
</sup> The adult learner strives to obtain information that satisfies their intellectual curiosity, permits them to incorporate their previous clinical experience, and allows them to reflect and apply or practice their newly acquired information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885066611429539">30</xref>
</sup> As an example of adult learning theory, the Kolb learning cycle classifies learners into 4 types: concrete experimenters, abstract conceptualizers, active experimenters, and reflective observers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885066611429539">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885066611429539">32</xref>
</sup> The Internet can offer learning components to satisfy all types of learners, by incorporating text and/or video with multiple choice questions, simulators, avatars, and social networking. This is an important advantage over the passive learning experience of a lecture setting or of reading printed medium. Kosir and colleagues demonstrated that an online, blended learning, surgical remediation program incorporating principles of the Kolb learning cycle, produced improvement in the American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam in 78.6% of students enrolled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885066611429539">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the capability of the Internet to provide learning that would satisfy the adult lear ner’s needs, not all Web sites fulfill these needs. Alur and colleagues investigated medical student teaching Web sites and found that less than half of them clearly described the learning objectives, and only 17% utilized learning principles (active learning, critical thinking, independent and evidence-based learning, and feedback) that appeal to the adult learning needs of the students.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066611429539">28</xref>
</sup> Thus, more work is still needed to improve the content contained in most educational Web sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0885066611429539">
<title>Interactive Cases/Simulators/Games</title>
<p>In alignment with the meta-analysis by Cook, there is considerable interest in developing Internet-based learning modules that incorporate features of interactivity, practice, repetition, and feedback in an environment familiar to the learner. Additionally, duty-hour constraints combined with limitations in experiencing low-volume, high-risk events that create a greater need for the development of interactive patient-based experiences in the form of virtual patients or cases, virtual device simulation (ie, mechanical ventilators), virtual procedures, and game-based patient care activities to achieve appropriate clinical competency (the volume–outcome relationship principle). The major hurdles in the utilization of these types of educational modalities are the immense cost and time commitment required to develop these resources. Thus, sharing these resources between hospitals and medical schools in an Internet education consortium may be the best way to enable rapid development and utilization.<sup>

<title>Knowledge Retention</title>
<p>A busy clinician must attempt to choose medical education resources that will help promote the greatest gains in knowledge as well as the retention of this knowledge. There are few studies evaluating the effect of Internet-based learning in the promotion of long-term knowledge retention in medical learners, and among these few studies, there are conflicting results.<sup>

They discovered that the more common Internet-learning modality, bolus Web-based training, produced greater initial increases in knowledge (63.9%-90% in 16 weeks) than the spaced-education modality (55.2%-69%), but that this was not sustained. In contrast, the Web-based training generated a mean long-term score increase of only 3.4% compared to the increase by spaced education of 15.2% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).<sup>

<title>Evaluating Educational Web Sites</title>
<p>There are no set of standardized guidelines or peer review processes that all medical education Web sites abide by for the creation and evaluation of their educational content. Several organizations and studies, however, have attempted to develop processes for evaluation. MedEdPortal is a free, peer-reviewed publication service supported by the Association of the American Medical Colleges and American Dental Education Association, which allows health care providers to share online educational resources that have been peer reviewed for quality and accuracy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885066611429539">46</xref>

<title>Disadvantages</title>
<p>Web-based learning can also have some disadvantages. Although rare as the extent of Internet-based resources continues to grow, it is possible that the learner may not be able to find an educational tool that suites his or her needs for learning a particular topic. There are often immense initial costs that are required for the creation of a high quality, interactive educational Web site, and thus many Web sites suffer from poor instructional design,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066611429539">9</xref>
</sup> such as a “course” containing only long scrolling text without multimedia adjuncts or specified learning objectives. This type of “course” offers little advantage over a textbook. Another significant disadvantage is that the process of updating and maintaining sites as information changes or becomes outdated can also incur a significant amount of time, effort, and money. It is not uncommon to try to access a link to another part of the Web site or another Web site, only to have the link not functioning. This creates frustration for the user and suggests that the Web site has not been updated regularly. Printed media has a publication date that is clearly evident and a general assumption is that the data are correct at the time of publication. With Web media, publication dates may not be quite so evident, and many people assume that data and information, which is currently available online, is accurate and up-to-date. This is often not the case. Another problem faced by Web-based learning is the duplication of efforts and inability to connect or bring together many different Web sites into a comprehensive platform. Often, much time and effort are spent creating Web sites that essentially cover the same material. If these sites could be somehow linked together, the user would have a more robust teaching tool that utilizes the knowledge of many more people, utilizing different educational modalities. Finally, technical problems such as loss of Internet connection, inadequate software, removal of a Web site from the Internet, or a virus infection of a computer can create frustration in the learner.</p>

<sec id="section15-0885066611429539">
<title>Internet-Based Learning in the Nonmedical Fields</title>
<p>In many fields outside of medicine, such as the military, active and collaborative Internet-based experiential learning is now commonplace. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) regularly utilizes Internet-based interactive training exercises using computer-based simulators networked to teams practicing a joint mission across continents. Since the 1950s, the DOD has been utilizing computer-assisted and simulation-based instruction to prepare their large group of personnel to perform difficult jobs with great precision in extremely stressful environments. Much like medicine, the instructional method used in the DOD must both impart knowledge to the learner about the topic and allow the learner to acquire necessary hands-on skills to be able to perform their job appropriately. In both fields, there is often inadequate opportunity to allow for complete reliance on on-the-job training because of low volume of high-risk events and the inappropriateness to allow the inexperienced trainee to perform the tasks completely on their own when human lives are at stake. In order to adequately train over 2 million members, the DOD must utilize educational modalities that are efficient and effective in producing appropriate competence and can be employed in a variety of settings. To accomplish this, the DOD has emphasized portability and reusability of their instruction. They have created the educational components in the formats that allow them to be used on a wide variety of computer systems and platforms (including computers and handheld devices) and that can be utilized when needed (just-in-time training) and have made the educational information applicable to different groups within their organization to enhance reusability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885066611429539">50</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Just-in-time training refers to games, simulations, references, protocols, and other educational tools that are meant to be utilized as a real-life situation is occurring to help guide practice and procedures during this event. The DOD’s Defense Acquisition University just released a casual gaming Web site, including just-in-time training for its work force, which allows deployed soldiers to learn specific details related to their new location or given task directly at the point of activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885066611429539">51</xref>
</sup> Just-in-time education training may be used in medicine, when caring for a patient with a specific disease or problem which the clinician is unfamiliar with, during an epidemic outbreak of an infectious disease such as cholera<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885066611429539">52</xref>

</p>
<p>Higher educational institutions are also using computer-based education as an important method of instruction. The Sloan Consortium survey, most recently published in 2008, reports that 20% to 25% of all students in US colleges enrolled in at least 1 online class in 2007.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066611429539">23</xref>
</sup> Sharing of educational resources is becoming increasingly common as more higher learning institutions are taking part in the open educational resources movement. Starting with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) OpenCourseWare in 2002, millions of educational creators and users have been sharing resources. In fact by 2007, 1800 MIT courses were freely open to the public.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885066611429539">54</xref>
</sup> These courses allow users around the world to sign up for courses, and then they are able to watch videos of the actual MIT instructors and have access to homework and exams as were given in the actual course at MIT. No credit or degrees are given for completing the courses. MedEdPortal has very similar goals and is the closest equivalent that we have in the medical field to this sharing platform.<sup>

<title>Internet-Based Learning in Critical Care Medicine</title>
<p>In light of the continued duty-hour restrictions, the decreased teaching and mentoring opportunities available in medical education today, and the limitations in actual patient care experiences, which make the acquisition of clinical competency based on the volume–outcome relationship particularly challenging, especially in critical care medicine, Internet-based experiential learning would be exceptionally valuable as an adjunct to postgraduate medical training. The benefit of simulating low volume, high-risk events and its appropriateness for the adult learner makes Internet-based learning aptly suited to the critical care provider.</p>
<p>There are many Web sites available online that are targeted to teaching topics applicable to the critical care physician utilizing a variety of educational modalities. These educational modalities can be divided into several groups with examples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885066611429539">Table 1</xref>

</list-item>
</list>There is a significant amount of knowledge and a specific set of skills that must be learned for a critical care provider to be able to manage the common diseases and procedures that are seen and performed in the intensive care unit. Additionally, clinical decision making and teamwork training must be learned in order to become a proficient intensivist. Although there is no substitute for hands-on training and experience in real-life situations, a well-designed, diverse Internet-based critical care curriculum may be an important supplement to clinical training. The learning of common diseases and their pathophysiology can be learned utilizing Web sites containing text, images, lecture-based, and just-in-time educational modalities, which is already in common practice in the medical field. Medical devices use can be enhanced by Web sites containing case-based scenarios of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mechanical ventilation simulation is also currently available, but further modifications to enhance realism and integration into case-based scenarios could provide added benefit. The development of dialysis and ECMO simulators might also be useful. Procedural skills have traditionally be taught either in a medical simulation center or on actual patients but perhaps could be learned by game-based educational tools, for example, the development of handheld gaming devices that detect movement and simulate procedures such as central line placement or endotracheal intubation. A medical-grade version of a device such as Nintendo’s Wii console could possibly provide this kind of training, although the costs of developing a tool like this would be quite significant, and the realism of the procedure is likely to be a limiting factor especially in training a clinician for more than just the very basic, initial skill set. Medical avatar or case-based training of clinical scenarios may help in teaching more advanced skills such as clinical decision making and teamwork training. Modeling medical case training after the DOD’s game-based combat training, which utilizes multiple users around the global to complete a mission, might allow multiple care providers around the world to work together via the Internet to care for a critically ill patient in a virtual environment. Breakaway’s Pulse is a single-user version of complex clinical decision-making training in use currently. Similarly, the use of high-fidelity medical simulation has been successful in teaching teamwork training and the use of multiple users caring for a sick patient via the Internet might also provide education in team training. Finally, the use of Web 2.0 capabilities including blogs, wikis, sites to upload educational tools (protocols, videos, etc), and other social networking modalities may allow for easier dissemination of best practices and sharing of ideas in critical care.</p>

<p>We identified 6 articles that specifically evaluated the use of Internet-based learning for training health care providers in topics and skills related to critical care medicine, which emphasize the potential for using Internet-based learning in critical care specific topics and skills. Cochran and colleagues studied the administration of an online burn care module to medical students and interns in surgery and emergency medicine and evaluated the time spent, successful completion, and satisfaction with the module. Trainees were given access to the module online and asked to complete the module, postmodule exam, and satisfaction survey. There was no comparison group. Although the numbers are small, the mean exam score was high (no pretest or posttest comparison) and the scores correlated with the length of time spent completing the module. Additionally, most trainees reported that they would like to use a similar format to learn other topics related to surgical care.<sup>

<p>Belda and colleagues investigated the ability of a Web-based intervention to affect clinical practice and the compliance with recommended clinical guidelines for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Heath care providers (critical care specialists, residents, nurses, and respiratory therapists) in the intensive care unit were asked to participate in a survey which required then to report about current clinical practices regarding the care of patients with ARDS, that is, utilizing a low tidal volume strategy, using neuromuscular blockade. Actual patient data were also collected addressing the same clinical practices prior to 6 months of the survey. A repeat survey was sent asking again about clinical practices and included hypertext links that provided summary information about current clinical practice guidelines for ARDS management. Patient data were again collected for 6 months following the survey and hypertext administration. There was a very low survey response rate (35% for the initial survey and only 15% for the second survey) and a small amount of patients identified with ARDS (23 patients preintervention and 22 patients postintervention). Patients were more likely to receive low tidal volume ventilation following the administration of the survey with hypertext links than did prior to the intervention. There was no difference in positive end-expiratory pressure, neuromuscular blockade, use of total parenteral nutrition, or hospital mortality between the 2 groups.<sup>

<p>Xiao and colleagues evaluated surgical and emergency medicine residents compliance to utilizing sterile technique for central venous catheter placement following the use of an online training course incorporating video compared to paper instruction or no instruction. Central line placement by residents was videotaped for a 4-month period. Attending surgeons blinded to the training received evaluated the compliance with sterile technique. Even after controlling for specialty, years of training, site of insertion, and number of catheters placed, residents who had received the online training course had significantly more compliance with sterile technique than those residents who had received either paper instruction or no instruction.<sup>

All participants were tested both by a prewritten and postwritten examinations and by prepractical and postpractical skill demonstrations in the management of a difficult airway, such as how to place a laryngeal mask airway. There were no statistically significant differences in the pretest scores between groups in either the written or the practical skill tests. There were significant gains in knowledge in both the written and the practical skills tests following the course, and there were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of their knowledge gains.

<p>Heinrichs and colleagues studied the capabilities of virtual world or avatar-based training to teach principles of crisis resource management to medical students and first-year residents in emergency medicine. Trainees were randomized to receive crisis resource management training utilizing a traditional hands-on medical simulation or avatar-based training. They developed a virtual emergency room that allowed trainees to practice leading the emergency team to care for critically ill patients. In addition to the 4 training courses, all trainees were given precourse and postcourse cases in which they asked to lead the emergency team caring for the patients. Trainees in both groups were scored on behavior components of emergency medicine crisis resource management (EMCRM rating scale). The EMCRM rating scores showed statistically significant improvement precourse and postcourse for both groups, but there was no difference between groups in terms of team training behavioral gains. This suggests that teaching team training skills via a virtual world environment may be feasible. They also created virtual environments simulating mass casualty events and initial hospital care, assessed satisfaction scores from case-based scenarios in these environments. These results were positive in which users thought avatar-based training was effective and would be useful for training, allowed the users to feel immersed in the training (ie, suspending disbelief), and increased the confidence of users to respond to mass casualty event.<sup>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Internet-based learning holds the promise of enhanced flexibility, learning modules uniquely structured to meet the need of the adult learner, and the ability for practicing patient care, especially those patient situations which are low volume and high risk. This educational modality seems perfectly matched to complement the traditional hands-on learning that occurs in the critical care environment, as a blended-learning strategy. More work is needed to develop innovative Internet-based educational resources for the critical care physician, which includes interactive components to actively engage the learner and assist in training the hands-on skills needed in critical care. There are important challenges to the development of robust Internet-based education platforms, principally the currently prohibitive cost of development. Nevertheless, Internet-based learning has the potential to provide dramatic transformations of educational practice and become a vehicle for leveling of access to knowledge and information on the care of critically ill patients across the world.</p>
