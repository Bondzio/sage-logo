<abstract>
<p>This case study reveals the development and action research work of a student in a newly designed educational doctorate aimed at preparing scholarly and influential practitioners. Data were gathered from a research journal, field notes, email correspondence, observation, and dissertation work, and analyzed with a constant comparative approach. Results tell the story of leadership development and action research that discovered the failure of professional development, the importance of teacher efficacy, and ways to build efficacy with knowledge and feedback. Findings from this case have implications for program developers and doctoral students wishing to become action researchers and agents of change.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the Education Doctorate (EdD) has been plagued by a lack of identity and because of this, its usefulness has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464960">Levine, 2007</xref>; Perry, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464960">Perry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464960">Perry, &amp; Imig, 2008</xref>). Lacking an identity caused <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464960">Shulman, Golde, Bueschel, and Garabedian (2006)</xref> to call for a restructuring of the EdD and warned that without rethinking, the EdD would continue to be seen as little more than a “PhD lite” (p. 27). As a solution, these authors proposed the creation of a professional practice degree. In 2007, Levine responded to this idea by saying it would be an “impossible mission for schools of education.” To Levin, schools of education are burdened with cash-flow problems, embrace too many political agendas, and are resistant to change. However, he also acknowledged that a distinction between degrees could be beneficial for the field of education.</p>
<p>Fortunately, change is occurring. Since 2007, the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) and its university affiliates have been working as a community of practice to reenvision, redefine, and reclaim the EdD as a distinct professional degree for the next generation of school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464960">Perry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464960">Perry &amp; Imig, 2008</xref>). Thanks to the work of CPED, EdD programs are now graduating scholarly practitioners, that is individuals who have the ability to blend their practical wisdom and professional knowledge to identify, frame, and solve the problems of practice they face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464960">CPED, 2010</xref>). Second-generation EdD programs like those developed by CPED institutions are situating themselves at the intersection of the profession, the workplace, and the university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464960">Lee, Green, &amp; Brennan, 2000</xref>). These EdD programs emphasize the workplace as a laboratory of practice, focus on the interface of theory and practice, offer flexible delivery systems, and support students with signature pedagogy focused on practice and scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464960">Boud &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464960">Scott, Brown, Lunt, &amp; Thorne, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As an affiliate of CPED, our college has been working to develop our EdD in leadership and innovation. The mission of our program is to prepare scholarly and influential practitioners who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they need to solve the problems of practice they face. As faculty designed our program, we relied on CPED’s principles and our own ideals. We hope our students become educational leaders who uphold access and excellence, collaborate with their constituents, turn theory into practice, and inquire into their work. We consider these to be the themes that run through our program, and an elaboration of them can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942775112464960">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Program themes are the faculty’s vision of who we hope our students will become, and to achieve them, students take core courses focused on leadership, change, innovation, and social justice (our professional core), and research courses focused on action research, mixed methods, and applied research. Our students are midcareer professionals who work full-time in varying positions. Some are teachers (elementary, middle, high school, community college, college), some principals (elementary, middle, and high school), some administrators (superintendents, directors), and others work in varying jobs (e.g., counselor, librarian, academic specialist, elderly care specialist, teacher of nurses, Department of Education employee). Given our program’s mission, themes, and coursework, we expect students will remain in the field and become leaders of change.</p>
<p>However, doctoral students working toward change often need support, and one way we do this is with leader–scholar communities (LSC), a signature pedagogy in our program. LSCs are formed the 2nd year students are in the program. A LSC comprises five to six students and two faculty members, one serving as dissertation chair and the other a second committee member. LSCs meet regularly, learn together, and support each other intellectually, socially, and emotionally. In LSCs, students take on an apprenticeship role as they conduct action research in their workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464960">Amrein-Beardsley et al., 2012</xref>). As apprentices, students work on authentic problems of practice and perform multiple cycles of action research with faculty and peer feedback and support. Early cycles of research and scholarship are novice-like, but with practice, students gain the tools, skills, and discourse they need.</p>
<sec id="section1-1942775112464960">
<title>The Action Research Dissertation</title>
<p>Our other signature pedagogy is an action research dissertation for which students must</p>
<list id="list1-1942775112464960" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>find a problem of practice they want to resolve,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>take action informed by scholarship,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>investigate the action systematically and methodically,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>reflect on what this means to participants and themselves as leaders, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>report the results to a stakeholder audience.</p></list-item></list>
<p>We believe these steps develop scholarly and influential practitioners because of the philosophy behind action research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464960">Herr and Anderson (2005)</xref> pose that action research is conducted by or with insiders but never on them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112464960">McKernan (1988)</xref> describes action research as “a form of reflective problem solving, which enables practitioners to solve pressing problems in social settings” (p. 6). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464960">Kemmis and Wilkson (1998)</xref>, action research is a series of self-reflective cycles that include planning, acting, reflecting, and determining one’s next steps. Due to its local and cyclical nature, action research often becomes a means of personal and professional growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464960">Hendricks, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As educators work on problems of practice, they question their epistemological beliefs, create new identities, and gain a sense of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112464960">Zambo, 2011</xref>). School leaders who perform action research become socially responsible, reflective agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464960">Levin &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). They challenge assumptions, question hierarchies, and work for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464960">Atweh, Kemmis, &amp; Weeks, 1998</xref>). Because they are close to the problem, action researchers have a bird’s eye view. They watch actions carefully, listen to voices of those close to the problem, and collect data as evidence. Action researchers have the potential to transform their practice, their relationships, and the situations in which they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464960">Herr &amp; Anderson, 2005</xref>). The use of action research for these purposes in dissertation work makes sense and has been purported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464960">Herr and Anderson (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464960">Coghlan and Pedler (2006)</xref> who argue that action research in educational leadership programs prepares the leaders our schools need. The remainder of this article brings these ideas together. It explains the action research dissertation work and the development of Shelley, a student enrolled in the second-generation, CPED-influenced EdD program. Data to understand Shelley’s case were gathered by the second author (S.I.) as she worked with Shelley in her LSC. A case study approach is appropriate for this work because people are cases in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464960">Jarvis, 1999</xref>). Cases provide insight not easily gained in other ways, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464960">Guba and Lincoln (1981)</xref> suggest there are four reasons to conduct case study work. These include (a) recording developmental changes, (b) describing what it is like to experience a situation, (c) understanding roles and expectations, and (d) testing and experimenting with new ideas. These authors also note that case study work can be beneficial to both practitioners and researchers if it provides thick description, is grounded in theory and context, is holistic, and contains data gathered with integrity and care. Case studies have the potential to illuminate meaning and communicate this meaning to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464960">Yin, 2003</xref>). However, case study is only beneficial with reflection and much work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464960">Creswell (2009)</xref> contends that to build an in-depth case, a researcher must gather an array of data over a period of time. These ideas are incorporated into this study. Data were multifaceted and gathered over the 2 years the second author (S.I.) and Shelley worked together in a LSC. Data comprised the researcher’s journal, field notes, email correspondence, an observation, and Shelley’s dissertation. The researcher’s journal contained reflections made by her on students in her LSC (including Shelley), field notes gathered during LSC and individual meetings, and emails. To gain a more in-depth picture of Shelley’s work, parts of her dissertation (the context, innovation, methodology, analysis, and conclusions) were included in the data set.</p>
<p>These corpus of data were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. The analysis proceeded inductively by reading and rereading each data source, creating an electronic database, developing initial codes, generating categories from codes, combining categories into themes, and positioning themes within theoretical frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464960">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2007</xref>). However, to be valid, a case requires internal validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464960">Jarvis, 1999</xref>). Analysis must be ongoing, and findings must be discussed throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464960">Creswell, 2009</xref>). This was the case in this work. Analysis was ongoing with a constant comparative approach. An audit trail was developed, and findings are reported in a straightforward and sincere way. However, even with these precautions, results from this case cannot be generalized to other individuals or other programs.</p>

<title>Shelley’s Problem and Beliefs</title>
<p>Shelley was an instructional coach at a Title I high school in the southwestern United States. Shelley’s school was unique because the economic housing boom caused hyper growth. It opened in 2008 with 1,172 students and 44 teachers; 3 years later, it had 2,400 students and 104 teachers. Fortunately, Shelley’s district worked to foster teacher development. Every Monday, students were released 2 hr early, and teachers were given an opportunity to work together at their school on curriculum and content area needs or they were given districtwide professional development focused on an array of best practices. The district tried to help its teachers advance professionally, but teachers in the district seemed confused by the mix of training and felt discouraged by the one-shot initiatives they were expected to implement. At the same time, legislation like No Child Left Behind and state standards were raising the bar for teacher accountability and effectiveness. Principals and coaches, like Shelley, were required to conduct walk-through observations, and these observations were not always good. District data showed that even though teachers were being exposed to professional development opportunities, there was no evidence that what was being learned was transferring into their practice. A districtwide survey found that teachers felt the professional development they were receiving was too short and too broad. Teachers felt they did not have time to digest what was being learned and they did not feel efficacious enough to transfer what they were learning in professional development sessions into their practice.</p>
<p>As an instructional coach, Shelley reflected on her practice and asked herself what she could do about this situation. Her question became more pressing as the stakes of accountability became more prominent at her school. To assess the effects of professional development on teachers, Shelley conducted scheduled and unannounced observations, and provided either on-the-spot coaching or emailed feedback about what she had observed. Shelley wanted to help teachers transfer best practices into their teaching but based on what she observed, she was not sure how sure as to what she needed to do. Shelley realized she was helping some teachers, but she also knew many were being left out. Shelley wanted to improve her practice. Fortunately, some changes occurred at her school.</p>
<p>In 2009, Shelley’s principal hired a consultant (Larry) to conduct professional development on student engagement. Shelley found Larry’s ideas fascinating because he was going to use a cyclical approach in which teachers focused on one strategy at a time and reflected on what they learned. Shelley liked the idea of a cycle and felt the reflective piece was key. Instead of providing one-way feedback at the end of an observation, like she typically did, Larry was going to use dialogue to help the teachers solidify and feel empowered by what they had learned. Hearing this, Shelley knew she wanted to learn from Larry and work with him. This became the focus of Shelley’s action research dissertation. She set out to understand what the literature said about professional development, cognitive coaching, and teacher efficacy; so that she could design and implement the innovation she needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1942775112464960">
<title>Literature Review: What Shelley Learned</title>
<p>Almost every school improvement plan includes provisions for professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464960">Guskey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464960">Newmann, King, &amp; Youngs, 2000</xref>). These plans are typically based on the assumption that teachers with knowledge and skills equate to student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464960">Hord, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464960">Miller, 2003</xref>). Yet, developing effective teachers is not always simple or cheap. One-shot professional development rarely works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464960">Anderson, Herr, &amp; Nihlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464960">Hall &amp; Hord, 2006</xref>). Instead, research shows that professional development needs to be comprehensive and cyclical because these factors help teachers learn deeply, have time to practice, and in the process, gain mastery and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464960">Fullan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464960">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464960">Knight, 2009</xref>). Teacher efficacy is important to teacher retention and effectiveness. Efficacy, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464960">Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy, and Hoy (1998)</xref>, is a teacher’s belief in his or her capability to organize and execute courses of action required to successfully accomplish a specific teaching task. Teachers with a high sense of efficacy are open to new ideas, willing to try new strategies, set high goals, and persist through setbacks and times of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112464960">Goddard, Hoy, &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2000</xref>). Because efficacy matters, instruments have been developed to measure it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464960">Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy’s (2001)</xref> Teachers Sense of Efficacy Scale is one. This instrument has high reliability and consists of three subsections: student engagement, instructional strategies, and classroom management.</p>
<p>Efficacy matters to teachers and researchers have identified a number of variables related to its development like ongoing and clear feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464960">Fullan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464960">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464960">Guskey, 2002</xref>). Good feedback lets teachers know how they are doing and what they need to do to improve. Good feedback from a coach can lead to improvement and change. Coaching comes in many forms, but cognitive coaching is one of the most effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464960">Knight, 2009</xref>). Cognitive coaching is based on metacognition, or being aware of one’s own thinking, as a means to foster learning. Cognitive coaches use three types of conversations. A planning conversation focuses on the goals one hopes to achieve and the indicators of success one would like to use. A reflective conversation encourages teachers to analyze their actions, construct meaning, and commit to a new strategy. In this type of conference, coaches engage in active listening and instead of telling, they paraphrase. The third type of conversation is about problem solving. In this type of conference, the coach strives to get the teacher to change. To do this, a coach uses data and questions to encourage a shift in perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464960">Costa &amp; Garmston, 2002</xref>). Each conversation type is unique, but they all rely on a coach providing useful feedback.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464960">Tschannen-Moran et al. (1998)</xref> contend that the feedback coaches provide functions as social persuasion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464960">Speck (1996)</xref> notes that teachers need to receive feedback regarding their performance as they attempt to implement strategies learned in professional development. Effective feedback is timely, specific, and focused on specific needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464960">Veenman &amp; Denessen, 2001</xref>). Effective feedback builds self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, Shelley and Larry decided to work to develop useful professional development. Larry had his typical format, but he was new to the school and was unsure how to make it fit in this context or how it would be received. Shelley knew the teachers at her school, but she was wondering about the feedback she typically provided. Given these commonalities and needs, Shelley decided to investigate the effectiveness of Larry’s professional development cycle, the reflective conferences he used, and her own feedback style. Larry’s professional development would take place weekly over 3 months. Teachers would see Larry’s model as an engagement strategy, learn how to manage the class when they used the strategy, have an opportunity to practice the strategy, and then discuss what they learned. At the end of each session, teachers would be given time to plan a lesson that incorporated the new strategy, and it was understood that Shelley, Larry, or Dayna (the other instructional coach) would observe the lesson and provide feedback. Wondering about the benefits of feedback to promote transfer to classroom practice, Shelley decided to collect data on the reflective conferences Larry used as well as on the feedback she traditionally gave. She divided teachers into two groups. One group, the <italic>traditional group</italic>, would receive the feedback Shelley typically provided, short on the spot comments and emails. The other or <italic>reflective group</italic> would participate in a 15-min reflective conference with Larry. In these conferences, teachers would receive feedback about their strategy implementation and be asked to reflect on what they did. Shelley’s research questions became the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1942775112464960" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What will teachers think of the new professional development cycle used to help them learn engagement strategies? Will using spaced trainings and the support structures of modeling, practice, and feedback help teachers transfer engagement strategies into their practice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Will teachers implement and transfer the engagement strategies learned in this new process into their practice and will this change their students’ engagement over time?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Will the efficacy of teachers in the <italic>traditional group</italic> differ from the efficacy of the <italic>reflective group</italic>?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1942775112464960">
<title>Shelley’s Method</title>
<p>A total of 14 teachers were a part of Shelley’s study. In all, 4 of the teachers were new to the profession (had 5 years or less experience) and the other 10 more seasoned (5+ years of experience). The education of the teachers ranged from newly received bachelor’s degrees to master’s degrees. There were 3 male and 11 female participants, and their ages ranged from 22 to 43.</p>
<p>Shelley’s action research study used a mixed methods design. She used two quantitative instruments: Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464960">Tschannen-Moran &amp; Woolfolk Hoy, 2001</xref>) and a portion of the district’s observation protocol. The Efficacy Scale was administered online during the first professional development session and readministered at the end of the study. The engagement portion of the district’s protocol was used to conduct two (20 min) observations prior to and after training. Scores on this instrument could range from eliciting minimal engagement (less than 85% of students engaged), eliciting engagement (85% of students engaged), and eliciting mandatory engagement (100% of students engaged). To establish inter-rater reliability, Larry, Dayna, and Shelley talked, compared scores, and came to consensus. The observation form can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1942775112464960">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Shelley collected qualitative data with teacher journals, open-ended survey items, and field notes. Teacher journals were used to gather participants’ thoughts about the professional development they were receiving, the strategies they were implementing (successes and challenges), and the feedback they were receiving. Teachers completed two journal entries (midway and end). The prompts given were as follows:</p>
<p>Midway</p>
<list id="list3-1942775112464960" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Describe your experience using the engagement strategies you learned. Explain your successes and challenges.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Did the strategies affect your ability to motivate students? Explain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Did the strategies affect your ability to manage students? Explain.</p></list-item></list>
<p>End</p>
<list id="list4-1942775112464960" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What strategies have you attempted to utilize in your class since our last meeting?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What successes and challenges have you had with the strategies?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do these motivate your students who typically show low interest?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The open-ended survey items were designed to explore teachers’ efficacy related to student engagement, instructional practices, and the feedback they received. Five questions were asked:</p>
<list id="list5-1942775112464960" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Do you feel you implemented any of the engagement strategies at a mastery level? If so, what support did you receive that helped? If not, what support could have been offered to help you implement the strategies more effectively?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What opportunities did you have to engage in reflection? Did these opportunities affect your transfer of skill? Describe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What helped you to transfer the strategies you learned, in training, into classroom practice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has your ability to engage students changed as a result of your participation in this training? Explain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do you feel you have more strategies to engage students than you did before the training? Explain.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Field notes were collected to gain a more in-depth view of the entire process and provide a strategy for Shelley to reflect on her leadership skills and own practice. Using these tools, Shelley was able to answer each of her research questions.</p>

<title>Shelley’s Analysis</title>
<p>Responses on the Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale were entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and descriptive and inferential statistics run. Qualitative data were analyzed with grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464960">Glasser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>Shelley began with open coding and then developed codes to mark important concepts, meanings, and idea. She then collapsed and combined codes to develop categories of meanings. To clarify these, she organized them onto a matrix described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464960">Scott and Howell (2008)</xref>. This allowed her to understand what, when, where, why, and how events in her innovation evolved. After this, Shelley used axial coding to make assertions. Selective coding was then used to develop the story line.</p>

<sec id="section6-1942775112464960">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In response to her first research question, Shelley discovered that the teachers in her study valued the professional development cycle. Journal entries and field notes showed the teachers liked the fact that the trainings focused on student engagement and were spread across a 3-month period. According to the teachers, remaining on engagement strategies afforded opportunities to practice what they learned and that practice helped them assimilate and internalize what they learned. Having time in the trainings to develop a lesson was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Support structures were also mentioned. The teachers felt the modeling they saw Larry perform, the management tips he provided, and the feedback he and the other coaches gave was useful. The management tips were appreciated by all the teachers, but novice teachers expressed a greater appreciation because they often encounter difficulties when they try new strategies. Interestingly, the teachers also liked the observations because they felt that being observed forced them to transfer what they learned into their lessons.</p>
<p>Observations were used to examine whether teachers were implementing and transferring the engagement strategies leaned into their practice and whether this changed their students’ engagement over time (Research Question 2). All data were tallied and numerically compared pre and post. When the initial observations were conducted, groups were very similar. In the <italic>traditional group</italic>, two teachers were observed eliciting minimal engagement, four were seen eliciting engagement (85% or more students engaged), and one made the learning mandatory (100% engagement). The <italic>reflective group</italic> had two teachers eliciting minimal engagement, five engaging 85% or more of their students, and zero making engagement mandatory. However, on the post-observation, the <italic>traditional group</italic> did not exhibit the same growth as the <italic>reflective group.</italic> They had two remain in the minimal category, one remain in the 85% category, and four move to making engagement mandatory. In contrast, in the <italic>reflective group</italic>, all improved a level. They had zero eliciting minimal engagement, one engaging 85% or more of their students, and six making engagement mandatory. One teacher in the <italic>reflective group</italic> moved two levels from initially eliciting minimal engagement to making engagement mandatory for all students. Field notes gathered by Shelley and notes on the observations showed that teachers in the <italic>traditional group</italic> were more likely than the <italic>reflective group</italic> to confuse the steps of the strategy or merge steps together. Data showed teachers in the <italic>reflective group</italic> did better and attributed this to the reflective conferences. In the reflective conferences, coaches were able to get teachers to think about their instruction, and quickly and on the spot address any of their specific concerns. Interestingly, journals and field notes showed that <italic>who</italic> gave the feedback and support was important. Both groups mentioned the importance of feedback, but the <italic>traditional group</italic> noted that instead of coaches, they would be more likely to turn to their colleagues for support. To them, peers helped them come up with solutions. In contrast, the <italic>reflective group</italic> noted the importance of feedback and support from coaches. Especially important were discussing what went right and wrong; reminders as to what to do, when, and how; and encouragement and belief that they could implement the strategies effectively. Feedback from coaches helped teachers understand how they were doing, and this was noted to have an enabling effect. The <italic>reflective group</italic> associated coaches and reflection, and they liked this idea because they knew the coaches had good insight and were able to help them fix problems. When asked what supported their transfer of the engagement strategies reflecting on their actions was key.</p>
<p>In response to her third question, Shelley found that the teachers’ efficacy rose and there were subtle differences by groups. The Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale was administered pre and post to understand whether the teachers’ efficacy would differ based on the type of feedback they received. Mean scores for both groups rose but increased more for the <italic>reflective group</italic>. However, tests of significance showed no difference. Open-ended items provided a finer grained perspective.</p>
<sec id="section7-1942775112464960">
<title>Efficacy and Engagement</title>
<p>At the end of the 3 months, 57% of the teachers in the <italic>traditional group</italic> and 67% in the <italic>reflective group</italic> felt efficacious about their ability to engage students. Those in the <italic>traditional group</italic> felt the trainings opened their eyes and helped them understand the importance of targeting students who participate less. Those in the <italic>reflective group</italic> also believed themselves to be better at engaging students after the training but drew a stronger connection between their actions and how they helped or hindered students’ engagement. Teachers in the <italic>reflective group</italic> made more efficacious statements about their abilities and noted that the professional development they received and the reflective conferences changed their behaviors and helped them understand that they were responsible for their students’ success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1942775112464960">
<title>Efficacy and Instructional Practices</title>
<p>At the end of the trainings, all participants felt efficacious about their practice. Professional development in student engagement helped teachers learn new strategies and have a variety of strategies. To the teachers in this study, having more strategies equated to better lessons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1942775112464960">
<title>Efficacy and Classroom Management</title>
<p>At the end of training, 57% of teachers in the <italic>traditional group</italic> and 67% in the <italic>reflective group</italic> felt efficacious about classroom management. Teachers in the <italic>traditional group</italic> viewed themselves as having good management prior to the trainings but admitted the trainings helped enhance what they knew especially in terms of responding to discipline problems during a lesson. There was similarity in thought in members of the <italic>reflective group</italic>. They were grateful to learn the engagement strategies and felt the additional information on classroom management enhanced their ability to conduct smooth running lessons. Teachers in the <italic>reflective group</italic> came to see themselves as capable of managing students’ behaviors. This idea led to more intentional behaviors and perceptions of better classroom management.</p>

<title>Reflecting on Her Practice and Dissertation Work</title>
<p>Shelley engaged in a cycle of action research aimed at making her a more effective instructional coach. To do this, she worked with Larry as he provided professional development and provided a type of feedback that was different from Shelley’s. Shelley listened to the voices of teachers to discover whether these actions were beneficial and whether they raised teachers’ efficacy. The survey, journals, observations, and her own field notes helped Shelley learn about the importance of her role. Doing an action research dissertation in her workplace became in Shelley’s words “personal.” In the “Lessons Learned” section of her dissertation, she wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>My professors wanted me to look at a problem that existed in my world. They wanted me to learn about it, find out what the experts said, and then do something about it! This study has ultimately impacted my practice as well as how I see the world around me. Perhaps the biggest lesson I have learned, and one that will forever impact my practice, is the idea of looking at situations from multiple perspectives and truly digging into the data. Prior to engaging in this process I was more apt to implement practices based on what I was told was effective. Through this process I have heard the voices of the participants and learned a valuable lesson that will make me a better coach and research practitioner. I realize that finding answers is my responsibility, and then it is my responsibility to act from an informed position and do something about it!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Shelley’s story and data gathered on her development by the second author (S.I.) show that Shelley is graduating with a very different and specialized set of skills. Shelley knows how to use theory and research, take action, and implement and lead change. These abilities are making EdD graduates of newly designed programs unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464960">Perry, 2011</xref>; Perry &amp; Imig, 2010).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1942775112464960">
<title>Returning to the EdD and Action Research</title>
<p>Since its inception, the EdD has suffered from a lack of identity and its need has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464960">Levine, 2005</xref>). Some have called for the elimination of the EdD, whereas others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464960">Perry &amp; Imig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464960">Shulman et al., 2006</xref>) have called for a new vision and design. Working with CPED, our college has used its ideas and our own to develop our program. We strive to prepare scholarly and influential practitioners or individuals who have the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they need to resolve problems of practice and improve their local situations. Utilizing a case study approach, this statement now has backing. Yet, as we move forward, our faculty and others redesigning EdD programs must continue to take a hard look to see whether we are achieving our mission and goals. The ultimate question we must ask ourselves (and gather data to prove) is, “Are our students really making a difference? Are they committed to solving real-world problems? Do they remain in leadership positions and use the knowledge, skills, and dispositions gained as part of their doctoral work to solve problems of practice?” Shelley’s case begins to answer these questions and offers an opportunity for both celebration and critique.</p>
<p>Shelley’s story shows that she developed into an active leader. Shelley did not just investigate a problem or focus on a problem chosen by her chair. She found an authentic problem in her workplace that had meaning to her and those around her. As an EdD student, Shelley used the research skills and theory she learned at the university in untraditional ways. Instead of simply reading theory and research articles, she had to select ideas carefully and consider how they could be applied in her situation. Shelley had to blend her professional knowledge with the scholarship she reviewed to understand the failure of professional development; the importance of comprehensive, cyclical, and informative professional development; and ways to build efficacy with knowledge and reflective feedback. Blending theory and practice, Shelley discovered, framed, and developed an innovation. She built her action on the best theories available and in doing this, theory became applicable, useful, and real to her. Wanting to understand whether her innovation mattered, Shelley collected data in a systematic and organized manner. Because she had data, Shelley was forced to stop, look, and listen carefully to what the teachers were doing and what they had to say. Shelley’s data confirmed and disconfirmed her ideas and helped her understand the next steps she needed to take. Being an action researcher helped Shelley transform her practice, relationship with teachers, and workplace. So even though the number of participants in her study was small and her findings cannot be generalized, Shelley’s work tells a compelling story, has real characters, and contains an authentic voice that shows the challenges coaches and teachers face every day. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464960">Herr and Anderson (2005)</xref> note that doctoral committees often reject action research dissertations because they contain small stories. Stories cannot be generalized, and bias can seep into them. There are drawbacks to students doing action research in their workplaces, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464960">Shulman et al. (2006)</xref> note, EdD programs should treat the practice part of students’ lives as a wellspring of inspiration. The use of students’ experience in the field should make their doctoral study richer and more powerful, and data from Shelley’s case show this is possible.</p>
<p>The debate will go on, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464960">Perry (2011)</xref> notes, change will only happen when colleges of education change. Students like Shelley are graduating from newly designed second-generation EdD programs, and they have a very different set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions. EdD graduates are remaining in the field, leading, and enacting change. One year after graduation, Shelley remains in the field and has become the principal of a local elementary school.</p>
