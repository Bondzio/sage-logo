<abstract>
<p>Living with an incurable illness such as HIV/AIDS is a stressful experience. However, many HIV-positive individuals are able to maintain their emotional well-being. This begs the question of what strategies these individuals employ to allow them to do so. In this article, we examine how Thai women living with HIV/AIDS learned about their health status, what feelings they had, and how they dealt with the illness. In-depth interviews were conducted with 26 women in central Thailand. The women adopted several strategies to deal with their HIV status, including taking care of themselves, accepting their own faith, disclosing their HIV status to family, and joining AIDS support groups. These strategies can be situated within the “living positively” discourse, which helped to create a sense of optimism to combat the HIV epidemic among the women. Additionally, the acceptance of their HIV status played an essential role in the meaning-making process because it assisted the women in sustaining the equilibrium of their emotional well-being.</p>

<p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic has entered its third decade, and continues to be a major public health problem worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421680">Norman, Abreuc, Candelariad, &amp; Sala, 2009</xref>). It has tremendously affected women around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311421680">Zhou, 2008</xref>). Of the 33.4 million people worldwide who were living with HIV/AIDS in 2008, 15.7 million were women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421680">Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS], 2009</xref>). In Asia, the AIDS epidemic continues to grow, and compared with 1.7 million in 2003, at the end of 2005 the number of women living with HIV was estimated at 2 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421680">UNAIDS, 2005</xref>). Thailand is one of the Asian countries that have been hit hard by the epidemic of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Ever since the diagnosis of the first case of AIDS in 1984, the epidemic has risen rapidly, and it now affects people from injecting drug users, sex workers, heterosexual men, their wives, and sexual partners to the infants of infected mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421680">Singhanetra-Renard, Chongsatitmun, &amp; Aggleton, 2001</xref>). Currently, about 1 million Thai people are living with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421680">UNAIDS &amp; World Health Organization [WHO], 2008</xref>). Although Thailand has successfully reduced the spread of HIV among female and male sex workers and their clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421680">McCamish, Storer, &amp; Carl, 2000</xref>), the number of HIV-positive pregnant women has steadily increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311421680">Ruxrungtham &amp; Phanuphak, 2001</xref>). In 1998, there were approximately 23,000 HIV-positive women who gave birth in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421680">Siriwasin et al., 1998</xref>), and around 26% of HIV-infected women in Bangkok had HIV-negative partners. In 2007, there were 250,000 HIV-positive women, aged 15 and over, living in Thailand (UNAIDS &amp; WHO). Similar to women in other parts of Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421680">Ainsworth, Beyrer, &amp; Soucat, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311421680">Ruxrungtham, Brown, &amp; Phanupak, 2004</xref>), Thai women contracted HIV from having sex within monogamous relationships with partners who engaged in high-risk behaviors (Siriwasin et al.).</p>
<p>Living with HIV/AIDS signifies the need to deal with numerous emotional challenges resulting from compound losses, anxieties, fears, self-blame, and social stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner &amp; Meiring, 2006</xref>). Culturally, HIV in Thai society is still perceived as a “death sentence.” Because physical and moral appearances are important in Thai society, shame is therefore experienced by Thai people infected with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421680">Bennetts et al., 1999</xref>). The continuing high rates of HIV/AIDS and the shame and stigmatization attached to the epidemic are due mainly to inadequate knowledge and understanding of the infection and its transmission among Thai people. Although living with an incurable illness and feeling uncertainty about one’s own health condition is a very stressful experience, many HIV-positive individuals are able to maintain their emotional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421680">Pakenham &amp; Rinaldis, 2001</xref>). This begs the question of what strategies these individuals employ to allow them to do so (Plattner &amp; Meiring). In this article, we examine the strategies that Thai women living with HIV/AIDS used to deal with their health condition.</p>

<title>Living Positively Discourse: Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Living positively discourse has been adopted to explain positive living among those with disabilities and illnesses, but it is particularly advocated for people living with HIV/AIDS. The discourse makes use of a specific “narrative account of life with HIV” to alter the damage brought to one’s life by an HIV diagnosis into a rational story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>, p. 56). The narrative is not “creative story making,” but a means for an individual living with HIV/AIDS to reconcile the new reality within the existing prospect of his or her life. It emphasizes the ability of an individual living with HIV/AIDS to boost “self-fulfillment” in spite of the hardship associated with being diagnosed with a life-threatening health condition. This can be accommodated through changed actions and understandings characterized as “positive living advice” (Levy &amp; Storeng, p. 56).</p>
<p>For many individuals, in particular those who lack or have limited access to sufficient health care, adopting positive living advice offers a possible means to change the course of HIV/AIDS. It is suggested that healthy diet, exercise, sufficient sleep, stress decrease, preventive actions (such as using condoms to prevent the reinfection of HIV), and proper health care seeking will enhance immune functioning of the body and hence postpone the inception of opportunistic infections and AIDS. Within the positive living discourse it is theorized that the potential for individuals to participate in these behaviors is made possible by their “open and accepting attitude toward HIV” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>, p. 56). This can be achieved by revealing one’s HIV status to others, such as family members and friends, and participating in AIDS support groups where the discourses of positive living are often discussed and emotional and social support can be obtained. The living positively discourse contests not only “the image of the culpable AIDS sufferer,” but also “the assumption that an HIV diagnosis leads to an inevitably rapid demise” (Levy &amp; Storeng, p. 56).</p>
<p>Living positively is essential for people living with HIV/AIDS because it contests the disapproving social interpretations of the disease. It is now known that HIV/AIDS has “a polysemic concept” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>, p. 59). The disease produces the disruption of the “embodied experience” of those living with it. It implies not just a continuing decline of the bodily immune reaction, but has dealt with diverse meanings connected with sexuality, class, gender, and ethnicity. This led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311421680">Treichler (1988)</xref> to refer to AIDS as “an epidemic of signification.” Moral judgments such as good and bad, right and wrong, and responsibility and danger have been implanted within the social interpretations of HIV/AIDS (Levy &amp; Storeng). All too often, being infected with HIV is connected with promiscuity, unruly behavior, and other types of discriminated-against, “risky” conduct. As such, AIDS is seen as being produced by “a moral failure” of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421680">Brandt &amp; Rozin, 1997</xref>). Once labeled as such, these individuals are disconnected from other identity groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421680">Schoepf, 2001</xref>). By definition then, they are despoiled and stigmatized (Levy &amp; Storeng). Living positively allows individuals living with HIV/AIDS to fight against the negative images of the disease and hence be able to deal with their conditions and environments in a more positive way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we contend that to be able to live positively, individuals are required to make meaning of their life circumstances. Here, the discourse of “meaning making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner &amp; Meiring, 2006</xref>) becomes relevant. The concept of meaning making was theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421680">Park and Folkman (1997)</xref> within the broader framework of stress and coping theory. According to Park and Folkman, meaning making is “a psychological process” which elucidates how individuals construe acutely traumatic and potentially destructive incidents that occur to them. Often, on encountering a shocking and stressful experience, people pose the question of why it happened to them. In the process of looking for underlying explanations, people “construct meaning from the event.” Park and Folkman theorized that meaning making can be perceived as both “part of coping” and “an outcome of the coping process,” which individuals experience when dealing with stressful incidents. Meaning making can be different and can change over time. This depends on the person’s broad outlook toward life and the personal significance that an event has for him or her. However, it is only through meaning making that people are equipped to cope with stressful, life-changing events. Those who cannot make meaning out of specific experiences would have difficulties dealing with them (Park &amp; Folkman). According to Plattner and Meiring, meaning making discourse assists us to understand how individuals handle the situations of living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>This article is based on our larger project, still in progress, exploring the experiences of women living with HIV and AIDS who have participated or are participating in drug trials in Thailand (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421680">Liamputtong, Haritavorn, &amp; Kiatying-Angsulee, 2009</xref>). Because of the epidemic of HIV infection and AIDS in the country, numerous clinical trial centers have been established in Thailand. These trials are supported by international organizations and agencies in developed nations, mainly the United States. The HIV/AIDS Collaborative Center was established in 1990 within the Ministry of Public Health in Nonthaburi, located on the periphery of Bangkok. It is a joint venture of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand. Most clinical trials in Thailand are carried out in general and specialist hospitals, and medical schools at the provincial, regional, and national levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421680">Chokevivat, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A qualitative approach was adopted in this study. This approach was appropriate because qualitative researchers accept that to understand people’s behavior, we must attempt to understand the meanings and interpretations those people give to their behavior. This approach is particularly appropriate when the researcher has little knowledge of the researched participants and their world views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421680">Padgett, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we aimed to examine the lived experiences of women living with HIV and AIDS, descriptive phenomenology was adopted as our methodological framework. Descriptive phenomenology allows researchers to understand the issues under study from the experiences of those who have lived through it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421680">Carpenter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421680">Norlyk &amp; Harder, 2010</xref>). Therefore, descriptive phenomenology permitted us to examine the experiences of HIV-positive women and how they dealt with HIV and AIDS. Within the phenomenological framework, in-depth interviews are usually adopted to generate data. In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews and some participant observation with 26 Thai women.</p>
<p>Purposive sampling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421680">Morse, 2006</xref>) was adopted; that is, only Thai women who had experienced HIV and AIDS and who were participating or had participated in HIV clinical trials were approached to participate in the study. The participants were recruited through advertising on bulletin boards at hospitals where drug trials have been undertaken, and personal contacts made by the Thai coresearchers, who had carried out a number of HIV and AIDS research projects with Thai women. In conducting research related to HIV and AIDS, the recruitment process needs to be highly sensitive to the needs of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311421680">Stevens, Lord, Proctor, Nagy, &amp; O’Riordan, 2010</xref>). The sensitive nature of this research guided our discussion of how we would approach the women and invite them to take part in the study. We directly contacted potential participants ourselves only after being introduced by our network members or gatekeepers. We also relied on snowball sampling techniques; that is, our previous participants suggested others who were interested in participating. We enlisted the assistance of leaders of two HIV and AIDS support groups to access the women in this study. We also took part in the activities of the groups as part of the methodology of our study.</p>
<p>The number of participants was determined by theoretical sampling technique, in which recruiting is stopped when little new data emerges, and this signifies data saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421680">Patton, 2002</xref>). The sociodemographic characteristics of the women were as follows: The majority of the women were aged between 31 and 40 years; 4 were under 30 years of age and 5 were over 40 years. Most of the women (25) were Buddhist and one was Muslim. Nineteen women were living with their new partners at the time of the interview, 1 was married, 2 were divorced, 2 were widowed, and another 2 were single mothers. Twelve women had only primary school education, 11 had finished secondary school, and 3 had vocational college training. At the time of the interview, 7 women worked as outreach health workers, 6 were self-employed, 4 were office workers, 5 had casual employment, 1 was unemployed, and 3 women were homemakers. All of the women except one were mothers; 13 women had two children, 12 had only one child, and 1 woman was pregnant when she was interviewed. Twenty-three women had children who were HIV negative and 3 women did not know about the HIV status of their children. Twelve women had family income of less than 5,000 baht (about US$160) per month, and 12 received an income of between 5,000 and 10,000 baht (between US$160 and $322); only 2 women had a family income of more than 10,000 baht. Eighteen women were covered by “30 Baht Scheme” health insurance (sponsored by the government), 7 were under the “Social Security Scheme,” and 1 had no health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted in the Thai language to maintain as much as possible the subtlety and any hidden meaning of the participant’s statements. Prior to the commencement of the study, ethical approval was obtained from the Faculty of Health Sciences Human Ethics Committee, La Trobe University, Australia, and the Ethics Committee at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Before making an appointment for interviews, the participant’s’ consent to participate in the study was sought. After a full explanation of the study, the length of interviewing time, and the scope of questions, the participants were asked to sign a consent form. When we participated in the women’s activities (to conduct participant observation), they were informed that it was part of our research and there was no separate informed consent obtained for this method. Each interview took between 1 and 2 hours. Each participant was paid 200 Thai baht as compensation for their time in taking part in the study. This incentive is necessary for a sensitive research because it is a way to show that research participants are respected for their time and knowledge.</p>
<p>With permission from the participants, interviews were tape-recorded. The tapes were then transcribed verbatim in Thai for data analysis. The in-depth data were analyzed using a thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421680">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>). In this method of analysis the researcher aims to identify, analyze, and report patterns or themes within the data. Initially, we performed open coding, in which codes were first developed and named. Then, axial coding was applied, which was used to develop the final themes within the data. This was done by reorganizing the codes we had developed in new ways by making connections between categories and subcategories. This resulted in themes, and they were used to explain the lived experiences of the participants. The emerging themes are presented below. In presenting the women’s verbatim responses, we use fictitious names to preserve their confidentiality and protect their identity.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732311421680">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Several themes emerged from the interview data. These themes are discussed according to a sequence of events that reflects the lived experiences of the participants.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732311421680">
<title>Learning About HIV-Positive Status</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421680">Singhanetra-Renard et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421680">Maman, Cathcart, Burkhardt, Ombac, and Behets (2009)</xref> have shown in their studies, most women in our study learned about their HIV status through their contacts with health services. Most often it was during pregnancy—when they went for an antenatal checkup, referred to as <italic>fak thong</italic> in Thailand—that they were told by health professionals that they <italic>pen AIDS</italic> (had AIDS):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I knew about it when I was two months pregnant. Because I came to fak thong at hospital that I learned that I pen AIDS. When I was told about it, I first felt so sad, because it should not have happened to me like this. (Ajchara)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nataree was suspicious of her illness about 13 years previous to interview, when her husband was still alive, but she never went for a blood test. Even after his death, she was still unsure if she had contracted the disease from her husband. After living with a new partner she became pregnant, and it was through antenatal care that she learned about her HIV status:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I became pregnant with my new partner’s child so I went for a checkup. After the checkup, they told me to come back for a counseling session, and that was the time they told me that I had a virus, and they asked me if I wanted to take antiretroviral drugs which would prevent me passing the disease to my baby.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other women learned about their HIV status through contact with health professionals for other health issues. One woman had to have surgery to remove a lump in her uterus. After a blood test, she was told that she had AIDS. Other women only came to know about their HIV status when their husband or partner became very ill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311421680">
<title>Women’s Feelings Upon Learning of Their Diagnosis</title>
<p>The inevitability of being confronted by death, sooner or later, and the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS, make the disease “one of the most feared of all diseases” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner &amp; Meiring, 2006</xref>, p. 241). Hence, being informed that one is HIV positive is often met with feelings of shock and emotional devastation. Most people respond to HIV diagnosis with feelings of shock, and many have ideas of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421680">Jirapaet, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421680">Maman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, Draucker, &amp; Suwansujarid, 2007</xref>). In Maman et al.’s study, many participants were “emotionally unprepared” when informed about the diagnosis of HIV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421680">Sanders (2008)</xref> also found in her research in the United States that most women were extremely shocked, frightened, and sorrowful on learning about their HIV status. This was mainly because they believed they would die soon. In our study, Puangchompoo said she was shocked about the bad news, and she cried for 3 nights because she believed she would die very soon. Meena said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I knew the result that I was HIV positive, I was so shocked. I walked out without any real feelings, but only the thought that I had no more hope in this life. I could not speak, and <italic>nam ta tok nai</italic> [my tears were coming down inside me]. I went home and told my husband that the doctor found AIDS in me. He was also shocked and said nothing; just kept quiet.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these women, being told they had HIV was a disruption of “the taken-for-granted conceptions of self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>, p. 58). The positive diagnosis of HIV produces what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421680">Pierret (2000</xref>, p. 1590) referred to as a “watershed” that unravels the “before” and “after” life of most HIV-positive people. Kesaree remarked,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I could not say a word after hearing what the doctor told me. I only cried and cried because I could not accept it. It was my first pregnancy. And I was only selling my groceries at home, never went out to mix with people. I could not accept that I have the disease. From that day on I could not eat even though I was pregnant. And I was so stressed out. I was losing weight because I could not eat, and because of the stress.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of the women also felt puzzled about their HIV status. They were housewives who stayed home to look after the family and had never been promiscuous; in their minds they could not have contracted a serious disease like HIV. When Naree, who was told about her HIV status when she went for the antenatal checkup of her first child at a hospital, was asked how she felt when she was told, she remarked,</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<p>Many women have thought of or attempted suicide after being diagnosed with HIV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner and Meiring (2006)</xref> found in their study that the participants considered committing suicide after learning about their HIV status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421680">Bennetts et al.

<p>When the doctor told me about it I cried, because I was so sad that why it happened to me. I was so sad because I did not expect that I would get the disease.

I did not know what I should do, so I <italic>kit san</italic> [thought of shortening my life]. (Ajchara)</p>

<p>Sinjai went further than Ajchara in trying to kill herself. She jumped from the second floor of her house, but she and her baby survived:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I walked out from the hospital and I did not cry. When I got home, I did not think about anything else. On the way home, in a train, my husband asked me what was the matter with me, but I said nothing. I was thinking about what the nurse said to me, that I must be the one who got the disease and passed it on to my husband. I was thinking a lot. When my husband went outside the house, I jumped from the second floor. I was seven months pregnant then, but nothing happened.</p>

<title>Living Positively: Dealing With the Illness</title>
<p>Once it was confirmed that they had HIV, the women attempted to deal with the disease in diverse ways.

<sec id="section7-1049732311421680">
<title>Taking care of self</title>
<p>Once they were sure that they had HIV, most women tried to take care of themselves to prolong their lives. Eating healthily, exercising, and not thinking too much about the health condition and life were means of living positively. Wasana said that she would do a few things to look after herself:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I have got time, I will rest. I will take rice and milk on schedule. I will eat fruits and vegetables; in fact, anything that will make me healthy. I used to have CD4 166 [referring to T lymphocytes], but now it has increased a lot. Now, it is 400. It has come up a lot, because the doctor advises me to eat lots of vegetables, fish, meat, and milk. I have, and my CD4 has increased a lot. My doctor says that I was great.</p>

<p>My cousin took my husband to take <italic>ya tom samoon prai</italic> [brewed herbal medicines]. If people told us that there were good medicines somewhere, even [if] it was far away from my home, my cousin would take him there and I would also go, because I wanted to be cured from this disease.

<title>Accepting faith</title>
<p>Thai Buddhists see HIV/AIDS as “a disease of Karma (<italic>rok khong khon mee kam</italic>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421680">Jirapaet, 2001</xref>, p. 26). Research in Thailand revealed that people living with HIV/AIDS believed that their suffering from AIDS was a consequence of their own karma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421680">Kobotani &amp; Engstrom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, Draucker, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit &amp; Suwansujarid, 2007</xref>). Most women in our study perceived that their HIV status was brought on by their own <italic>wen kam</italic> (karma). In Thai culture, wen kam refers to a bad or evil deed that the person has committed and therefore causes disastrous consequences. The law of karma is that every action, be it good or bad, has its consequences. The outcomes are inescapable, but might happen immediately or long afterwards, or even in subsequent lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, Draucker, et al., 2007</xref>). From the strong belief in the law of karma among Buddhists, it follows that the state of an individual’s present existence is the consequence of his or her karma accumulated in previous lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421680">Klunklin &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>); the more good deeds are accumulated from a past life, the better and happier the state of being will be experienced in the present one. The opposite holds true for bad deeds, and usually this results in wen kam of an individual.</p>
<p>Meena talked about this when she told us about how she contracted HIV. She was a single woman and working in Bangkok until the death of her father. Because there was no one to take over the family rubber plantation in the south of Thailand, she returned to her father’s home. As a single woman, it became difficult for her to look after the plantation. Her nephew introduced her to her husband, who was at that time a single man, and after a few meetings she decided to marry him and expected to have children soon afterward. However, her dream was shattered when she contracted HIV from her husband. She spoke about her wen kam:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is really my wen kam that I came across a terrible experience like this. I was living in Bangkok for a long time and nothing bad happened to me, but when I returned to the south and married, I had to deal with this huge problem until I gave birth to my son.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421680">Kobotani and Engstrom (2005)</xref> suggested that their participants’ belief in karma also assisted them to accept that their AIDS was the part of life which is seen as suffering in Buddhism. Connecting their AIDS to karma signifies that they were not the only ones who were suffering; other human beings who live in this life also suffer. Buddhist teachings are employed as a means to help individuals living with HIV/AIDS to “understand and make sense of what AIDS is and how to cope” (Kobotani &amp; Engstrom, p. 18). In their article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, and Suwansujarid (2007)</xref> also suggested that all Thai women believed that their belief in karma permitted them to embrace the reality of their health status, feel more at peace with their condition, take care of themselves, and continue their lives.</p>
<p>Wen kam assisted many women in our study to deal with their life-threatening illness better. In the case of Sinjai, who attempted suicide by jumping from the second floor of her house, the doctor consoled her and told her not to think too much about the disease. In a way, the doctor promoted the “positive living” discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>, p. 59); he offered her some ways that she could deal with the diagnosis and HIV:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The doctor told me that we, as a human being, always get something in our life. If we do not contract one disease now, one day we will get another one. He told me not to think too much about my HIV, and he gave me a lot of counseling and support. He gave me good information about the disease and how to take care of myself. Because of this doctor, I then decided not to kill myself, and also accept my situation. So, I can now live with the disease.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The doctor also suggested that it was her own wen kam that she contracted HIV. The doctor and nurses were all supportive of her, and this helped her not to give up her life and to deal with her illness better. She also realized that she already had the virus and she would not be able to recover from it, so she had to deal with it as best she could, and this stopped her from thinking of committing suicide.</p>
<p>The women also suggested that to reduce their own wen kam in this life and the next, they must perform more good deeds in their present life. This is part of the beliefs of Thai Buddhists. Saijai explained,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because of my wen kam, I suffer a lot from this illness. The monks at my local <italic>wat</italic> [temple] told me that if I want to have a better life and not to suffer like this, I must do a lot of good things in my life now. I have been doing it. I <italic>tham bun</italic> [make merit] a lot nowadays. Whenever I see poor people, I will give them some money. Even though I don’t have a lot, I still want to help people. It is a way for me to tham bun.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, and Suwansujarid (2007)</xref> suggested that the women in their study believed that doing good things in the present life would allow them to be better off later on in this life or the next. Therefore, the women in their study performed many good deeds such as giving alms to Buddhist monks, freeing animals, and giving out money to unfortunate people. These simple actions are commonly carried out by Thai people, including the women in our study.</p>

<title>Disclosure to family members</title>
<p>Literature suggests that people living with HIV/AIDS tend to conceal their health status for fear of being discriminated against and rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421680">Anderson &amp; Doyal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421680">Medley, Kennedy, Lunyolo, &amp; Sweat, 2009</xref>). Somsri said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t tell anyone about my HIV. I don’t want to tell anyone anyway because people will <italic>rang kiat</italic> [discriminate against] me, and they would not want to have anything to do with me. People still have a lot of fears about HIV and AIDS in my community. If they know I have AIDS, I and my family will have a lot of problem living around here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It has been found that some women do disclose their HIV status to their significant others, particularly family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421680">Baumgartner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421680">Dageid &amp; Duckett, 2008</xref>). Some women in our study dealt with the illness by telling their extended family members, and most often the women confided in their mothers. Nataree’s mother, for example, was the first person who knew about her illness:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I told my mother as the first person. We talked about the illness and other things. My mother did not rang kiat [discriminate against] me, but gave me <italic>kam lang jai</italic> [emotional support]. I told her when I was very sick. I did not take any medication, and I had viral infection in my mouth, so I went home and told my mother about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, Draucker, et al. (2007)</xref> suggested that their study participants’ disclosure of their HIV status to family members or partners led to gaining support from them. We asked the women who said they had informed their family members about their feelings on this. Most women expressed that revealing the status of their illness to family members helped them to deal with their health and other issues better than trying to keep it secret. It also made them feel more relieved and less frustrated. Sinjai elaborated on this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I feel <italic>sabai jai</italic> [relieved] from living with the feelings of frustration about not being able to talk about it. It also makes me stronger about my life. If I say anything, they understand my points. They used to question me about what I do and why I do it my way. Like when I was sick often, they thought that I was <italic>sam oi</italic> [being too weak and too lazy to do anything]. But now, if I am sick or have headaches and can’t get up to do anything, or if I am tired often, they understand my situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yardtip also said that telling family members about the illness had helped her to deal with the illness better because she received more support from them:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I was <italic>kread</italic> [had too much emotional stress to deal with], my symptoms became worse. I could not eat and I lost a lot of weight; I was down to 38 kgs. Virus started to creep in and every evening I would have a bad headache. It was so terrible, and I was so thin. So, I decided to tell my sister. After I told her, it was much better. From trying to ignore each other before, we are now much closer. Because she knew about my HIV, she has looked after me. She would ring [telephone] me often. When I was having side effects from ARV [medication], she came to stay and look after me. I think telling your family is good. Before, I would keep everything inside my chest. Now, I can just ring her and talk about my health problems.</p>

<title>Joining AIDS support groups</title>
<p>Joining AIDS support groups has been employed by many people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) as a means to counteract stigma about their conditions and lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421680">Liamputtong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421680">Lyttleton, Beesey, &amp; Sitthikriengkrai, 2007</xref>). This strategy was also used by some women in our study. Belonging to an AIDS support group helped the women to reverse the shame and stigma that come with HIV and AIDS. Collectively, a support group was a means that the women employed to fight against stigma and discrimination that they felt or experienced. Because of the issue of disclosure and social acceptance, most PLWHA tend to seek emotional support from people who share similar conditions, such as other PLWHA, rather than close friends and family (Liamputtong et al.). Belonging to a support group allows PLWHA to access more emotional support from their peers (Levy &amp; Storeng). In our study, it was found that HIV/AIDS support groups provided emotional support to many women. Kanokwan felt relief after joining an HIV/AIDS group because it allowed her to talk to <italic>puag diew kan</italic> [people who had similar experiences]. Learning more about others in the group also made women emotionally stronger about their own HIV status. Wasana remarked,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Joining the group activity is good because I can meet many of my friends there. Everyone in the group looks good [no negative physical appearances], and this makes me have more emotional strength that it is not only me who has got this disease in the world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Support groups offered women more knowledge about the illness and how to deal with it better. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421680">Foucault (1980)</xref> theorized, with more knowledge, individuals believe that they have more power to deal with their situations. Support groups also provided women with a sense of belonging. Women got to know more about others who were in the same situation as themselves; by joining the group, it made them realize that they were not alone in the world living with HIV and AIDS. With more knowledge and a greater sense of belonging, support groups offered the women emotional strength to deal with stigma and their health conditions. Joining support groups created collective power for all of the women, and this collective power allowed the women to defend their conditions and view themselves in a more positive light.</p>

<title>Living Positively: Constraints</title>
<p>Although the living positively discourse is seen as a positive attempt to assist women to deal with their HIV/AIDS, it is not without constraints. As discussed above, disclosure on the part of some women resulted in more support from family members and others. But we also found that some women who disclosed their HIV status to family were discriminated against and rejected by those around them. Orachorn told us,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I told my mother about my HIV, she stopped talking to me. She would avoid me as much as she could. She would separate kitchen utensils and she would not wash her clothes in the same tub as me. She would eat in a separate room. I felt so sad when my own mother rang kiat me like this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner and Meiring (2006</xref>, p. 243) found that some of the participants who disclosed their HIV status to family members and friends received harsh rejection from those whom they told. Ugandan women in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311421680">Withell’s study (2000)</xref> were also rejected by their family after the disclosure of their HIV status.</p>
<p>Most often, the rejection of family members in our study stemmed from a lack of understanding about HIV/AIDS. Isara’s brother and sister-in-law, for example, did not wish to be close to her and her children for fear of being contaminated by HIV. Her children were HIV negative. She remarked,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Talking about my family, I cannot touch my niece. My sister invited my brother and the family for dinner at a restaurant, and my children went with my sister. My brother would not eat anything that day and after that he rang my sister and scolded her for taking my children to the dinner. My brother has a good education and works as a manager, but he is very afraid of this disease. He is afraid that my children would pass it onto his child. My sister told him that my children won’t pass anything on to his child, but he does not believe her. When I was in hospital, my children wanted to see me and asked my sister to take them. My brother told my sister not to take the children to visit me because they might contract the disease from me.</p>

<p>Living positively requires one to take care of oneself by eating healthily and adhering to medication regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>). However, the maintenance of this lifestyle can be challenged by the living reality of the person, particularly for those with few resources available to them. Having good nutrition is claimed to be one of the most efficacious means to maintain sufficient immune functioning (Levy &amp; Storeng). However, many people living with HIV/AIDS are, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421680">Sinhanetra-Renard et al.

For the same reason, some of the women in our study found their attempts to obtain nutritious food for good health met with difficulty. Their living conditions could also impact on adherence with medication, and they had less time to take care of themselves. Additionally, only some women had the luxury of joining AIDS support groups. Many others in our study could not do so because of their family commitments and work. Hence, the living positively discourse could be a constraint for some women living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Living with HIV/AIDS signifies the need to deal with numerous emotional challenges resulting from not only feelings of loss, fear, and self-blame, but also social stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner &amp; Meiring, 2006</xref>). However, many HIV-positive individuals, including the women in our study, are able to maintain their emotional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421680">Pakenham &amp; Rinaldis, 2001</xref>). We have discussed some of the strategies that the women in our study adopted as a means to deal with their health conditions. These include taking care of themselves, accepting their faith, disclosure of their HIV status to family members, and joining AIDS support groups. These strategies can be situated within the “living positively” discourse theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy and Storeng (2007)</xref>. Living positively created “a sense of optimism about combating the HIV epidemic” (Levy and Storeng, p. 56) among the women in our study.</p>
<p>The women in our study not only took an active role in ensuring their own health by taking care of themselves, but also employed more positive attitudes about their life as a way to deal with their HIV status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>). Many women used their religious beliefs to cope with their health condition more positively. According to Plattner and Meiring, for those living with HIV/AIDS, ascribing their HIV-positive status to religion and faith made their health status more meaningful. This ascription not only brings “a purpose to their infection but also hope” (2006, p. 244). The women in our study also attributed their HIV status to their own karma. Religion can be a means for individuals to cope with difficulties in their lives when there is no other hope left for them (Plattner &amp; Meiring). Religion performs a crucial role in the process of meaning making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421680">Park &amp; Folkman, 1997</xref>). Ascribing health conditions to something beyond one’s control, such as karma, is a mechanism that makes the reality of one’s life more meaningful and comprehensible (Plattner &amp; Meiring). The belief that their HIV status was the result of their own <italic>wen kam</italic> was a good rationality for allowing the women in our study to also develop their hope by doing good deeds. Hope allowed them to focus on their future. This was crucial, because it made them not give up on life (Plattner &amp; Meiring).</p>
<p>The living positively discourse dictates that individuals must accept their HIV status and be open about their condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>). This can be achieved by revealing one’s HIV status to significant others such as family members and friends, because this disclosure could also lead to support from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421680">Ross, Sawatphanit, Draucker, et al., 2007</xref>). This was the experience of many of the women in our study. Participating in AIDS support groups, where positive living is often discussed and emotional and social support can be obtained, is another salient aspect of the living positively discourse; many women in our study joined AIDS support groups for this reason. The AIDS support groups in Thailand can be seen to provide “strength” to the positive living dictum. AIDS support groups in Thailand not only act as “a panacea for stigma and alienation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421680">Lyttleton et al., 2007</xref>, p. S49), but are also “the site of communication and empowerment” (Levy &amp; Storeng, p. 62). Support groups offer those living with HIV/AIDS a space to socialize with others who are in the same situation, and form groups which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421680">Alonzo and Reynolds (1995)</xref> referred to as “a community of ‘own.’” Within this new community, people realize that despite their health condition, they are able to assist other HIV-positive individuals with emotional support and knowledge that they have generated from their lived experiences. This creates the opportunity for them to see themselves as “individuals with strengths and resources” rather than as “victims” of HIV/AIDS (Levy &amp; Storeng, p. 62; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421680">De Jager &amp; Kirk, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not all women in our study were able to follow the living positively discourse. Implicitly, the dictum anticipates that individuals would take responsibility to live healthily without considering the social and structural constrictions that might impact on the behaviors of these individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>). A simple task such as consuming nutritious food can be a formidable task for those who are poor. As we have pointed out, although the women in our study attempted to adhere to the “openness rhetoric of disclosure” (Levy &amp; Storeng, p. 61), in reality, for some women disclosure led to rejection instead of support from their significant others. Joining AIDS support groups might seem like a simple thing to do, but not all women could do so because of their family commitments and other constraints in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Notably, after the initial shock of learning about their HIV status, most of the women in our study had accepted this reality. The acceptance of their HIV status played an essential role in the meaning-making process because it assisted individuals living with the infection to be able to sustain the equilibrium of their emotional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421680">Plattner &amp; Meiring, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421680">Park and Folkman (1997)</xref>, acceptance is “a means of resolution” because it propitiates a traumatic life event with the purposes, beliefs, and cultural norms of the individual. Acceptance allows them to be able to manage their conditions because it is they who decide to “make ‘peace’ ” with their life circumstances (Plattner &amp; Meiring, p. 243).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that the living positively discourse was a persuasive narrative strategy adopted by a group of Thai women living with HIV/AIDS. Its power and efficacy is due partly to the social context in which these women were located. Thailand, as with many other poor nations, has been a site for drug and treatment testing, and this has produced space and hope for positive living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421680">Levy &amp; Storeng, 2007</xref>). Because all of the women had participated in drug trials for combating AIDS, and some were on antiretroviral therapy when this study was undertaken, most were relatively healthy, with few HIV symptoms. Most of them were mothers who were also given an opportunity to take part in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV program, and therefore gave birth to healthy babies. Hence, the women in our study were situated in a fertile ground that allowed them to embody the positive living discourse.</p>
<p>Our study was based on a qualitative approach and relied on a small number of participants. Hence, the findings cannot be generalized to cover all Thai women. However, our findings add an extra layer of interest to examining how the living positively discourse functions in Thai society. It reveals that these women were not passive victims, but that they acted according to their own agency to counteract any negativity they might have encountered. As such, the study findings provide a theoretical understanding about the ways women in a non-Western culture deal with HIV/AIDS, which can be adopted as a means to provide culturally sensitive HIV/AIDS care for women living with HIV/AIDS in Thailand and elsewhere.</p>
