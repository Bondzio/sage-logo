<sec id="section1-0017896911422776">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Sexually-transmitted disease (STD) is a facilitating cofactor that contributes to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Previous studies indicated a high prevalence of STDs among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. To date, limited data are available for correlates of STD infection among young migrant MSM in China. The current study intends to examine the association between demographic and behavioral factors and STD infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0017896911422776">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Data were collected from a sample of 307 migrant MSM aged 18–29 years in Beijing in 2009. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the factors associated with a history of STDs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0017896911422776">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Results showed that about 13% of MSM reported a history of STDs. The average number of lifetime sexual partners was 15.0. About 56.7% of MSM did not use a condom at the first sexual encounter. The percentage of MSM who used a condom consistently was 47.4%. Multivariate logistic regression results showed that STD history was positively associated with education, income, the number of lifetime male sexual partners, and negatively associated with the frequency of properly using a condom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896911422776">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>STD history was associated with socioeconomic status and sexual risk behaviors. The results suggested that HIV prevention intervention programs need to educate MSM to reduce the number of sexual partners and to use a condom properly. Furthermore, HIV prevention intervention programs among MSM need to be tailored to meet the needs of different socioeconomic groups of MSM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) cause considerable mortality and morbidity and increase human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422776">1</xref></sup> With the epidemic of HIV, control of STDs has received higher priority throughout the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911422776">2</xref></sup> STD are the facilitating cofactor that contributes to the spread of HIV by increasing risk of infectiousness and susceptibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911422776">3</xref></sup> Empirical evidence has indicated that control of STDs can be an effective strategy of HIV prevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422776">4</xref></sup> To prevent HIV transmission successfully, it is critical to have a better understanding of both behavioral and social aspects of STDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911422776">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>STDs were reported to be eradicated in China in 1964.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422776">6</xref></sup> Since the initiation of economic reform in 1979, there has been an increase in both economic disparity and internal migration and a change in social norms regarding sexuality and sexual behaviors, which has facilitated the spread of STDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422776">6</xref></sup> As of 1980, STDs reemerged and the incidence of STDs has been increasing significantly since then in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422776">7</xref></sup> A systematic review of seroprevalence studies indicated an increase of STD prevalence in both low risk population and high risk population, including MSM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422776">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies have suggested a high prevalence of STDs among MSM in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422776">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422776">10</xref></sup> A study conducted in Chengdu indicated that the syphilis prevalence was 28.1% among 513 MSM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422776">9</xref></sup> A study conducted among 144 MSM in Jiangsu reported a high prevalence for several STDs (i.e. 2.7% for gonorrhea, 8.0% for chlamydial infection, 27.7% for nonchlamydial nongonococcal urethritis, 6.9% for active syphilis, 9.1% for hepatitis B virus infection, 7.8% for herpes simplex virus-2 infection, and 13.2 for genital warts).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422776">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Existing studies also suggested that MSM might play a very important role in HIV/STDs transmission from high risk groups (e.g. HIV-positive MSM) to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422776">12</xref></sup> In China most MSM were married to women due to the social pressure and stigmatization against MSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911422776">13</xref></sup> and many of them practiced high risk sexual behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422776">14</xref></sup> MSM usually had many sexual partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422776">15</xref></sup> and they did not always use condoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422776">12</xref></sup> A study conducted in Chengdu indicated the rates of consistent condom use among MSM were 38.6% with male partners and 17.8% with wife/girlfriend.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422776">9</xref></sup> The study in Beijing reported that 51% of MSM had more than 11 lifetime male sexual partners and the rate of unprotected anal intercourse in the past six months was 49.0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422776">15</xref></sup> A study reported that the percentages of unprotected insertive and receptive anal intercourse in the past six months among MSM were 50.1% and 45.8%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422776">16</xref></sup> The rate of inconsistent condom use during male anal sex in the past six months among MSM in Yunnan of China was 54.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422776">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few studies examined the association of STDs and socioeconomic status among MSM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422776">10</xref></sup> The study conducted among 4,983 MSM in 20 cities in China found that MSM with less education were at a higher risk of syphilis infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422776">10</xref></sup> Data from the United States and South Africa have indicated that migration increased the risk for HIV/STDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911422776">17</xref></sup> and patterns of migration were related to the spread of STDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911422776">18</xref></sup> In China, rural-to-urban migrants often encountered stigmatization due to lower socioeconomic status in the urban destination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422776">19</xref></sup> Rural-to-urban migrants were exposed to the high risk for STDs infection as most of them were at sexually active age, lived apart from their spouses and/or their family, and were more likely to have commercial sex without using condoms compared with non-migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422776">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422776">21</xref></sup> To date, few existing studies have suggested a link between rural-to-urban migration and STDs in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422776">21</xref></sup> Sexual risk behaviors are highly predictive of STD infection. Self-reported history of STDs is a very important indicator of high risk sexual behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911422776">22</xref></sup> A number of studies have indicated an association between STDs and inconsistent condom use during anal sex among MSM in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422776">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422776">15</xref></sup> Data from a study in Shanghai in 2005 showed that syphilis was associated with the number of lifetime male anal sex partners, type of sexual networks and HIV knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422776">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, limited data are available regarding the association of socioeconomic status and sexual risk behaviors with STDs among migrant MSM in China. The factors associated with STDs among young migrant MSM are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to explore socio demographic factors and sexual risk behaviors that are associated with STD history among young migrant MSM in Beijing.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0017896911422776">
<title>Study site</title>
<p>This study was conducted in 2009 in Beijing, the national capital of China with a population of 17 million. Beijing is a city with the largest number of MSM in the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911422776">24</xref></sup> HIV prevalence among MSM in Beijing had increased from 0.4% in 2004 to 5.8% in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422776">7</xref></sup> In 2006, the rates of syphilis and chlamydia infection were 7.0% and 5.6% respectively among MSM in Beijing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911422776">25</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0017896911422776">
<title>Participants and sampling</title>
<p>The recruitment procedure of this study has been reported in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911422776">26</xref></sup> Briefly, participants aged 18–29 years old were recruited via ‘peer outreach’, ‘snowballing’, ‘internet-based’, and ‘venue-based’ sampling methods. Once a potential participant was referred or identified with one of the sampling methods, a local research team member approached the individual to verify the eligibility and to explain the research purpose, potential risk and benefit of participation. The individual was also assured of confidentiality of his participation. Written informed consent was signed if a participant agreed to take part in this study. A total of 317 participants were approached and 311 (98%) agreed to participate in and provided written informed consent. Four participants with substantial missing data in their questionnaires were excluded and 307 remained in the final database of the current study. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both Wayne State University in the United States and Beijing Normal University in China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0017896911422776">
<title>Data collection procedure</title>
<p>Interviewers were psychology faculty members and graduate students from a local university and health workers from a local CDC in Beijing. All interviewers and MSM peer outreach workers received extensive training on research ethics and assessment methodology prior to the survey. Participants were asked to complete a confidential and self-administered questionnaire in a private room in the local CDC or a community medical center in Beijing. Necessary instructions and clarification were provided to participants during the survey. The questionnaire typically took about 45 minutes to complete. Participants received a small monetary incentive (equivalent to US$2) for their participation and reimbursement for their transportation expenses (up to US$5) upon the completion of the survey.</p>

<sec id="section10-0017896911422776">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section11-0017896911422776">
<title>Self-reported history of STDs</title>
<p>Participants were asked whether they had ever had any STDs in the past. This is a binary outcome variable (e.g. 1 = yes, 0 = no).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911422776">
<title>Sociodemographic factors</title>
<p>Participants were asked about their individual characteristics during the survey. These characteristics included age, marital status (never married and ever married), type of residence of original birth place (urban or rural), education (≤ middle school, high school, ≥ college), average monthly income in Chinese Yuan (US$1 = 6.8 Yuan; &lt; 1,000 Yuan, 1,000~1,999 Yuan, 2,000~2,999 Yuan, &gt; 3,000 Yuan). Participants were asked how many months previously they had moved into the current city (i.e. duration of migration). For the purpose of data analysis in the current study, this variable was categorized into four levels using 25 percentile, 50 percentile, and 75 percentiles as the cutoff scores (i.e. ≤ 15, 28, 54 months, respectively). Participants were asked to identify their sexual orientation (e.g. gay, bisexual, uncertain) and years they have had homosexual behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911422776">
<title>Sexual behavior</title>
<p>Participants were asked to report the number of lifetime male sexual partners. For the purpose of data analysis, the number of lifetime male sexual partners was categorized into four groups (≤ 4, 5~14, 15~34, ≥ 35) based on the frequency distribution. MSM were asked whether they used a condom at the first sex with a man (yes/no). They also reported the frequency of condom use in the past (never, occasionally, sometimes, often, always). The proper condom use was measured by a question ‘How often did you put a condom on before penetration’ (never, occasionally, sometimes, often, always).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0017896911422776">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables or Chi-square test for categorical variables was used to examine differences in demographic characteristics and sociodemographic factors between MSM who reported a history of STDs and MSM who did not report such a history. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the factors associated with a history of STDs. Self-reported history of STDs (yes/no) was employed as the dependent variables. Age, marital status, residence, education, income, duration of migration, sexual orientation, condom use at first sex with a man, number of lifetime male sexual partners, frequency of condom use, frequency of proper condom use were used as the independent variables. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for each independent variable in the regression model. Finally, descriptive statistics were used to describe health seeking behaviors, sexual behaviors and condom use during STD infection among MSM who reported a history of STDs.</p>

<p>Multivariate logistic regression analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0017896911422776">Table 3</xref> showed that a history of STDs was significantly associated with education (AOR = 1.935, 95% CI = 1.029–3.639), and income (AOR = 1.603, 95% CI = 1.105–2.325). MSM who had higher education attainment and who earned higher income were more likely to report a history of STDs. There were significant associations between a history of STDs and the number of lifetime male sexual partners (AOR = 1.945, 95% CI = 1.282–2.949), and frequency of proper condom use (AOR = 0.630, 95% CI = 0.418–0.948). MSM with a larger number of lifetime male sexual partners were more likely to report a history of STDs. MSM who always used condoms properly were less likely to report a history of STDs. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, marital status, residence, duration of migration, sexual orientation, and lifetime frequency of condom use did not show a statistically significant association with a history of STDs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study showed that 13% of MSM reported a history of STDs. While this number is alarmingly high, we believe that the actual rate of STDs among this population could be much higher. Besides the issues of underreporting, many young migrant MSM might be simply unaware of their infections/symptoms because of lack of access to health care (including STD testing and diagnosis) in urban destinations or lack of necessary knowledge of STD symptoms. Our suspicion was partly supported by the finding that migrant MSM who had higher socioeconomic status (e.g. higher education attainment and higher income) were more likely to report a history of STDs. This result differed from a previous study in which MSM (including both migrants and non-migrants) with less education were more likely to have syphilis infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422776">10</xref></sup> In the current sample of young migrant MSM, MSM with higher education and higher income may be more likely to have access to STD testing or other medical services. MSM with lower education and lower income may be less likely to have access to the services due to the higher cost of these services. Therefore, within the group of young migrant MSM who might have already been in a difficult financial situation, the lower the income they had, the less like they would seek the testing service, therefore, the less likely they were aware of their STD status even if they had been infected with a STD.</p>
<p>There were some potential limitations in this study. First, the representativeness of the sample is limited. Although we made efforts to recruit a representative sample of migrant MSM in Beijing with multiple sampling methods, the sample remains a convenience sample that may limit our ability to generalize our findings to other MSM populations. Second, both the STD history and behavioral data were collected through self-report and therefore were subject to self-reporting biases (e.g. socially desirable response or error of recall). Underreporting about the history of STDs may exist because some of them were not aware of their STD infection, some MSM did not seek testing, or some of them may have known their STD status but did not want to disclose it. Self-reported STD history has questionable validity that may lead to a false conclusion about the incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911422776">27</xref></sup> However, previous studies provided evidence that having a STD history predicts subsequent infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422776">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study has some implications for health education and HIV prevention programs among MSM. First, educating MSM to reduce the number of sexual partners should be the priority of these programs. Second, it is important for the programs to promote condom use among MSM to focus not only on increasing the frequency of condom use but also on educating MSM to use condoms properly. Third, these programs need to be tailored for targeting migrant MSM with different socioeconomic status since they may have different risk and vulnerability for STD infection. For MSM with lower education and lower income, they may need to increase their awareness of STD risk and to seek STD testing. Fourth, these programs need to strengthen the education on the importance of appropriate and timely STD treatment.</p>
