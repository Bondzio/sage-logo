<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper begins with an intellectual conundrum: The turn to materialism emerging in world politics scholarship promises fruitful ways of understanding power and political life by focusing on agency in the physical world. Yet immaterial information and ‘the virtual’ seem to dominate our lives. How can we understand the relationship between the material and the informational? Does this understanding promise any further insight into agency, power, and world politics? Materiality and information are always inextricably connected, regardless of whether we are speaking of biotic or abiotic things. The focus in this paper is on the materiality (corporeality) and information of the human body as a special case.</p>
<p>I seek to answer these two questions by looking at embodied information and knowing bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829813486413">1</xref></sup> Bodies are not just material things and are not just the physical containers of minds. Bodies are lively,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305829813486413">2</xref></sup> material, agentic, and informational. <italic>Embodied information</italic> is the information contained in the body that can potentially be accessed by others through an act of power. Surveillance is thus a world political practice of power that should be seen as much more complex than simply the gaze of the state on the person. On the other hand, a person sending forth his or her embodied information may also be a powerful act. Bodies are also the means by which information becomes sensible: we understand information from various sources and with various kinds of content through our bodies’ ability to sense. This <italic>knowing body</italic> is also implicated in power. In short, <italic>to control how information flows, how it is extracted from the body, how it is inserted or received, how quickly, and to what end is to have power or to be powerful.</italic></p>
<p>The plan of the paper is as follows. I first provide a model of informational power as a useful intellectual construct. This is then followed by a discussion of three examples of embodied information and the associated practices<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305829813486413">3</xref></sup> controlling the flow of that information that are instances of power in world politics. First, ubiquitous surveillance in the absence of suspicion is enabled by the digitised collection of traits (e.g. digitised fingerprints), that allows governments and other agents to swiftly identify (or misidentify) individual bodies. The second example explores how DNA is used powerfully, from manipulating content toward racist ends (as the critical intervention of artist Paul Vanouse demonstrates), to allowing the collection of and access to large databases of DNA for data mining purposes, to commodification of DNA through patents. The final example of embodied information problematises global practices of transplant tourism and body organs as information. The following section turns to the recipient of information: the knowing body. In this section I explore how information and sensation are implicated in power relations, drawing on two examples: sound and technologically augmented senses. I discuss the use of sound’s physical effects on the body in conflict situations and hip-hop music’s production of emotional attraction to neoliberalism. Technologically augmented senses allow bodies to sense more kinds of things over greater distances and to record more data. The ability of pilots to manipulate drone aircraft is perhaps the most obvious case of relevance of this to international relations, but more quotidian practices, such as people using social media technologies to see and act across borders, is also important for understanding how information flows and who is controlling that flow. Brief concluding comments summarise the findings and return to the question how embodied information, knowing bodies and power are important for our understanding of international relations.</p>
<sec id="section2-0305829813486413">
<title>Informational Power</title>
<p>The starting point of my analysis is to redefine power in terms of control of the flow of information, where flow of information refers to content, velocity (direction and speed), and access. I suggest that the informational model of power that I describe here is <italic>a</italic> way and not <italic>the</italic> way to define power. I argue below that my definition is useful for helping us to understand politics, a pragmatic criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829813486413">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars of international relations have often questioned the nature of power, and the answers they arrive at range widely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829813486413">5</xref></sup> Though realists differ in how they understand power (as relation, as resources, as a characteristic of states, as a fundamental human drive), they in general assume the validity of a plain-text reading of Thucydides’ bromide – ‘The strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829813486413">6</xref></sup> Approaches that stress the relational aspect of power draw on Dahl’s formulation of power as the ability of A to get B to do what it otherwise would not do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829813486413">7</xref></sup> This definition holds for both realists, who tend to emphasise the relative distribution of power, and liberals, who are more interested in outcomes and conditions of Pareto optimality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829813486413">8</xref></sup> Power, for liberals, tends to be a set of capacities or resources, and more is better, regardless of the quantities of power held by other states. Nye’s differentiation between the ‘soft power’ of attraction and persuasion, as opposed to the ‘hard power’ of military force and economic strengths, fits into a liberal model in which changed interests allow for cooperative outcomes under conditions that are fundamentally anarchic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829813486413">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Sterling-Foker and Shinko suggest, realists (and one might add liberals) and postmodern critical theorists see power ‘as a resource that is capable of simultaneously maintaining structures and inducing historical change, but what wields power and why it does so are seen to be very different’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829813486413">10</xref></sup> Critical approaches often rely on the soft Marxian analyses of Bachrach and Baratz,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829813486413">11</xref></sup> Crenson,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829813486413">12</xref></sup> Lukes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829813486413">13</xref></sup> and Gaventa,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829813486413">14</xref></sup> who understand power in terms of social structures (including class) that enable and constrain not only behaviour but also consciousness of interests. Foucault plays a major role in critical approaches, as well, with biopower<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829813486413">15</xref></sup> and power/knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829813486413">16</xref></sup> forming the basis of understandings of power that work on the individual within society and therefore on society as whole. Power in this view is pervasive, inescapable. Feminist IR theorists similarly assume the ubiquity of power and bring to the table another critical perspective: that of how gender and identity constitute the context through which and on which power has effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829813486413">17</xref></sup> Feminist theorists emphasise both the power relations within the scholarly discipline (what ‘counts’ as IR) and the gendered subjectivity of global politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829813486413">18</xref></sup> Further, feminist theorists contest the assumed dichotomy of strong (having power) versus weak (lacking power), noting that all humans and consequently all collectivities of humans, like states are at once empowered to different degrees and vulnerable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829813486413">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>An overlapping approach to the definition of power comes from constructivists, who can fall into realist, liberal, or critical camps. Their question concerns how power comes to be defined as it is and what power does. Guizzini sees a relationship between the social construction of politics as conflictual to power ‘defined in a way to privilege manipulative features in the ‘art of the possible’, rather than the notion of a common good’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829813486413">20</xref></sup> For social constructivists, such as Bially Mattern, a key form of power is ‘representational’. Actors, through communicative exchange, ‘fight over representations of reality’, and the actor that is able to force others ‘[to submit] in word and in deed, to the terms of [the actor’s] viewpoint’ is powerful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829813486413">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Constructivist and critical approaches focus attention on the materiality of realist and liberal conceptualisations of power. What is at stake is the social and inter-subjective meaning that the participants in the dialogue ascribe to their sensing of the material. Materiality of resources matters, but it matters in the context of a set of embodied social dynamics, shared understandings, and understandings that are not shared. Information somehow plays a role.</p>
<p>That information must be connected to materiality in a theory of power is even more apparent in the Information Age. States continue to be important agents, but they are not the sole agents that are powerful. One need only look at the consequences of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula’s use of widely available information technology to produce an anti-Moslem film, <italic>Innocence of Muslims</italic>, and to distribute the trailer via YouTube video. Nakoula’s action to disseminate hateful information sparked rage and violence in the Moslem world. It seems, on the face of it, that Nakoula was, for a moment, powerful, though we can guess that his powerful acts did not result in the outcome that he had intended. Acting powerfully to control the flow of information and having results that coincide with intentions are distinct.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Nakoula story and at the heart of the story about the use of social media and the Arab Uprisings is the sense that information matters in the world, that information acts on people. Violence happens; political change happens. Perhaps, too, if we scratch the surface a bit, interactions that seem to be about material forces acting on people might be fundamentally about information because the only way in which we are aware of material forces is because we have the ability to sense them. And what about the bullet that the kills the unsuspecting, unseeing person instantly, without time for conscious awareness? I think that information has a role here, as well, though my interpretation may be stretched. Information flows through our bodies, most obviously through the electrical impulses that travel along nerves, but also through the chemical signaling that flows in veins, in lymphatic tissue, from cell to cell. A way to think about the cessation of life is a final interruption of the flow of information in the body.</p>
<p>The irony that conventional IR notions of power fail to capture important instances of power that are readily apparent in the Information Age prompts me to offer a tentative reconceptualisation of power, one which works for current circumstances as well as for historical contexts. Power can be understood as the ability to control the flow of information, with flow of information understood in terms of content, velocity (direction and speed), and access. There are numerous points in this system at which content, velocity, or access can be controlled. To exert control over any of these dimensions is to act powerfully. Power manifests as instants of controlling the information flow – by acting on the content, the velocity, or the access.</p>
<p>The model I develop need not involve humans. In theory, a machine could be the recipient of information about some other machine (think of automated control systems), and the recipient machine could have enough (artificial) intelligence to qualify as a knowing recipient. Some other machine – perhaps one with faulty code<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829813486413">22</xref></sup> – could disrupt the flow of information and (arguably) have a powerful (if unintentional) effect on the system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305829813486413">Figure 1</xref> presents a simplified rendering of the flow of information, abstracting from the complex information field<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829813486413">23</xref></sup> in which multiple agents (individuals, ‘the state’, collectivities) are sources and recipients of information. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0305829813486413">Figure 2</xref> expands this model to represent in a slightly more complex way how information might flow among a group of people (Imagine the way information flowed in the Nakoula incident described above). In both these figures, one would represent power as that which affects the content, the velocity (direction, speed), and access at any point.</p>

<p>For this paper, however, I am interested in the endpoints of the simplified system, and specifically in human sources and human recipients. Within a complex field of innumerable information flows among an uncountable number of bodies in a vast social field, we can take the analytical step of isolating a single stream as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305829813486413">Figure 1</xref>: Content flows from a source and to a recipient. What information can be taken from or given by the body of the source? What information can be taken in by or forced into the recipient? How can we conceptualise embodied information and knowing bodies and how will that enrich an understanding of world political practices? The corporeality of the human is central to this analysis and helps to fill what had been a lacuna within international relations theories. International relations happens to bodies – that bodies die as a consequence of global political practices is one obvious example – yet only rarely has the body been problematised within IR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829813486413">24</xref></sup> Scholarship on the body and world politics can be found within critical scholarship, with feminist IR scholarship, in particular, problematising the gendered body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0305829813486413">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The system depicted above could look like an illustration of information flowing through the Internet only. After all, the purpose of the Internet is to enable the flow of information, and several scholars have examined different aspects of how global information flows enabled by the Internet have made various agents more or less powerful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0305829813486413">26</xref></sup> Indeed, I have written about the information and power in cyber environments in part because it is an easy case, but also because it is an important one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0305829813486413">27</xref></sup> There are two distinctions I make in the present work. First, the system illustrated here can be applied widely and does not need to be mediated by information technology. It works in face-to-face interactions, and the sensory rich environment of face-to-face interactions allows for different kinds of content to be moved from the source to the recipient. Second, the emphasis is on the relation of information, power, and corporeality.</p>
<p>The next two sections connect this information flow model of power to bodies, both the source as embodied information and recipient as the knowing body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0305829813486413">
<title>Embodied Information</title>
<p>It is tempting to separate body and mind and (ironically) to locate embodied information in a disembodied mind. I want to resist this temptation and instead consider the body as simultaneously material and informational: all the material is also information; information may also be material. Embodied information flows internally and externally. Internal flow is the body’s communication with itself, but this should not be reduced to ‘thinking’ or internal narration. As the protagonist of a Coetzee story puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>To thinking, cognition, I oppose fullness, embodiedness, the sensation of being – not a consciousness of yourself as a kind of ghostly reasoning machine thinking thoughts, but on the contrary the sensation – a heavily affective sensation – of being a body with limbs that have extension in space, of being alive to the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0305829813486413">28</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Antonio Damasio notes that internal information flows are continual because the living body constantly senses that it is alive and monitors its state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0305829813486413">29</xref></sup> These sensations are fundamental bits of information that the body constantly signals to itself. Internal information flow is recursive, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0305829813486413">Figure 3</xref>. Our internal relationship to the information of our bodies includes conscious comprehension, feelings and sensations that cannot be expressed in words, and information (commands to proteins from our DNA, marching orders of our immune systems, etc.) that operate well out of the range of the ability of our conscious mind to understand or even notice.</p>

<p>Much of this information is in constant motion. One moment we may not be hungry, the next moment we may be. We smell something awful and we feel disgust. Our bodies are constantly sending and receiving information to maintain homeostasis. The information of our minds is in constant motion as well – we think thoughts and narrate to ourselves.</p>
<p>Some of our embodied information moves very slowly within us. Consider eye colour. From day to day it seems constant, yet over the span of a lifetime, it changes. Just as hair loses pigment and becomes grey, eye pigment degrades and eyes change colour. Disease and chemicals can also change eye colour. Nevertheless, it is often thought of as closely linked to the identity of the person – Frank Sinatra as ‘Ol’ Blue Eyes’, for example. Multiple forms of identification require that eye colour be specified, even though linking an identity to a physical characteristic that can change over the lifespan seems short-sighted (pun intended). Eye colour is just one example of a corporeal trait that helps to link a particular body with a larger corpus of information. Bodily traits are one way to configure ‘the I as ID (the socially identifiable Self, with a gender, a job, a driving license, a marital status etc.)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0305829813486413">30</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0305829813486413">
<title>Surveillance and Bodily Traits</title>
<p>Recording eye colour is an instance of moving information from the body and making it available to a recipient. Embodied traits like eye colour do not become instances of control of information flow until observed and transmitted, which is what happens with surveillance. Use of eye colour and other surveillance information for identification purposes requires that the information flow out from the body and be made sense-able to some Other. In Foucauldian terms, surveillance involves both biopower and power/knowledge. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0305829813486413">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biometric measurements and fingerprints are other examples of information about a body that is collected in order to uniquely identify the person at a later time. Having such information is useful for the conduct of surveillance. Fingerprints, according to G.T.C. Lambourne, were described by a botanist named Dr. Nehemia Grew in a 1684 paper in <italic>Philosophical Transactions</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0305829813486413">32</xref></sup> Lambourne traces the first known systems of collecting and organising information from the body in order to help with identifying criminals to Dr. Alphonse Bertillon, Chief of the Identification Bureau in Paris, and Sir Francis Galton in England, both working in the last years of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Bertillon created a system in which habitual criminals had measurements of various parts of their bodies taken. These measurements could then be filed and later retrieved to identify who had committed another criminal act. In 1892, Galton published a book on a way of categorising fingerprints for the same purpose. By 1894, Scotland Yard began using both biometric measurements and fingerprints to identify criminals. The keeping of such records is ‘a “power of writing” [that] was constituted as an essential part in the mechanisms of discipline’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0305829813486413">33</xref></sup> This is just one way in which power, as Foucault explains, produces knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0305829813486413">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fingerprinting and other biometric measurements are now part of world political practices, especially as practices of the state for securing the border and combating crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0305829813486413">35</xref></sup> In her thought-provoking discussion of biometrics and security, Louise Amoore suggests that ‘the allure of biometrics derives from the human body being seen as an indisputable anchor to which data can be safely secured’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0305829813486413">36</xref></sup> In her analysis, the state and the other agents (firms and individuals) charged with collecting the data on behalf of the state are powerful because, in a Foucauldian and Butlerian sense, they govern the body and determine (limit, allow) mobilities.</p>
<p>And one way in which they are particularly powerful is when they misread, misinterpret, or mistake the information in the body. Such errors are reproduced as truth. As Foucault asserts: ‘We are subjected to the production of truth through power and we cannot exercise power except through the production of truth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0305829813486413">37</xref></sup> One such instance occurred in 2004, when Brandon Mayfield, an attorney in Oregon, was wrongly thought to be the source of a latent fingerprint on materials used in the bombing of the Madrid train station despite the fact that he had not been out of the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0305829813486413">38</xref></sup> Fingerprint analysis using data mining techniques (his fingerprints had been transformed into readable, digital images) combined with ‘expert’ analysis led to this false positive result. Weeks passed before Mayfield was cleared. In this instance, agents of the state (the fingerprint experts for the FBI) controlled the flow of information by acting on (corrupting) the content, by inserting unwarranted certainty into the false conclusions they drew from the physical evidence.</p>
<p>The use of data extracted from the body is the common experience of all of us who have been through airport security. As Lauren Wilcox describes, embodied information is made visible, scanable, analyzable through digitisation, and therefore subject to confiscation and transformation by the government. She concludes: ‘The airport security assemblages manage the threats of violence and insecurity by transforming embodied subjects into suspicious flesh that can be dissected digitally in a search for the truth of a person’s safety or dangerousness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0305829813486413">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Configuring the body into an identifiable assemblage of information is essential for global practices of surveillance. While an older set of social practices referred to surveillance as keeping a watchful eye on a suspect person, surveillance, as Gary Marx points out, has been disconnected from suspicion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0305829813486413">40</xref></sup> Everyone is surveilled; every body has information extracted from it through observation, through the recording and digitising of traits like eye colour, through the computer analysis of digital traces of practices (e.g. purchases), and the like.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0305829813486413">
<title>DNA as a Special Kind of Embodied Information</title>
<p>As technologies for analyzing the information of the body have advanced, the role of DNA has become prominent. To be the recipient of DNA information about a source is to have identifying information linking the body to the person. I raise three different kinds of global problems that arise with DNA: the misuse of DNA for racist ends, the large amount of data held around the world and the probability of false positives, and commodification of DNA via patents.</p>
<p>Extracted DNA and scientific manipulation of it easily plays into racist political meanings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0305829813486413">41</xref></sup> In 2007 (and previously), James Watson, a discoverer of DNA, made comments about the genetics of black people and intelligence that were widely understood as racist. After the 2007 incident, he apologised and, according to an editorial in <italic>Nature</italic>, ‘he acknowledged that there is no evidence for what he claimed about racial differences in intelligence. But the damage has been done, lending succour and comfort to racists around the globe’. As the editorial notes, the world’s history of eugenics and racism, studying ‘the influence of genetics on human attributes and behavior’ is risky.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0305829813486413">42</xref></sup> For <italic>Nature</italic>, the risk is that those who are interested in political correctness can use conclusions that scientists arrive at about the influence of genetics for shutting down such research as racist. Yet the other risk – the risk that Watson manifested – remains as well: Despite the widely held understanding among scientists that race is an ‘unscientific word’ (again quoting <italic>Nature</italic>), scientific findings based on DNA can be used to justify racist ideas.</p>
<p>Paul Vanouse, an artist who uses techno-science as a medium, subverts the relationship of DNA and race by racing DNA, quite literally. He writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Over the past few years, I have been specifically concerned with forcing the arcane codes of scientific communication into a broader cultural language. In The Relative Velocity Inscription Device (2002), I literally race DNA from my Jamaican-American family members, in a DNA sequencing gel, in an installation/scientific experiment that explores the relationship between early 20th Century Eugenics and late 20th Century Human Genomics. Specifically, the double entendre of race is intended to highlight the similarities and obsession with “genetic fitness” within these historical endeavors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0305829813486413">43</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The installation projects the progress of the race to the viewers (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0305829813486413">Figure 4</xref>). The irony of the disembodied DNA fragments running a race on an ‘inscription device’ challenges the viewer to re-inscribe meaning to race and the body and to the technology – the device – that is used to measure and evaluate characteristics of (dis)embodied information.</p>

<p>Further, extracted DNA is considered to be reliable information for providing evidence, either damning or exculpatory, of an individual’s guilt, though the degree of reliability is subject to statistical margins of error.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0305829813486413">44</xref></sup> Though global DNA databases may help identify miscreants,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0305829813486413">45</xref></sup> the size of the databases is unavoidably connected to the number of innocents who will be misidentified as guilty. The more data in the database, the greater the number of false positives.</p>
<p>Another aspect of DNA and other forms of embodied information is the degree to which embodied information is commodified and becomes something that is traded globally. To commodify information is to change its content and to restrict access to the content. Myriad Corporation’s patents on isolated genes for breast and ovarian cancer have been the subject of contentious legal proceedings. At stake is whether an isolated piece of a DNA molecule should receive patent protection that would allow the company to restrict others’ use of the patented piece for clinical or research purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0305829813486413">46</xref></sup> Given the global nature of research and development, as well as the global diffusion of US-style rules for patentability, allowing patents for DNA may have a deleterious effect on innovation, contributing to ‘patent thickets’ that hinder other innovators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0305829813486413">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vanouse again provides the ironic critique. His work, <italic>Latent Figure Protocol</italic>, uses electrophoresis to ‘paint’ DNA into images. Of the series of images he presents, the copyright symbol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0305829813486413">Figure 5</xref>) is the most telling. On one level, this works as a simple sight gag: It is funny to see the copyright symbol as a work of art itself rather than as protecting a work of art. But the critique quickly emerges. The image, as a creative work, is itself copyrighted. What about the DNA itself? Presenting the copyright symbol out of genetic material makes the viewer ask about the ownership of that material as well as of the art work it comprises. By using DNA and electric current to paint an image, Vanouse certainly has DNA acting in an innovative and (perhaps) useful way. Should it be patented? In this image, the artist is using DNA from bacterial plasmid pET-11a. How would human DNA (and the viewer’s knowledge of the use of human DNA) have changed the work?</p>

<title>Organs as Information</title>
<p>To be able to own and alienate embodied information is to be able control its flow, particularly in terms of content and access. This can be seen, as well, in the case of global trade in organs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0305829813486413">48</xref></sup> At first glance, organ trade may seem to be nothing more than material: a kidney moving from one body to another. Yet organ transplantation is embedded in a series of informational relations. First of these is the idea of the kidney as, itself, embodied information. It is the body part that knows how to filter the blood and remove impurities. Others of these are webs of information about where to find organs and transplant tourism, medical knowledge about how to conduct transplantation, awareness (or not) of global norms concerning transplantation. Transplant tourism refers to the practice of wealthy but ill bodies going to developing countries and purchasing kidneys from donors who are poor. The purchase of the kidney itself – being able to control the velocity (its direction and speed) of the embodied information (the organ) – is an instance of power. Transplant tourists get organs and they get them faster than they would otherwise. Further, the poor donor may not have true access to information about the risks to him or her from the donation procedure itself and from potential consequent medical issues. The consent will likely not be truly informed. Also, being poor, the donor may not be able to control the velocity (direction and speed) of information in the form of medical expertise that he or she might need in the future. Comparing the ways in which individuals in this case are able to control information flow highlights instances of power and points of powerlessness.</p>
<p>Surveillance and the collection of traits, DNA as information, and body organs understood as information are three examples of embodied information and how information is taken or sent from a source. In the next section, I turn to the recipient of information, the knowing body.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0305829813486413">
<title>The Knowing Body</title>
<p>The relationship of information to the body has to do with the fact that information, to matter, must be received by an agent who makes sense of that information. There are at least three ways to make sense of information, though most of the time making sense involves a jumble of all three. The first is making sense of semantic content. The knowing body with cognitive competence can process words and symbols – in other words, signs – and recognise their meanings. Albert Borgmann is referring to this kind of information when he writes that ‘information has to be a relation of at least four terms: a PERSON is informed by a SIGN about some THING within a certain CONTEXT’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0305829813486413">49</xref></sup> (Translating to my terms: a recipient is informed by content about some source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0305829813486413">50</xref></sup>) His trichotomy of ‘information about reality’ (information in which the sign and the thing are intimately connected – a thundercloud signaling the likelihood of a storm, for example), ‘information for reality’ (information that can be used to produce reality, such as written instructions or maps), and ‘information as reality’ (information <italic>qua</italic> information, such as digitised datasets that are useful because they are collections of information) all fits within the category of semantic meaning.</p>
<p>Second, the knowing body can also make sense of received information through the emotions. Information <italic>moves</italic>, in both denotations of the verb – it moves as it travels across space, and it moves us emotionally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0305829813486413">51</xref></sup> For example, spectacular visual images can invoke emotional responses in the spectator, and awe and excitement can distract the spectators from other information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0305829813486413">52</xref></sup> Research on the embodiment of emotions has focused attention on perceptual, somatovisceral, and motoric experiencing of observed emotion. ‘Taken all together, recent findings provide a scientific account of the familiar contention that ‘when you’re smiling, the whole world smiles with you’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0305829813486413">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third way to make sense of information relies on neither semantic nor emotional meaning, but instead relates to the way the recipient is in the world. I will call this material meaning, though I am mindful that semantic and emotional meanings have material aspects to them as well. Jane Bennett (writing about food ‘as a self-altering, dissipative materiality’) discusses the power of food to change how we <italic>are</italic> in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0305829813486413">54</xref></sup> Though her point is about the agentic power of the non-human, non-living material, we can re-read her examples as informational power. Food that is ingested by the body communicates to the body, i.e. makes the body receive a certain kind of information and changes how information flows within the body itself. The body makes sense of the information through a change in being. As I noted above, physical harm to the body, including killing it, is an example of some outside agent controlling the flow of information, expressed materially as blood, nerve impulses, and other biological processes within a body, which is both the source and recipient of information. When the body receives information properly, the body is healthy. Some kinds of hindrances of information flow signal injury or death. Most of this internal information, with the notable exception of pain, is not something we are cognitively aware of. Nevertheless, the body itself makes sense of the information materially.</p>
<p>How bodies make sense of information semantically, emotionally, and materially can be further explained using the examples of sound and technologies that allow us to augment reality.</p>
<sec id="section8-0305829813486413">
<title>Sound and the Knowing Body</title>
<p>Sound refers to content (what we hear) and to the means by which the content travels (via sound waves, sometimes first mediated by analog or digital technologies). By content of the sound, I refer not just to the specific semantic message that is heard and that the knowing body can translate into a recognised word or melody or scream. The vibration, frequency, and volume of the sound is information as well. Steve Goodman examines ‘sonically provoked, physiological, and autonomic reaction of the body’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0305829813486413">55</xref></sup> His focus is on the way agents use sound to provoke fear in the recipients. In terms of my model, to be able to force the recipients to have access to this sound is an instance of power. Moreover, as Goodman notes, the sound need not be consciously heard and processed by the rational mind. Sound, including inaudible sound, works on the body and can force the body to feel. The body can be knowing even when the mind does not know that it knows – an example of material meaning. Goodman focuses on ‘sonic warfare’, which he describes in terms of a continuum of ‘sonic force’, with one pole as a use of sound to repel or disperse and the other pole as a use of sound to attract.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0305829813486413">56</xref></sup> The sound cannon disperses the rioters, using sound to cause pain. The drumbeats and rhythm of the march (Hup 2, 3, 4!) encourage the army to move forward together.</p>
<p>At times, though, sound carries content that works on a semantic level, moving and convincing through words, melody, and rhythm – and the movement of bodies, as well. Lester Spence, in his analysis of black politics and hip-hop, writes of the ‘circulation’ of hip-hop and the way in which the music is productive of a certain kind of black parallel public sphere. Hip-hop spreads ‘the <italic>neoliberal narrative</italic> across space and the most dominant aspects of black politics across space and time’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0305829813486413">57</xref></sup> Neoliberal causal explanations of life become plausible because of the message carried by the attractive medium of hip-hop. Spence writes that hip-hop and its related embodied reproductions (rapping, DJ-ing, breakdancing, and tagging) ‘affirm … that another reality is possible’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0305829813486413">58</xref></sup> The negative outcome is that this other reality privileges extremes of neoliberal consumption and lack of regulation, leading to criminality and exploitation. In this case, the information in the music acts on the recipient as an emotional attractor to a particular kind of ethical and aesthetic judgment. Artists are able to act powerfully when they control the flow of content and are able to push semantic, emotional, and material meaning at the recipients. The fact that the artist and the recipient are embodied is critical to the way the transmission happens and to its attractiveness to the recipient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0305829813486413">
<title>Augmented Reality and the Knowing Body</title>
<p>A final example of the knowing body takes us into the realm of ‘augmented reality’ (I borrow this phrase from Nathan Jurgensen and P.J. Rey),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0305829813486413">59</xref></sup> which is reality as augmented by technology. Our experience of information – sense data from the world – is dependent both on the ‘wetware’ of our bodies and the technologies we use to further enable our bodies. As we evolve (and we are continually evolving, especially through technology), we add means of extending our senses and sensations, of moving our bodies outward, or perhaps bringing the outside into our bodies and in<italic>corporating</italic> new sense organs. Donna Harraway’s cyborg idea is instructive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0305829813486413">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are two aspects to this: the extension of the senses and the recording of the sense data. The first is typified by eyeglasses. My experience of the world is fully integrated with the quality of my lenses. My reality is augmented beyond what I could sense without them. My computer is another obvious augmentation to my senses. When I ‘visit’ websites, I am the recipient of information, but I receive this information because the technology allows me to ‘go’ to the site. Technologies that extend the senses allow the knowing body to know more. This is important for an analysis of power because the technologies open new ways of controlling the flow of information, especially in this case in terms of access.</p>
<p>The second aspect is in the recording of sense data. The idea is that our brain’s memory cells are not our sole means of recording and preserving information. The technology used to be papyrus, parchment, quills, and the like.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0305829813486413">61</xref></sup> It is now, of course, computers. Camera technology fixes the visual aspects that fixes a moment in time. It too gives us an ability to record information and changes the way the memory of the moment is lived.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0305829813486413">62</xref></sup> Power is implicated here especially in terms of content (the quantity and quality of content) and the velocity (the speed at which information can be accessed), as well as in terms of the other aspects of control of information flow.</p>
<p>The use of piloted drones in warfare depends on the knowing body operating in augmented reality, with extended senses and the ability to record that sense data. Lauren Wilcox understands the relation of the drone pilot through the drone to the targets as a<disp-quote>
<p>redefinition of human bodies in terms of the “posthuman” that makes possible the political conditions of life and death for both the targets and civilians. Specifically, the attempted (but ultimately incomplete) transformation of the human body into an information processor enables a certain moral and political calculus of which bodies “count”. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0305829813486413">63</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The pilot is supported by others who receive the recorded images, who try to use the video to refine strategies, much in the way that game films are used by coaches. A problem not yet resolved is that too much data is being received. <italic>The New York Times</italic> reported that in the US, the CIA and the military have been struggling with too much data to analyze effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0305829813486413">64</xref></sup> The inability to control the volume of content demonstrates a lack of power. In this case, trying to receive the flow of content is like drinking from a fire hydrant. Though few are drone pilots, the overwhelming majority of us are recipients of information via digital technology. Social media, in particular, is alluring to us, and the use of Facebook and other social media continues to rise rapidly. These sites fully incorporate the extension of sensing ability and the expansion of memory retention, leading us to live differently. We sense, remember, and live more widely (I am not sure about more deeply). We are hybrids; we are cyber-humans. As our senses reach out through cyber environments, we become (partially) what Jane Bennett, following Deleuze and Guattari, calls ‘bodies-without organs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0305829813486413">65</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0305829813486413">
<title>Concluding Comments</title>
<p>In short, we are embodied information and we are knowing bodies. We serve as sources and recipients of information. One way to conceptualise power is to understand it as the ability to control the content and velocity of information as well as access to it as information flows from embodied sources to knowing recipient bodies. As we have recently seen (most of us at a distance and through external storage of memory) videos can go viral, and the viral contagion can be for good or ill. The metaphor of contagion brings us back to the corporeality of our informational selves, both as embodied information and as knowing bodies.</p>
<p>The examples discussed here – surveillance, DNA, the global organ trade, sounds for coercion and for attraction, and technologies that augment the human body’s senses – serve as illustrations of why paying attention to the relation of corporeality and information is useful for recognising and analyzing how power manifests in world politics (and indeed, in social relations that are not necessarily global). I have intentionally chosen examples that touch upon topics of world politics in the widest sense – conflict and security, global political economy, global political sociology, global communication. By focusing on embodied information and knowing bodies and how information flows (content, velocity, access), who successfully acts to control the flow and who does not becomes apparent. Who is speeding or slowing the flow of information? Who is taking (accepting/wresting) it from bodies? Who is sending it to (forcing it into/making it available to) bodies? Are such practices affecting bodies as violence or as care or as exchange? Individuals and collectivities can be capable of powerful actions, and micro-instances of power can be seen within a larger global context. However, the argument here is not that states no longer matter in our information rich global environment, since states figure prominently in stories of controlling information flows. States conduct surveillance, they engage in both traditional and public diplomacy, they seek to control access to the Internet, they grant rights to intellectual property, and so forth. States are both sources and recipients of information, and they act powerfully on the flow of information. Rather, the argument I have set forth here is that to look just at the artificial person of the state and other abstractions would be to miss the corporeality inherent in information flow. While not all information of political importance is about some body, our embodied information is important in global politics. Further, knowing bodies (often on behalf of the state) ultimately make sense of content to which they have access. While it may at first seem like we, as embodied information and knowing bodies, have little control over information flow and are therefore powerless, the story is not all bleak. Though others may sometimes act to control the content and velocity of information and our access to it, we are also agents empowered to control the flow of information that swirls around and through our bodies. Our control is not total and could not be, yet there are moments when we can act to exert control.</p>

Coetzee’s Mrs. Costello, who utters these words, is rejecting a Cartesian notion that human rationality is more important or grants moral standing. Instead, she is arguing that animals and humans share the same sense of being-in-the-world and therefore are of equal moral worth. Although I am discussing specifically the embodied information of humans, I am mindful that non-human animals are similarly both material and informational.</p>
