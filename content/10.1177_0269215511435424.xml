<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Memory impairments are one of the most common cognitive deficits reported by people who have multiple sclerosis (40–60%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511435424">1</xref></sup> traumatic brain injury (54–84%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511435424">2</xref></sup> and stroke (about 60%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511435424">3</xref></sup> These memory problems are persistent, debilitating and frustrating, both to the patients and their carers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511435424">4</xref></sup> and are difficult to treat. The safety of such patients can be compromised by memory deficits, making them vulnerable citizens in the home, community and work settings. Memory deficits may also affect the manner and extent to which such patients, who usually have other comorbid conditions, engage with other interventions or rehabilitation. Memory problems consequently can have a devastating effect on the psychological well-being of individuals and others around them,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511435424">5</xref></sup> and have significant long-term effects for patients and their families.</p>
<p>Katz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511435424">6</xref></sup> defined cognitive rehabilitation as ‘a systematically applied set of medical and therapeutic services designed to improve cognitive functioning and participation in activities that may be affected by difficulties in one or more cognitive domains’ (p. 2). Memory rehabilitation is a specialized component of cognitive rehabilitation. The cognitive rehabilitation literature is divided on what strategies work best for people with memory problems. These strategies include restoration (restitution), which aims to improve a specific cognitive function, possibly by forcing a damaged neural circuit to work again, through regeneration or unmasking of silent synapses; or compensation, which focuses on adapting to the presence of a cognitive deficit, possibly by employing other undamaged circuits to perform a task or function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511435424">7</xref></sup> Clinically, restitution is attempted by repeated drill and practice on focused, discrete aspects of a cognitive function, while compensation is achieved by teaching patients to use strategies to adapt to the problem, with the use of prosthetics or environmental manipulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511435424">8</xref></sup> While restitution has been found to be useful in some domains of memory function, such as verbal memory performance (word lists),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511435424">9</xref></sup> it has generally not been viewed favourably in the memory rehabilitation literature. However, as Evans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511435424">10</xref></sup> asserted, this view is ‘largely based on the absence of evidence rather than evidence of absence of an effect of restitution oriented therapies’ (p. 520).</p>
<p>While there has been substantial growth in the number of memory rehabilitation studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511435424">11</xref></sup> systematic reviews of the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation following stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511435424">12</xref></sup> multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511435424">13</xref></sup> and traumatic brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511435424">14</xref></sup> have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of such rehabilitation strategies. These reviews have pointed to the poor quality and quantity of randomized trials in this area, and the diverse manner in which outcomes are assessed, leading to difficulties in converging data into a meta-analysis. Meta-analyses are particularly warranted in memory rehabilitation given the need for large participant numbers in individual trials and the long duration and intensity of interventions, which sometimes lead to attrition. A recent meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511435424">15</xref></sup> examining the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation following acquired brain injury concluded that the results for memory rehabilitation were ‘mixed and weak’ (p. 33). This conclusion was contested by Cicerone et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511435424">16</xref></sup> who claimed that there was ‘substantial evidence’ (p. 519) to support interventions for memory. There are several reasons why this difference in results has emerged, and one of them relates to the type of outcomes considered by the various studies. The diversity of outcomes is not limited to the types of individual tests employed, but also the International Classification of Function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511435424">17</xref></sup> domains they tap, with most only assessing impairment with objective memory measures. As Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435424">18</xref></sup> and Wade and Halligan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511435424">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511435424">20</xref></sup> have suggested, this form of assessment falls short of the aims and spirit of neuropsychological rehabilitation. Cognitive rehabilitation, Wilson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511435424">18</xref></sup> suggested, ‘should focus on real-life, functional problems, it should address associated problems such as mood or behavioural problems’ (p. 99). The discrepancies observed in recent meta-analytic studies suggest that the debate related to the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation is far from over.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of compensation and restitution memory rehabilitation strategies with a self-help control, on an ecologically valid measure of memory functioning. In addition, the effect of intervention on memory, mood, independence in activities of daily living and adjustment was examined. It was hypothesized that the intervention groups would produce better outcomes than the control group, and that compensation training would reduce memory failures in daily life more than restitution.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was advertised among clinicians and through charities, such as Headway, the Stroke Association and the Multiple Sclerosis Society. Posters were also placed in clinics and stroke clubs. Individuals were included if they were over the age of 18, and reported memory problems due to a traumatic brain injury, stroke or multiple sclerosis; having been diagnosed at least one month prior to recruitment and having no previous diagnosis of brain damage or other severe disability. Diagnosis was verified by hospital or general practitioner records. Participants with mixed aetiologies were included to be representative of clinical practice. Participants were excluded if they did not speak English or lived more than 50 miles from Nottingham or Derby.</p>
<p>After informed consent was obtained, all potential participants underwent baseline assessments. These included assessment of language ability (Sheffield Screening Test for Acquired Language Disorders);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511435424">21</xref></sup> pre-morbid intellectual level (National Adult Reading Test);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511435424">22</xref></sup> memory (Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test Extended version,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511435424">23</xref></sup> Spatial and Digit Span subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale – Third Edition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511435424">24</xref></sup> and Doors and People: a test of visual and verbal recall and recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511435424">25</xref></sup>); executive abilities (Trail Making Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511435424">26</xref></sup> and Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test – Victoria version<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511435424">27</xref></sup>); mood (General Health Questionnaire-12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511435424">28</xref></sup>) and disability (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511435424">29</xref></sup>). People with uncorrected visual or hearing impairments which prevented them from completing the assessments were excluded; as were those who did not have a demonstrable memory deficit, defined as an overall profile score of &gt;1 on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test – Extended version.</p>
<p>Participants were informed that their allocation to the type of programme was to be determined by chance. However, if they were allocated to the self-help programme, they had the option of attending an intervention group after they completed the second follow-up.</p>
<p>Randomization was conducted by an independent randomization centre. A computer-generated random number sequence was prepared in advance of the study. Block randomization was used with each cluster comprising four participants, who were able to attend a group at the same time and place. Participants were randomized to one of three programmes: restitution, compensation or self-help. The intervention groups were conducted by research assistants who were trained by the lead author, and all three programmes were documented in a manual to ensure consistency of delivery of sessions across time and groups. The format and duration of all three programmes were comparable. Each session lasted approximately one and a half hours, with a 10–15 minute break. All sessions began with a summary of the previous session, a plan for the current session, and ended with a review of the session, assignment of homework and a preview of the next session. There were 10 sessions in each programme. Homework provided participants with an opportunity to translate what was learned in sessions to their everyday life and to practise the use of memory aids and relaxation strategies. Travel expenses were offered to all participants.</p>
<p>The treatment manuals were developed on the basis of pre-existing workbooks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511435424">30</xref></sup> published studies and by consulting practitioners. Participants in both memory intervention programmes were taught the use of internal memory aids and errorless learning techniques. In addition, those in the compensation group were taught how to use external memory aids. The restitution group engaged in exercises to practise encoding and retrieval, which also included attention retraining exercises, such as letter and number cancellation tasks. People were also taught how to encode specific information using the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions. The self-help group were not taught any memory strategies, but were taught relaxation techniques and ways in which they could cope with their condition. In order to ensure that there was not a substantial amount of ‘memory’ input in the self-help group, and to ensure that the two intervention groups had equal proportions of memory components, which only differed qualitatively (one focusing on restitution and the other on compensation), independent observational time-sampling was conducted on all programmes.</p>
<p>Follow-up assessments were conducted five and seven months after randomization, by an assessor blind to the group allocation, who informed participants at the beginning of the assessment session that they were not to disclose any information about the programmes they attended.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measure was the Everyday Memory Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511435424">31</xref></sup> This is a unitary, self-administered scale which measures slips in ‘normal’ memory function (e.g. forgetting where you have put something). It has good face validity, assesses real-life situations and is used in clinical practice. The secondary outcome measures were the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test – Extended version, General Health Questionnaire-12 and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale. In addition, the Internal and External Memory Aids Questionnaires (based on the Memory Aids Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511435424">32</xref></sup>) were completed to assess the use of memory aids. The Wimbledon Self Report Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511435424">33</xref></sup> was included to assess emotional state and the Mental Adjustment to Brain Damage scale (modified from the Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511435424">34</xref></sup> to assess psychological adjustment.</p>

Analysis was initially conducted on those with complete outcome data. Then a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which missing outcomes were replaced with the last observation carried forward. As there were three assessments, the sample size was small and most of the scales are ordinal, the area under the curve was calculated as a summary measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511435424">35</xref></sup> Results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511435424">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511435424">3</xref>.</p>

<p>There was a significant difference between the groups on the Internal Memory Aids Questionnaire (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). In addition the difference on the External Memory Aids Questionnaire approached significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07) as did the Wimbledon Self Report Scale when using the last observation carried forward to replace missing outcome data (<italic>P</italic> = 0.055).

<p>In order to determine where the significant differences occurred a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used to compare the groups in pairs on the Internal and External Memory Aids Questionnaires and the Wimbledon Self Report Scale for those with completed outcomes. These showed significant differences between compensation and self-help groups on the Internal Memory Aids Questionnaire at both five months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and seven months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010) and on the External Memory Aids Questionnaire at seven months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.049). There were significant differences between the restitution and self-help groups on the Internal Memory Aids Questionnaire at five months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and seven months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011). There was a significant difference between the compensation and restitution groups on the Wimbledon Self Report Scale at seven months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013), indicating that those in the compensation group had a better emotional state than those in the restitution group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results indicate there were no statistically significant differences between restitution and compensation treatment groups and a self-help control group in self-reported memory problems in daily life. However, both restitution and compensation-based memory rehabilitation programmes appeared to lead to an increased use of memory aids. These results suggest that participants learned to use the memory strategies that they were taught in the two memory intervention groups. It is possible that the greater differences seen in the use of internal memory aids was because these had not been taught as part of clinical practice, whereas participants may have previously been taught to use some external memory aids and therefore the effect of intervention on these was less. The effects persisted beyond the end of the intervention, which suggests they continued to be used. It is possible that a consolidation period is required before memory aids can be used efficiently. This is consistent with the aims of the intervention, which was to provide participants with strategies to deploy, depending on their preferences and according to their needs. Participants in the restitution group also developed the use of compensatory strategies. Dirette and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215511435424">36</xref></sup> also observed that 80% of those trained in restoration-type tasks also went on to develop the use of compensatory strategies spontaneously.</p>
<p>The lack of significant differences between groups on the primary outcome measure, the Everyday Memory Questionnaire, may reflect the scoring method used. In this questionnaire items are rated according to the frequency of occurrence and no consideration is given to the importance of the item to the respondent. It may be that the frequency of the forgetting did not change substantially but the use of strategies may have reduced the inconvenience caused; for example, still forgetting to do something, but doing it when prompted by a pre-set reminder on a mobile phone. It may also be that the aspects of memory assessed on the questionnaire do not adequately reflect the daily life activities that change with treatment.</p>
<p>One interesting observation was that the outcome of the restitution group was similar to the compensation group. Although it is difficult to confidently assert the usefulness of restitution, as the differences between intervention and self-help groups were not statistically significant, these results highlight the potential use of restitution as a treatment strategy. Restitution may be an appropriate adjunct to compensation-focused rehabilitation programmes.</p>
<p>There were no significant effects of intervention on adjustment or independence in activities of daily living. This may be due to insufficient power of this study to detect differences. There were, however, improvements in adjustment across all groups, as measured on the Mental Adjustment to Brain Damage scale. This is consonant with findings which observed reduction in some emotional adjustment difficulties, even years after injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215511435424">37</xref></sup> Such improvements may be due to the non-specific effects of attending a group. There was, however, a difference in mood between the restitution and compensation groups, as assessed on the Wimbledon Self Report Scale. This could be a chance finding or it could be that the use of compensation strategies puts fewer demands on the individuals themselves, which is less stressful. In contrast, restitution approaches may require more active attempts by participants to encode information to compensate for their memory problems and this may be more emotionally demanding. This requires further evaluation.</p>
<p>The study design meant it was not possible to ascertain the effect of attending a group. To this extent, future studies should compare memory rehabilitation with a no intervention control instead of a self-help control group, to determine the effect of emotional support on outcomes. A limitation of this study is the clinical heterogeneity of the sample. The aim was to analyse ‘progressive’ and ‘non-progressive’ subgroups, but this was not done due to the limited sample size. However in clinical practice people receive memory rehabilitation in mixed aetiology groups and there was little evidence of a differential effect of memory rehabilitation according to diagnosis at the time the study was designed.</p>
<p>Given the lack of conclusive evidence for memory rehabilitation, it seems that further randomized controlled trials of memory rehabilitation programmes would be useful.</p>
