<abstract>
<p>Cultural resources are the essence of indigenous tourism. Tourist’s sincere attitudes toward indigenous culture are critical to successfully manage and develop indigenous tourism. This study proposes examining the seriousness of tourists toward indigenous tourism to better explore the distinguishing and meaningful subgroups of indigenous tourists. Based on the ‘serious leisure perspectives’ (SLPs), this study first developed a measurement of seriousness toward indigenous tourism and applied it to further segmentation analysis. Study results indicate that indigenous tourists can be divided into three segments: ‘expert’, who are driven by a serious leisure interest (indigenous culture); ‘interested’, who are curious about indigenous appeals; and ‘apathetic’ type, who are not interested in aboriginal culture at all. These three segments differ significantly in terms of marital status, travel motives, and preferences for culture-based tourism product. Managerial implications are drawn based on the nature of SIT and their differences among segments. Finally, this study discusses the application of SLP to indigenous tourism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rapid growth of the indigenous tourism market has attracted considerable scholarly attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711431768">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711431768">Harron and Weiler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711431768">King, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766711431768">Li, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711431768">McIntosh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711431768">Pitchford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711431768">Ryan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe, 1992</xref>). Collections of articles have built upon and extended literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766711431768">Butler and Hinch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766711431768">Ryan, 2005</xref>). Most studies on this subject concentrate on visits to exotic and frequently peripheral destinations, where tourists experience performances, representations, and attractions portraying or presented by small, often isolated, ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711431768">Harron and Weiler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711431768">Smith, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711431768">Ryan and Huyton (2002</xref>) defined indigenous tourism referring to individuals interested in the cultural arts performances, celebrations, destinations, historical sites, and traditions of aboriginal cultures traveling to aboriginal areas to participate in tourist activities. Regardless of how scholars define or distinguish indigenous tourism, they commonly recognize that the primary attraction of indigenous tourism is the cultural exoticism associated with aboriginal areas, including arts, apparel, architecture, music, and dance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711431768">Kiwasaki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe and Keyes, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Although most researchers consider the pursuit of exotic cultural experiences to be the primary motivation of ethnic tourists, in reality, the motivations can be more varied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711431768">McIntosh (2004</xref>) found that Maori aboriginal culture is not the primary motivation for tourists visiting New Zealand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711431768">Xie and Wall (2002</xref>) ranked the preferred activities of indigenous tourists on Hainan Island and found that tourists preferred, in order, architectural styles, dance performances, apparel, children, and natural landscapes. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711431768">McKercher and du Cros, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711431768">Ryan and Huyton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711431768">Xie and Wall, 2002</xref>) have indicated that the aboriginal tourism market is essentially heterogeneous, and distinguishing ethnic tourists from general tourists visiting an aboriginal attraction is difficult because he or she can also be a sightseer, shopper, or loafer. Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce (1999</xref>), in an empirical study of an aboriginal cultural park in Australia, identified four distinct groups of ethnic tourists: ‘ethnic tourist connection group’, ‘passive cultural learning group’, ‘ethnic products and activities group’, and ‘low ethnic tourism group’. These divisions were based on level of interest in various aspects of ethnic tourism experiences and engagement with aboriginal culture.</p>
<p>Serious leisure perspective (SLP) is proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766711431768">Stebbins (1982</xref>) to illustrate the way participants become so substantial and interesting in a sustained pursuit of a leisure activity. Serious leisure activity can provide profound experiences and learning for participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711431768">Baldwin and Norris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766711431768">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711431768">Orr, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766711431768">Stebbins (1996</xref>) had proposed that cultural tourists can be a subtype of serious leisure participants, as they seek profound cultural experiences in both aesthetics and intellect. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766711431768">Stebbins (1997</xref>) noted that serious leisure tourists (or true cultural tourists) and casual leisure tourists (or mass tourists) coexist in cultural tourism destination. This study proposes using Serious Leisure to better conceptualize the profound levels of experiencing aboriginal cultures during trips to indigenous tourism destination. Applying SLP to this context might help to gain novel insights into the attributes of ethnic tourists. Thus, this study examines and segments tourists based on the seriousness of their desire to experience aboriginal culture and further compares and discusses the differences exhibited by different tourist types in travel motivation, and preferences for culture-based tourism products/services. Based on these assessments of indigenous tourists, this study will suggest marketing strategies for aboriginal tourism.</p>

<title>Indigenous tourism market</title>
<p>Indigenous tourism as a form of ethnic tourism has been examined from numerous perspectives, including the authenticity of the experiences provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766711431768">Oakes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711431768">Xie and Wall, 2002</xref>), visitor motivation and expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711431768">Ryan, 2006</xref>), the ways in which ethnic people are represented, marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766711431768">Hughes, 1995</xref>), consequences for minority people of the culture becoming a tourist attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711431768">Faulkner and Tideswell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711431768">Pearce, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766711431768">Ryan, 2005</xref>), and planning implications (Aboriginal Tourism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711431768">Canada, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766711431768">Butler and Hinch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766711431768">Notzke, 2004</xref>). Numerous studies have investigated the profile of ethnic tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711431768">Deaden and Harron, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766711431768">Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711431768">Silver, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe, 1992</xref>). These studies have described the socioeconomic characteristics of such visitors, explored their motivations, and assessed their evaluations of the authenticity of their experiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe (1992</xref>) found that consumers of ethnic tourism are typically highly educated and respect cultural diversity. These tourists are frequently sensitive to their impact on the local culture, and conscious of the irony that their presence and behavior can destroy the authenticity they seek.</p>
<p>Numerous previous investigations were particularly interested in the needs and motives of aboriginal tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce (1999</xref>) found that the motivations for visiting the Tjapukai Park included the following: viewing traditional aboriginal song, dance, music performances, learning about aboriginal culture, contacting indigenous people, visiting aboriginal areas, and so on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711431768">McIntosh (2004</xref>) found that although Maori aboriginal culture was not the primary travel motivation for tourists visiting New Zealand, Maori cultural destinations were important for them. Most tourists are interested in cultural differences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711431768">Xie and Wall (2002</xref>) investigated and ranked the drawcards attracting aboriginal tourists to Hainan Island and found that they included aboriginal architecture, dance, and clothing. However, in terms of shopping, tourists also favored local foods, tropical fruits, teas, and Chinese medicines, all of which were unrelated to aboriginal people. These studies demonstrated that the appeal of ethnic culture is the identifiable attraction for driving indigenous tourism and ways of undertaking the essence of ethnic culture to create tourist aboriginal experiences.</p>

<title>Segmenting the indigenous tourists</title>
<p>The literature clearly demonstrates that indigenous tourists are essentially heterogeneous, suggesting the importance of segmenting the indigenous tourism market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711431768">Morrison (2006</xref>) discussed how the advantages of market segmentation include finding space for developing new products and allowing for more precise and effective execution of marketing strategies, thus achieving efficient resource allocation and product positioning. Past investigations of the segmentation of the indigenous tourism market have stressed necessity and effectiveness segmentation for managing and operating in this market. Researchers have used various variables, including leisure motives, preferences, benefits, and socioeconomic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711431768">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce, 1999</xref>), to examine different categories of tourists and understand the composition of the indigenous tourism market.</p>
<p>Some previous studies utilized market segmentation concepts to examine the indigenous tourist market in hopes of understanding the defining characteristics of indigenous tourists. In variable selection, scholars have stressed examining tourist motives and behavioral characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce (1999</xref>) used tourist preferences to segment tourists visiting Tjapukai Cultural Park in Australia. Based on the strength of their preferences for aboriginal tourist-products, tourists were divided into four groups: ‘foreign tribe tourism-related group’, ‘passive cultural learning group’, ‘foreign tribe products and activity group’, and ‘uninterested in foreign tribe tourism group’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce (1999</xref>) identified significant differences in terms of motivation and purpose among different types of tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711431768">Ryan and Huyton (2002</xref>) segmented tourists into 14 types based on their interests in various tourism products, ‘the sightseers’, ‘the low score respondents’, ‘older professionals’, ‘the comfort/intellectual seekers’, ‘the active information seekers’, ‘the nature oriented’, and ‘the visitors of family and friends market’ ‘senior professionals’, ‘ active information seekers’, ‘comfort/knowledge seekers’, ‘landscape viewers’, ‘low degree responders’, ‘nature lovers’, and ‘visitors of family and friends’. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711431768">Chang et al. (2006</xref>) segmented aboriginal tourists from a novelty-seeking perspective and identified different levels of curiosity regarding aboriginal tourism.</p>

<title>Serious leisure and tourism</title>
<p>Serious leisure is defined as sustained pursuit of a core leisure activity that people find so substantial, interesting, and fulfilling that they launch themselves on a leisure career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766711431768">Stebbins, 1982</xref>). Over 20 years, SLP was developed as an important theoretical framework designed to offer a classification (serious leisure, casual leisure, and project-based leisure) and explanation of all leisure experiences from the perspective of sincere participations in leisure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766711431768">Stebbins, 2006</xref>). Six distinct qualities of activity—perseverance, a ‘career’ path (e.g. beginning, evolution, and maintenance), significant personal efforts, durable benefits available, a unique ethos within the community of the activity (e.g. active member of activity-based organization), and strongly identify with the pursuit—are often used to differentiate serious leisure and casual leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711431768">McCarville, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766711431768">Stalp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711431768">Stebbins, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Serious leisure has been often used to address numerous leisure/recreation activities, including bass fishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356766711431768">Yoder, 1997</xref>), dog sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711431768">Baldwin and Norris, 1999</xref>), computer gaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766711431768">Bryce and Rutter, 2003</xref>), museum volunteering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711431768">Orr, 2006</xref>), quilting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766711431768">Stalp, 2006</xref>), dance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766711431768">Brown, 2007</xref>), and Ironman Triathlon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711431768">McCarville, 2007</xref>). Most of those studies qualitatively annotated the seriousness of leisure experience using distinct qualities of serious leisure. Furthermore, some scholars extended the serious leisure concept to study special forms of tourism, such as volunteer tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766711431768">Wearing, 2004</xref>), special interest tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711431768">Trauer, 2006</xref>), sports tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711431768">Jennings, 2007</xref>), adventure tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766711431768">Kane and Zink, 2004</xref>), and themed festivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766711431768">Kim and Jamal, 2007</xref>). Tourism combined with special leisure recreation pursuit appears to meet the distinguishing features of serious leisure.</p>
<p>In <italic>Cultural Tourism as Serious Leisure</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766711431768">Stebbins (1996</xref>) had suggested the theory of ‘serious leisure’ could be applying to cultural tourism. The ways in which tourists experience the essence of ethnic culture characterize their cultural travel experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711431768">Kiwasaki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe and Keyes, 1984</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711431768">McKercher and du Cros (2002</xref>) had advocated to apply the depth of experience sought and its relative importance to understand cultural tourists. While considering taking aboriginal cultural tours as a specific leisure pursuit, SLP may assist to address various degrees to which tourists experience culture resources.</p>

<title>Indigenous tourism in the Taiwan region</title>
<p>Taiwan, a country located in the Asia-Pacific region, has numerous ethnic groups. The indigenous population of Taiwan numbers around 490,000, and represents approximately 2% of the total population. Currently, the Taiwanese government recognizes 14 indigenous tribes, each with its own distinct language, cultural features, traditional customs, and social structure. In early 1960s, only few indigenous tourism activities can be observed in Taiwan. Initially, indigenous tourism focused on indigenous people performing ethnic song and dance routines at tourist hotels or tourism-oriented cultural villages located near popular (mass) tourist destinations, such as Hualien, Sun Moon Lake, and Wulai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711431768">Chen, 1994</xref>). During the 1980s, indigenous tourism became more attractive and significant. Aboriginal culture is no longer simply an extra offered by mainstream tourism destinations but rather has become an attraction and destination in itself. Several theme parks, hotels, and museums have successfully made indigenous culture their main tourist attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766711431768">Shieh, 1994</xref>). ‘Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village’ (one of the top three theme parks in Taiwan) and the ‘Taiwan Indigenous Culture Park’ (a successful government-owned recreation resort) are typical examples and present aboriginal culture packages that incorporate various recreational activities, including aboriginal dance, traditional arts, and celebration and festival performances. In the late 1990s, Taiwanese Indigenous Affairs policies strongly emphasized consolidating the indigenous welfare system and expanding indigenous economic activities and several indigenous communities were encouraged to use tribal tourism to pursue economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711431768">Huang, 2001</xref>). Such initiatives have facilitated the development of ‘tribal tourism’ in Taiwan. Consequently, indigenous communities have begun to host tourists, rather than serving them as actors or employees, leading to more ‘authentic’ cultural experiences.</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<p>This study uses the characteristics and orientations of serious leisure theory as presented by Stebbins to develop measures of the seriousness of tourists undertaking indigenous tourism. Serious leisure essentially describes investment in long-term leisure activities, and six different qualities of serous leisure are often used to illustrate participant attitudes and values. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711431768">Gould et al. (2008</xref>) had developed a Serious Leisure Inventory and Measure (SLIM), this study decided not to use this scale for following reasons. SLIM was mainly developed from the perspective of leisure/recreation behavior and was tested on adventure racers, runners, and paddlers, some items were clearly not suitable for most aboriginal tourists. In addition, combining SLIM with 54 items in its short form and other study questions together will create a lengthy questionnaire and greatly reduce the responses. Thus, this study developed three or four items for each dimension of serious leisure based on the context of indigenous tourism and the nature of serious leisure. From previous literature reviews, this study yielded 22 items measuring tourist seriousness toward indigenous tourism (SIT). To ensure measurement validity, expert review and pilot testing were conducted before constructing the final questions. Five outside experts, including three scholars who taught culture tourism or leisure courses at a university and two senior managers who packaged and promoted tribal tours for more than a decade, were asked to describe suitable contents for the six qualities of serious leisure under the context of indigenous tourism. This procedure generated 24 items. A dichotomous pilot test was then conducted to assess the suitability of the generated items by interviewing 30 people who had attended special aboriginal tour program supported by the Council of Indigenous People of Taiwan. Two of the statements were excluded from the final questionnaire, and some of the wording was modified following the pilot test. Respondents were asked to indicate their agreement with each item assessing their SIT on a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from strongly disagree (score of 1) to strongly agree (score of 5).</p>
<p>Other measures in questionnaire include travel motivation, activity preferences, travel patterns, and sociodemographics. In terms of travel motives, tourists were asked seven dichotomous questions regarding their reasons for visiting aboriginal tourist attraction. The questions were developed based on the tourism motivation study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711431768">Uysal and Jurowski (1994</xref>). In addition, this study specifically measures activity preferences that focused on products/services provided with aboriginal culture essence. Eight questions were designed and referred from studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711431768">Ryan and Huyton (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766711431768">Getz and Jamieson (1997</xref>). Respondents were asked to evaluate the questionnaire items on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strong disapproval (score of 1) to strong approval (score of 5). Several questions regarding general travel patterns are also asked. Questions included number of days of the tour, length of stay at the aboriginal resort, travel expenditures at the attraction, and number of visits to aboriginal destinations in the past 3 years. Finally, respondent demographic information, age, education level, marital status, occupation, and income were also obtained.</p>

<title>Sampling and investigation</title>
<p>This study sampled tourists traveling to aboriginal tourism resorts in northern Pingtung country. The northern region of Pingtung country is the homeland of the Rukai and Paiwan tribes. Both tribes have a strict social hierarchy, comprising chieftains, nobles, warriors, and commoners, with the primary difference being that Rukai society is patrilineal while Paiwan society is bigender. Both societies use extravagant costumes to denote social status. Chieftains and nobles have special rights to ornament their costumes, for example, using snake pattern and hawk feathers, exquisite glazed beads, and unique graphic designs (e.g. the human crane and hundred-step snake). This region offers various indigenous tourism activities and tourist resorts, including Taiwan Indigenous Culture Park (a national indigenous museum with large outdoor recreation areas displaying the traditional lifestyles of different tribes), Wutai Scenic Area (a national park) designated for Rukai tribal tourism development and famous for its stone slab houses, old Haocha village, Yila Fish Watching Trail, and Majia and Sandiman townships (famous for their indigenous arts and crafts, hot springs and nature areas). This study surveyed tourists aged 20 years and older who were encountered at main stops on Road 24 (the main access to Wutai, Majia, and Sandiman townships) and who had visited at least one aboriginal tourism resort in the region on their trip. The sampling period spanned May to June 2009, and 450 surveys were distributed and 390 of them accepted for interviews. After scrutinizing missing data and potential outliers, total 372 surveys were used for analysis.</p>

<title>Profile of respondents</title>
<p>Among 372 surveys, the respondents were dominated by visitors aged 20–29 years old (35.75%) and 30–39 years old (34.95%), who were married (52.30%) and had a bachelor’s degree or higher level of education (66.41%). In terms of occupation, the largest group of respondents was salaried workers (32%) followed by students (15.9%). Regarding income, the largest group of respondents was those with average monthly income below 20,000 new Taiwan dollars (NTD; 28%) followed by above 40,000 NTD (28%). The majority of respondents were simply on a day trip (84.94%). Approximately half of all respondents had not visited this destination during the past 3 years (57.84%), but 57.51% had visited other aboriginal tourism attractions in the past year.</p>

<title>Seriousness of indigenous tourists</title>
<p>This investigation used 22 questions to measure tourist SIT. Respondent scores on these 22 questions exceeded 3 points (out of 5), with an average of 3.59. Examining individual items in the scale, Question 20—‘indigenous tourism is a meaningful activity (<italic>M</italic> = 4.01)’—and Question 21—‘indigenous tourism is an activity worth promoting to the public (<italic>M</italic> = 3.93)’—were the highest scored items, showing that most tourists perceive indigenous tourism positively. Conversely, tourists scored lowest on Question 4—‘I will still tour aboriginal attractions despite frustrations encountered (mean = 3.24)’—and Question 6—‘I have met many friends through aboriginal tourism (mean = 3.28)’. These scores reveal that tourists are unlikely to persevere in taking indigenous tours, which results in limited durable outcome, such as making new indigenous friends. These findings may result from the irregularity of participating indigenous tours. Unlike other cultural hobbies, most tourists visit indigenous destination occasionally, not on a regular basis. Thus, few of them perceive the long-term commitments and outcomes from their indigenous travel experiences.</p>
<p>This study further applied exploratory factor analysis to identify potential dimensions of SIT. In the factor analysis, this study used principal components analysis, varimax to perform orthogonal rotation, and eigenvalue &gt;1 and screen test to test individual factors and ensure that measurement items had absolute factor loading values of at least 0.4. In terms of the analytical results, the Bartlett test results reached significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) value reached 0.95, demonstrating that the scale had excellent sampling adequacy. The factor loadings of all variables exceeded the 0.4 threshold and can be reduced to three primary factor dimensions: ‘prolonged outcome and liking’, ‘ethos and personal devotion’, and ‘approval and recommendation’, comprising 21.96%, 21.04%, and 19.55% of total explained variance, respectively; meanwhile, the accumulated explained variance was 62.55%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356766711431768">Table 1</xref> lists the extracted factors and factor loadings of the item variables. The Cronbach’s alpha value of overall reliability was 0.95, while the reliability for the individual dimension was in the range 0.89–0.91; reliability tests indicate that the scale and its dimensions possess high internal consistency.</p>

<title>Clustering indigenous tourists</title>
<p>Furthermore, this investigation utilized two-stage cluster analysis to segment tourists into several distinct clusters based on tourist SIT. The factor scores of the three extracted dimensions obtained from previous factor analysis were used as inputs for cluster analysis. First, the hierarchical cluster method was applied to obtain possible combinations of clusters, after which the K-Means method was used to group the collected data. The results of cluster analysis suggest tourists can be divided into three different clusters based on their SIT; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356766711431768">Table 2</xref> lists the segmentation results.</p>

<p>Tourists in Cluster 1 displayed low concern for aboriginal culture and indigenous tourism, and scored below average in the dimensions of ‘approval and recommendation’, ‘prolonged outcome and liking’, and ‘ethos and personal devotion’. As a result, this study labeled this cluster ‘apathetic’. Cluster 2 showed high ‘approval and recommendation’ for indigenous tourism (mean = 4.35) but scored around average for ‘prolonged outcome and liking’ and ‘ethos and personal devotion’, suggesting strong approval of indigenous tourism but insufficient readiness for extended appreciation of and long-term devotion toward aboriginal culture–based activities; this study labeled Cluster 2 as ‘interested’. Cluster 3 scored highest in almost all seriousness dimensions but scored only second highest in approval of indigenous tourism and willingness to recommend it to others. Cluster 3 displayed especially strong agreement on ‘prolonged outcome and liking’, demonstrating most significant difference separating Cluster 3 from the other types. Simultaneously, tourists in Cluster 3 are more willing to connect with aboriginal culture and make personal efforts to pursue indigenous tourism. This study labeled Cluster 3 the ‘expert’ tourist segment.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356766711431768">Table 3</xref> summarizes the profiles of tourists belonging to three segments. Some 122 tourists belonged to the ‘apathetic’ segment, representing 32% of all respondents. These tourists were primarily single, the majority had at least a college/professional education, roughly one third were salaried workers in private companies, nearly two thirds had monthly salaries of less than 30,000 NTD, and finally most of them were young (with 41% of 20–29 years old). The ‘interested’ segment included 126 tourists, representing 34% of the sample. Respondents in this group were primarily married, more than 70% had received at least a college/professional education (with 52.83% holding at least a bachelor’s degree), one third were salaried workers in private companies, the same proportion had income of at least 40,000 NTD, and the majority were aged between 30 and 39. Finally, 124 tourists belonged to the ‘expert’ segment, representing 33% of total respondents. This segment contained the highest proportion of married people (58.06%), nearly two thirds had at least college/professional education, 30% were salaried workers in private companies, around one third had monthly incomes of at least 40,000 NTD, and over a third comprised middle-aged and elderly people more than 40 years old. Testing of the differences among the three segments revealed that only ‘marital status’ reached statistical significance at the 0.05 level. In sum, the majority of all tourist segments had received higher education, and the ‘expert’ tourist segment was dominated by middle-aged, elderly, and married respondents.</p>

<p>To further understand the nature of SIT segments, this study performed differential tests to detect the differences in travel motives, preferences for aboriginal tourist activities, and consumption patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1356766711431768">Table 4</xref>). Chi-square test results revealed that the proportions of tourists expressing their travel motive as ‘visiting nature’, ‘viewing celebrations or performances’, ‘aboriginal literature and art’, or ‘never been to the area before’ differed significantly among the three segments. This study found that tourists in the ‘interested’ and ‘expert’ segments were more likely to be motivated by ‘viewing aboriginal celebrations or performances’, ‘aboriginal literature and art’, and ‘visiting nature’ than tourists in the ‘apathetic’ segment. Conversely, tourists in the ‘apathetic’ segment were more likely to be motivated by ‘visiting the area for the first time’. To summarize, this investigation found that the ‘interested’ and ‘expert’ segments, which have higher seriousness, are more likely to be motivated by aboriginal cultural activities. Tourists belonging to the apathetic segment tended to engage in aimless travel or to participate in indigenous tourism only because they had not previously visited the area.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1356766711431768">Table 5</xref> summarizes the different inclinations of segments in activity preferences of aboriginal culture. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect differences among segments. The ‘expert’ and ‘interested’ segments expressed much stronger preferences on various culture-based activities than the ‘apathetic’ segment. This study further compared the ‘expert’ and ‘interested’ segments and found that tourists in the ‘expert’ segment scored considerably higher in ‘I hope to experience indigenous life’ than did ‘interested’ tourists. Meanwhile, the ‘interested’ segment expressed slightly stronger preferences for visual activities, such as ‘I want to see traditional aboriginal architecture, song and dance, and apparel’, although the difference was not statistically significant. In sum, this study found that ‘expert’ tourists appear to favor experiencing things in person, ‘interested’ tourists anticipate ‘seeing’ aboriginal things, while ‘apathetic’ tourists exhibit few strong preferences regarding ethnic tourism activities.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Aboriginal culture, the core of indigenous tourism, creates many specific opportunities and challenges for managing and developing indigenous tourism. Tourists are attracted to visit aboriginal attractions by the ethnic culture and customs of indigenous peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711431768">Van den Berghe and Keyes, 1984</xref>). When tourist’s understandings and knowledge of indigenous culture improves, their visits to aboriginal tourism resorts play as a potential source of interesting ethnic experiences. Furthermore, whether tourists value aboriginal culture as engaging in tourism activities is critical in optimizing the management of aboriginal tourism and resort development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711431768">McKercher and du Cros, 2002</xref>). The main purpose and contribution of this study were to further emphasize the importance of ‘serious attitude toward touring culture’ in managing indigenous tourism. This study proposed Serious Leisure as a theoretical base to examine tourist ‘seriousness’ toward cultural tourism and apply segmentation to explore the seriousness of indigenous tourist types, thus providing suggestions for aboriginal tourism management.</p>
<sec id="section16-1356766711431768">
<title>Seriousness in indigenous tourism and its dimensions</title>
<p>In order to examine the seriousness characteristics possessed by indigenous tourists, this study generated a set of items to measure respondent’s SIT. The reliability of the SIT Scale reached 0.95, and the reliability of the extracted three dimensions lay between 0.89 and 0.91, meaning the scale has good reliability. The dimensions extracted from factor analysis were compared with Stebbins’s serious leisure theory. The characteristics of ‘identification with pursuit’ from serious leisure resembles the factor dimension of ‘approval and recommendation’ from this study. The ‘significant effort’ and ‘unique ethos’ of serious leisure were combined into a single factor dimension named ‘ethos and personal devotion’ in this study. Finally, the ‘prolonged outcome and liking’ dimension resembled the mix of ‘perseverance’, ‘durable outcome’, and ‘leisure career’ derived from original characteristics of serious leisure. The SIT scale can illustrate tourist’s SIT and its dimensions can be compatible with distinguishing characteristics of Serous Leisure. However, the items presenting long-term commitments and outcomes are less evident, such as perseverance in the face of obstacles, obtaining durable outcome, joining indigenous clubs/associations, and consistent participation/concern. This phenomenon can be explained by the different natures of leisure and tourism participation. The participation frequency of tourism activities is usually unlike other types of leisure activities (such as jogging or collecting stamps) for which regular participation is frequently sustained over years. Thus, the seriousness of indigenous tourists is less obvious in the dimension of ‘prolonged outcome and liking’, which share similar concepts of ‘leisure career’, ‘durable outcomes’, and ‘perseverance’ described by serious leisure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1356766711431768">
<title>SIT segments of indigenous tourists</title>
<p>The study results show that the aboriginal tourism market comprises three primary segments: ‘apathetic’, ‘interested’, and ‘expert’. These three types of tourists differ significantly in travel motives and culture-based tourism product preferences. ‘Expert’ tourists most enthusiastically appreciate aboriginal culture and are concerned with aborigine issues. These tourists behave like a special subculture group comprising individuals that jointly care for aboriginal tourism activities and are willing to recommend such activities to others. Moreover, aboriginal culture being their primary motivation for travel, ‘expert’ tourists are strongly interested in ‘experiencing aboriginal life’. The ‘interested’ tourists strongly support aboriginal tourism, enjoying such activities as ‘viewing aboriginal architecture, song and dance, and apparel’; ‘visiting aboriginal crafts/arts workshops’; and ‘participating in aboriginal tours to understand aboriginal culture’. Such tourists stress ‘visual’ contact as means of learning about aboriginal culture. ‘Apathetic’ type tourists have the least serious attitudes and are not interested in aboriginal culture. Such tourists simply use their spare time to relax by escaping their daily routines, walking around, and enjoying nature.</p>
<p>Three segments of indigenous tourists found in this research contain similar patterns with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711431768">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711431768">McKercher and du Cros, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711431768">Moscardo and Pearce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711431768">Ryan and Huyton, 2002</xref>). They all indicated that the indigenous tourists are heterogeneous especially in experiencing (or attitude toward) indigenous cultures. As conceptualizing those differences under Stebbins’s works, expert tourists in this study would be equivalent with his ‘specialized cultural tourist’, interested tourists would be similar with his general cultural tourists, and apathetic tourists would be perceived as culture dabbler in his definition. The SLPs provide sound bases to illustrate that those ‘expert tourists’ would devote significant efforts to indigenous tour, gain profound satisfactions, and identify themselves with this leisure pursuit. However, interested tourists may treat indigenous tours as project-based leisure, while apathetic tourists take indigenous tour as a casual leisure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1356766711431768">
<title>Managerial discussions and implications</title>
<p>From a managerial perspective, ‘seriousness’ segmentation of indigenous tourists can provide better understandings of the way that tourists tour aboriginal destinations and the inclinations of experiencing culture-based tourism product/service. Based on tourist’s seriousness, managers can identify tourists who are best suited to support sustainable tourism development and can properly introduce cultural elements into various tourism product/service. For example, tribal villages providing in-depth cultural experience programs should target expert tourists who are genuinely interested in aboriginal culture. The SIT segments can be used to devise ‘matching’ marketing strategies to attract ‘expert’ tourists and reduce potential damage to culture or heritage most likely associated with visits by ‘apathetic’ tourists. Careful matching of use types of cultural resources with specific types of tourists can deliver benefits of tourism development to indigenous communities. The following summarizes the various market segments and associated managerial implications:</p>
<sec id="section19-1356766711431768">
<title>‘Expert’-type tourists</title>
<p>‘Expert’-type tourists yearn to experience ‘authentic’ aboriginal culture during their visit. To cater to these tourists, elements of aboriginal culture thus can be used in designing experience activities, such as traditional hunting, living arts (e.g. weaving), farming life (e.g. cultivating millet), and cuisine (e.g. making millet wine). Most importantly, ‘expert’ tourists are eager to experience living aboriginal culture through interaction with locals. Aboriginal culture thus should be the focus in designing physical facilities, environment, and recreation activities for such tourists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1356766711431768">
<title>‘Interested’ type tourists</title>
<p>‘Interested’-type tourists have positive feelings toward aboriginal culture and tend to satisfy their curiosity by ‘viewing’ things related to aboriginal culture and participating in interpretation programs. It is suggested that tourism products for such tourists should be focused on touring preselected heritage spots, and workshops of aboriginal people and culture-based recreation activities (such as folk dance). Such tourists enjoy learning from aboriginal culture, but their level of understanding is insufficient to deal with abstruse concepts. Tours thus should present cultural elements in an easily understandable manner and should be assisted by lively interpretation. This study also found that these tourists spend heavily on purchasing aboriginal souvenirs. Therefore, we suggest that souvenir design should incorporate aboriginal legends and should be suitable for them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1356766711431768">
<title>‘Apathetic’ type tourists</title>
<p>Apathetic tourists, who view ‘indigenous travel’ just like other forms of travel, are chiefly motivated by a desire to escape their daily routines and travel and do not necessarily have any interest in aboriginal culture. Thus, the provisions of touring should stress pleasurable travel experiences, rather than authentic culture. Aboriginal cultural elements can be mixed with general tour activities when appropriate, and brief notifications may be helpful to assist ‘apathetic’ tourists enjoy foreign aboriginal culture. Additionally, a fully designed package with a fixed touring schedule is recommended to prevent inappropriate behavior arising from a lack of understanding and associated negative local impacts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1356766711431768">
<title>Limitations and suggestions for future research</title>
<p>Motivated by concerns about how tourists react to aboriginal culture presented in tourism product, this study tested the seriousness of tourist attitudes toward indigenous tourism at one aboriginal region in Taiwan and developed an associated measurement scale (SIT). Future studies can apply this measure to investigate various types of aboriginal tourism attractions and thus contribute to understanding scale generalization and stability. Additionally, indigenous tourism is a type of cultural tourism. Almost all cultural or heritage tourism faces similar challenges in optimally ‘using’ cultural resources. Tourism destinations must simultaneously satisfy the needs of tourists to enjoy cultural resources and also attract the ‘right’ type of tourists to avoid cultural destruction. Thus, this study suggests that future studies develop a scale for measuring seriousness in tourism that can be broadly applied to different types of cultural tourism.</p>
