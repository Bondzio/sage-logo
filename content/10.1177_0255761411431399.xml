<abstract>
<p>Previous studies demonstrate that private music training has benefits which may transfer to other domains, including verbal memory, intelligence and self-esteem. The current paper reports on the impact of an increase in school-based music training on a range of cognitive and psychosocial measures for 10–13-year-olds in two independent studies. In the first study, the benefits of increased frequency of classroom-based music classes were compared with classroom-based drama and art lessons in secondary school students (<italic>N</italic> = 127). The second study compared the effects of introducing a new classroom-based music programme with a new drama programme for primary school students (<italic>N</italic> = 100). Assessments were obtained at baseline and approximately six months after implementation of each programme. In contrast to previous research on the effects of private music tuition, no convincing benefits of school music classes were apparent. Trends of interest were observed in non-verbal intelligence, aggression scores and verbal memory, which require further investigation. The findings suggest that the benefits of music instruction previously reported may be limited to private or externally-based music tuition, or socio-economically disadvantaged schools. The intrinsic value of music education for enjoyment and learning should therefore remain central to the justification of music education in the national school curriculum.</p>

<p>Music education is widely argued to be integral to a well-rounded education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0255761411431399">Reimer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0255761411431399">Taylor, 2008</xref>), fostering creativity, self expression, imagination and emotional responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0255761411431399">Robinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0255761411431399">Trusty &amp; Olivia, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, music education can engage students where other subjects may not and provides learning opportunities that are not based on traditional academic skills but utilize different sets of strengths and abilities. This fosters cognitive growth that is quite distinct to advances in learning aptitude or intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411431399">Bryce &amp; Withers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411431399">Eisner, 1999</xref>). Learning about music is clearly valuable as an end in itself; nevertheless, the inclusion of music education in the school curriculum has been increasingly justified on the basis that it may enhance ability in other domains.</p>
<p>Pressures on an expanding school curriculum often result in the marginalization of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411431399">Australian Council of State School Organizations [ACSSO], 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411431399">British Educational Research Association [BERA] Music Education Review Group, 2004</xref>). Music education is not mandatory under several state education authorities in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0255761411431399">Stevens, 2003</xref>) and approximately 10% of Australian schools do not have any music programme at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411431399">Pascoe et al., 2005</xref>). This trend is echoed globally, with many countries failing to mandate music education in the school curriculum, particularly at the secondary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0255761411431399">Royse, Addo, Klinger, Dunbar-Hall, &amp; Campbell, 1999</xref>). Only 5–10% of secondary students in the United Kingdom and United States of America participate in music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411431399">Bray, 2000</xref>). The threat to music education as a core subject has led to an increase in research exploring whether music training might also contribute to the development of non-musical (or extrinsic) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0255761411431399">Price, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0255761411431399">Winner &amp; Cooper, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Cited extrinsic benefits of music education typically include improvements to a wide range of academic, cognitive and psychosocial skills (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411431399">Hallam, 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2001</xref>, for extensive reviews). For instance, music education is reported to enhance verbal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411431399">Ho, Cheung, &amp; Chan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0255761411431399">Rickard, Vasquez, Murphy, Toukhsati, &amp; Gill, 2010</xref>), general intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0255761411431399">2004</xref>), spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411431399">Črnčec, Wilson, &amp; Prior, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411431399">Orsmond &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411431399">Rauscher &amp; Zupan, 2000</xref>), school attendance and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411431399">O’Connell, 2005</xref>), emotional sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0255761411431399">Thompson, Schellenberg, &amp; Husain, 2004</xref>), social development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411431399">Harland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0255761411431399">Rickson &amp; Watkins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>), self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411431399">Costa-Giomi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411431399">O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., in press</xref>), academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411431399">Anvari, Trainor, Woodside, &amp; Levy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411431399">Gardiner, Fox, Knowles, &amp; Jeffrey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411431399">Hodges &amp; O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0255761411431399">Southgate &amp; Roscigno, 2009</xref>), creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411431399">Hamann, Bourassa, &amp; Aderman, 1991</xref>) and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411431399">Hendricks, Robinson, Bradley, &amp; Davis, 1999</xref>). At the pre-school and primary levels, regular music classes or instrumental training have been associated with enhanced pre-reading and writing skills, significantly higher mathematics scores, improved memory and differential brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431399">Cheek &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411431399">Fujioka, Ross, Kakigi, Pantev, &amp; Trainor, 2006</xref>). At the secondary school level, instrumental music training is correlated with significantly higher levels of mathematics proficiency and enhanced verbal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411431399">Catterall, Capleau, &amp; Iwanga, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411431399">Ho et al., 2003</xref>). Even short periods of passive exposure to music can facilitate memory in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411431399">Morton, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>To a lesser degree, music instruction has also been associated with psychosocial well-being and health outcomes. Numerous correlational and quasi-experimental studies have reported that music education leads to emotional and social development in children (see, e.g., reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411431399">O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>). However, the field remains limited by the absence of rigorous experimental designs. For instance, music training is typically compared with ‘no music training’ or baseline measures prior to implementation of the programme. Positive effects may therefore be due to a range of factors that result from introduction of an engaging and novel programme, but that are non-specific to music education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2001</xref>, for a discussion on these issues). In a well-controlled study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411431399">Costa-Giomi (2004)</xref> found that formal piano lessons enhanced primary school children’s global self-esteem over a 3-year period. The potential of music training to have a positive impact on aspects of adolescent psychological well-being, including self-esteem, depression and aggressive behaviour, has also been documented. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0255761411431399">Rickson and Watkins (2003)</xref> found an increase in interpersonal relationships and awareness of other’s feelings among aggressive boys following music education in a residential setting. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411431399">Knox-Anderson and Rickard (2007)</xref> found no effects on aggression or self-esteem measures of a 4-week music training programme targeted at disengaged adolescents in a school setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411431399">Hendricks et al. (1999)</xref> found significant reductions in depression scores after a 10-week classroom-based, therapeutic, music intervention for a group of adolescents. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411431399">Lindblad, Hogmark and Theorell (2006)</xref> found that fifth to sixth graders receiving music instruction demonstrated lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol than students receiving control classes. However, no differences in measures of psychopathology risk were observed.</p>
<p>Previous research is limited in its generalizability to classroom-based music education as the effects of mandatory, all-inclusive, group-based school music classes have rarely been investigated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411431399">Gill &amp; Rickard, 2012</xref>, for a review). Instead, the majority of studies have evaluated participation in private instrumental tuition or specialized music groups such as orchestras. Such training differs substantially from classroom education which cannot easily cater for varying levels of ability among students or provide the same level of individual attention or guidance to foster skill advancement, interest and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411431399">Pitts &amp; Davidson, 2000</xref>). This is demonstrated by a study on the effects of an enriched elementary arts education programme in Canada that incorporated performing arts classes into the school curriculum. Preliminary results showed that enhanced language and mathematical abilities were associated only with participation in music lessons outside of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0255761411431399">Upitis, Smithrim, Patteson, &amp; Meban, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The limited research investigating the effects of school music classes has produced conflicting findings. The Australian Council for Educational Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411431399">ACER; 2004</xref>) evaluated four Australian school-based arts programmes (two of which were music specific) directed at indigenous populations or students from remote communities and/or disadvantaged backgrounds. Although these programmes were shown to have a positive impact on students’ engagement with learning and school attendance, there was no evidence that the arts programmes benefited academic performance. However, these studies were limited by small sample sizes and short-term programmes (three to six months duration). Several larger-scale multi-arts evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411431399">Catterall &amp; Waldorf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431399">Luftig, 1994</xref>) demonstrated that integration of arts into academic programmes enhanced performance on several academic (mathematics, reading) and non-academic (self-esteem, creative thinking) measures. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411431399">Eisner (1999)</xref> argues that some of the findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411431399">Luftig (1994)</xref> were ‘educationally trivial’ (p. 53), and caution is advised as there was difficulty implementing a full experimental design. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411431399">Catterall and Waldorf (1999)</xref> found that students from economically-disadvantaged schools in particular advanced more quickly and improved more on the Iowa test of basic skills when compared with students at arts-poor schools in the same neighbourhood. This outcome is consistent with recent findings from a region of low socio-economic schools in Australia, in which increased music education yielded significant benefits for verbal memory and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While these studies do not isolate music instruction from other arts-based education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg (2001)</xref> did report that increases in general intelligence scores resulting from music classes were absent in students receiving drama lessons. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411431399">Moreno et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated enhanced literacy in children involved in music training (Kodaly, Orff and Wuytack methods) compared with children matched for baseline ability who were given painting classes. These findings suggest that school-based music education has the potential to generate more substantial academic benefits than collective ‘arts’ training. Moreover, the latter study investigated the introduction of a new classroom-based music programme suggesting that benefits may generalize to this setting. It is of note, however, that new specialist music teachers were hired for this programme, and therefore the effects may still be dependent on an intervention that is not typically available to most schools. Assessment of increased music education utilizing existing school staff and resources, as well as that involving external staff and resources, would be valuable. This would provide insight into whether one of the key contributors in previous studies was the introduction of a dedicated, external music teacher or whether increased frequency of quality music tuition is sufficient to yield such benefits. In addition, inclusion of non-music arts-based programmes as controls in such research would enable the effects of music education classes <italic>per se</italic> to be differentiated more confidently from the effects of arts-based programmes in general.</p>
<p>In the current study, we investigated the effect of increased <italic>classroom-based</italic> music education on various psychosocial and cognitive measures in children aged 10–13 years. Two different music programmes were evaluated: one that utilized the existing school programme, while the other involved introduction of an external music education programme. To control for non-specific effects of increasing novel or engaging arts-based activities to students, the impact of each music programme was compared with that resulting from an increase in alternative arts-based programmes (drama, art).</p>
<sec id="section1-0255761411431399">
<title>Study 1: The cognitive and psychosocial impact of increased school-based music classes for young adolescent males</title>
<p>The effect of increasing existing music education in young secondary male students on a number of psychosocial and cognitive variables was evaluated in Study 1. The outcome variables included: verbal memory; verbal and non-verbal intelligence; self-esteem; attitudes to school and motivation; and engagement with classes. The effect of an increase in existing high-quality music education was investigated by comparing students who took part in twice as many music classes with students who received twice as many art or drama classes.</p>
<sec id="section2-0255761411431399">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0255761411431399">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A sample of year seven students (<italic>N</italic> = 127; mean age 12.67 years, <italic>SD</italic> 0.31 years) from a private all-boys secondary school in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria, completed this study voluntarily. Written informed consent was obtained from parents. As part of their normal school curriculum the students participated in two different arts classes (music, art and/or drama) over two terms so that in one school semester each student was allocated a term of drama, art and music, as well as a second term of one of the class types. While the intention was for students to be randomly allocated to the second arts-based class, it appears that students were given some input. Allocation to the additional art (<italic>n</italic> = 27), drama (<italic>n</italic> = 37) or music (<italic>n</italic> = 47) class was therefore pseudo-random.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0255761411431399">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Each participant completed a personal details form to record age, formal/informal music training, leisure activities and enjoyment of arts classes. They also completed the word pairs sub-test of the Children’s Memory Scale (CMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431399">Cohen, 1997</xref>), the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (second version; KBIT-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411431399">Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004</xref>), the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory-Third Edition (CFSEI-3, Immediate Response Form; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411431399">Battle, 2002</xref>), the School Life Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411431399">ACER, 1984</xref>) and the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES, music, drama and art versions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431399">Martin, 2008</xref>). All questionnaires are psychometrically sound and appropriate for this age group (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761411431399">Appendix 1</xref> for details of all questionnaires and tests used in this study).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0255761411431399">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All students were tested at the beginning of the school year (baseline measure) and again 6.5 months later. Initially the personal details form and the school life questionnaire were completed at home. The remaining questionnaires were completed in phases of no more than 30 minutes duration, with short breaks in between, and facilitators assisted students as necessary. The CMS delayed recall was presented approximately one hour into the test battery. The two MES questionnaires (one for each arts class they were currently participating in) were either completed during the test battery or at home due to time constraints of the test session.</p>
<sec id="section6-0255761411431399">
<title>The arts programmes</title>
<p>The aim of the school’s arts curriculum was to provide students with an intensive experience of three arts disciplines (visual art, drama and music) through observation, active participation, performance and analysis and evaluation of their own work and others. Students were encouraged to explore and develop ideas from observation and personal experience in order to create an art work, drama or musical performance and to present these to a variety of audiences. Skills and techniques appropriate to each discipline were also developed. For instance, in visual art there was a focus on two and three dimensional art forms and the variety of techniques and processes necessary for each format. Drama classes focussed on developing and sustaining characters, improvisational skills and stagecraft. Music classes provided the opportunity to play and learn about different instruments with an emphasis on improvisation and composition of music in a range of styles, using conventional and unconventional notation and computer technology. Another major area of emphasis was developing an understanding of how each of these arts disciplines are used to meet specific cultural and historical purposes and to identify ways in which they are in turn influenced by cultural and historical contexts.</p>

<sec id="section7-0255761411431399">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the initial sample of 127, data from 16 students were not analyzed due to large amounts of missing data (final sample, <italic>N</italic> = 111). Outliers were defined as cases with <italic>z</italic>-scores exceeding ± 3.29. Cases that were outliers on four or more variables were removed for each relevant analysis, while cases that were outliers on fewer than four variables were adjusted to the second most extreme value. (Experiment-wise α was set at .05 for all statistical analyses.)</p>
<sec id="section8-0255761411431399">
<title>Equivalence of groups</title>
<p>No significant difference in age was found across groups at baseline (art: <italic>M</italic> = 152.93 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.52; drama: <italic>M</italic> = 151.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.20; music: <italic>M</italic> = 152.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.18). A chi-square test revealed that socio-economic status categories were unequally distributed across groups, χ2(df = 6) = 19.12, <italic>p</italic> = .004, with fewer students of high socio-economic status in the art group (25.9%) than in the other two groups (drama: 56.8%, music 55.3%). The influence of socioeconomic status (SES) could not be controlled by selecting a sub-sample of each group with similar SES as the resulting sample size was very small. However, as SES was equivalent in the music and drama groups, secondary analyses consisting of only these two groups was performed to confirm any significant effects.</p>

<title>Effect of additional music, drama or art classes</title>
<p>Mean non-verbal IQ scores did not appear to change over time in the drama and art groups, but increased in the music group from baseline to post treatment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411431399">Table 1</xref>). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant main effect of group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 102) = 2.22, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. There was a significant main effect of time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 102) = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> = .032, η<sup>2</sup> = .044, and a significant time by group interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 102) = 4.85, <italic>p</italic> = .010, η<sup>2</sup> = .087. However, the ANOVA assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were not met, so the non-verbal IQ data were subjected to reflect and inverse transformations then reanalyzed. Transformed data met the assumption of normality at baseline and post treatment and met the assumption of homogeneity of variance at baseline. A subsequent two-way ANOVA revealed no significant main effect of group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 102) = 1.05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, or time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 102) = 1.18, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and the time by group interaction effect only approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(2, 102) = 2.69, <italic>p</italic> = .073, η<sup>2</sup> = .05. As group allocation was confounded by a significantly-higher proportion of lower socio-economic status participants in the art group than the other two groups, a subsequent analysis of transformed non-verbal IQ scores was performed between only the two non-confounded groups (music and drama). These analyses confirmed a near significant interaction between group and time, <italic>F</italic>(1,76)=3.87, <italic>p</italic> =.053, η<sup>2</sup> =.05, which replicated the main findings, indicating that they were not an artefact of socio-economic differences.</p>

<p>Motivation and engagement measures were analyzed via the four cluster scales of booster thoughts, booster behaviours, mufflers and guzzlers. Mean scores were obtained for each of the three types of class (music, drama or art) when the class was either ‘increased’ (two terms received) or ‘usual’ (one term received only). Motivation and engagement scores were similar across all usual classes. There was no significant change in global booster thoughts or behaviours for the students who experienced drama or art classes twice. In contrast, a substantial reduction in both adaptive thoughts and adaptive behaviours toward music classes was evident for the students who took additional music classes. A two-way ANOVA revealed that the group × time interaction was significant for both booster thoughts, <italic>F</italic>(2,81) = 15.24, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .273, and booster behaviours, <italic>F</italic>(2,81) = 6.67, <italic>p</italic> = .002, η<sup>2</sup> = .141. Post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed that the change over time was significant only for the music group, for both booster thoughts, <italic>t</italic>(35) = 6.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and booster behaviours, <italic>t</italic>(35) = 3.56, <italic>p</italic> = .001. For all other measures, no significant time × group interaction effects were found as indicated by non-significant two-way ANOVAs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411431399">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Study 2: The psychosocial impact of introducing a quality school-based music programme into upper primary school classes</title>
<p>The effect of introducing a new music education programme into classes on psychosocial well-being was examined in Study 2. The outcome variables included: self-esteem; social skills; depression; anger; attitudes to school; and motivation and engagement with classes. The effect of an increase in external music education was investigated by comparing students who received a new music programme developed and run by a dedicated service provider with students receiving a new drama programme run by the same provider. In contrast to Study 1, allocation to conditions was strictly random.</p>
<sec id="section11-0255761411431399">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section12-0255761411431399">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Students in grades five and six (<italic>N</italic> = 106; 48 males, 58 females; mean age = 131.07 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.92 months) at a private primary school in the outer southeastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, volunteered to participate and written informed consent was obtained from parents. Students were randomly allocated to either the music programme (<italic>n</italic> = 38), drama programme (<italic>n</italic> = 37) or no additional programme (<italic>n</italic> = 31). The school was initially selected to receive the tailored drama and music programme because it was identified as a socio-economically disadvantaged school which did not offer its own music or arts programme. However, the demographics of the final sample indicated that participants were of average to high socio-economic status, with over 70% of those providing income information in the middle- to high-income range.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0255761411431399">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Each participant completed a background information questionnaire to record gender and age, and after the completion of the programme, a questionnaire assessing enjoyment of the music or drama programme. In addition to the KBIT-2 (described in Study 1), students in Study 2 completed the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0255761411431399">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>), the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411431399">Buss &amp; Warren, 2000</xref>), The Attitudes to School Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411431399">Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, 2006</xref>), the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS, Student Form Elementary Level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411431399">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 1990</xref>) and the Reynolds Child Depression Scale (RCDS, Form HS About Me; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411431399">Reynolds, 1989</xref>). Parents and caregivers also completed the SSRS (parent form) and a demographic survey, and a range of academic measures was obtained from the school. All questionnaires are psychometrically sound and appropriate for this age group (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761411431399">Appendix 1</xref> for materials detail).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0255761411431399">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All students were tested at baseline and again five months later. The KBIT-2 was completed in a separate session to the rest of the test battery and was administered only at baseline to determine the contribution of IQ as a potentially confounding variable. Facilitators provided assistance to students when needed, and breaks were provided to avoid fatigue. All procedures for this study were approved by Monash University’s Human Research Ethics Committee. The intervention programmes were developed and implemented by a national not-for-profit organization that provides tailored music and arts programmes for disadvantaged children and schools with the aim of enhancing learning and development. A specialist peripatetic teacher taught both the music and drama programmes at separate times for one hour per week for one semester (approximately six months). Each group consisted of approximately 20 students. The music programme included exposure to a wide variety of musical styles, with active listening and analysis and the introduction of basic music literacy concepts. It also incorporated playing, composing, improvising and performing together in groups using percussion instruments, learning songs and active group discussion. The drama programme focussed on different forms of storytelling with the students working with existing texts and also developing their own. The emphasis was on exploring various ways of communicating through different performance styles and approaches. Both the drama and music groups worked toward a public performance at the completion of the programme. The control group continued with their normal curriculum but had the opportunity to participate in the programme later in the year, at the conclusion of this study.</p>

<p>Of the initial sample of 106, data from 22 students were not analyzed due to either large amounts of missing data (<italic>n</italic> = 12), borderline intellectual disability (IQ &lt; 80; <italic>n</italic> = 4) or students electing to withdraw from the study (<italic>n</italic> = 6), yielding a final sample of <italic>N</italic> = 84. No significant differences in demographics were found across groups at baseline in age (months: music <italic>M</italic> = 129.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.13; drama <italic>M</italic> = 130.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.04; no programme <italic>M</italic> = 133.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.00), gender (percentage of females in each group: music 43%; drama: 56%; no programme: 55%), socio-economic status or total IQ. Outliers were defined as cases with <italic>z</italic>-scores exceeding ± 3.29. Cases that were outliers on four or more variables were removed for each relevant analysis, while cases that were outliers on fewer than four variables were adjusted to the second most extreme group value. Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) raw scores for aggression were excluded where the AQ inconsistency score was greater than five. (Experiment-wise error rate was set at .05 for all statistical analyses.)</p>
<p>ANOVA analyses of academic measures revealed a significant interaction effect between time and experimental group for a measure of reading, <italic>F</italic> (2,77) = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> = .039, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .081, and working mathematically, <italic>F</italic>(1,77) = 3.53, <italic>p</italic> = .034, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .084. While all three groups increased on both measures across the assessment period, the interaction effects appear to be due to the drama and music groups improving more than the control group in working mathematically scores, while improving less than the control group in reading scores. However, if an experiment-wise correction is applied (for 10 tests, Bonferroni’s adjustment α = .005), both these findings lose significance. No interaction was observed in the remaining eight sub-sets of the Victorian Education Learning Standards (VELS).</p>
<p>There were no significant interactions between group and time for any of the other measures as indicated by non-significant interaction effects from two-way mixed-model ANOVAs. A non- significant trend was observed for the aggression measure, whereby mean raw aggression scores appeared to increase somewhat for the music and drama groups and decrease for the no programme group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411431399">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Self-reported appreciation of classes</title>
<p>Students in both studies were also queried about what they enjoyed and did not enjoy about their classes. The top ranked items were (in Study 1): (1) enjoyed using computers, in particular composing tunes (50%); and (2) learning about and playing different instruments (36%), and (in Study 2): (1) writing their own songs (48%); (2) performing (45%); and (3) singing and playing instruments in class (30%). The bottom ranked items were (in Study 1): (1) theory (22%); and (2) learning about music from different cultures (16%), and (in Study 2): (1) teacher-selected music choices (12%); and (2) theory (9%)</p>
<p>The majority of students indicated that they enjoyed the music classes, although this was similar to enjoyment of other arts-based classes (e.g., in Study 2, 88% of students enjoyed the music classes, while 87% liked the drama classes). With regard to music classes, several themes emerge from these qualitative data. First, students primarily enjoyed the composition aspect of their classes. Second, they enjoyed various aspects of performance, including the social aspect, the variety of instruments to which they had access and the confidence gained by performance. Third, students enjoyed learning about instruments and about music. In contrast, students did not like music theory or learning about music from other cultures, indicating a preference for greater focus on their own music selections and popular music.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of two empirical evaluations of non-musical benefits arising from increased music training within the school classroom are reported. The effect of increasing the quantity of existing high-quality music education was examined in Study 1, while the effect of introducing a novel high-quality music education programme was examined in Study 2. The global finding was that neither intervention had any substantial impact on a broad range of psychosocial and cognitive measures beyond that observed in alternative arts programmes or continued normal curriculum. Non-verbal IQ scores were found to increase significantly more in students receiving twice as many music classes than in those receiving increased arts or drama classes (Study 1). However, caution must be taken when interpreting this finding given that the students receiving increased music classes demonstrated significantly poorer non-verbal IQ at baseline than the other students and the significance was lost once the abnormally-distributed IQ scores were transformed. Mathematics scores increased significantly more for students receiving additional music training than for students receiving no additional arts training (Study 2). However, this effect was also observed for students receiving additional drama training, and was reversed for reading scores (students in the music training group improved the least). Given that these effects represented only two out of 10 academic achievement sub-scales, the impact must be regarded as minimal. A non-significant trend was also observed in aggression scores, with students receiving either the music or drama programme in Study 2 reporting an increase in aggression scores relative to controls. While the failure to reach statistical significance prevents further interpretation, it is possible that the presence of independent staff and arts-based activities encouraged students to express negative affect (including aggressive tendencies) more easily than students remaining in normal curriculum classes with their routine teacher. This finding, nevertheless, requires replication with a fully- randomized design. Importantly, the randomized design in Study 2 yielded few significant differences between groups in the measures tested. Interestingly, the majority of previous research reporting positive effects of music education on non-musical abilities has assessed kindergarten or early primary school students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411431399">Anvari et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411431399">Costa-Giomi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411431399">Rauscher &amp; Zupan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2004</xref>). It is possible, then, that such benefits are more easily generated in younger participants, which is entirely consistent with research indicating age-dependent effects of music training on synaptic plasticity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411431399">Pantev et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0255761411431399">Schlaug, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The current findings are inconsistent with considerable previous research reporting enhancement in non-musical abilities as a result of music training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411431399">Costa-Giomi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411431399">Črnčec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411431399">Ho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411431399">Hodges &amp; O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411431399">O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0255761411431399">Orsmond &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411431399">Rauscher &amp; Zupan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0255761411431399">Schellenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0255761411431399">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>). However, there has been limited evidence to date that such benefits generalize to school-based music instruction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411431399">Gill &amp; Rickard, 2012</xref>). The absence of effects of school-based music instruction reported in the current studies, across a comprehensive set of psychosocial and cognitive measures, suggests that such benefits may be limited to the more focussed and intensive instruction available in private or small group tuition. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431399">Cheek and Smith (1999)</xref> found that private instrumental lessons yielded improvements in mathematics achievement that were not observed following school-based music lessons. This may be because class-based instruction is less likely to be able to cater for the varying levels of ability within the class. In addition, music training requires individual attention to foster skill advancement, interest and motivation in a classroom setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411431399">Pitts &amp; Davidson, 2000</xref>). The current findings suggest that this might be particularly challenging in the music classroom, as we observed significant reductions in student motivation and engagement in students receiving increased music training in Study 1 that were not apparent in those receiving additional drama or art classes. In her review of the effects of music training on children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411431399">Hallam (2010)</xref> concludes that many of the non-musical benefits only occur if the music experience is enjoyable. It is possible that, despite student reports that they liked many features of these classes, there was nonetheless a clear decline in motivation in the music classes in one of the studies. This highlights the importance of maintaining an engaging programme within class-based music instruction, and would be an area worthy of more intensive future research.</p>
<p>Alternatively, previously reported benefits of private music tuition may be directly attributable to participation in extra-curricular activities. Two different forms of music education (involving either an internal or external teacher) were assessed in the current study to explore whether teacher novelty was influential in yielding positive psychosocial effects. No attempt was made to assess which form of education yielded superior music training. Nonetheless, it is of interest that factors outside of school have been identified as more predictive of valuing arts in later life than is enjoyment in arts at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411431399">Australia Council, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, introduction of a novel programme – designed and implemented by external staff, and then offered in school classrooms – did not yield benefits in our study either. This suggests that novelty or independence (from the school) of the instructor is not sufficient to produce benefits, and that the instruction might literally need to be offered outside of school.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the current findings is that benefits may be limited to disadvantaged or ‘at risk’ students, as these sub-samples appear to experience the most gains from music training in the qualitative literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0255761411431399">Shields, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>). While an attempt was made to evaluate a programme in a socio-economically disadvantaged school (Study 2), the demographics indicated this had not been achieved. Both sets of data in the current study appear to be largely from average to above average socio-economic status populations, and therefore it is entirely possible that an effect would be observed in more disengaged or lower functioning students. In this context, it is of interest that an exploratory analysis of these data excluding students from high socio-economic categories failed to yield substantially different findings. A notable exception was a significantly larger increase in immediate recall of verbal information in the group receiving more music in Study 1 (compared with those receiving more art or drama) in low to average SES participants (data not shown). Given the consistency of this finding with those in a study we previously performed in socio- economically poor schools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0255761411431399">Rickard et al., 2010</xref>), the possibility that school-based music classes may be beneficial to verbal memory in socio-economically disadvantaged students remains a topic worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>Importantly, the current studies were experimental in design, and therefore are not subject to the limitations of correlational studies. In this context, it is of interest that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411431399">Lu (1986)</xref>, using an experimental design with random allocation of participants to groups, also failed to find any effect of music instruction on reading ability in first graders. This reinforces cautions when interpreting significant findings of correlational studies in that superior performance or enhanced well-being in students choosing to partake in music classes may be attributable to some other pre-existing difference across groups (such as socioeconomic status or IQ). Interestingly, the increase in non-verbal intelligence in the music group in Study 1, which approached significance, was obtained despite only pseudo-random allocation to groups. While clearly of interest, the quasi-experimental design and the need for transformation of these data reduce the meaning of this particular finding. The absence of differences observed in the current studies implies that significant effects observed in some previous studies may have been an artefact of non-random allocation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the failure to detect differences between students receiving music classes and those receiving other arts-based activities or normal curriculum in the current studies may be due to limitations of the methodology. Each programme was evaluated after one semester only (approximately half a year), and it is possible that a longer duration period is necessary for benefits to emerge. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411431399">Cheek and Smith (1999)</xref> found that mathematics scores were higher for eighth grade students receiving private instrumental lessons for two or more years, than those receiving lessons for a briefer period. In addition, while a comprehensive set of measures was assessed in the current studies, the findings do not exclude the possibility that these programmes had an effect on some other area of cognitive or psychosocial functioning. For instance, measures of spatial-temporal performance, or indices of cultural values, social identity or creativity, were not obtained, each of which has been identified in previous research as sensitive to music-induced benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411431399">Črnčec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411431399">Hodges &amp; O’Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411431399">Pascoe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0255761411431399">Rauscher, Shaw, &amp; Ky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0255761411431399">Teachout, 2005</xref>). In addition, interpretation of the data from Study 1 remains limited by its pseudo-experimental design, although partial replication of the aims in Study 2 (in which students were fully randomized to groups) strengthens the overall conclusions.</p>
<p>In sum, the current studies obtained only weak evidence for enhanced functioning on a range of psychosocial and cognitive measures in 10–13-year-old students as a result of increased music instruction in classrooms of average to high socioeconomic status schools. These findings, however, do not detract from a strong pedagogical argument that music education should be increased for its intrinsic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411431399">Pascoe et al., 2005</xref>). There remains substantial evidence that music training yields non-musical benefits in particular contexts, for instance, with younger students, at-risk students, or in private tuition. However, school-based music instruction offers the only practical means of ensuring widespread, non-discriminatory access to music for children from all cultures and socioeconomic strata. The cultural and artistic value of music education remains undisputed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0255761411431399">Reimer, 1999</xref>). The intrinsic benefits appear to be intuitively recognized by the community, with an overwhelming majority considering the arts (including music) to be a vital part of children’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411431399">Hunter, 2005</xref>). Further, children feel that participating in the arts enhances their learning, communication, creativity and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411431399">Hunter, 2005</xref>). The current findings, however, argue against attempts to justify music education by its non-musical or transfer effects, and instead re-focusses the argument on <italic>musical</italic> benefits of learning music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0255761411431399">Reimer, 1999</xref>); that is, music education should be considered a valuable end in itself, rather than simply a means to other ends (Taylor, 1988). This intrinsic love of learning music was evident in the participants of our studies, and confirms that music education remains valuable for its intrinsic benefits even in the absence of cognitive or psychosocial effects.</p>

<sec id="section18-0255761411431399">
<title>Experiment 1 measures</title>
<p><italic>Verbal memory</italic>: Students completed the Word Pairs sub-test of the Children’s Memory Scale (CMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431399">Cohen, 1997</xref>), which consists of six sub-tests designed to measure different aspects of memory functioning in children between 5 and 16 years of age. The Word Pairs sub-test assesses verbal learning and memory. It provides scores for learning (total capacity to learn word pairs), short-term memory (immediate free recall of word pairs), long-term memory (delayed free recall of word pairs) and long-term recognition (ability to differentiate memory storage from recall per se). It is designed to be individually administered. The CMS is psychometrically sound. Internal consistency coefficients for the sub-tests range from .71 to .91 for the verbal sub-tests, .72 to .84 for the delayed recall tasks, and .75 to .79 for the delayed recognition tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411431399">Cohen, 1997</xref>). It has also been found to correlate strongly with other measures of memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0255761411431399">Vaupel, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Verbal and non-verbal intelligence</italic>: Intelligence was assessed with the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411431399">Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004</xref>). The KBIT-2 is a brief measure of verbal and non-verbal cognitive ability in people between 4 and 90 years of age. Typically administered individually, in the current study the KBIT-2 was adapted for group administration with permission from the authors. The verbal scale contains two sub-tests, verbal knowledge and riddles, which measure knowledge of words and their meanings (crystallized intelligence). The non-verbal scale comprises a matrices sub-test that measures the ability to solve novel problems by perceiving relationships and completing analogies (fluid intelligence). Verbal and non-verbal scores are combined to determine the composite IQ score. The KBIT-2 has sound psychometric properties. Average internal consistency coefficients for the IQ composite range from .89 to .96. Average split-half reliability for children and adolescents aged between 4 and 18 years is .90 for the verbal score and .86 for the non-verbal score. The IQ composite correlates strongly (<italic>r</italic> = .77) with the full scale IQ score in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411431399">Homack &amp; Reynolds, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Self-esteem</italic>: Self-esteem was measured using the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventories – Third Edition (CFSEI-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411431399">Battle, 2002</xref>), which consist of age-appropriate self-report questionnaires that measure self-esteem levels in children and adolescents between 6.0 and 18.11 years of age. The CFSEI-3 assesses four areas of self-esteem: academic, general, parental/home and social, as well as a global self-esteem quotient (GSEQ). The primary form for 6- to 8-year-olds contains 29 items, while the intermediate form for 9- to 12-year-olds consists of 64 items. Examples of items are: <italic>My teacher feels that I am not good enough; I am never shy; My family thinks I am important</italic>; and <italic>Children often pick on me</italic>. Simple yes or no responses may be given orally or in writing. The CFSEI-3 can be administered individually or in a group format. The CFSEI-3 has been found to have sound psychometric properties. For GSEQ scores, average internal consistency coefficients range from .81 to .93, and time sampling coefficients range from .72 to .98. It also correlates strongly with other measures of self-esteem and self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411431399">Battle, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Attitudes toward school</italic>: The Australian Council for Educational Research School Life Questionnaire (ACER SLQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411431399">1984</xref>) was used to measure attitudes towards school, learning, teachers and other students. It consists of 40 statements about a number of aspects of school life to which students rate their level of agreement on a four-point Likert scale (<italic>definitely agree, mostly agree, mostly disagree, definitely disagree</italic>). Examples of items are: <italic>My school is a place where I feel proud to be a student; My school is a place where teachers are fair and just</italic>; and <italic>My school is a place where I feel lonely</italic>. Items are sub-divided into two general scales, which reflect positive and negative feelings toward school, and five specific scales that relate to attitudes towards teachers, the relevance of schooling, level of success in schoolwork, status among peers, and degree of social integration. The ACER SLQ has been shown to be a reliable measure. It has a reliability coefficient of .93, with reliability coefficients for individual sub-scales ranging from .74 to .87 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0255761411431399">Todd, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Motivation and engagement</italic>: Motivation and engagement in music, drama and art were assessed using the Motivation and Engagement Scale – Music (MES-M) and two adaptations of this scale for art and drama. The MES-M comprises 11 scales that represent adaptive cognitions and behaviours (such as self-belief and persistence) and maladaptive cognitions and behaviours (such as anxiety and self-sabotage). There are 44 items, four for each scale, to which respondents rate their level of agreement on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>disagree strongly</italic> to 7 = <italic>agree strongly</italic>). Examples of items are: <italic>If I can’t understand something in my music at first, I keep going over it until I do; I worry about performing poorly in my music; What I learn in my music will be useful to me in the future</italic>; and <italic>I’ve pretty much given up being involved in my music</italic>. These scales can then be combined into four over-arching clusters: booster thoughts, booster behaviours, mufflers and guzzlers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431399">Martin, 2008</xref>). The MES-M can be administered individually or to groups, and can be easily adapted to other performing or creative arts, such as drama and art, by substituting the word <italic>music</italic> (permission obtained from the author). Internal consistency coefficients for each scale range from .72 to .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431399">Martin, 2008</xref>). In addition, the MES-M has demonstrated good external validity through correlations with items that measure enjoyment of music, music participation, positive music intentions, music buoyancy, and flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411431399">Martin, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Experiment 2 measures</title>
<p><italic>Self-esteem</italic>: The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0255761411431399">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>) is a widely-used measure of global self-esteem. It consists of 10 items relating to self-worth and self-acceptance to which respondents indicate their level of agreement on a four-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Five items are positively worded (e.g., <italic>I feel that I have a number of good qualities</italic>) and five are negatively worded (e.g., <italic>At times I think I am no good at all</italic>). In a sample of high school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411431399">McCarthy and Hoge (1982)</xref> reported an internal consistency coefficient for the SES of .74, and a test–re-test coefficient of .77. Convergent validity is demonstrated by a strong correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .76) with the Global Self-Worth Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411431399">Hagborg, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Aggression</italic>: The Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411431399">Buss &amp; Warren, 2000</xref>) is a brief measure of anger and aggression for people aged nine years and older. It contains five scales: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, hostility, and indirect aggression, as well as a total score and an inconsistent responding index as a validity indicator. It consists of 34 items relating to aggressive characteristics with a five-point Likert scale response format (1 = <italic>not at all like me</italic> to 5 = <italic>completely like me</italic>). Examples of items are: <italic>My friends say that I argue a lot; I have threatened people I know; I have trouble controlling my temper</italic>; and <italic>I wonder what people want when they are nice to me</italic>. The AQ can be administered individually or in a group format. Internal consistency estimates for the AQ sub-scales range from .71 to .88, and test–re-test reliability estimates range between .72 and .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411431399">Buss &amp; Warren, 2000</xref>). All AQ scores have been found to correlate positively with scores on the Children’s Inventory of Anger and on the Novaco Anger Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411431399">Buss &amp; Warren, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Attitudes to school</italic>: The Attitudes to School Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411431399">Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, 2006</xref>) assesses the perceptions of students in years 5 to 12 on school life. It consists of 52 items that are categorized into 11 scales. Respondents indicate their level of agreement on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 7 = <italic>all the time</italic>) for items on two scales: student morale and student distress. Agreement level is indicated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) for items on the remaining nine scales: learning confidence, school connectedness, student motivation, classroom behaviour, teaching and learning, connectedness to peers, stimulating learning, student safety, and teacher empathy. Examples of items are: <italic>I feel uneasy at school; I am a very good student; I feel I belong at this school</italic>; and <italic>My teachers make learning interesting</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Social skills</italic>: The Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990) assesses social skills, problem behaviours and academic competence in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. It has three behaviour rating forms (teacher, parents, and student versions) that may be used separately or in combination. The parent form (elementary level) contains 55 items: 38 social skills items (e.g., <italic>compliments friends</italic>) and 17 problem behaviours items (e.g., <italic>has temper tantrums</italic>). Items on the social skills and problem behaviours scales are rated according to perceived frequency on a three-point scale (0 = <italic>never</italic> to 2 = <italic>very often</italic>). Items on the social skills scale are also rated according to perceived importance to successful functioning on a three-point scale (0 = <italic>not important</italic> to 2 = <italic>critical</italic>). The student version (elementary level) contains 34 items, all of which relate to social skills (e.g., <italic>Ignore children teasing me</italic>), and which are rated on a three-point scale according to perceived frequency (0 = <italic>never</italic> to 2 = <italic>very often</italic>). The SSRS has been shown to be psychometrically sound. Internal consistency estimates are .87 for the parent form (elementary level) and .83 for the student form (elementary level). Test–re-test reliability estimates are .87 for the parent form (elementary level) and .68 for the student form (elementary level). The validity of the SSRS has been demonstrated through its moderate correlations with similar measures of social skills and problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411431399">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Depression</italic>: Depression was assessed with the Reynolds Child Depression Scale (RCDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411431399">Reynolds, 1989</xref>). This is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms for children aged 8 to 12 years. It can be administered individually or to groups. The RCDS consists of 30 items, of which 29 require respondents to indicate how often they have experienced a depressive symptom over the past two weeks on a four-point Likert scale (<italic>almost never, sometimes, a lot of the time</italic>, or <italic>all the time).</italic> Examples of items are: <italic>I feel sad; I have trouble sleeping; I feel I am no good</italic>; and <italic>I worry about school</italic>. The final item requires respondents to select one of five faces that depict emotions ranging from happy to sad. The RCDS is a reliable and valid measure of depressive symptoms. Internal consistency coefficients range from .87 to .90, and reported test–re-test reliability coefficients range between .81 and .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411431399">Reynolds, 1989</xref>). It also correlates strongly with the Children’s Depression Inventory (<italic>r</italic> = .73) and the Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised (<italic>r</italic> = .76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411431399">Reynolds, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Academic measures</italic>: Academic measures of reading, writing, speaking, space, number, structure, measurement and working mathematically were accessed from the school. These measures were obtained via the Victorian Education Learning Standards (VELS), which offer assessment standards for all students from prep to year 10 in Victorian primary and secondary schools. Teachers assess whether students complete a set of learning activities which demonstrate students’ understanding of the curriculum (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/parents/assess.html">http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/parents/assess.html</ext-link> for further detail).</p>

<title>Absence d’effects psychosocial et cognitif répandus de l’enseignement musical en milieu scolaire chez des étudiants à l’age de 10–13 ans</title>
<p>Des études antérieures démontrent que la formation musicale privée a des avantages qui peuvent être transférés à d’autres domaines, notamment la mémoire verbale, l’intelligence et l’estime de soi. Cet article rapporte l’impact d’une augmentation de la formation musicale en milieu scolaire sur une série de mesures cognitives et psychosociales chez des étudiants de 10–13 ans dans deux études indépendantes. Dans la première étude, les avantages de la augmentation de cours de musique ont été comparés avec celles de classe de théâtre et des cours d’art chez les élèves du secondaire (<italic>N</italic> = 127). La deuxième étude a comparé les effets de l’introduction d’un nouveau programme de musique en classe avec un programme nouveau de classe de théâtre chez les élèves des écoles primaires (<italic>N</italic> = 100). Des évaluations ont été obtenues au début et environ six mois après la mise en œuvre de chaque programme. Contrairement aux recherches antérieures sur les effets des cours de musique privés, aucuns avantages convaincants de classes de musique à l’école étaient apparentes. Tendances d’intérêt ont été observées dans les scores d’intelligence non verbale, d’agression, et de la mémoire verbale, qui nécessitent une enquête plus approfondie. Les résultats suggèrent que les avantages de l’enseignement musical indiqués précédemment peuvent être limitées à l’enseignement privé de musique ou externe à l’école, ou à des écoles socio-économique défavorisées. La valeur intrinsèque de l’éducation musicale pour le plaisir et l’apprentissage devrait donc rester au cœur de la justification de l’éducation musicale dans les programmes scolaires nationaux.</p>

<title>Ausbleiben von verbreiteten psychosozialen und kognitiven Auswirkungen von schulischer Musikerziehung bei 10- bis 13-jährigen Schülern</title>
<p>Frühere Studien haben bewiesen, daß privater Musikunterricht Vorteile hat, die sich auf andere Bereiche übertragen können, wie verbales Gedächtnis, Intelligenz und Selbstbewusstsein. Dieser Aufsatz berichtet von der Auswirkung eines intensiveren schulischen Musikunterrichts auf eine Anzahl von kognitiven und psychosozialen Messungen bei 10- bis 13-Jährigen in zwei unabhängigen Studien. In der ersten Studie wurden die Vorteile einer zunehmenden Häufigkeit an schulischem Musikunterricht mit den Vorteilen von schulischem Theater- und Kunstunterricht bei Oberstufenschülern (<italic>N</italic> = 127) verglichen. Bei der zweiten Studie handelt es sich um den Vergleich von den Auswirkungen der Einführung eines neuen schulischen Musikprogramms mit den Auswirkungen eines neuen Theaterprogramms für Grundschüler (<italic>N</italic> = 200). Ergebnisse wurden zu Anfang sowie ungefähr sechs Monate nach Einführung des jeweiligen Programms erhalten. Im Vergleich zu früherer Forschung über die Auswirkung privater Musikerziehung wurden keine überzeugenden Vorteile von schulischem Musikunterricht festgestellt. Interessante Tendenzen wurden bei nicht-verbaler Intelligenz, Aggressionswerten und verbalem Gedächtnis beobachtet, die aber weitergehende Forschung erfordern. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, daß die Vorteile von Musikunterricht, von denen vorher berichtet wurde, auf private oder extern basierte Musikbildung, oder auf sozio-ökonomisch vernachlässigte Schulen beschränkt werden können. Der inhärente Wert von Musikerziehung zum Spaß und zur Bildung sollte deshalb zentral bleiben bei der Rechtfertigung von Musikausbildung im nationalen Lehrplan.</p>
<p>Falta de Difusión de los Efectos Cognitivos y Psicosociales en la formación musical escolar en estudiantes de 10 a 13 años</p>
<p>Estudios previos demuestran que la formación musical privada tiene beneficios que pueden transferirse a otros dominios, incluyendo la memoria verbal, la inteligencia y la autoestima. El presente artículo informa de dos estudios independientes sobre el impacto de la formación musical escolar en el incremento de una serie de medidas cognitivas y psicosociales entre los 10 y 13 años de edad. En el primer estudio, se compararon los beneficios para unos estudiantes de Secundaria (<italic>N</italic> = 127) de una mayor frecuencia de clases de música con respecto a otro grupo que recibió clases de teatro y arte. El segundo estudio comparó los efectos de introducir un nuevo programa de música en el aula con respecto a otro de teatro en estudiantes de Primaria (<italic>N</italic> = 100). Los valores encontrados se obtuvieron al inicio del estudio y aproximadamente seis meses después del inicio de cada programa. En contraste con investigaciones previas sobre los efectos de las clases particulares de música, no se encontraron indicios convincentes de beneficios de la música escolar. Se observaron tendencias a mejorar la inteligencia no verbal, la agresividad y la memoria verbal que requieren de posterior investigación. Los hallazgos sugieren que los beneficios de la formación musical conocida con anterioridad puede limitarse a la enseñanza privada o extraescolar, o a las escuelas con desventaja socioeconómica. El valor intrínseco de la educación musical para disfrute y aprendizaje debieran, por tanto, permanecer como base para la justificación de la educación musical en los sistemas educativos obligatorios.</p>
