<abstract>
<p>This study compared the pattern of relationships among personality, vocational interests, and career exploration within an integrated framework between 369 American and 392 Hong Kong university students. The first hypothesis predicted differential contributions of the universal and indigenous personality dimensions based on the Cross-cultural (Chinese) Personality Assessment Inventory-2 (CPAI-2) to career exploration of the American and Hong Kong students. The second hypothesis predicted that vocational interests mediated the association between personality and career exploration of the students. Cultural differences were found between the personality predictors for Hong Kong and American students, supporting the first hypothesis. The CPAI-2 indigenous personality dimensions derived in the Chinese cultural context predicted career exploration of Hong Kong students only. The second hypothesis was partially supported: Enterprise interest type mediated the association between Social Potency and career exploration in the Hong Kong sample; Artistic interest type was the mediator in the American sample. The contributions of personality and vocational interests to students’ career exploration, and the implications to cross-cultural career counseling were discussed.</p>

<p>As a central construct of career development, career exploration involves activities that attempt to relate knowledge of oneself to the external world and the internal world (e.g., knowledge and mental structures) and can be described as an openness to experience that fosters self-discovery and prompts reflection about environmental action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417167">Blustein &amp; Flum, 1999</xref>). In the career development literature, many studies have explored its antecedents based on the traditional trait-factor models and suggested several pivotal factors such as personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072711417167">Larson, Wei, Wu, Bailey, &amp; Borgen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed, Bruch, &amp; Haase, 2004</xref>) and vocational interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>). These variables are not isolated and their interactions should not be ignored. It is also likely that there are some indirect effects, such that personality affects career exploration through different vocational interests. Few studies have explored how trait factors such as personality and vocational interests interact within an integrated framework.</p>
<p>Vocational psychologists have recognized that traditional trait-factor models of career development tend to channel people into fields that would express their internal characteristics based on limited past experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072711417167">Krumboltz, 1996</xref>). Thus, these models may constrict individual choices rather than broaden and encourage growth and personal awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1069072711417167">White, 2006</xref>). In contrast, social cognitive career theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711417167">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>) emphasizes how one’s experience influences his or her vocational expectations which, in turn, are related to career behaviors such as occupational information seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed et al., 2004</xref>). As such, career exploration is an interactive and ongoing process, involving the reproduction of existing mental structures as well as their transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711417167">Cohen, Duberley, &amp; Mallon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural context is also an important environmental variable that affects the relationship among career exploration, personality, and vocational interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711417167">Burr, 1995</xref>). The effects of culture on personality or vocational interests have been examined extensively in cross-cultural psychology. The contributions of these variables to career exploration might vary in different cultural contexts. However, there has been a relative dearth of studies examining the cultural dimensions of these relationships with a combination of the etic and emic approaches that are sensitive to different cultural contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711417167">Farh, Leong, &amp; Law, 1998</xref>). Theoretically, this brings us to examine both the cultural validity of applying Western theories of career development into Eastern cultures and the culturally unique aspects of career development in specific cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711417167">Leong &amp; Brown, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although much of the research on career development is based on Western samples (especially on American samples), the increasing globalization of the occupational landscape increases the need to investigate the cross-cultural validity of career development theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1069072711417167">Nota, Ferrari, Solber, &amp; Soresi, 2007</xref>). In collectivistic cultures, social factors may have a greater influence on the individuals’ interests and behaviors. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072711417167">Leong, Kao, and Lee (2004)</xref> found ethnic differences in the relationship between family dynamics and vocational interests of European American and Chinese American students.</p>

<title>Contributions of Personality Traits and Vocational Interest to Career Exploration</title>
<p>Theoretically, personality traits are presumed to crystallize in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069072711417167">Cattell, 1973</xref>). On the other hand, it is generally argued that vocational interests may be developed later and have their roots in the individual’s personality space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711417167">Zak, Meir, &amp; Kraemer, 1979</xref>). Research evidence generally supported that personality traits are associated with vocational interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711417167">De Fruyt &amp; Mervielde, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711417167">Larson, Rottinghaus, &amp; Borgen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417167">Zhang, 2008</xref>), and both jointly affect vocational behaviors and career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711417167">Gellatly, Paunonen, Meyer, Jackson, &amp; Goffin, 1991</xref>). The relationship between personality and vocational interests has been well established. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711417167">Larson et al. (2002)</xref> concluded in a meta-analysis that the Holland’s six interest dimensions and the big-five personality dimensions were substantially correlated (e.g., Artistic with Openness, Enterprising with Extraversion, Social with Extraversion, Investigative with Openness, and Social with Agreeableness). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417167">Zhang (2008)</xref> obtained similar results in Hong Kong university students. This conclusion was consistent with the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711417167">Costa, McCrae, and Holland (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711417167">Holland’s (1997)</xref> argument that vocational interests are strongly influenced by personality traits.</p>
<p>The independent contributions of personality traits and vocational interests to career exploration have also been well studied in literature. First, major personality models (e.g., FFM, 16PF) have been used to examine the contributions of personality traits to career exploration or related vocational behaviors. For example, all five personality factors of the Five-Factor Model have been shown to associate with a variety of vocational behaviors including career exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1069072711417167">Tokar, Fischer, &amp; Subich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed et al., 2004</xref>). Particularly, career self-exploration was well predicted by neuroticism and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed et al., 2004</xref>). In another multifactor study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta (2007)</xref> also found that openness was positively related with career self-exploration.</p>
<p>With the development of indigenous personality measures, the additional contributions of emic personality traits to the prediction of vocational behaviors were also examined. For instance, senior executives’ leadership behaviors showed significant correlation with the indigenous Interpersonal Relatedness (IR) factor of the Cross-cultural Personality Assessment Inventory (CPAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711417167">Cheung, Fan, &amp; To, 2008</xref>). The trait of Harmony was significantly associated with the interpersonal as opposed to the personal domains of job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072711417167">Kwong &amp; Cheung, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the contributions of vocational interests to career exploration or related variables were well supported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417167">Blustein &amp; Flum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072711417167">Randahl, Hansen, &amp; Haverkamp, 1993</xref>). Generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711417167">Holland’s (1997)</xref> theory of vocational interests (RIASEC) and its three most widely used assessing instruments, namely, the UNIACT-R (the Unisex Edition of the ACT Interest Inventory), the Self-Directed Search (the SDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069072711417167">Holland, 1985</xref>), and the Strong Interest Inventory (SII; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711417167">Harmon, Hansen, Borgen, &amp; Hammer, 1994</xref>), have been employed in different ethnic samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711417167">Day &amp; Rounds, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072711417167">Leong et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta (2007)</xref> found that five of six Holland interest types (i.e., Realistic, Artistic, Conventional, Investigative, and Enterprising [RIASEC]) were significantly associated with career self-exploration among college students. In a longitudinal study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072711417167">Randahl et al. (1993)</xref> found that the experimental participants, who received a SII profile interpretation and feedback about their vocational interests, engaged in more career exploration activities (e.g., individual information seeking) than did the contrast group.</p>
<p>To sum up, while many studies demonstrated the significant effects of personality traits on career exploration, as well as those of vocational interests on career exploration, the interaction among the predictors were seldom examined.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The present study aims to examine a mediating model of career exploration that integrated personality and vocational interests across two cultural contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069072711417167">Figure 1</xref>
). In a university student sample from the United States and from Hong Kong, a combined etic-emic approach for personality assessment that is derived in the Chinese cultural context, which includes universal and indigenously derived personality dimensions, was adopted to explore possible cultural differences in the pattern of relationships among personality, vocational interests, and career exploration. In particular, the cultural relevance of the universal dimensions of personality traits, vocational interests based on Holland’s model, and career exploration behaviors based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417167">Stumpf, Colarelli, and Hartman’s (1983)</xref> model were examined in the Hong Kong sample. At the same time, the relevance of the indigenous personality dimensions developed in the Chinese context would be explored in the U.S. sample.</p>

</fig>
<p>Generally, personality, as a fundamental construct in psychology, should be distal antecedents of other later developed psychological features such as vocational interests and career explorations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711417167">Zak et al., 1979</xref>). The evidence about the contributions of personality to vocational interests and career development variables (including career explorations) has been well established in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711417167">De Fruyt &amp; Mervielde, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711417167">Larson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417167">Zhang, 2008</xref>). Causal paths from personality to vocational interests and career explorations are largely possible. The causal paths could be developed by first differentiating between the constructs of vocational interests and career exploration as follows. (1) Career explorations define a set of outcome behaviors that directly reflects individuals’ performances in career development. (2) In the research literature, vocational interest types are suggested as a set of “intellectual styles”, which define individual preferences to particular activities or behavior modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1069072711417167">Messick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1069072711417167">Riding &amp; Cheema, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1069072711417167">Zhang &amp; Sternberg, 2005</xref>). In other words, vocational interest type could be a bridge or interface between basic mental properties (e.g., general personality factors) and individuals’ behavior outcome (e.g., career-related behaviors) and could thus affect individuals’ behaviors such as career explorations. The contributions of vocational interests to career exploration or related variables were well supported in the literature as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711417167">Blustein &amp; Flum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1069072711417167">Randahl et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, we argue that it is theoretically suitable that the causal path of vocational interests would mediate the prediction of the underlying general personality factors on the specific career exploration behaviors.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined two hypotheses. First, universal personality dimensions could significantly predict career exploration in both Hong Kong and American samples, but the indigenously derived personality dimensions would contribute added value in predicting career exploration beyond the universal predictors in the Hong Kong sample. Second, different vocational interests would significantly mediate the effects of personality factors on career exploration.</p>
<p>The two hypotheses could be integrated into a framework for both cultural samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069072711417167">Figure 1</xref>): As the primary linkage in this model, path β<sub>31</sub> represents direct effect of personality traits to career exploration; path β<sub>21</sub> represents direct effect of personality traits to vocational interests; path β<sub>32</sub> represents direct effect of vocational interest to career exploration. The hypothesized effects of personality traits and vocational interests on career exploration were analyzed within an integrated framework among university students from two different cultural settings.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample included students from different majors in two comprehensive universities in Hong Kong and one university in the United States, respectively. The final sample consisted of 761 valid cases (723 freshmen and 38 sophomores), with 392 from Hong Kong (274 females and 118 males) and 369 from the United States (294 females and 75 males). The 38 sophomores were all American students. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 23 years (<italic>M</italic> = 19.24, <italic>SD</italic> = .88). In addition, as university education in Hong Kong is 3 years instead of 4 years, year one students in Hong Kong may be close in age to sophomores in the United States. For the purpose of data analysis, students aged lower than 20 were classified as the younger group (<italic>N</italic> = 556) and those aged 20 or above as the older group (<italic>N</italic> = 205).</p>

<title>Personality dimensions</title>
<p>The Cross-cultural (Chinese) Personality Assessment Inventory-2 (CPAI-2, Form B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711417167">Cheung, Leung, Song, &amp; Zhang, 2001</xref>) was employed to assess personality. The CPAI-2 consists of 28 general personality subscales that loaded on four factors (namely, Social Potency/ Expansiveness, Dependability, Accommodation, and IR). The CPAI-2 was standardized in 2001 on a representative sample of 1,911 adults in Mainland China and Hong Kong. The four-factor structure extracted from the standardization sample was congruent among college samples in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711417167">Cheung, Cheung, Zhang, Leung, Leong et al., 2008</xref>), as well as in other samples in Western contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711417167">Cheung, Cheung, Leung, Ward, &amp; Leong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711417167">Lin &amp; Church, 2004</xref>). The Social Potency factor assesses traits related to pursuit of variety, innovation, self-development, leadership, and sociability. Particularly, the factor includes Extraversion together with several Openness-related scales that were constructed in a Chinese context. Dependability measures the aspects of personality traits connected with reliability, responsibility, emotional stability, and earnestness. Accommodation assesses how people accept others and adapt themselves to the environment and the collective. The IR factor distinguishes the CPAI-2 from other Western personality models such as the Big Five with a unique culturally relevant dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711417167">Cheung, Cheung et al., 2008</xref>). The IR factor assesses the aspect of formalistic relationship orientation in collective societies. The coverage of IR is broader than the meaning expressed by Agreeableness in the Big Five and includes the qualities of humanity and social propriety in Confucian philosophy. An individual may achieve this equilibrium through personal cultivation and self-discipline (inner sageliness or “nei-sheng”) and maintaining harmony and propriety in relation to others (outer kingliness or “wai-wang”).</p>
<p>The CPAI-2 is answered in a True/False response format. The alpha coefficients of four factors (based on the subscales)—Social Potency/Expansiveness, Dependability, Accommodation, and IR—were .84, .78, .72, and .53, respectively, in the present Hong Kong sample; while they were .80, .78, .72, and .62, respectively, in the present American sample. Given the complex nature of the IR factor, its alpha values were generally lower than normal. One possible reason might be that these indigenous constructs reflected a culturally relevant broad bandwidth in the corresponding mental space at the expense of maximizing fidelity from a psychometric perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072711417167">Dawis, 1987</xref>). In addition, the use of the True/False instead of a Likert-type scale response format might also be a constraint.</p>

<p>The Unisex Edition of the ACT Interest Inventory (UNIACT-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072711417167">Swaney, 1995</xref>) developed by American College Testing (ACT) was used as the measure of Holland’s model of vocational interest in this study. The UNIACT-R’s items emphasize work-relevant activities (e.g., fix a toy) that are familiar to most people. The items were carefully chosen in order to minimize the effects of sex biases. The UNIACT-R provides six scores that parallel Holland’s six interest and occupational types: Technical (Realistic), Science (Investigative), Arts (Artistic), Social Service (Social), Business Contact (Enterprising), and Business Operations (Conventional). It consists of 90 items with 15 items measuring each type. Each item refers to a specific activity measured on a 3-point scale (<italic>dislike</italic> = 1, <italic>indifferent</italic> = 2, or <italic>like</italic> = 3). One sample item is “Build a picture frame” (Realistic). According to the technical manual of the UNIACT-R, internal consistency reliability estimates for its subscales range from .83 to .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1069072711417167">Swaney, 1995</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711417167">Farh et al. (1998)</xref> obtained Cronbach’s alphas on the UNIACT-R scales in a Hong Kong college sample ranging from .82 to .88.

<sec id="section10-1069072711417167">
<title>Career exploration</title>
<p>Career self-exploration and environment exploration were assessed by employing the corresponding subscales of the Career Exploration Survey (CES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417167">Stumpf et al., 1983</xref>), which is currently the most widely used model and measure. The CES was developed to assess career-search behaviors, reactions to exploration, and beliefs about exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417167">Stumpf et al., 1983</xref>). We selected the 5-item Self-Exploration (CSE) subscale that measures behavior engaged in self-assessment and introspection in career exploration, and the 6-item Environment Exploration (CEE) subscale that examines the extent of career exploration in the work environment. A 5-point response format was used where 1 indicates very little whereas 5 indicates very high in terms of the degree to which the person has engaged in the corresponding aspects of career exploration. One sample item in CSE is “To what extent have you reflected on how your past integrated with your future career?” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417167">Stumpf et al. (1983)</xref>, the alpha coefficients of the two subscales were .88 (CSE) and .83 (CEE). For the current sample, the corresponding values were .88 (CSE) and .87(CEE) in the Hong Kong sample and .82 (CSE) and .84 (CEE) in the American sample.</p>
<p>In addition to these standardized measures, we obtained information on the participants’ background. Both the Chinese and the English versions of the CPAI-2 were provided by its developers. For the other two measures, Chinese versions were developed using back-translation and consensual revision procedures to ensure accuracy in translation.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The data collection was conducted in a class setting through traditional pencil-and-paper mode. The American participants received either extra credit toward a course requirement or a gift card of US$5. The Hong Kong participants obtained either 1 hour credit for subject pool requirement of the introductory psychology course or HK$40 (about US$5) as a token for their participation. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>

<sec id="section12-1069072711417167">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Previous research suggested that age and gender are two important correlates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1069072711417167">McCrae et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1069072711417167">Stumpf et al., 1983</xref>) of personality traits, vocational interests, and career exploration. Thus, a MANOVA procedure was first used to examine the differences in research variables in relation to gender, age, and culture. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the contributions of universal and indigenous personality dimensions based on the CPAI-2 to career exploration by subgroups in relation to the cultural factor. Finally, mediating effects of vocational interests on the relationship between personality and career exploration were further investigated among different subgroups with structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure.</p>

 reports the means and standard deviations of variables used in the present study. A 2 (age group) × 2 (gender) × 2 (culture) MANOVA procedure was employed to examine the effects of the three variables on the differences of the research variables including personality traits, vocational interests, and career exploration. The results indicated that only the culture factor showed observable main effect (Wilks’s Λ= .82, <italic>F</italic>(12, 742) = 13.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .18) in terms of significance level (<italic>p</italic> value) and effect size (η<sup>2</sup>). In the present study, the gender proportion of the samples was very uneven (Hong Kong sample, male vs. female: 118 vs. 274; American sample, male vs. female: 75 vs. 294). The age variable was restricted with 98% the students’ ages ranging only from 18 to 21. Therefore, the variables of gender and age would not be further considered in subsequent analyses. Further univariate analysis on the mean differences in research variables in relation to culture is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1069072711417167">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The results showed that there were significant cultural differences in three of the four personality factors, four of the six vocational interests, and CEE between Hong Kong and American students. Specifically, for personality traits, students from Hong Kong scored lower on the factor of Social Potency and Dependability, but higher on IR, than did American students. On the UNIACT-R, students from Hong Kong scored lower on Investigative and Social interests, but higher on Realistic and Conventional interests, than did American students. Concerning career exploration, Hong Kong students scored significantly lower on CEE than did their American counterparts, but no significant difference on the CSE score was found between the two cultural groups.</p>

<title>Contributions of Personality Traits to Career Exploration</title>
<p>The contributions of universal and indigenous dimensions of personality assessed by the CPAI-2 to career exploration were investigated with a hierarchical multiple regression procedure for the two groups separately (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1069072711417167">Table 2</xref>
). The results indicated that the universal personality factors and the indigenous personality factor together explained 15% of the total variance in CSE and 6% of that in CEE among the Hong Kong students. For the American sample, the corresponding values were 12% and 10%, respectively. Among the three universal personality factors, Social Potency significantly predicted CSE and CEE in both samples. However, Accommodation was a significant predictor of CSE and CEE in the Hong Kong sample only; Dependability was a significant predictor of CSE and CEE in the American sample only. Particularly, as predicted, the indigenously IR factor significantly contributed unique variance to CSE and CEE beyond those universal personality factors in the Hong Kong sample only. In contrast, the contributions of IR to either CSE or CEE were insignificant in the American sample.</p>

<title>Mediating Effects of Vocational Interests on the Relationships Between Personality Traits and Career Exploration</title>
<p>We first identified a possible mediating model according to the conditions suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711417167">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>: (a) the total effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be significant; (b) the path from the independent variable to the mediator must be significant; (c) the path from the mediator to the dependent variable must be significant; and (d) these relations must reduce the direct effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable.</p>
<p>A series of regression functions was developed for each path in the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069072711417167">Figure 1</xref>). First, concerning the first condition—the total effects of personality factors on CSE, regression analyses indicated that Social Potency (β = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Accommodation (β = −.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and IR (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) significantly predicted CSE in Hong Kong sample (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), while in the American sample, only the effects of Social Potency (β = .34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Dependability (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significant (<italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Similar results were obtained for the influences of personality on CEE with the exception that the explained variance of CEE by personality was a bit lower than that obtained from CSE. Thus, these significant direct effects from personality variables to both CSE and CEE laid the groundwork for examining the path from personality to vocational interest (Condition 2); and the path from vocational interest (possible mediator) to career exploration (Condition 3).</p>
<p>We then examined the path from vocational interests to career exploration by checking whether Condition 3 was satisfied. In the regression models, only the Enterprising type interest significantly contributed to CSE (β = .16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and CEE (β = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) in the Hong Kong sample. In the American sample, the effect of Artistic interest was significant on CSE (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the effects of Social interest on CSE (β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Investigative interest on CEE (β = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) were also significant.</p>
<p>Therefore, Condition 2 for the path from personality factors (independent variable) to vocational interest (possible mediator) was correspondingly examined as follows: (a) the Enterprise type was significantly predicted by Social Potency in the Hong Kong sample (β = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and (b) for the American sample, Investigative type was significantly predicted by Social Potency (β = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and IR (β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); Artistic type was significantly predicted by Social Potency (β = .50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Dependability (β = −.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); Social type interest was significantly predicted by Social Potency (β = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and IR (β = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>According to these abovementioned analyses and the first three necessary conditions for mediating effects proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711417167">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>, only three mediating models obtained significant support in light of the basic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1069072711417167">Figure 1</xref>. For each dimensions of all measures employed in the study, the individual items were randomly combined into parcels to reduce the number of cross-product indicators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711417167">Joreskog &amp; Yang, 1996</xref>). After parceling, every construct included two indicators.</p>

<p>First, after controlling for the mediating effect of Enterprising type interest, Social Potency still positively contributed to CSE in the Hong Kong college students (β<sub>31</sub> = .18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; Submodel 1). The mediating effect of Enterprising interest, β<sub>21</sub>β<sub>32</sub> = .48 × .18 = .09 (<italic>SE</italic> = .04), was significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. This result indicated that Enterprising vocational interest mediated or lessened the association between personality traits (Social Potency) and CSE. In other words, if Enterprising vocational interest had not been introduced in this model, the direct contributions of the Social Potency personality factor to CSE would have been higher or, specifically, would have been .18 + .09 = .27. The finding in this study indicated that the total effect of Social Potency on CSE was .27, of which .09, or around 33%, was mediated by Enterprising vocational interest.</p>
<p>Second, Enterprising interest type also significantly mediated the contribution of Social Potency to CEE among the Hong Kong students (Submodel 2; β<sub>31</sub> = .38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in this model). This suggested that after accounting for the mediating effect of Enterprising type interest, personality traits (Social Potency) still positively contributed to CEE. As expected and directly related to the mediating hypothesis, the mediating effect of Enterprising interest, β<sub>21</sub>β<sub>32</sub> = .26 × .20 = .05 (<italic>SE</italic> = .02), was significant, <italic>z</italic> = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the contributions of personality traits and vocational interests to career exploration within an integrated model among Hong Kong and American university students. At the same time, we also explored cultural differences in the pattern of relationships.</p>
<p>One specific postulation in our cross-cultural comparison relates to the differential influences of universal and indigenous personality dimensions on career exploration among Hong Kong and American students. Using the CPAI-2 that covers both universally applicable personality dimensions (etics) and personality dimensions that are particularly important to the Chinese culture (emics), we demonstrated the unique contributions of the IR factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711417167">Cheung, Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711417167">Cheung, Leung, Zhang, Sun, &amp; Gan et al., 2001</xref>). IR features the qualities of humanity and social propriety in Confucian philosophy and reflects the aspect of formalistic relationship orientation in collective societies. On average, Hong Kong students scored higher than American students on this personality dimension. As predicted, the influences of IR on career exploration were significant and beyond those of the universal personality factors, but this effect was only found on Hong Kong students. This suggests that the indigenous personality factor that highlights relational orientation had added value in predicting career exploration in a Chinese cultural context. In contrast, the contributions of IR to either CSE or CEE were insignificant among the American sample.</p>
<p>Significant cultural differences were also found in the contributions of the other two universal dimensions, Accommodation and Dependability. The Accommodation personality factor was more important to career exploration in Hong Kong context whereas Dependability was more important in the American context. Theoretically, the Accommodation factor overlaps with some universal agreeableness traits but also includes collectivistic characteristics related to accommodating other people in the social environment. The importance of interpersonal relationships to the Chinese collectivistic cultural context is confirmed. On the other hand, Dependability, which mainly assesses the personality traits of reliability, responsibility, stability, and earnestness, reflects more intrapersonal characteristics that may be emphasized in an individualistic society.</p>
<p>The contributions of Social Potency to career exploration did not show obvious differences between Hong Kong and American students. In the CPAI-2, the Social Potency factor combines both Extraversion and Openness in a dynamic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711417167">Cheung, Cheung et al., 2008</xref>). As both openness and extraversion have been found to be important predictors of CSE in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed et al., 2004</xref>), the cross-cultural relevance of Social Potency to CSE would be supported.</p>
<p>In this study, the direct contributions of personality to the prediction of career exploration were stronger than those of vocational interests in both cultural samples. Personality traits are presumed to crystallize in early childhood whereas vocational interests may develop later and have their roots in the individual’s personality space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1069072711417167">Zak et al., 1979</xref>). Previous studies showed that Extraversion and Openness, the two Big Five factors that are covered under the CPAI Social Potency factor, had the strongest association with vocational interests among both Hong Kong and American university students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711417167">Larson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1069072711417167">Zhang, 2008</xref>). In this study, the Social Potency factor was also the strongest predictor of vocational interest types among the four CPAI-2 personality factors. Similarly, it was the strongest predictor of both CSE and CEE in the American sample. In the Hong Kong sample, Social Potency was the strongest predictor of CEE and had a strong contribution to CSE along with the Accommodation factor. It is reasonable to expect a more dominant role of this universal personality dimension in the integrated framework of vocational behavior.</p>
<p>We further examined the role played by vocational interests in mediating the relationship between distal personality predictors and career exploration in the second hypothesis. While all four CPAI-2 personality factors showed significant influences on career exploration in the regression analysis, only the effects of Social Potency were significantly mediated by two of the six vocational interest types (i.e., Enterprising and Artistic types). From a mediational perspective, even though personality traits are pivotal antecedents to individual’s career exploration behaviors, the process of their influence depends on the individuals’ particular vocational interests as well. In other words, individual’s career preferences also important factors in this causal chain.</p>
<p>The finding of the partial role of vocational interests in mediating the effect of the Social Potency personality factor on students’ career exploration suggested an additional dimension to the conceptualization of career exploration beyond the direct relationships between these sets of variables. We postulated that the actual association between students’ personality and career exploration was attenuated by the mediating influences of vocational interests. The findings in this study partially confirmed the associations among the three constructs. However, as shown in the regression analyses, the direct contributions of personality to the prediction of career exploration were relatively stronger than those of vocational interests. The SEM analysis further suggested that a pathway whereby the total effects of the most important personality factor related to career exploration and Social Potency was mediated by participants’ various vocational interests, with slightly different patterns between the two cultural samples. Social Potency is the general personality factor most dominantly related to career exploration as well as to some of the vocational interests. The particular vocation interests would partially mediate the specific pathway of Social Potency’s effect on career exploration behaviors.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong sample, Social Potency predicted Enterprising interest type, which in turn showed significant mediating effect on the association between Social Potency and both CSE and CEE. The Enterprising type reflects an interest in working in environments that involve interactions with other people and taking up leadership roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711417167">Holland, 1997</xref>). Sociability, willingness to try out new ventures, and leadership potential fit the Enterprising type in the financial and commercial setting that is one of the largest employment sector of Hong Kong society. In this study, the only significant regression model of personality on vocational interest for the Hong Kong sample was the contribution of Social Potency to Enterprising interest type. The Enterprising interest type, in turn, had the stronger association with both forms of career exploration.</p>
<p>In contrast, Artistic interest type showed significant mediating effects on the link between Social Potency and CSE among the American students in this study. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711417167">Holland (1997)</xref>, people who are open would be interested in dealing with tasks that provide opportunities for using one’s imagination and wisdom, which are characteristics related to the Artistic type. In this study, it is likely that there is a strong association between the Artistic interest type and the sociability components of the Social Potency factor. On the other hand, the Artistic interest type would be likely to show strong connections with the openness and aesthetic components of the Social Potency factor. The explanatory model of the contributions of Social Potency as a multifaceted distal personality predictor of career exploration can be enhanced by the inclusion of vocational interests as a mediator.</p>
<p>The cultural differences in the mediating effects of vocational interests on the associations between personality and career exploration may be further explored in terms of the environmental context. With the strong business environment in Hong Kong, there are more information and activities associated with career development in the business and entrepreneurial sector for university students. Careers related to artistic interests are relatively scarce and are not generally encouraged by Chinese parents. On the other hand, in American society, there is more access to diverse career information and opportunities. People who are outgoing and creative are more likely to develop artistic interest leading to their career exploration behaviors. These contextual factors should be further examined in future cross-cultural studies.</p>

<title>Conclusions, Limitations, and Implications</title>
<p>Consistent with previous findings in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072711417167">Larson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1069072711417167">Nauta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1069072711417167">Reed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1069072711417167">Tokar et al., 1998</xref>), this study further demonstrated the significant contributions of personality traits and vocational interests to career exploration. Furthermore, the relations and interactions among the three constructs were considered conjointly within an integrated model in which they affected participants’ career exploration. Simultaneously, we considered the cultural differences in the pattern of relationships.</p>
<p>Three points are drawn from the findings in this study. First, university students’ career exploration was significantly influenced by personality factors and vocational interests across cultural settings. Second, there were partial interactions among these variables. Specifically, the direct influences of the universal Social Potency personality factor were significantly mediated by some vocational interests. Third, even though the contributions of personality and vocational interests to career exploration were generally significant across cultures, some culturally relevant differences were found. These cultural differences point to the importance of adopting culturally relevant measures to capture specific predictors that are important to the local culture.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the significant findings obtained in this study, we recognize that we only had one sample of Hong Kong students from two universities and one sample of U.S. students from one university in this study. These samples may not be representative of university students in both societies. The results should be cross-validated in other Chinese and American samples. Future studies that include participants from other cultural settings could guide us to consider the cultural validity and specificity of these career-relevant constructs from a cross-cultural perspective and unpackage the cultural and environmental variables that explain these differences.</p>
<p>The findings of this study also provide implications for career counseling of university students. While personality plays an important role in career exploration, vocational interests and preferences may partially mediate its effect. In particular, Social Potency as an underlying distal personality factor acts through specific vocational interests to influence career exploration. The pattern of relationships among personality, vocational interests, and career exploration behaviors varies according to the cultural context and employment opportunities in different societies.</p>
<p>In the process of career counseling, it is important to consider specific cultural contexts and behavior patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711417167">Chen &amp; Mak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1069072711417167">Worthington, Soth-McNett, &amp; Moreno, 2007</xref>). In our study, there are cultural differences in the contributions of the dimensions of personality and the types of vocational interest in predicting students’ career explorations. Counselors need to consider the culturally relevant patterns of relationship between personality dimensions and career interests of their counselees. If the results for the Hong Kong sample could be further supported in other Chinese samples, this may confirm the importance of including interpersonal dimensions of personality in addition to intrapersonal dimensions of personality in career counseling for Chinese students. In particular, in addition to helping Chinese students to understand their self-focused characteristics, their interpersonal circumstances and the influence of other people are important considerations. When conducting personality assessment with ethnic Chinese students, counselors need to use a culturally relevant personality measure that includes both intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions of personality.</p>
<p>In contrast, the American cultural context does not highlight the interpersonal aspect of personality prominently in defining one’s personal identity, so the IR personality factor did not show any significant effects on the career exploration behaviors of the students. Instead, the universal factors of Social Potency and Dependability play a more central role in predicting career exploration, which is consistent with existing Western models of career development. Further research with other Chinese and American samples will help to inform counselors on the implications of culturally relevant aspects of career counseling. Cultural sensitivity should become a mainstream component in the training and supervision of multicultural career counseling.</p>
