<p><italic>Leisure and Power in Urban China</italic> is a case study of everyday life in Quanzhou. Although Quanzhou is not a huge Chinese cosmopolitan hub, the theoretical implication about power invested in and through leisure is clearly of interest and importance to scholars of various disciplines. Based on interviews with people from all walks of life and case studies covering bookshops, Internet bars, karaoke parlours, streets and public squares, Unn Målfrid Rolandsen highlights the importance of fun, pleasure, entertainment and socializing in the lives of Chinese residents in this second-tier city of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Precisely because the fieldwork of the study was conducted in 2005–2007, a transitional period in the PRC during which housing and food prices rose exorbitantly, how people conceived leisure then can be very different from perceptions nowadays. We have to interpret the data and arguments in the book with this in mind. However, this should not divert us from the central argument of the book, which shows contrasts between popular practices and official discourse. Taking leisure as a point of departure, Rolandsen describes a new kind of interaction between the population and the local party-state and how the latter seeks to govern.</p>
<p>On the one hand, as an anthropological enquiry, Rolandsen looks into the various forms of routinized leisure that Quanzhou’s residents engage in shopping malls, parks, museums, streets and alleys. The focus includes holidays, festivals, tourism, and other all kinds of non-work practices in everyday lives. On the other hand, Rolandsen provides in-depth analyses of the more or less top–down version of the leisure discourse reflected in official Chinese publications and news media, and scrutinizes the various measures, policies and practices through which the authorities and interest groups attempt to collectively construct and implement the discourse of leisure. Ultimately, Rolandsen interprets the organization and arrangement of leisure as an exercise of power, an argument probably shared by many scholars in cultural studies as well as by cultural sociologists. This kind of power is one which is not invested in realpolitik, but which penetrates into our everyday culture.</p>
<p>The best argument of the book is the discussion of leisure ethics in the PRC. Even readers who are not interested in Chinese society and politics would find the parallel between Chinese leisure ethics and Protestant ethics of the West theoretically intriguing. Both are utilitarian discourses conducive to social order, stability and social formation, and consolidate the moral sentiments of society (p. 65). The difference is perhaps that, as Rolandsen wants to illustrate, leisure ethics in China is what the state wants to consciously impose on society, or a kind of ‘national pedagogy’ of the party-state (p. 57). In the chapter on Qingyuan Mountain, the author seems to suggest that ultimately official propaganda or leisure ethics as structured in the PRC has increasingly become obsolete and exerts a highly limited influence on Chinese individuals.</p>
<p>In the chapter on consumption, Rolandsen briefly mentions how the rising Chinese middle class (as opposed to the cultured middle class), who celebrate conspicuous cultural capital and consumption, may possibly constitute a strong opposition to state-propagated leisure ethics. I wish the author had paid greater attention to the growing tension and explicated how civil discourse in relation to leisure ethics is being constantly challenged by growing materialism in the Chinese society in the face of globalization and the rise of the new rich in China. As a matter of fact, crude consumerism, fetishism, and the trend of secularization have threatened both Protestant ethics and PRC leisure ethics globally. Instead of top–down political pressure, an alternative route for the state to bind people and nation together will be a major line of inquiry for researchers in China studies and global studies in the coming years.</p>
<p>As Rolandsen also admits, the limitation of the book is its generalizability over other urbanities of China. The study centres on life in a small township, and caution should be exercised when we try to tell the same story about urban youth in Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou. We have to acknowledge that the extent and pace of change in urban Quanzhou, both in the conception of the local populace and in the city’s urban space, are different from other big cities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rolandsen’s project gives a broad overall picture of how leisure ethics work in the arenas of reading, shopping, gaming, and space (Internet cafes, karaoke, contested space, and so on). Yet we also have to acknowledge that the specific problematic in each of the domains can be very different. For example, Anthony Fung (Consuming karaoke in China: Modernities and social contradictions, <italic>Chinese Sociology and Anthropology</italic> 42(2), 2010: 39–55) argues that karaoke in China has been taken over by the middle class as a site for business negotiations, whereas Helen Sun (<italic>Internet Policy in China: A Field Study of Internet Cafés</italic>, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2011) asserts that Internet cafes can be a vital site for citizens to engage in warfare with the state. While leisure ethics in the PRC may constitute an overarching framework to study the phenomenon, we should inspect each of these sites with caution and avoid oversimplifying the arguments.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Leisure and Power in Urban China</italic> is a very useful and informative book about the non-political space and leisure culture in China’s second-tier cities in the wake of globalization.</p>
