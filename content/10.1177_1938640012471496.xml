<p>There have been substantial changes of philosophy over the past decade regarding the management of soft tissue defects of the lower leg. Some of these changes have been catapulted by new technology but others have been born by a better understanding the wound healing and biologic processes. This symposium will explore the contemporary approach to soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938640012471496">
<title>In your opinion what has been the most influential change in the treatment of soft tissue defects of the lower leg in the past 10 years?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy has been the most influential wound healing adjunct in terms of soft tissue reconstruction for the lower extremity. It allowed surgeons time to choose between microsurgical free flap reconstruction and far simpler solutions (such as skin graft) to solve the problem without increasing limb loss rates. Because it can be difficult to find plastic surgeons to do flap surgery, it has decreased the complexity of many reconstructions so that surgeons who do not do flaps can still close wounds.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>The utilization of negative pressure wound therapy, hydrosurgery, ultrasonic debridement, bioengineered alternative tissues, and external fixation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>I think the advent of negative pressure therapy has revolutionized our ability to treat a whole host of soft tissue defects in the lower leg.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy. This concept has helped decrease edema, reduce wound exudate, lower the bacterial count, aid in tissue contraction, and probably improve blood supply. With regards to large soft tissue defects, the concept of free flaps has been a very positive change. These flaps allow coverage of large defects in the middle to lower leg that may not be possible with rotation or pedicle flaps.</p>
</speech>

<title>In your opinion, what is the most influential change in wound care in the past 10 years?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>The most influential change in wound care in the past 10 years has been emphasis on the team approach to solve lower extremity wound problems. Incorporating a multidisciplinary team that includes vascular surgery, foot and ankle surgery, plastic surgery, infectious disease, rheumatology, hematology, prosthetist, orthetists, psychiatry, and dermatology have enabled resolution of complex wound problems that, hitherto, could not be solved due to lack of expertise.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Advanced moist wound therapy is important with respect to wound care, negative pressure wound therapy is important with respect to adjunct therapy for wound reconstruction, and bioengineered alternative tissues are helpful with respect to bridging and providing tissue prior to a final reconstructive process.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>It is my opinion that the most influential change in wound care in the past 10 years is the development of multidisciplinary wound care clinics. These clinics have allowed a more centralized approach to wound care and have made a difference in the management of these wounds in general.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Wound care centers with an emphasis on a multispecialty wound care team. This results in more specialists, including multispecialty physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. In addition, incorporating diagnostic studies, advanced wound care agents, and in-depth patient education have all been influential changes.</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section3-1938640012471496">
<title>What is the most promising concept in wound care over the next 5 years? With all other factors staying the same, do you believe that it will change the rate of limb loss in the US population?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>Using instillation therapy with negative pressure wound therapy may revolutionize care for complex wound if the randomized trials show this to be effective. It is aimed at treating infected wounds and will hopefully permit the surgeon to get wounds ready to close with less debridements and with more successful eradication of infection.</p>
<p>The rate of limb loss will decrease throughout the United States as more and more physicians embrace the team concept to limb salvage and use the principles of revascularizing the wound when necessary, establishing a healthy wound base that is infection free and doing a lower extremity reconstruction that is functionally sound enough to avoid recurrence.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>The combination of negative pressure therapy, advanced moist wound therapy, debridement techniques, and polymerase chain reaction analysis should reduce the risk of limb loss in the US population. There is no one single concept that will be responsible for a major shift in wound care but the combination of multiple modalities can provide a greater foundation for wound care, wound reconstruction, plastic and reconstructive surgery with respect to the lower extremity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>I think that the understanding of the role that biofilms play on whether or not antibiotic therapy and local wound care is effective.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>A promising concept for the future is gene array technology. This will allow us to identify, on a molecular level, specific wound types. In this fashion, malfunctioning or nonfunctioning genes in the wound may be identified resulting in customized therapy for the particular patient and wound. This should help decrease the rate of limb loss in the US population.</p>

<title>How would you manage this young woman with steroid-dependent pulmonary disease (20 mg per day) after a wound slough following total ankle arthroplasty? Please concentrate on the soft tissue problem</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>It appears that the anterial tibial tendon is gone. As such, her ankle function will be severely limited. In addition, what remains of the ankle joint may be infected. I would recommend ankle fusion if the wound can be debrided to clean tissue or below the knee amputation if it cannot.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Further debridement with negative pressure wound therapy to be considered for wound bed preparation with a bioengineered alternative tissue followed by either a skin graft or free tissue transfer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>I would begin negative pressure therapy and place the patient on appropriate antibiotics based on wound cultures and, if necessary, application of a split thickness skin graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy specifically with a Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) dressing. Surgical debridements may be used as needed.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938640012471496">
<title>What modifications (if any) would you make because of the steroid dependency?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>In terms of steroid dependency, I would simply add vitamin A 10 000 U every other day to counteract the wound retarding effects of the steroids. I would have her rheumatologist lower her steroid dose to as low a dose as tolerable.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Reduction in steroid utilization from 20 mg per day to 10 mg per day with adjunct inhalation therapy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>I would consult a pulmonologist regarding any modifications to be made regarding the steroid dependency.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to decrease inflammation in wounds and may improve wound healing in steroid-dependent patients. Also, alternate day steroid use may be beneficial.</p>

<title>What would be the best modality to achieve closure with a durable stump in this diabetic patient 1 week after guillotine amputation?</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012471496-fig2.tif"/>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>The quality of the blood supply would have to be first assessed and addressed if found deficient. The wound is still infected and would have to go to serial debridements until clean. NPWT could be used as an intermediary dressing. When clean, I would cut the metatarsals short enough to allow the surrounding soft tissue to collapse over the distal metatarsal stumps. I would then cover the distal end with neo-dermis and NPWT. When the neo-dermis was vascularized (10-14 days) I would skin graft it and lengthen the Achilles tendon.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy with serial debridement and bioengineered alternative tissue followed by a split thickness skin graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>This is a difficult question because the best modality to achieve closure would be negative pressure therapy, but to maintain a durable stump, one would need to remove more tissue dorsally and create a plantar flap to rotate dorsally</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>I think the VAC dressing may be extremely helpful to achieve soft tissue contracture. Then a revisional amputation may be performed avoid fragile, thin distal coverage that has poor durability.</p>

<title>This is a 23-year-old female who fell 2 stories from a balcony. She has this wound and resultant fracture. Assuming that her tibia fracture will be maintained with this external fixator, how would you deal with the soft tissue wound? It is a complete circumferential degloving of directly over the fracture site</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>I assume that her blood flow and sensation are still intact. I would initially treat this patient with debridement and negative pressure wound therapy. If there is any question of viability of skin flaps, I would combine the negative pressure wound therapy with hyperbaric oxygen. If the skin remained viable, I would close primarily and cover any remaining defects with Integra and skin graft. Alternatively, if there was too much bone or tendon exposed, I would consider doing a microsurgical free flap.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy in addition to bioengineered alternative tissues with free tissue transfer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>This 23-year-old patient needs serial debridement and lavage, followed by coverage with a vascularized free flap.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>I would obtain a plastic surgery consult for consideration of a free flap placement. Given the location of the wound and the degloving nature surrounding the fracture, a pedicle or rotation flap is probably not feasible. The free flap should give adequate soft tissue coverage to the area.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>If the heel pad is still attached, I would debride the wound and attach it back into position. If there is any question of viability of heel flap, I would also treat with hyperbaric oxygen. If the heel flap dies, I would consider doing a pedicled medial plantar flap or microsurgical free flap.</p>

<p>Serial debridements with reverse sural artery flap.</p>

<p>Probably with a split thickness skin graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Surgical irrigation and debridement with repair. Offload the area and eventual management with an acellular collagen matrix, which can act as a dermal scaffold and decrease wound depth and size, as well as speed the epithelization process.</p>

<sec id="section10-1938640012471496">
<title>Would your plan change if the plantar foot was insensate? What would be the determinant factors in the management of an insensate flap?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>If the heel pad were completely avulsed, I would consider using an innervated medial plantar flap to restore skin to the plantar heel. It could be pedicled from the ipsilateral side or free from the contralateral side. That would give her the best possible coverage by replacing like tissue with like tissue. My plans with respect to an insensate flap would not change. Many diabetics get reconstructed foot defects despite being insensate. If appropriate attention is placed on biomechanics, appropriate offloading and orthotics, the heel should hold up.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Reverse sural artery flap.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>In this situation, I would probably consider a pedicle flap such as a soleal flap because this would be more durable in a patient with an insensate foot.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>If the heel is insensate, we need to facilitate coverage in such a fashion that the high loading pressures and shear forces are accommodated. The medial plantar artery flap has been shown to be a reliable flap for heel coverage. It is durable and long lasting even in insensate feet.</p>

<title>This patient is a 67-year-old diabetic male s/p (status post) puncture wound with subsequent infection. The wound was debrided and the infection is controlled. Blood sugar control is optimal. How would you achieve closure of the wound?</title>

<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>Closure of this wound would first mandate looking at the skeletal framework, which appears to include a collapse of the forefoot/ midfoot. Correcting that would create more redundancy of the soft tissue. I would do that with external fixation. Most of the tissue could then be closed primarily. The remaining tissue could be closed with a large âVâ to âYâ flap from lateral to medial.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Negative pressure wound therapy with a split thickness skin graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>I would probably use negative pressure therapy on this wound and then depending on the response would consider application of a biologic such as Dermagraft to close this defect. It is not in a direct weight-bearing area so I think that it would remain fairly durable over time. The other option beside Dermagraft would be a split thickness skin graft.</p>
</speech>

<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>Primary closure distally and proximally with the incorporation of a split thickness skin graft centrally.</p>

<sec id="section12-1938640012471496">
<title>This is a 50-year-old diabetic construction worker who is s/p debridement of this ulceration. The patient does not want an amputation of the hallux. How would you manage this particular situation? What would you do differently if the patient was willing to have an amputation? Specifically, how would you perform the procedure?</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1938640012471496-fig6.tif"/>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>He is not ready for reconstruction. The wound is still infected and needs further debridement and intravenous antibiotics. He may require metatarsophalangeal joint resection. If that were done, there might be enough collapse of the soft tissue that it could be closed. Unfortunately, the hallux would be in varus.</p>
<p>I would strongly urge him to undergo a fillet of toe by making a medial incision along the medial hallux and remove the nail bed. I would then flip the filleted toe 180Â°, tailor the flap to remove any redundancy, and sew it in such a way to break up the natural curl of the tissue at the distal tuft to achieve an everted suture closure.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>If this patient is an active 50-year-old construction worker but does not want an amputation, corticotomy with extensive debridement of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint and septic arthrodesis with external fixation of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint followed by a local flap reconstruction of the plantar and medial first metatarsal phalangeal joint. If the patient was willing to undergo an amputation, a partial first ray amputation with fillet flap of the hallux would be appropriate for coverage in the region pending clear margins and appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>If he was adamant about not having an amputation I recommend offloading of the area in a total contact cast, consider other wound management modalities including periodic debridement and application of biologics such as Dermagraft. If an amputation was to be considered in this patient, I would probably recommend a hallux filet procedure. I would remove the phalanges and maintain the hallucial vascular pedicle and rotate the flab around to fill the defect.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>The subâfirst metatarsophalangeal joint ulcer in a diabetic with a presumably insensate foot is a complicated problem with many biomechanical considerations. If equinus is present, Achilles tendon lengthening should be considered. The examination should include an evaluation of flexible versus fixed deformity. In flexible deformities, the peroneus longus âoverpullâ may be the cause of the imbalance and a peroneus longus to brevis tenodesis may be indicated. In the case of a contracted hallux, an interphalangeal joint arthrodesis with Jones tenosuspension may be considered. In fixed deformities, a dorsiflexory first metatarsal osteotomy or first metatarsal-medial cuneiform arthrodesis may be performed. Adjunctly, repeat wound debridement with soft tissue mobilization and closure vs. free or rotated flaps may be used.</p>
<p>There would be the challenge of adequate soft tissue coverage. The distal first metatarsal may require resection. This may lead to the development of lesser metatarsophalangeal joint issues.</p>

<title>Is this foot salvageable? How would you attempt salvage? (Please elaborate.) If the patient were 75 years old instead of 55, would your approach change?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Attinger:</speaker>
<p>The history for this heel ulcer does not make sense. My gut feeling is that the posterior tibial artery and peroneal arteries are out. If that is the case, serious discussion should be made toward either partial calcanectomy if the patient is a minimal ambulator or a below-the-knee amputation if the patient is an active ambulator. We have found that a 75% vertical calcanectomy in these situations work well with patients who have a bed to chair existence. However, for those who are more active, the loss of the Achilles tendon and heel pad makes it very difficult to carry on normal life. The subsequent pictures show that there is minimal granulation tissue and bear out the fact that this indeed was an ischemic injury due to absent posterior tibial and/or peroneal arteries.</p>
<p>Same argument applies for the 55-year-old patient. If the patient is minimally ambulatory, I would do a vertical 75% calcanectomy and close primarily. If the patient is fully ambulatory, I would recommend a below-knee amputation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Blume:</speaker>
<p>Before the foot deteriorated, I would use a reverse sural island artery flap versus possible suprafascial rotational flap with appropriate wound bed preparation.</p>
<p>After the wound deteriorated, calcaneal debridement with negative pressure therapy and bioengineered alternative tissues, once the wound has become fully granular with adequate wound bed preparation, a suprafascial rotational flap as described by Hidalgo and Shaw should be raised from the arch and rotated into the heel with a skin graft along the entire flexor digitorum brevis and abductor muscle belly with a skin graft to the non-weight-bearing region. I would do the same procedure the patient was 75 years old as long as they were active and fully ambulatory. If the patient is 75 years old and nonambulatory, aggressive calcanectomy with local reconstruction and negative pressure therapy would be acceptable. Another alternative would be a reverse sural island artery flap pending adequate angiosomes and inflow in the region.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hutchinson:</speaker>
<p>Based on the sequential photographs, I am assuming that there is better granulation on the last picture so I would consider either a free flap or possibly a rhomboid advancement flap from the plantar skin with placement of a skin graft in the defect just behind the metatarsal heads. Some of the skin around the Achilles could be mobilized as well and a partial calcanectomy could allow some soft tissue mobilization with out compromising the insertion of the tendon.</p>
<p>I would probably consider the same procedures if the patient was 75 years of age. Of course, an amputation would also be a viable option.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mariash:</speaker>
<p>The foot is salvageable. If there is exposed calcaneus or underlying osteomyelits, a partial calcanectomy may be considered. After the wound is healed, the patient is fitted for a custom ankle-foot orthosis with a soft inner foam liner and dense outer foam heel. I think this would be reasonable for underlying osteomyelitis or exposed bone regardless of age. Also, I would consider this in the 75-year-old without oseomyelitis. In the 55-year-old without exposed bone or underlying osteomyelitis, a VAC dressing may be used to aid in soft tissue contracture, and then a medial plantar artery flap can be considered.</p>
