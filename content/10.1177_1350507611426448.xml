<p>What do we mean by visual research? Claudia Mitchell’s timely book, <italic>Doing Visual Research</italic>, arrives as scholarship and higher education itself struggle to catch up with the runaway train of technology and how visual images affect our perception of the world around us. Although Mitchell is primarily interested in the way photographs, drawings, digital storytelling and video are used in qualitative research, the larger question lurks as the elephantine subtext of the book—how to interpret and validate research data using visual images? Advertisers and commercial artists have long understood the power of images to tap into the social and cultural psyche, but how does one use the visual in scholarly research and still maintain the integrity of the data? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611426448">Pain (2011)</xref>, ruling out the usual graphs and charts used in scientific journals or classrooms, defines visual research as: ‘use of a medium that is primarily visual to generate knowledge or therapeutic intervention’ (p. 343). Mitchell, the James McGill Professor in the Integrated Studies in Education at McGill University, is less interested in engaging in the philosophical debate of interpretation than in providing a context for visual methodology—the ‘doing’ of research. The author wisely frames her arguments, however, by starting with the ethical ramifications of research in the age of proliferating digital images and social networking sites.</p>
<p>The book is organized in three parts: visual research and ethics, visual research methods, and the interpretation of visual research. Part 1 provides an overview of visual research and addresses the need for the protection of human subjects, providing helpful examples of consent forms and protocol for assisting the researcher in the use of visual images. The author asks the questions: how can subjects, especially children and minors, be protected when using visual research methods, and how does the visual affect research? In addition, what images can be used and how should the research be recorded? The author has been using visuals in her research for over 20 years, and notes that documentarians have long recorded powerful descriptions of war, human suffering, and natural and man-made disasters in ways that traditional research cannot. But how do researchers protect their subjects and what ethics are involved in providing confidentiality in a forum of fast-paced information and social media networks? Mitchell asks the tantalizing questions but is less interested in presenting social interpretations than she is in providing a template for visual researchers to conduct their research in a sensitive and ethical way.</p>
<p>Part 2 outlines the various instruments used in visual research and offers a persuasive ‘how-to’ for gathering the specific research within each sub-section, accompanied by a discussion of the ways visual research can be used. The focus on how visual objects or images tap the cultural and ritual meanings related to the respective study is a useful section. Mitchell argues that the visual is a ‘social accessory’ and allows the researcher to dig deeper into the meanings of the study. Objects can also be used as a pathway to expand ethnographic studies. Mitchell recounts how a wire car she brought home from Rwanda led to a spontaneous conversation with a repair person from Angola who was in her home during a holiday emergency. This story had several layers; the wire car, often the only toy available to children in that war-ravaged region, was instantly recognizable as a symbol of war and also facilitated a spontaneous interview that allowed for a deeper engagement than usually available to researchers. But the wire car, by the very circumstance of existing in her apartment, had also become a social icon—equal parts a consumer item for tourists, and a toy for children who have no other options for play.</p>
<p>Part 3 asks the important questions about interpreting visual research in support of other data instruments. Mitchell details a case study examining the blight of AIDS on Swaziland to illustrate how visual images depicting absence and the social stigma of AIDS were used to support the quantitative data (in this case census data showing an abnormal population loss where growth was projected). Mitchell cites the dangers of using images out of context and warns the researcher to ask: ‘When was the image made? Where was it made? Who made it? Was it made for someone else?’ (p. 98). Although Mitchell concedes that visual representations alone should not dominate research, she persuades that images have a part in the analytical framework of research data.</p>
<p>Mitchell is most interested in providing guidance on how to conduct visual research and it is here this book’s content is the strongest. Researchers who are interested in using visual images to support and augment their data, will find this book helpful in navigating the often shaky ground of ethics, protection of human subjects, consent, and archiving images. But do not expect an enlightened discussion of how access to media, video, and software-enhanced photography has changed the ways we work with visual research. One of the more disappointing features of this book is its workman-like approach to research documentation without a larger discussion of how our exposure to images through burgeoning technology has changed the way we look at images and our ability to critically analyse what we see. The researcher’s job is to interpret the data and this is where Mitchell’s analysis is the weakest.</p>
<p>More problematic are the questions left unanswered regarding the interpretation of images, and how to maintain research integrity when visual literacy is casually understood, and images can so easily be shared, manipulated, and altered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611426448">Pain (2011)</xref>, in her literature review on the empirical support for use of the visual in research, observes that the immediacy of visual images creates emotions that words and numbers do not. The author notes that researchers must be acutely aware of how their own sociological interpretations challenge their ability to interpret subjective images. Her review of the literature led her to conclude that images unaccompanied by socio-cultural context are suspect, while too much specificity may hinder the organic outcome of the research. Therein lies the conundrum that Mitchell does not fully address.</p>
<p>The research practitioner, who is seeking guidance on how to implement visual methodology, will gain the most from this book. But Mitchell, in her attempt to promote the ways visual research can augment traditional methods, does not go far enough in exploring how the visual can distort or exploit research in unintended ways. This is a valuable book because it dares to begin a discussion on how to conduct research in the millennium, but it does not go far enough to address the troubling questions of how technology and the proliferation of images bias both the researcher and viewer and, therefore, changes the data in unintended ways. Researchers who want more direction in understanding how the visual image is distorted by changing technology, and how that may affect research methodology, will not find guidance in this book.</p>
