<p><italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic>, originally <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Social Medicine</italic>, is this year celebrating its 40th anniversary. During the same year, Dr Finn Kamper-Jørgensen, who has been Chief Editor since 2008, will be retiring. I want to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Dr Kamper-Jørgensen for his work for <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic>. Concomitantly with holding the post as Chief Editor, he was also Director of the National Institute of Public Health in Denmark. In spite of a considerable workload, the scientific development of the journal has been very satisfactory during his editorship. In this context, I also want to acknowledge Professor Stig Wall from the University of Umeå, who, during his period as Chief Editor prior to Finn Kamper-Jørgensen, initiated the active development of a high-quality journal.</p>
<p>I feel that <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic> is an important forum for health-oriented welfare research. Naturally, all kinds of topics are welcome, but special interest is given to health-oriented welfare research emanating from the Nordic Welfare model, especially with a comparative approach. We feel that the model is in many respects valuable, and although not capable of solving all problems, still offers a good platform for dealing with issues such as inequity and inequality in society. From an international perspective, we also have unique possibilities of register-based and linked register-based research in the Nordic countries. <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic> is a referee-based journal and publishes contributions from all fields of public health. In recent years, the number of manuscripts submitted to the journal has steadily increased, and today nearly 500 articles are considered for publication each year. Moreover, the latest value of the so-called 5-year impact factor is 2.020.</p>

<p>Presently, the journal is owned by the societies of public health in the Nordic countries. I myself have been a member of the Executive Board from the late 1990s. From the beginning of 2005, I have been Chairman. I was elected for my third period from 2011 in order to safely escort the journal during the transition from one Chief Editor to his successor. The Executive Board further looks into the long-term perspectives of the journal, due to the fact that the market for scientific publishing is changing. From 2008, following a bidding contest, Sage has been our publisher and we have been very satisfied with this collaboration. All the revenue from the journal has been directed to its development.</p>
<p>Most of the articles published still come from the Nordic countries, but manuscripts submitted to the journal verify that the share of contributions coming from other parts of the world is increasing.</p>
<p>I hereby call all persons interested in becoming Chief Editor of <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic> to contact me. Concomitantly, we are seeking a new host organization as well as the contribution of an Editorial Assistant. However, modern IT technology enables solutions where the key persons of the editorial office do not necessary have to share the same geographical location.</p>
