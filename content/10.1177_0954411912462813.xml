<abstract>
<p>Preparation of the proximal femur using incremental broaches to create the ideal cancellous bone envelope is an important technique to perfect in uncemented hip arthroplasty. To guide broaching adequacy and final implant position, the surgeon can use audible pitch changes produced by the femoral broach and definitive implant. The aim of this study was to characterise these pitch changes by analysing the sound spectra created by the first broach, last broach and implant using spectral analysis software. The last broach and implant introduction spectra demonstrated low-frequency (400–1200 Hz) spectral peaks that were not detected when using the first broach. These frequencies corresponded to the natural resonant frequency of a standing sound wave within the femoral bone canal (~894 Hz) that was estimated using acoustic physics theory. The remaining spectral peaks were associated with transverse vibration modes produced by striking the metal broach handle and implant introducer and were a function of the constructs geometry and material properties.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) has gained popularity as a method of implant fixation in recent years. Data from the National Joint Registry of England and Wales has shown uncemented femoral components are being used in 40% of all primary THAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912462813">1</xref></sup> The implant survivorship and clinical results have been reported as excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912462813">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912462813"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912462813">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to insertion of the femoral stem the proximal femur and intra-medullary canal is prepared using incrementally sized broaches. The broaches are designed to create an envelope of impacted cancellous bone into which the implant is inserted. This technique provides primary implant stability, maintains highly biologically active cancellous bone and preserves the endosteal blood supply. All these factors are paramount in achieving stable primary stem fixation and rapid secondary biological fixation to the outer surface of the implant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912462813">5</xref></sup> thus ensuring good long-term survival.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the optimal cancellous envelope, it is important not to undersize or oversize the final broach. An undersized broach may result in inadequate implant stability, thus compromising primary and secondary fixation. Conversely, an oversized broach may initiate a femoral fracture or compromise endosteal blood flow.</p>
<p>Tactile (rotational stability testing), visual and acoustic feedback cues are used by the surgeon to judge broaching adequacy. Acoustic feedback in the form of an audible pitch change is one of the most useful and practical modalities as the tip of the broach cannot be directly visualised in the femoral canal and tactile feedback is not always reliable.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was first to determine if the acoustic changes heard by the surgeon were measurable, and second, to explain the spectra using fundamental acoustic physics theory.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Nine total hip replacements were performed via a posterior approach using an uncemented femoral stem (Corail, DePuy International Ltd, Leeds, UK). The operations were performed by two experienced hip arthroplasty surgeons using standard, identical instrumentation and broaching technique. The last utilised broach was the same size as the definitive implant in all cases. The underlying diagnosis was osteoarthritis in all cases. Post-operative standardised antero–posterior plain radiographs were assessed for evidence of fracture. The broach and implant sizes for each patient are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912462813">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A highly sensitive acoustic measurement system was used consisting of an Edirol microphone (Edirol R-1 Recorder; Roland, Shizuoka Japan) and a preamplifier (Cirrus ZE901; Cirrus Research PLC, Hunmanby, UK). The system was initially calibrated using a Cirrus 511E Sound Calibrator (Pennine Instrument Services, Sheffield, UK). The acoustic measurement system was placed opposite the operating surgeon at the outer edge of the laminar flow enclosure. Sound was recorded on a digital recorder in 128 bit digital format from the start of the femoral preparation to the end of definitive implant insertion, and as each incremental broach was used, the size was called out by the surgeon in order that it would be registered along with the acoustic data. The sound data was analysed using a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) spectrum analyser (SpectraPLUS v5 Pioneer Hill Software; Poulsbo, WA, USA) with a Hanning weighted window. The frequency spectra for the first broach (size 8 in all cases), the last strikes of the final broach and the implant insertion were analysed. The four peaks with the highest amplitudes for each spectral trace were measured and comparisons were made between these frequency values.</p>
<p>The fundamental longitudinal resonant frequency of the femoral bone was estimated using acoustic physics theory for a closed-ended tube, first published by Kundt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912462813">6</xref></sup> in 1866. The femoral canal can be considered similar to a closed-ended tube. Sound waves produced at the proximal end pass distally towards the closed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912462813">Figure 1</xref>). A standing sound wave vibrating at its fundamental frequency has a wavelength of 4L (were L = the tube length). The sound waves travel within a medium composed of bone marrow, which is predominately fatty tissue. The average femoral length (mean femoral length from the calcar cut) and the velocity of sound in a marrow fat cavity were taken from Gillespie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912462813">7</xref></sup> and Browne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912462813">8</xref></sup> It was then possible to calculate the fundamental vibration frequency using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954411912462813">equation (1)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912462813">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>where K is radius of gyration, L is the constructs length (0.28 m), E is Young’s modulus and d is the density of the material. To facilitate the analysis, the non-uniform shape of the stainless steel introducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912462813">Figure 2</xref>) was assumed to have a cylindrical component (radius = 0.004 m, length = 0.14 m) and a rectangular component (width/depth = 0.015 m, length = 0.14 m). This produced a corresponding radius of gyration K for the construct of 0.0031. The elastic Modulus (E) for stainless steel is 220 GPa and the density (d) is 7842 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

<p>In six out of the nine cases (67%), the spectra identified a low-frequency peak (range 553–1179 Hz) with mean 892 Hz associated with the final broach that was not detectable in any of the first broach spectra. The implant introduction spectra all show a low-frequency peak (range 431–1000 Hz) with mean 709 Hz and a higher consistent peak (range 3200–3800 Hz). This higher consistent peak was also the peak with the maximum amplitude in all cases.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results show that it is possible to measure and to identify the low-pitched signal change that can be heard when broaching the femoral canal or seating the definitive implant. The change in pitch was observed to occur at a mean frequency of 892 Hz during final broaching and 709 Hz during implant insertion. This low-pitched frequency was visualised in 6/9 of the last broach spectra and all of the implant introducer spectra. The authors postulate that when the mallet strikes the broach handle, or the implant introducer, vibration energy causes the femur to resonate, producing longitudinal standing sound waves in the femoral canal. In order for this phenomenon to occur, there must be dense compacted bone around the broach to allow efficient energy transfer to the femur. In the case of the implant, the collar seating down firmly on the calcar allows additional energy transfer. An underlying principle of the Corail system is that the broaches do not remove bone, but compact the bone around the implant and is therefore bone preserving. This is in contrast to other stem systems such as the Zweymueller hip (Zimmer, Warsaw and Indiana), which is designed to osseo-integrate with cortical bone and utilises rasps to remove bone from the proximal femur. Seating rasps and implants against cortical bone is known to cause pitch changes. The sound waves behave as they would in a closed-ended tube passing through the intra-medullary marrow fat, which has a density similar to normal body fat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912462813">8</xref></sup> The predicted fundamental resonant frequency of the femur (894 Hz) lies very close to the observed spectral low-pitch changes. The first broach spectra do not show this low-frequency peak because the cancellous bone is not sufficiently compacted to allow sufficient energy transfer to the femur and cause resonant vibration. The three cases that did not show a low-pitched frequency spectral peak on final broaching may have had inadequately impacted bone or an inadequate strike force to cause resonance. Perception of pitch change during surgery is subjective and may be more obvious to some surgeons than others. The low-pitched spectral peak was never the maximum amplitude peak in any case and, therefore, interference from other transitional resonant frequencies may have obscured the low-frequency peak. Factors such as ambient theatre noise and vibration damping may also play a role in production of the recorded spectra.</p>
<p>The remaining intra-operative spectral peaks were noted at varying frequencies with little pattern when the broaching spectra were analysed; however, the implant spectra contained a consistent peak (mean 3537 Hz). The timbres produced by metal objects when struck are largely a result of transverse resonance in the same way a tuning fork produces a specific pitch. When non-uniform objects are forced to resonate, the timbre is dependent on many factors, which include strike force, strike area and degree of damping. In our examples, we believe that the degree of damping varies greatly between cases. The surgeon usually holds the broach tightly in order to control its orientation. The implant introducer is often held loosely as the implant will follow a predetermined path made by the previous broach. The tighter the instrument is held, the greater the damping effect. For this reason, we were able to identify constant spectral peaks within the implant introducer spectra and not in the broaching spectra. The implant introducer spectra when analysed in isolation from the patient show predictable modes of resonance frequency, which were also detectable on the intra-operative spectra. The spectral data suggest that the implant introducer vibrates maximally at its third resonant frequency when struck, and this note is responsible for the metallic high-pitched sound heard during surgery. The lower modes were not visible on the intra-operative spectra; this is typical of a metal bar in that it predominantly resonates at a mode above the fundamental frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912462813">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall strike note is a characteristic of the instrumentation and caused mainly by transverse resonance. It is dependent on many factors including construct geometry, degree of damping, type of material and strike force. Some hip systems use a pneumatic hammer, which applies a uniform repetitive force to the broach or implant. In theory, this could produce a more consistent note and make pitch changes easier to detect. We acknowledge that different femoral morphologies and bone quality may affect the degree of vibration energy transfer and therefore the resonant pitch, but due to the small sample size, we were not able to compare the spectra produced by these variables. This study showed that spectral sound analysis of femoral preparation is possible and that future studies directed at bone morphology or density could be considered in order to identify patient groups that do not produce reliable audible pitch changes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The authors believe that the change in pitch (from high to low) is a reliable indicator that the appropriate broach size has been reached and the implant is correctly seated. Failure to reach this point may result in under-sizing of the definitive implant, which can lead to failure of osseo-integration and/or excessive implant subsidence, necessitating revision surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912462813">12</xref></sup> If the broach size continues to be increased after the appearance of the pitch change, the proximal femur is at risk of fracture. These fractures most commonly occur at the medial calcar and normally require circular wire fixation, which can compromise primary fixation. In order to avoid these complications, the surgeon should use as many aids as possible to judge appropriate broaching. We recommend actively listening for the low pitch change when preparing the femur. It has also been our experience that ambient noise in the theatre should be kept to a minimum during this period. This technique does not replace other methods, but should be used in conjunction with accurate preoperative templating, visualisation of the broach depth and rotational stability testing. The authors raise concern over using only pitch changes as the definitive indicator of seating as research in this area remains in its early stages.</p>
