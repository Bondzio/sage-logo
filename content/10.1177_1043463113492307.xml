<abstract>
<p>This paper discusses the compatibility of Thomas Schelling’s concept of coordination games with microsociological analyses of everyday interaction offered, among others, by Erving Goffman and Harold Garfinkel. This compatibility is based on the mutual premise that participants of everyday interaction are continuously involved in the tacit coordination of expectations. Whereas game theory focuses on distinct patterns of interdependence between participants, microsociologists have been pointing to principles of affirmation adhered to by participants of everyday interaction in establishing and preserving coordination. Tacit coordination of expectations is complemented by signalling and by processes of framing, explored by Goffman in terms of keys and frames and by game theorists in terms of correlated equilibrium selection and signalling games. Implications for social theory are discussed, particularly with respect to welfare aspects of everyday interaction.</p>

<p>The sociological study of everyday interaction is not a field to which game theory is generally expected to make a contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1043463113492307">Petersen, 1994</xref>: 501–502). Microsociological and game-theoretical analyses of social situations often articulate divergent views of what social situations are about and how they should be investigated: ethnographic documentation and narrative reconstruction on the one hand, measurement and modelling on the other, ideographic versus nomothetic reasoning, affinities to phenomenology and social constructivism on the one hand, and economics, physics or biology, on the other. Indications of reciprocal recognition are rare and the notorious image of the ‘two sociologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043463113492307">Dawe, 1970</xref>: 210) suggests itself.</p>
<p>Some of the generic differences supposedly setting apart these fields, however, can nowadays be found within rather than across them, such as, for example, the opposition between Hobbesian and Humean types of social inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 1996</xref>: xi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1043463113492307">Van Krieken, 2002</xref>). Evolutionary game theory, more particularly, has become increasingly concerned with ‘naturalizing’ the game-theoretical understanding of social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463113492307">Binmore, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463113492307">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1043463113492307">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1043463113492307">Sugden, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">2004</xref>). The early work of Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling (1960)</xref> has been the major inspiration of these recent advances. Schelling’s work originally appeared just about that time when the initial diffusion of game theory into sociology came to a halt (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1043463113492307">O’Rand, 1992</xref>), and it is Schelling to which Erving Goffman extensively referred when setting the general tone for keeping game theory at a distance from sociological investigations of everyday interaction in his widely read essay on ‘strategic interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>The present paper attempts to test some of the common ground between microsociology and game theory that is now gradually starting to resurface. It begins by going back to the 1960s and to the initial rejection of game theory by sociologists like Goffman and Garfinkel. It then explores congenial aspects of Schelling’s understanding of coordination games and Goffman’s understanding of the interaction order, discusses particular dynamics of tacit coordination in everyday interaction thus suggested, and a couple of complications associated with processes of signalling, framing and the occasional breakdown of tacit coordination. This leads to a preliminary re-appraisal of the potential of game theorists and microsociologists to more comprehensively cooperate in the investigation of everyday interaction, followed by a brief summary and conclusion.</p>
<p>The substantial understanding that emerges from this discussion is that everyday interaction is grounded in a game of tacit coordination among players maintaining expectations. Coordination tends to be maintained by players who follow principles of affirmation that have been identified in sociological studies of everyday interaction. The efficiency of coordination thus accomplished is to some extent determined by participants’ ability to draw on a variety of correlation devices, keys and signals that allow participants to deliberately switch between coordination equilibria. An important implication of this analysis is that the ‘effective cooperation in maintaining expectations’ pictured by Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463113492307">1983</xref>: 5) is associated not only with the overall stability of the ‘interaction order’, but also with questions of individual and collective efficiency, and with persistent inequalities sustained among participants of everyday interaction.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043463113492307">
<title>Erving Goffman and the strategy of conflict</title>
<p>A conceptual basis for constructive dialogue between game theory and the microsociology of everyday interaction has been in place for over half a century in the understanding of coordination games first offered by Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling (1960)</xref>. After some early enthusiasm among sociologists about Schelling’s contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463113492307">Bernard, 1965</xref>), and despite the fact that Schelling’s work has been a popular citation ever since, it has failed to make a lasting impact on the sociological study of everyday interaction. Erving Goffman’s paper on ‘strategic interaction’, written in full awareness of, and to some extent inspired by, Schelling’s ‘The Strategy of Conflict’, is a particularly prominent expression of the dominant tendency among microsociologists to keep game theory at a distance. Game theory is seen by Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">1969</xref>: 85) as refining a ‘traditional concern about calculation’. This concern is acknowledged as intrinsic to certain instances of everyday interaction, but its game-theoretical refinement is taken as (at best) circumstantial to understanding everyday interaction, even in cases of ‘gamelike interactions’ (p.113). In his essay, it is Goffman’s explicit aim ‘to isolate the analytical framework implied in the game perspective’ (p.85) by showing the insufficiency of game theory both in dealing with the gamut of ‘real-life situations’ (p.113) and with its genuine area of interest in the domain of strategic interaction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1043463113492307">Swedberg, 2001</xref>: 311–312). Game theory is seen as unduly generalizing from the analysis of a narrow subset of social situations and as failing to understand situations within this narrow set to begin with. For Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">1969</xref>: 100–101), the latter is constituted by situations in which an exchange of ‘fateful moves’ takes place with zero-sum payoffs. Goffman’s argument is that the empirical study of strategic interaction would need to proceed beyond this point of what he calls a ‘tight game’:<disp-quote>
<p>The idea of all-out, ‘zero-sum’, opposition, and of a pure and tight game, does not cover all that is to be considered. And while the notion of a game of coordination expands matters a little, too much is still left out. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is, in this perspective, left out by game theory, are the various social constraints, enforcement systems and commitments constitutive of any instance of ‘strategic interaction’ – the ‘matter of chief interest’ for sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 113–114). These constraints indicate the ‘socially mediated’ or ‘loose’ character of social situations generally, and of games more particularly, a character that would make them, in contrast to game theory’s ‘tight’ understanding of games, highly vulnerable to issues of framing, misperception or cheating (pp.115–119). These constraints are also used by Goffman to indicate limitations on the application of game theory to the analysis of social situations. To interpret players’ moves in situations in which strategic designs, as well as norms, conventions, honour, trust, friendship, etc., are put in play unilaterally in game-theoretical terms would, in Goffman’s view, take us a certain way but only ‘end by making sustainable interpretations of complex play to persons who aren’t quite players and aren’t quite playing’ (p.135).</p>
<p>Everyday interaction, therefore, is taken not to be a game at all and as generally unavailable to analysis in game-theoretical terms. This argument in terms of an alleged mismatch between game theory and the evidently non-game-like character of everyday interaction can be found in many microsociological assessments of the value of game theory. Another early, and to some extent canonical, instance is the differentiation of social situations by Harold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel (1967)</xref> in the famous ‘Agnes’ chapter of ‘Studies in Ethnomethodology’:<disp-quote>
<p>To help collect my thoughts about the various occasions on which Agnes had to pass, I tried to think of these situations as a game. When I did so only a comparatively small amount of the material (…) can be handled without encountering severe structural incongruities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 140)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Garfinkel then goes on to explore a couple of ‘game-like passing situations’ followed by his broader investigation of ‘passing’ in situations that generally ‘fail to satisfy various game properties’ (p.145). Garfinkel’s rejection of the value of game theory through differentiating between game-like and non-game-like situations was not lost on a contemporary reviewer, who noted that:<disp-quote>
<p>Garfinkel lists some appropriate elementary points about games, but in contrast to the belabored points elsewhere in the book, these occupy only one paragraph. (…) If it is useful to analyze behavior in a game perspective (as I believe it is), then the analysis must be careful to extract that usefulness and not merely refer to it in passing. I (…) would like to see sociologists devote further serious treatment to games as a contribution to the methodology of their use. I found no such treatment here. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043463113492307">Coleman, 1968</xref>: 129)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For James Coleman, the ‘Agnes’ chapter of ‘Studies in Ethnomethodology’ was, in sum, ‘not only an ethnomethodological disaster in itself but also evidence of the more general inadequacies of ethnomethodology’ (p.129). These are not the harshest words in Coleman’s review of ‘Studies in Ethnomethodology’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1043463113492307">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The list of mutual criticisms and adversities between game theorists and microsociologists that were to appear in subsequent decades could easily be extended. Rather than further surveying these battle lines the concept which, in Goffman’s words, would ‘expand matters a little’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 113) – Schelling’s concept of coordination games – will subsequently be explored as a stepping stone into a more amicable kind of dialogue. As such it was initially greeted by sociologists with some enthusiasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463113492307">Bernard, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1043463113492307">Scheff, 1967</xref>). Besides acknowledging its existence, Goffman mentions Schelling’s idea of tacit coordination at another point in his original essay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 99) without further utilizing it. Even when cautiously indicating some convergence of symbolic interaction and game theory towards the end of the paper by pointing to the mutual insistence on the ‘<italic>full</italic> interdependence of outcomes, on mutual awareness of this fact, and on the capacity to make use of this knowledge’ (p.136; italics by Goffman), Goffman leaves matters with an additional reference to the ‘crucial work by Schelling’ (p.137) and returns to marginalizing game theory as a general approach to social interaction (pp.137–140). Jessie Bernard’s intuition at that time that the ‘social-interactionist school’ may define a position of convergence between game theory and sociology with Goffman and Schelling as ‘the meeting point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043463113492307">Bernard, 1965</xref>: 444; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1043463113492307">Swedberg, 2001</xref>: 304–306) was thus left unexplored by Goffman, and since by many other students of everyday interaction. If at all considered, game theory has tended to be subject to ‘soft’ non-axiomatic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1043463113492307">O’Rand, 1992</xref>: 185). When everyday interaction has been investigated in terms of games, sociologists have tended to be interested more in potential game analogies of social situations than in utilizing game theory to analyse them (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043463113492307">DiCicco-Bloom and Gibson, 2010</xref>: 249; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1043463113492307">Leifer, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Three cautious steps will here be suggested in order to re-assess some of the common ground between microsociology and game theory claimed initially by Bernard, indicated circumstantially by Goffman, but ultimately deserted by both. The first step is to elaborate Schelling’s notion of coordination games with respect to a minimal understanding of coordination in everyday interaction; the second is to rearticulate on this basis certain principles of everyday interaction observed by sociologists like Goffman, Garfinkel, Sacks, Collins and Simmel. The paper will then move on to discuss how these principles relate to other forms of coordination through framing and signalling, and how the resulting arrangements relate to participants’ ability to deal with breakdowns. Rather than providing formal descriptions of social interaction in game-theoretical terms, the goal throughout is to demonstrate an initial congeniality between game-theoretical and microsociological insights. The modest aim is to prepare the grounds for more axiomatic applications of game-theoretical analysis to everyday interaction and more productive engagements with microsociological intelligence once the issue that has proven so divisive – the ‘game-analysability’ of everyday interaction – has been appropriately respecified.</p>

<title>Coordination games and the interaction order</title>
<p>Schelling’s understanding of coordination games is initially developed in terms of an argument about tacit coordination among players with mutual interests who are unable to communicate with each other. It is in this context that Schelling develops his famous concept of focal points:<disp-quote>
<p>People <italic>can</italic> often concert their intentions or expectations with others if each knows that the other is trying to do the same. Most situations (…) provide some clue for coordinating behavior, some focal point for each person’s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do. Finding the key, or rather finding <italic>a</italic> key – any key that is mutually recognized as the key becomes <italic>the</italic> key – may depend on imagination more than on logic; it may depend on analogy, precedent, accidental arrangement, symmetry, aesthetic or geometric configuration, casuistic reasoning, and who the parties are and what they know about each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 57; italics retained)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parties to coordination problems will be able to find solutions to these problems by expecting one another’s expectations, and participants in Schelling’s exploratory experiments turn out to be surprisingly successful in doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 55–57). Coordination in such instances surely requires a degree of wilful cooperation, but despite the fact that participants often act on the basis of common interests in finding solutions with mutual benefits – such as meeting in city without having settled on a meeting point, being rewarded for picking the same number or for claiming the same amount of money – the situation is that of a non-cooperative game: participants are unable to coordinate their moves through communication, for example by negotiating what move to make or to expect, respectively, and they are unable to trade or in any way deliberately distribute the benefits of coordination.</p>
<p>One of the surprising twists of Schelling’s analysis is that this initial restriction on understanding coordination problems, rather than isolating them as referring to a narrow subset of ‘real-life situations’, in fact generalizes the understanding of coordination problems in a way that allows one to identify aspects of tacit coordination in every situation in which payoff distributions are such that participants benefit from being able to settle on specific solutions. Schelling discusses tacit coordination with mutual interests, tacit bargaining with divergent interests (58ff.) as well as explicit bargaining with mixed motives in terms of coordination problems (67ff., pp.99–102). In the course of Schelling’s analysis, mutual perception or common interests turn out to be special cases of the more general collective problem that is the coordination of expectations within a collective of players (p.101).</p>
<p>Erving Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463113492307">1983</xref>: 5) considers the type of interdependence that is the basis of what he calls the interaction order in the following terms:<disp-quote>
<p>Effective cooperation in maintaining expectations implies neither belief in the legitimacy or justice of abiding by a convention contract in general (whatever it happens to be), nor personal belief in the ultimate value of the particular norms that are involved. Individuals go along with current interaction arrangements for a wide variety of reasons, and one cannot read from their apparent tacit support of an arrangement that they would, for example, resent or resist its change. Very often behind community and consensus are mixed motive games. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1983</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such ‘effective cooperation in maintaining expectations’ can be seen as an instance of solving coordination problems very much in the sense discussed by Schelling. What Goffman is alluding to in his reference to ‘tacit support’ and ‘mixed motives’ is that ‘effective cooperation’ plays out as non-cooperative game of tacit coordination as participants go along with events and activities but do <italic>not</italic> explicitly negotiate <italic>what</italic> it is they are going along with. This particular tendency characterizes everyday interaction as a coordination problem, generalizing the problem of tacit coordination with respect to a very broad set of social situations in which participants rarely, if ever, disclose their interests, motives, preferences or utilities explicitly in the coordination of expectations: participants may talk a great deal about all sorts of things but, as Garfinkel’s famous breaching experiments very effectively demonstrate, they generally do not like to talk about what they are talking about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 41–44).</p>
<p>There obviously is great variety in the potential dynamics and outcomes of tacit coordination in everyday interaction. Some of this variety can be addressed with respect to a generalized normal form of two-player games (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463113492307">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463113492307">Figure 1</xref>, row players’ payoffs are represented by the letters at the lower left corners of each cell, and column players’ payoffs are represented by those at the upper right corners. In the most often described instances of coordination games (e.g. in meeting point scenarios), players need to choose identical moves in order for both to be rewarded equally with payoffs that are higher than in other combinations of moves. This will hold in cases in which a = b and g = h, while a &gt; e and a &gt; c, b &gt; d, b &gt; f, g &gt; c, g &gt; e, h &gt; d and h &gt; f. Such cases present what Schelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">1960</xref>: 84) has initially called the ‘pure-collaboration game’ if additionally {a, b}, {g, h}, or both combinations, define best outcomes of the coordination game for both players. Given the above list of inequalities in the payoff matrix, both solutions will define coordination equilibria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 14) from which no participant will have an incentive to defect given the other player’s choice. If there is a difference in payoffs between {a, b} and {g, h}, one coordination equilibrium will Pareto dominate the other. Since the less efficient outcome is still better than other outcomes that a player could achieve given the other player’s choices, Pareto-dominated coordination equilibria will often be stable Nash equilibria – breaking down only if both players simultaneously switched to the more favourable coordination equilibrium.</p>
<p>Other types of situations will arise if a ≠ b or g ≠ h (or both), given that the other equalities (a &gt; e; a &gt; c; b &gt; d; b &gt; f; g &gt; c; g &gt; e; h &gt; d; h &gt; f) that define {a, b} and {g, h} as Nash equilibria are still in place. If a &gt; b and g &lt; h there is some conflict of interest between participants, since {a, b} will be favourable to row players and {g, h} favourable to column players. Respective distributions constitute the notorious ‘battle of the sexes’ scenarios, commonly illustrated by situations in which players are better off doing things together (at {a, b} and {g, h}) rather than on their own (at {c, d} and {e, f}), but still have divergent preferences about what to do and which equilibrium to choose. The ‘battle of the sexes’ has two pure-strategy Nash equilibria in the two coordination equilibria, and a mixed-strategy equilibrium as a distinct probability distribution of players’ moves based on their rational variation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1043463113492307">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>If instead a = b and g = h are retained from the pure coordination game and inequalities c ≠ d and e ≠ f are introduced, other variations result, one of which is the stag hunt problem initially discussed by Rousseau with similar scenarios in the works of Hume and Hobbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 2004</xref>). In the stag hunt, one of the coordination equilibria, say {a, b}, Pareto dominates the other because the players in this case coordinate to hunt stag rather than hare. At {c, d} and {e, f} players choose disparate moves, one hunting hare and getting d = h or e = g, respectively, while the other player is left to unsuccessfully hunt stag alone, getting nothing as a result (c = 0; f = 0).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1043463113492307">3</xref></sup> The problem of cooperation in such cases becomes one of committing players to {a, b}, despite the fact that unilaterally choosing to hunt hare and thus getting the respective payoff of {g, h} regardless of the other player’s move is safer in any world in which defection takes place with a probability that is greater than zero.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1043463113492307">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>All three types of scenario are characterized by payoff distributions in which players are rewarded for making moves that in some sense match.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1043463113492307">5</xref></sup> One might, however, also think of situations in which coordination equilibria are achieved by complementary rather than identical moves. This will, for example, be the case in situations in which a division of labour is essential to reaching Pareto-dominant outcomes, and in which the coordination equilibria will be represented by {c, d} or {e, f}, or by both. The payoff inequalities would shift accordingly to c &gt; a, c &gt; g, d &gt; b, d &gt; h, e &gt; a, e &gt; g, f &gt; b, f &gt; h. Overall, the payoff distributions would be equivalent and the transition from a coordination equilibrium established by the choice of identical expectations to one requiring complementary ones would essentially just call for a different understanding of matching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1043463113492307">6</xref></sup> At the same time, such a permissive interpretation of the variety of possible payoff distributions reflects the understanding of coordination games as employable with respect to all payoff distributions in which players have common (although not necessarily identical) interests in achieving one of usually numerous coordination equilibria (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043463113492307">Elster, 2007</xref>: 322–326).</p>
<p>Not every situation is congenial to this characterization of coordination problems. The game-theoretical scenario that has probably received the most attention across the social sciences, the prisoners’ dilemma (with, for example, both a = b and g = h but a &lt; e, b &lt; d, e &gt; g, d &gt; h), does not match since both participants are motivated to defect from {a, b}. The outcome that they are thus likely to end up with the suboptimal {g, h} payoff often leads to the characterization of {a, b} as the ‘cooperative’ solution, but this is not to be confused with the existence of a coordination equilibrium (not to speak of a Pareto-dominant one), since each participant will prefer a situation in which only the other sticks to the cooperative solution. Payoff matrices associated with a (one-shot) prisoner’s dilemma therefore do <italic>not</italic> present games that could be solved by tacit coordination, since one player’s willingness to choose the ‘cooperative’ move, if it could indeed be tacitly assumed by the other, will in turn be exploited by the other player. There is, in other words, no coordination equilibrium in the prisoners’ dilemma – and there is no way in which a ‘cooperative solution’ could be justified in game-theoretical terms, whether choices of expectations or other kinds of moves and payoffs are at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463113492307">Binmore, 1994</xref>: 102–113, 173–256).</p>
<p>Since the quest for establishing the conditions of ‘cooperative’ solutions to payoff matrices of the prisoners’ dilemma type has made distinct contributions to the explanation of social order (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043463113492307">Axelrod, 2006</xref>), it is essential to be precise at this point about the substantial claim intended here with respect to tacit coordination, the kind of equilibrium associated with it, and the kind of utility to be empirically associated with payoff matrices of tacit coordination games. Schelling writes about the coordination of expectations, Goffman about ‘effective cooperation in maintaining expectations’, but in game-theoretical terms these observations need to be related to moves and payoffs. In everyday interaction players are usually able to monitor activities in an overt manner: they are in a mutual ‘ecological huddle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1963</xref>: 95), they observe each other’s moves, and they respond on the basis of observations and assessments. If the choice of expectations is the matter of coordination, however, participants quite clearly do <italic>not</italic> tend to coordinate these particular moves explicitly, for example by stating and negotiating expectations verbally: Participants tend to simply ‘go along’ and tacitly support ‘current interaction arrangements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1983</xref>: 5). In such tacit coordination, players’ payoffs are a function of the utility that is attained by an individual and non-tradable choice of expectations. Such utility may take a wide variety of forms and may, for instance, refer to the benefit of understanding what is going on, of things making sense, or of knowing what to do. The only assumptions that are essential in this respect are that there is <italic>some</italic> individual and non-transferable benefit of maintaining expectations and that there is some difference among expectations in their respective utility.</p>
<p>To think of payoffs of everyday interaction in these terms suggests the existence of a learning mechanism for players acquiring preferences serviceable to adjusting expectations in a manner that allows their coordination. This may refer to a mechanism of reinforcement learning that Homans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043463113492307">1961</xref>: 10–14) has claimed will be required, whether explicitly or implicitly, by every explanatory social theory. The importance of taking learning into account has been emphasized both in game-theoretical models of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>: 27–30) and, incidentally, by Erving Goffman in his paper on the interaction order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1043463113492307">7</xref></sup> Learning emerges from tacit coordination because, very generally speaking, the confirmation of expectations is pleasant and the frustration of expectations is unpleasant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1043463113492307">Turner, 2002</xref>: 87–88; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043463113492307">Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005</xref>). Powerful emotions such as shame and embarrassment are involved in acquiring socially appropriate expectations and respective preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463113492307">Bowles and Gintis, 2011</xref>: 186ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463113492307">Scheff, 1990</xref>: 71ff., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1043463113492307">2006</xref>: 54ff.). Rather than a list of verbally formulated expectations or definitions of situations that players would memorize, the general result is a habitualized <italic>feeling</italic> of appropriateness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043463113492307">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 66–67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463113492307">Collins, 1981</xref>: 991). Tacit coordination, by virtue of keeping appropriateness mostly implicit rather than making it an issue of conversation, will tend to result in knowledge that is common among participants but, at the same time, to a large extent tacit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1043463113492307">Polanyi, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1043463113492307">Tummolini et al., 2013</xref>: 600).</p>
<p>Individual preferences for certain expectations may be reflexively expressed in deliberations of the ‘I expect you to expect me to expect you and so on’ type, but even analytically traceable procedures among players trying to figure out ways to manage their expectations rationally depend on some ‘shared acquaintance with a regularity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 41), and such acquaintance is ultimately a question of players’ full bodily and somatic exposure to one another in actual runs of tacit coordination as instances of socialization and emotional ‘attunement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1043463113492307">Scheff, 1990</xref>: 7; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1043463113492307">Ross, 2008</xref>). This perspective resonates well with findings in evolutionary anthropology and psychology that explore ‘the surprising ability of humans to read each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1043463113492307">Pentland, 2008</xref>: 99) as the foundation of human cooperation, cognition and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1043463113492307">Tomasello, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1043463113492307">2008</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463113492307">Gintis, 2009a</xref>: 140–141). In recent microsociology, Randall Collins’ notion of emotional energy suggests a particular kind of utility acquired by players learning to maintain expectations to their own benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463113492307">Collins, 2004</xref>: 172–182; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 16–20). On a more general level, however, the understanding of everyday interaction as tacit coordination allows for wide variance in the exact kind of reference to individual utility intended by a coordination game matrix as long as players’ preferences in picking moves can be referred to <italic>some</italic> utility function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463113492307">Binmore, 1994</xref>: 169, 267–268) – whether in terms of emotional energy or the utility of a cognitively more accessible form of ‘sensemaking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1043463113492307">Weick et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Everyday interaction and Nash’s categorical imperative</title>
<p>The taken-for-grantedness of social reality that is at the centre of the famous essay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463113492307">Berger and Luckmann (1966)</xref>, which has been associated with a resurgence of institutionalism in late 20th century social and organizational theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1043463113492307">Powell and DiMaggio, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1043463113492307">Scott, 2008</xref>), addresses a likely outcome of the repeated run of tacit coordination games within a collective: that certain solutions to coordination problems are learned thoroughly and become routines which, at the same time, remain to some extent tacit, beyond reflection or deliberate modification. Berger and Luckmann understand the taken-for-grantedness of institutions to be an aggregate outcome of participants training one another in social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463113492307">Berger and Luckmann, 1966</xref>: 65–85, 149–166). Their general understanding of institutionalization is quite compatible with the idea that players find ways to maintain expectations through tacit coordination and settle on focal points that become conventional:<disp-quote>
<p>The force of many rules of etiquette and social restraint, including some (like the rule against ending a sentence with a proposition) that have been divested of their relevance and authority, seems to depend on their having become ‘solutions’ to a coordination game: everyone expects everyone to expect everyone to expect observance, so that nonobservance carries the pain of conspicuousness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 91)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis’ (1969)</xref> analysis of conventions is clearly foreshadowed in this quote. That the reflexivity of expectations of expectations of expectations (and so on) may be the basis of a wide range of social regularities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 25–33) is an assumption evident in many strands of social theory from phenomenological to neo-Parsonian manifestations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043463113492307">Luhmann, 1995</xref>: 292–294), and it is also implicit in Coleman’s discussion of rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463113492307">Coleman, 1990</xref>: 53–54). Coleman’s analysis, in fact, much more than the emphasis on the social regularity of cognition that is found, for example, in the essay by Berger and Luckmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043463113492307">1966</xref>: 106–107), is strikingly congenial to how Erving Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043463113492307">1959</xref>: 24) characterizes the way in which situations come to afford a particular morality:<disp-quote>
<p>In stressing the fact that the initial definition of the situation projected by an individual tends to provide a plan for the cooperative activity that follows (…) we must not overlook the crucial fact that any projected definition of the situation also has a distinctive moral character. (…) Society is organized on the principle that any individual who possesses certain social characteristics has a moral right to expect that others will value and treat him in an appropriate way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the ‘moral right’ associated with the choice of certain expectations and the ‘pain of conspicuousness’ associated with crossing these expectations, Goffman and Schelling express the kind of reinforcement that needs to be in place if a combination of moves in accordance with the ‘rules of etiquette and social restraint’, or some ‘definition of the situation’, is to be a Nash equilibrium. The stability of tacit coordination equilibria thus is associated with collective tendencies to sanction, and to expect sanctioning from others, in a manner such that players will be better off for choosing activities in line with collective arrangements and worse off for deviating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043463113492307">Bowles and Gintis, 2011</xref>: 20ff.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463113492307">Coleman, 1990</xref>: 266ff.). In tacit coordination, activities that are in line with a conventional, taken-for-granted or righteous run of everyday interaction will be associated with coordination equilibria by virtue of confirming players’ expectations, while divergent activities are associated with some degree of frustration. In this manner, the tacit choice of expectations predicates, following Berger and Luckmann, as well as Goffman, Schelling and Coleman, all kinds of overt, observable activities.</p>
<p>It is evident that any kind of payoff distribution can be turned into a coordination game matrix if the payoffs are changed accordingly. In the case of tacit coordination, respective schemes of sanctioning can be internalized through the utility associated with maintaining certain expectations. The problem, however, is that even those participants who are prepared and happy to maintain expectations in a collectively desired and affordable manner will still need to choose appropriate expectations in every situation they encounter, and this continuously regenerates problems of coordination. In a world full of potentially relevant expectations and conventions, of diverse kinds of rights that are not quite consistently ordered and could in various ways be asserted or rejected – what are the expectations to choose in a specific situation? Among the wide variety of rights granted to participants of everyday interaction, the right to be a ‘cultural dope’ – whatever right to treatment by others this may presume – is conspicuously missing (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 69–73).</p>
<p>Participants of everyday interaction, in other words, even if they intend to just be ordinary, will face the problem of ‘doing being ordinary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463113492307">Sacks, 1984</xref>). To do ‘being ordinary’ cannot be accomplished by attending to a number of preset focal points, but requires participants to associate activities with expectations while behaving in a manner that maintains the impression that nothing unusual is happening – regardless of whatever actually <italic>is</italic> happening. Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463113492307">Sacks (1984)</xref> has observed that this general tendency of accommodation tends to be learned by heart to the extent that participants maintain it under the most extraordinary circumstances (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1043463113492307">Maynard, 2003</xref>: 53–54):<disp-quote>
<p>The plane is now in the midst of being hijacked, and the guy reports, ‘I thought to myself, we just had a Polish hijacking a month ago and they’re already making a movie of it.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463113492307">Sacks, 1984</xref>: 419)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To do ‘being ordinary’ is clearly a convention based on a reflexive generalization of expectations in an ‘I expect you to expect me (to expect you to expect me, and so on) to be ordinary’ manner, but it is not a convention in the sense that a specific focal point orienting the choice of expectations would be conventional. The tendency among participants to do ‘being ordinary’ is a manifestation of what Randall Collins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463113492307">2004</xref>: 144–145) calls the ‘Simon and Garfinkel principle’: accept anything that is taking place as normal and ordinary as long as you can bear to do so and contribute to maintaining this normality. Collins summarizes the finding of Garfinkel’s breaching experiments as showing that ‘the most important “ethnomethods” are to avoid raising questions’ and ‘the usual procedures of social interaction’ are ‘conservative with interactants assuming the normalcy of appearances, and engaging in ritual repairs’ (p.144) – thus the Garfinkel reference of the principle. The reference to Herbert Simon given by Collins is less specific<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1043463113492307">8</xref></sup> but easily supplemented: while no specific focal point is purported by going along and being ordinary, a preference among participants to do so and reinforce one another accordingly will surely reinforce attending to common sets of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1043463113492307">Simon, 1997</xref>: 110–111). Rather than instructing participants with respect to which cues to attend, the choice of expectations is based on a <italic>principle of affirmation</italic> that will make it easier for participants to settle on <italic>some</italic> cues, ‘key objects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463113492307">Blumer, 1969</xref>: 52) and ‘indexical expressions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 4–7), that serve as precedence for expectations that can collectively be maintained.</p>
<p>This principle of affirmation can be considered as a straightforward application of what Alfred Schutz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1043463113492307">1964</xref>: 228) has famously called the ‘natural attitude’ of everyday life, an attitude of playing along so that ‘any key that is mutually recognized as the key becomes <italic>the</italic> key’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 57; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463113492307">Gintis, 2009a</xref>: 145). However, even as players are ‘not interested in finding out whether this world really does exist or whether it is merely a coherent system of consistent appearances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1043463113492307">Schutz, 1964</xref>: 228), to bring about the consistence and coherence of appearances always remains a practical problem of tacit coordination, first of expectations, then of producing activities in line with them. If players are drawn from a population in which adherence to principles of affirmation is well-entrenched, such adherence will make them more likely to find focal points, and players will be able to rely on each other’s willingness to choose expectations in line with given precedence, producing further activity recursively – a point emphasized by Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">1969</xref>: 99) in praise of Schelling and reiterated many times by sociologists from Garfinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">1967</xref>: 7ff.) to Giddens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043463113492307">1984</xref>: 3; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1043463113492307">Vollmer, 2013</xref>: 53–56). In order to make initial adjustments, however, participants will still have to extrapolate from events and activities they observe to expectations they should entertain. Individual players will not merely have to face the risk of possibly going along with ‘exploitive fabrications’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 103–111), but also the costs of choosing expectations that may turn out to be wrong (as in the Sacks’ the hijacking example). These potential costs of following a principle of affirmation in coordinating by precedence may be associated with the likelihood with which players temporarily retreat from tacit coordination and choose other means of adjusting expectations and activities.</p>
<p>Schelling clearly suspected that such gaps in tacit coordination are rare and that a complete lack of tacit coordination in any social situation is probably a fiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 101). If players joining a game of tacit coordination are competent members of a community, well-trained to adhere to principles of affirmation, it will usually be unproblematic to add them to, say, a two-person game as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043463113492307">Figure 1</xref>: the payoff vector of a coordination equilibrium {a, b, …} will simply ‘grow’ in a way that payoffs to additional players will satisfy the Nash condition of being best outcomes given other players’ choices. In this way, a more explicit settlement of what it is that is going on can be avoided in the run of everyday interaction among appropriately trained participants, even if there is some fluctuation among participants. In cases in which an explicit settlement about the level of activity is indeed reached among players (whether in terms of an agreement to play, to go see a movie, or to take the time to really talk), implementing the agreement in actual moves will always involve an element of tacit coordination, thus calling on principles of affirmation to put explicit agreements into effect. Harold Garfinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">1967</xref>: 73–74) has referred to this as the ‘et cetera clause’ attached to any kind of agreement:<disp-quote>
<p>(…) no matter how specific the terms of common understandings may be – a contract may be considered the prototype – they attain the status of an agreement only insofar as the stipulated conditions carry along an unspoken but understood <italic>et cetera</italic> clause. (…) Therefore it is both misleading and incorrect to think of an agreement as an actuarial device whereby persons are enabled as of any Here and Now to predict each other’s future activities. More accurately, common understandings that have been formulated under the rule of an agreement are used by persons to normalize whatever their actual activities turn out to be. (pp.73–74)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even in the case of specific agreements to coordinate activities in a certain manner, therefore, tacit coordination is still called for in implementing these agreements and principles of affirmation are adhered to in coordinating from precedence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 52–55). In effect, the specificity of an agreement merely changes the kind of precedence (e.g. in the making of a contract or agreeing to follow its terms). Garfinkel’s comments on the ‘et cetera clause’ indicate the general character of tacit coordination in following not only agreements, but also any type of rule: if a rule were to spell out all cases of its future application, it would lose its general character and lead to monstrous specifications of rules about the rules for the rules of using rules. The implicit understanding of the ‘et cetera clause’ among participants ensures that they provide one another with room to manoeuvre in affirming each other’s expectations, but the point transcends the enactment of specific agreements: any rule able to coordinate participants’ moves (whether implicit or explicit) requires a community of players trained in applying the rule, and this application will invariably involve an element of tacit coordination in choosing expectations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1043463113492307">Zimmerman, 1970</xref>: 230–237; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043463113492307">Bloor, 1997</xref>: 6–26). Observance of the ‘et cetera clause’ as a particular principle of affirmation characterizing everyday interaction ensures that participants do not get carried away by the specification of regularities, conventions or focal points.</p>
<p>In the sense that participants would, in all likelihood, fail miserably at achieving explicit specifications of tacit coordination a priori, principles of affirmation could be considered as keeping participants from being overly clear about why and how to make their moves, whether these demands are thrown at them experimentally (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 42–44), attributed by social theorists (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043463113492307">Collins, 1981</xref>: 991) or by bureaucracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1043463113492307">Hilbert, 1987</xref>: 81–83). It may be assumed that respective savings of resources such as, say, emotional energy, will outweigh much of the individual costs of accommodating expectations. The strongest case for principles of affirmation as efficient orientations for gaining utility from maintaining expectations though may perhaps be provided by the observation that, while the confirmation of expectations may sometimes be a private affair of checking ideas and sometimes an institutional affair of applying collectively ratified rules, the utility gained from entertaining them appears to be particularly high if they are collectively ratified among co-present participants. This observation is central to Randall Collins’ Neo-Durkheimian understanding of interaction ritual as a process in which the entrainment of participants into patterns of physical interaction with a mutual focus is in itself rewarding, and a superior source of emotional energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463113492307">Collins, 2004</xref>: 47–101). In this understanding, it is first and foremost the solidarity intrinsic to interaction that provides the premium of utility that confers upon the situation the character of a game of tacit coordination in which participants attune to another’s faces, eyes, gestures, limbs, and very minute details of their encounter in coordinating expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463113492307">Binmore, 1998</xref>: 307–308).</p>
<p>Further maxims of conduct can be listed in collective support of a smooth run of tacit coordination in everyday interaction. The principles of sociability explored by Georg Simmel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043463113492307">1950</xref>: 43–57) may provide at this point one last example. According to Simmel, being sociable gradually decouples the run of interaction from other collective engagements and brings otherwise serious topics and considerations (e.g. about politics, religion, profits) under the auspices of the ‘play-form of sociation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043463113492307">Simmel, 1950</xref>: 45): participants’ attention is drawn away from long-term convictions or commitments to focus exclusively on their entrainment in a mutual engagement, as participants coordinate irrespective of participants’ class, religious or political persuasion. The effort to be sociable will restrain participants from introducing into an encounter anything that might be divisive with respect to the solidarity in play, and while they will certainly have serious longer-term commitments and convictions to live up to, and may know or guess each other’s to some extent, participants will generally tacitly avoid them. Not every encounter, of course, is sociable in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043463113492307">Simmel, 1950</xref>: 47), but, like doing being ordinary, doing being sociable will provide players with an orientation of how to go along, allowing others to go along, of how to join an engagement from outside the initial ecological huddle and allowing others to do the same.</p>
<p>As principles of affirmation, the ‘Simon and Garfinkel principle’, as well as Simmel’s concept of sociability, can be interpreted as manifestations of what Ken Binmore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043463113492307">1994</xref>: 158) has termed ‘Nash’s categorical imperative’: adopt strategies that will lead to equilibrium selection if they are adopted by others. Defining formally a family of coordination game maxims for choosing expectations and activities in everyday interaction on this basis is tempting but beyond the scope of the present paper. The particular convergence of game-theoretical and microsociological descriptions of everyday interaction on which such an effort would need to be based, though, has perhaps become sufficiently apparent in the way in which tacit coordination of expectations empirically calls on principles of behaviour that, by motivating a variety of explicit and implicit adjustments among players, affirm equilibrium selection and equilibrium maintenance in the tacit coordination of expectations. In identifying principles of affirmation, the microsociology of everyday life effectively complements and empirically substantiates the game-theoretical understanding of how expectations interdepend in tacit coordination. Principles of affirmation indicate the standing of Nash’s categorical imperative with respect to the coordination of expectations in everyday interaction – an imperative that may in turn be considered as a game-theoretical elaboration of its ‘distinctive moral character’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1959</xref>: 24; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1043463113492307">Rawls, 1987</xref>: 142–145).</p>
<p>Three observations with respect to tacit coordination within a finite population of players observing these principles of everyday interaction can also more immediately be made at this point, all of which indicate important welfare implications of running interaction in this manner: (a) inefficient coordination equilibria are likely to be common and stable; (b) unequal outcomes, as represented, for example by a ‘battle of the sexes’ type of payoff distribution, are also likely to be common and stable; (c) risky commitments, as represented by a ‘stag hunt’ type of payoff distribution, are likely to occur even among players who initially have little information about each other. This will put these players at risk but increase the scope of coordination available within the overall principles-of-affirmation-adhering collective.</p>
<list id="list1-1043463113492307" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Players following principles of affirmation will choose expectations that allow current activities to be treated as normal according to precedence and they will make moves that support each other’s subsumptions by going along and allowing others to go along. Adhering to principles of affirmation is clearly very permissive with respect to which coordination equilibria are struck. If an unlikely version of normality is projected from precedence, participants will face an increased risk of being disappointed by divergent moves. Somewhat ironically, this may back up the stability of coordination equilibria once participants realize the initial vulnerability of expectations and will accordingly be particularly careful not to offset them, as in groupthink dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1043463113492307">Janis, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>While a tendency to be extra careful not to offset ‘current interaction arrangements’ is one way of keeping coordination in equilibrium in the face of potential disappointments, another is to cultivate expectations that tolerate a wide variety of events and activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1043463113492307">9</xref></sup> In both respects, tendencies of tacit coordination to sustain inefficient equilibria are compounded, increasing the probability that Pareto-dominant equilibria will be missed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1043463113492307">Semeshenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1043463113492307">Sugden, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>: 25–26, 146–147). Participants will stick with maintaining expectations that generate less utility than alternative combinations that they could in principle just as well adopt if only they were able to collectively decide to do so in a simultaneous choice of alternative expectations that would re-lock them in a more Pareto-efficient Nash equilibrium.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In tacit coordination, participants do not have a clear idea of each other’s individual benefits derived from maintaining expectations. Differences in utility cannot be made an explicit issue without the coordination of expectations losing its tacit character. This will tend to reinforce participants not to offset a status quo since this would, as in a ‘battle of the sexes’ dating scenario, likely spoil further interaction. A stable kind of tacit divisiveness may thus be supported by equilibrium strategies, a divisiveness that participants are unable to address without putting the basis on which they have been sustaining an ‘effective cooperation in maintaining expectations’ at risk, as when a couple continues to rehearse the activity of an early date – possibly to mutual detriment, possibly to the unilateral detriment of one party stuck with an inferior payoff. Given that coordination is tacit, not only will by definition any first move away from a given equilibrium imply a loss of utility, but also players cannot be certain that an alternative equilibrium will even exist.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Principles of affirmation may draw players into engagements that are risky in the sense that their own utility will depend on other players whose payoff function is unknown and often cannot be ascertained without loss of coordination equilibrium. Chief among these risks are those of being defected or exploited. The ‘stag hunt’ type of coordination game, though, illustrates quite well that individual risks of being defected may be collectively offset by the collective benefits of being able to hunt bigger prey or, more generally, of being able to run more rewarding forms of tacit coordination – which potentially affords collective insurances against the individual costs of being misled or defected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1043463113492307">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, the repeated run of tacit coordination within a collective will favour a distribution of expectations that makes defection less likely by segregating populations into cooperators and defectors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 2004</xref>: 95–103): learning will over time cluster participants who are able to confirm each other’s expectations, establishing segments in a collective in which tacit cooperation can be run in a manner allowing for some fluctuation as long as participants are drawn from the same segment. By allowing a reflexive amalgamation of expectations in these segments with some indifference as to who actually is participating in any given situation, conventions can arise that are universal within the segment. One consequence is that more deliberate forms of coordination that rely on the relative predictability of expectations and activities become available within the segment by virtue of the mere fact of stimulus generalization: by reliably motivating specific moves, certain stimuli acquire the quality of signals, and thus present additional leverage for coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1043463113492307">March and Simon, 1958</xref>: 162–172).</p></list-item>

<title>Signals, framing and breakdowns</title>
<p>The analysis of signalling systems by David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis (1969)</xref> explores how more explicit forms of coordination emerge from tacit coordination. Very much in line with the preceding discussion, Lewis begins by showing that participants are more likely to solve coordination problems ‘through the agency of a system of suitably concordant mutual expectations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 25), subsequently discussing how the association of moves and expectations leads to ‘a metastable self-perpetuating system of preferences, actions and expectations capable of persisting indefinitely’ (p.42), and to conventions of which ‘those whereby we give to suitable actions the status of signals’ are ‘one especially important class’ (p.122).</p>
<p>That certain types of moves acquire the status of signals and, possibly, of ‘rudimentary language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 160) is a corollary of the observation that certain types of precedence for choosing expectations become conventional as predictability of moves and predictability of expectations mutually reinforce one another. This alone, however, will not generally motivate a shift from tacit to explicit coordination, particularly if principles of affirmation prevail among players. The stag hunt game illustrates, however, that prevalence of these principles is associated with some disregard of individual risk. If risks of defection or exploitation are for some reason more salient among players, tacit coordination will be much less likely. The collective exigency of committing players to complementary moves in such situations (e.g. in order to hunt stag) may lead to a demand for more explicit forms of signalling and ultimately to a demand for enforceable rights. How can this demand be met, however, if there are, on the one hand, situations in which tacit coordination is effective and in which more explicit forms of coordination are dispensable, and, on the other hand, situations in which no tacit coordination is possible and signalling conventions are unlikely to emerge, since participants will be unable to coordinate their moves appropriately to begin with? The apparent answer is that forms of explicit coordination will <italic>only</italic> emerge in collectives of players that are <italic>generally able to coordinate their activities tacitly and sometimes unable or unwilling to do so</italic>.</p>
<p>In support of this understanding of explicit forms of coordination as emerging only in collectives in which tacit coordination is generally effective, four interrelated arguments can be offered on the basis of the preceding discussion: (a) while tacit coordination without explicit signalling is possible and probably dominant empirically, a purely explicit form of coordination by signalling does not and probably cannot exist; (b) coordination can be deliberately affected by what Erving Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">1974</xref>: 43ff.) has called the ‘keying’ of activities, allowing the selection of preferred coordination equilibria; (c) a set of social situations in which explicit forms of coordination are prevalent is constituted by instances in which breakdowns of coordination have occurred, and these situations illustrate particularly well participants’ preference for tacit coordination; (d) this mixed arrangement of tacit and explicit coordination is likely to be evolutionarily stable, as it minimizes instances in which explicit forms of coordination become necessary; it allows for the selection of Pareto-efficient coordination equilibria, and isolates occasional breakdowns.</p>
<list id="list2-1043463113492307" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>A completely explicit form of coordination would be one in which participants were able to give signals that would unambiguously specify which moves to make. While there are many requests that participants of everyday interaction consider to be as explicit as they may possibly be (‘kiss me’, ‘pass me the ball’, ‘show me your ID’, etc.), such perceptions of explicitness come by virtue of participants being well-trained members of the same collective. This means that they will recognize any signal as explicit enough only through their ‘shared acquaintance with a regularity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1043463113492307">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 41) – and ‘explicit enough’ will never mean fully explicit with respect to some literal meaning. If shared acquaintance is in doubt or if some doubt or risk is salient with respect to a signal, participants may start to wonder about whether they should now really kiss, how to touch the ball, what ‘ID’ to show, etc., and similar uncertainties may arise with respect to any remedial specification. It is perhaps to some extent the fact that demands for explicit signalling themselves tend to be signals of doubt and risk aversion that motivates participants to avoid them. Sending coordinating signals that are explicit enough ‘for all practical purposes’ and being content to receive them is an articulation of the ‘et cetera clause’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 73–74), and it implicitly signals a general willingness to work out the specifics of any direction, plea or order, in tacit coordination (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1043463113492307">Scheff, 1967</xref>: 221–222). In an important sense, therefore, explicit coordination draws on the effectiveness of tacit coordination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1043463113492307">11</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Within the broader jurisdiction of an ‘et cetera clause’, the amount of signalling necessary to orient subsequent activities decreases with interpretive work being delegated to participants tacitly associating expectations and activities with signals (requests, demands, directions, etc.) affording them. This leads back to cases in which:<disp-quote>
<p>finding the key, or rather finding <italic>a</italic> key (…) may depend on imagination more than on logic; it may depend on analogy, precedent, accidental arrangement, symmetry, aesthetic or geometric configuration, casuistic reasoning, and who the parties are and what they know about each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1043463113492307">Schelling, 1960</xref>: 57; emphasis retained)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his essay on frame analysis, Goffman, like Schelling, uses a terminology of keys to describe how tacit coordination can be regulated and transformed among participants sending each other ‘cues (…) for establishing when the transformation is to begin and when it is to end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 45). The connotation of Goffman’s reference to keys is musical rather than door-opening, but the role of the concept is similar to Schelling’s in that ‘keying’ refers to the setting of precedence in solving coordination problems. Whether the metaphor is one of keys opening doors or indicating tonalities, the idea of keys as precedence is helpful when considering how explicit coordination may be embedded in and supported by tacit coordination: participants will give each other signals about the kind of expectations to entertain but they will generally tend to work out and follow further implications tacitly. The frame of activity is signalled with some explicitness but, once a cue has been given, the ‘Simon and Garfinkel principle’ takes over unless the keying is retransformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 159ff.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1043463113492307">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>With respect to tacit coordination, the keying of activities by certain signals can be understood as a particular form of correlated equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043463113492307">Aumann, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043463113492307">1987</xref>). This supposes that players’ strategies, rather than being completely independent, are correlated by some device, thus increasing players’ abilities to find equilibrium solutions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463113492307">Fudenberg and Levine, 1998</xref>: 21–24). Aumann’s solution concept is general and can be applied to all kinds of non-cooperative games, as well as to the analysis of conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 1996</xref>: 69–79). Keys, in the sense suggested by both Schelling and Goffman, are employed by participants as correlation devices in order to increase the likelihood that a specific, rather than just any kind of, coordination equilibrium will be struck (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463113492307">Gintis, 2009a</xref>: 135–139). The framing of activities can in this way be understood as a variant of correlated equilibrium selection brought about by the mobilization of distinct signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1043463113492307">Vollmer, 2013</xref>: 47–56). In utilizing correlation devices, players can avoid Pareto-dominated equilibria in tacit coordination to the extent in which they are able to shift their expectations simultaneously to preferred coordination equilibria. This may well associate the ability to frame experience and activities in this manner with a premium of efficiency available to appropriately trained participants and collectives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some of Garfinkel’s breaching experiments are built on the simple instruction to over-explicate what is going on, while others involve more elaborate setups designed to frustrate participants’ ‘background expectations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 58–67). Garfinkel’s characterization of these expectations as being in some ‘background’ indicates their implicit character and high individual costs associated with adjusting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: 44ff.). Among subjects’ responses reported by Garfinkel and his students, frustration and anxiety stand out (p.47). The tendency to turn against each other is pronounced: ‘What’s the matter with you? You know what I mean.’; ‘What came over you? We never talk this way, do we?’ (pp.43–44). Clearly, neither experimenters nor subjects preferred to interact in this manner. The explicit coordination of activities following the breaching of background expectations played out as a cooperative game with players trying to directly affect each other’s moves and payoffs, and this was experienced as stressful, risky and forbidding. Garfinkel’s breaching experiments elicit a type of response that tends to be avoided in everyday interaction and appears to be reserved for situations in which tacit coordination has broken down or turned out to be frustrating to the extent that more intrusive forms of coordination become comparatively affordable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043463113492307">Feld, 1997</xref>: 108).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extrapolating from these findings, an imaginary collective of participants running activities with a preference for more intrusive forms of coordination would have to incur a variety of costs from members’ exposure to reciprocal acts of sanctioning. In contrast, collectives with a preference for tacit coordination are likely to be less preoccupied with themselves and able to hunt larger prey (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>: 113–115). In cases of defection or exploitation, defectors may still be drawn into a cooperative game in which ‘acts of vengeance’ may be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463113492307">Durkheim, 1964</xref>: 85–90), but preferences to adhere to principles of affirmation will decrease such instances and depress both the extent of sanctioning and its intensity: participants preferring to go along (and be gone along with) will be sensitive to even small hints of sanctioning in other participants’ faces or gestures. Furthermore, aversion towards situations in which tacit coordination breaks down and forms of sanctioning take over will increase the likelihood that respective encounters will be avoided in the future – whether by resetting encounters if a social relationship needs to be recovered (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1043463113492307">Goodwin, 2007</xref>) or by staying clear of an ecological huddle that would involve renewed exposure to uncongenial forms of co-presence.</p>
<p>The run of cooperative games after failures of tacit coordination will thus tend to segregate collectives into subsets of players able to coordinate tacitly with some efficiency (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043463113492307">Collins, 2004</xref>: 297–344). Such segregation may serve the collective as a whole by isolating instances of breakdown: rather than engaging in reciprocal sanctioning and drawing other participants into coalitions, players who find themselves unable to tacitly coordinate at a reasonably low cost will often simply exit an encounter (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>: 62–65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043463113492307">Hirschman, 1970</xref>: 132–137). Players are likely to learn and collectively stabilize signals that allow them to identify and engage players who are able to let them go along and to avoid those unable or unwilling to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043463113492307">Frank, 1988</xref>), or, whenever respective contacts to the latter cannot be avoided, to run games with side-payments or other, possibly even more antagonistic, kinds of social exchange (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043463113492307">Collins, 2008</xref>: 79–80) – until some foundation of tacit coordination may be amalgamated in terms of reciprocally stabilized expectations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1043463113492307">Vollmer, 2013</xref>: 217–224).</p></list-item>

<title>Game theory and microsociology across the divide</title>
<p>Everyday interaction therefore appears to be consistently grounded in a game of tacit coordination in which players maximize the utility of maintaining expectations. Microsociological intelligence about how participants of everyday interaction are able to do so effectively complements the game-theoretical understanding of interdependent expectations and utilities by indicating the extent to which maintaining coordination equilibrium draws on distinct principles of affirmation. The tendency of participants to not more directly sanction each other’s expectations keeps coordination tacit. Within a continuum of expressions given and expressions given off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1959</xref>: 14–16), deliberate forms of signalling are embedded in a constant and continuously accommodated reiteration of tacit coordination as participants take each other’s behaviour as precedence for striking coordination equilibria. Other participants’ activities in this respect become paradigmatic focal points, which evidently is a useful orientation given that other participants (rather than nature) determine the utility gained from maintaining expectations in most instances of everyday interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043463113492307">Blau, 1964</xref>: 14–19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043463113492307">Blumer, 1969</xref>: 88).</p>
<p>There is nothing incompatible in this general picture with Goffman’s understanding that players in everyday interaction ‘aren’t quite playing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 135) if Goffman’s notion of playfulness as relying on a quite particular keying of activities ‘from a given distance from literal activity to a greater distance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 365) is taken into account: it is in tacit coordination that the game of everyday interaction is fully grounded in terms of a ‘primary framework’ of what is going on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1974</xref>: 38–39, 375–376); playfulness as a specific frame is somewhat removed from such fully grounded activities just like, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043463113492307">Goffman’s (1969)</xref> perspective, is ‘strategic interaction’. That this may not necessarily imply the irrelevance of either is noted by Simmel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1043463113492307">1950</xref>: 50), who observes that the ‘more profound, double sense of “social game” is that not only the game is played in a society (as its external medium) but that, with its help, people actually “play” “society”’ – an argument that could be extended to the realm of the explicitly strategic as a reflection or ‘play-form’ of the implicitly strategic. Respective categorizations, however, ultimately depend on how narrowly ‘the’ playful or ‘the’ strategic are defined by analysts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043463113492307">Brown and Levinson, 1987</xref>: 68–74, 84–94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1043463113492307">Maynard, 1991</xref>: 279; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>Instead of using such categorizations to fight for academic turf, game-theoretical and microsociological insights may be combined to mutual benefit in the investigation of everyday interaction with respect to a variety of topics. If, for example, expectations pertinent to tacit coordination are considered by Garfinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043463113492307">1967</xref>: 44ff.) to have a ‘background’ character, Aumann’s understanding of correlated equilibrium already mentioned here with respect to framing may help to clarify the exact status and meaning of such ‘backgroundness’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1043463113492307">Vanderschraaf (1995)</xref> has introduced a version of the correlated equilibrium idea that is arguably more general than Aumann’s by avoiding the assumption that the correlation of strategies needs to be primed by some signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1043463113492307">Vanderschraaf, 2001</xref>: 53–97). The correlation of strategies can also be based on joint randomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 1996</xref>: 69), which could very well result from reiterated runs of tacit coordination that distribute preferences for maintaining certain expectations as common priors across a collective of players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043463113492307">Gintis, 2009a</xref>: 132–145). Common or jointly randomized priors would then be a Bayesian expression for background expectations shared among participants without explicit consensus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1043463113492307">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instances of framing and keying provide examples of correlated equilibrium selection through signalling in Aumann’s original sense. Further transformations of tacit coordination, however, need to be taken into account by a more comprehensive understanding of everyday interaction. Most importantly, tacit coordination sometimes does fail as Garfinkel’s breaching experiments demonstrate. With respect to the ‘what got into you?’ exchanges reported by Garfinkel, the classical studies by Harsanyi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043463113492307">1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043463113492307">1967</xref>) of Bayesian rationality come to mind, since they address the problem of uncertainty about other players’ utility functions. The prominence that the differentiation of players and their utility functions into types assumes in Harsanyi’s discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1043463113492307">1962</xref>: 38, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043463113492307">1967</xref>: 163–172) resonates with the attributional type of verbal signalling and sanctioning evident in the course of Garfinkel’s breaching experiments and also with the potential evolutionary benefits of segregation indicated at the end of the preceding section. The assumption of non-cooperative games of tacit coordination being prevalent with cooperative games taking place mostly in cases of breakdown may suggest a limited empirical role for Harsanyi’s ‘type’ solution in everyday interaction. The frequency of breakdowns of tacit coordination in everyday interaction, however, is empirically not quite clear and may to some extent be underreported. Furthermore, processes of framing, even if they remain tacit, may in some sense be infected by categorizations of types of player, for example by players attending to who it is that is trying to key ongoing activities and correlate expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1043463113492307">Vollmer, 2013</xref>: 47–56). There is a potential tension between institutional solutions offered in terms of universalistic conventions that tacitly assume players to be alike and solutions that are stable because of type attributions – and there clearly are keys with respect to the former (e.g. general norms) as well as with respect to the latter (e.g. indicators of status or membership). A notion of social structure emerging from interaction would need to consider both the player-invariant and player-sensitive type of maintaining expectations accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043463113492307">Martin, 2009</xref>: 13–16).</p>
<p>There are indeed numerous situations in everyday interaction in which principles of affirmation that are insensitive to the type of players present in an ecological huddle are <italic>not</italic> being followed to begin with because participants cannot afford to disregard who it is they are facing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463113492307">Gambetta (2009)</xref> investigates how outlaws decide who to take into their racket and how taxi-drivers decide which person it would be safe to drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043463113492307">Gambetta and Hamill, 2005</xref>), providing outstanding analyses of situations in which tacit coordination is an insufficient mechanism for regulating participation. Gambetta’s works are congenial to the present perspective not only because they present one of the few accomplished combinations of microsociology and game theory in the literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1043463113492307">Vaughan, 2009</xref>: 705–706), but also because they are consistent with the prediction that situations in which establishing player type is critical will be particularly likely to take place if members from different segments of a collective with little or no history of tacit coordination need to interact with one another. Gambetta’s work explores these situations as signalling games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1043463113492307">Spence, 1974</xref>) and emphasizes how the quality of a signal for being a particular type of person is a function not only of the apparent cost of producing the signal incurred by its sender (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463113492307">Gambetta, 2009</xref>: 111–112), but also of certain conventions of signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043463113492307">Gambetta, 2009</xref>: 251ff.). While the latter types of signals lead back to Lewis’ analysis of conventions, the costliness of the former indicates limits to universalistic forms of tacit coordination.</p>
<p>The use of costly signals in everyday interaction clearly has further systematic implications. Keeping the cost of signalling low is serviceable for many instances of everyday interaction, for example when the very cheapness of talk serves the purpose of being sociable and maximizes the accessibility of an encounter. Such inclusiveness, however, is not always in participants’ interest. Increasing the cost of signals required for striking distinct coordination equilibria is an obvious way of generating exclusiveness. Such exclusiveness may be enforced within an ongoing run of activity, for example if participants attend to each other’s moves as indicators of cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043463113492307">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>), thus leaving those unable to coordinate in this manner, as it were, by the wayside. Costly signalling at the start of an encounter allows using signals as symbolic media of exchange (for example, as money) in setting up distinct forms of interdependence (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1043463113492307">Luhmann, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 54–55).</p>
<p>Game theory has, across its various manifestations and schools of thought, contributed very substantially to accounting for the emergence of norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043463113492307">Bendor and Swistak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043463113492307">Bicchieri, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 214–223; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1043463113492307">Voss, 2001</xref>). Its approach of thinking about norms as accommodating and stabilizing payoff distributions quickly found its way into both social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043463113492307">Coleman, 1990</xref>: 49ff.) and empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043463113492307">Diekmann, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1043463113492307">14</xref></sup> Investigating the reiterated run of tacit coordination offers a complementary route of investigating how the likelihood of specific activities is changed through the coordination of expectations in various and not necessarily normative forms. Whereas norms lead to the accommodation of activities to expectations, tacit coordination may also accommodate expectations to activities, as in the Sacks’ example of the hijacked plane discussed above as an instance of ‘doing being ordinary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1043463113492307">Sacks, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043463113492307">Galtung (1959)</xref> has famously differentiated normative and cognitive expectations along these differences in accommodation, an argument taken up later in the Neo-Parsonian theory of social systems by Luhmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1043463113492307">1995</xref>: 319–325). By investigating empirically and elaborating formally the dynamics of tacit coordination within a collective, the fact that there is social order not only within patterns of sanctioning, but also within patterns of learning among players, may be further explored (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043463113492307">Alterman, 2008</xref>). Recent analyses in evolutionary game theory point to a continuum of expectations that initially emerge from slight asymmetries in coordination and, through processes of collective learning, eventually stabilize as norms and rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043463113492307">Binmore, 1998</xref>: 273–293, 310–313; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>: 44–55, 214–218), or may, as forms of common knowledge, essentially remain beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1043463113492307">Paternotte, 2011</xref>). Beyond knowledge that is common as a manifestation of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043463113492307">Chwe, 2001</xref>), there may be a distinct social function of expectations as idiosyncratic beliefs that more easily than norms and rights accommodate to ongoing events.</p>
<p>Extending the present analysis in the direction of cooperative games, bargaining and signalling may well bring to light additional mechanisms for tacitly coordinating expectations and associating them with a variety of activities. Stable expectations often deviate from the universalism inherent in norms and common knowledge by being based on social relationships among specific players, or among specific types of players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1043463113492307">Lindenberg, 2000</xref>: 24–25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1043463113492307">Martin, 2009</xref>). The sociological understanding of how expectations are maintained, accommodated and mobilized within a collective is clearly in need of further elaboration beyond the distinction of normative and cognitive orientations used by Galtung and Luhmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1043463113492307">Vollmer, 2013</xref>: 43–47). The present discussion suggests that this will be crucial for associating more thoroughly the game-theoretical investigation of interdependent utilities with microsociological analyses of players’ strategies.</p>
<p>The relative inactivity in sociological theory with respect to the concept of expectations, a prime candidate for a correlation device in the game of theorizing, is stupefying. The divide in sociological theory between those concerned with questions of rationality and effectiveness in social and economic action on the one hand, and those concerned with culture, meaning and sensemaking on the other, clearly is an obstacle ill-afforded in the effort of investigating social interaction both in its impressive everyday stability and effectiveness and in its impact on individual and collective welfare.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Game theory has sometimes been characterized as providing ‘explanations in search of observations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2011</xref>). The present paper has argued that microsociological investigations of everyday interaction offer observations that are in many ways congenial to Schelling’s game-theoretical understanding of coordination games. Both perspectives converge in the understanding that everyday interaction is grounded in the tacit coordination of expectations. Whereas game theory focuses on the interdependence of utilities in coordination among participants and offers an understanding of the range of inequalities potentially associated with maintaining expectations, microsociology offers a variety of findings with respect to how participants actually master coordination problems in everyday interaction. More particularly, works by Goffman, Garfinkel, Sacks, Schutz and Simmel unanimously indicate the standing of distinct principles of affirmation that participants use in regulating conduct in line with the maintenance of expectations. Microsociologists therefore have been providing empirical intelligence about the relationship between expectations and actual conduct among participants, effectively complementing the game-theoretical understanding of interdependent utilities. In order to understand more comprehensively how tacit expectations and overt moves interrelate in the ongoing coordination of activities, and how more complex forms of coordination through signalling and framing are embedded in tacit coordination, a closer integration of game-theoretical and microsociological reasoning and empirical intelligence is desirable.</p>
<p>In its brief exploration of participants’ interdependent realization of benefits from coordinating expectations, the present investigation has also indicated distinct welfare aspects of everyday interaction. Most generally, coordination equilibrium in everyday interaction does not preclude the persistence of unequal benefits among participants. Rather, the effective coordination of expectations may lock participants in individually or collectively inefficient solutions and inequalities that are tacitly endured as, for example, in a ‘battle of the sexes’ dating scenario. Following principles of affirmation also makes participants more likely to make risky or exploitive commitments. If participants, on the other hand, are unable or unwilling to coordinate tacitly, this may lead them to exit an encounter. Such failure of tacit coordination in everyday interaction may eventually cause segregation within a collective of potential participants. Therefore, tradeoffs may exist not only between the individual and collective risks and benefits of tacit coordination in everyday interaction, but also between the stability of everyday interaction and the differentiation of preferences afforded by the collective. Such tradeoffs concern questions of integration, efficiency and solidarity with a long-standing, although mostly macro-analytical, sociological lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043463113492307">Durkheim, 1964</xref>). The present discussion has attempted to illustrate the analytical leverage gained by drawing on both game-theoretical and microsociological resources in addressing these questions, and, more generally, by seeking a broader conceptual and empirical footing for future work on the microfoundations of sociological inquiry.</p>

<p>Arguably, the payoffs in the latter case of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will be lower than in the case of the pure-strategy coordination equilibria, and both players will be better off coordinating their moves in a ‘battle of the sexes’ scenario than by acting out on a calculation of the most rational variation of moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043463113492307">Gintis, 2009b</xref>: 46–48).

<p>The stag hunt matrix, placed in a more contemporary context, can also be considered as describing a work-shirk game with working standing in for the stag solution and shirking for the hare equilibrium. The problem of a potentially risk-dominant choice of equilibrium, that is, of participants settling on shirking rather than working, is, of course, identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>: 17–19).</p>

<p>In the stag hunt game the set of equalities defining the pure coordination game need to be slightly adjusted to a &gt; c, b &gt; d, b &gt; f, g &gt; c, g ≥ e, h ≥ d, h &gt; f in order to make both equilibria rewarding in this sense. In most representations of the stag hunt g = e and h = d. Setting g and h higher than e and d, respectively, would give coordinating to hunt hare the edge of a strict (rather than a weak) Nash equilibrium. This could be justified by an additional utility gained from coordination, for example the greater effectiveness of hunting together even if the prey is smaller.</p>

<p>Goffman’s respective comments may easily be read as referring to participants and populations learning to effectively coordinate expectations: ‘How a given set of such understandings comes into being historically, spreads and contracts in geographical distribution over time, and how at any one place and time particular individuals acquire these understandings are good questions, but not ones I can address.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043463113492307">Goffman, 1983</xref>: 5) The present paper can also do little more than indicate the existence of a respective processes, but the issue is clearly associated with an impressive amount of contemporary game-theoretical research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043463113492307">Fudenberg and Levine, 1998</xref>), some of which is directly pertinent to the types of games discussed in this paper (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1043463113492307">Skyrms, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1043463113492307">Sugden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1043463113492307">Young, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>Models of framing abound in social theory. Approaches congenial to the present discussion have been developed in the theory of social action by Siegwart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1043463113492307">Lindenberg (1993)</xref> and Hartmut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043463113492307">Esser (2009)</xref>, and in game theory by the late Michael Bacharach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043463113492307">2006</xref>: 14–24, 53–57). Although these approaches discuss framing in a manner that tends to pay more attention to psychological correlates (e.g. in terms of cognitive schemata), which are not discussed here, they do not generally contradict the understanding of framing as correlated equilibrium suggested by the present paper. Rather, they indicate how this understanding can further be informed by the psychology of choice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1043463113492307">Tversky and Kahneman, 1981</xref>).</p>
