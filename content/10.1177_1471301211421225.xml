<abstract>
<p>This study describes nurses’ experiences of relationships with residents with dementia disease (1) before and after validation method (VM) training and (2) after extensive experience using the VM. An intervention was performed in a nursing home, involving supervision plus one year of training in using the VM. Nurses were interviewed before and after the intervention. Nurses with extensive VM experience, working at another nursing home, were interviewed once. Qualitative content analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed four themes with sub-themes. Most nurses participating in the intervention described a changed approach afterwards, focusing more on residents and on their communications, which in turn seemed to lead to closer, more trusting relationships. A similar approach was described by the nurses with extensive VM experience. One conclusion is that supervised VM training facilitated nurses’ development of communication skills and abilities to establish close relationships with residents. Some nurses described the VM as demanding.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421225" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many complicated situations can occur in everyday care of people with dementia disease (DD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421225">Graneheim, Isaksson, Ljung Persson, &amp; Jansson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421225">Skovdahl, Larsson Kihlgren, &amp; Kihlgren, 2003</xref>). Nurses have a range of skills for dealing with such situations. Studies demonstrate that, with training and supervision, nurses can further enhance their skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421225">Edberg &amp; Hallberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421225">Hansebo &amp; Kihlgren, 2001</xref>). Communication skills training and subsequent practice in creating relationships are crucial when caring for people with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421225">Kihlgren &amp; Hallgren, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421225">Normann, Norberg, &amp; Asplund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421225">Zingmark, Sandman, &amp; Norberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Validation method (VM) training is provided to help nurses develop communication skills in their interactions with people with DD, by accepting these people’s experiences of reality and by confirming their feelings with the use of various verbal and non-verbal communication approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421225">Feil, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The method focuses on the emotional content of what the people with DD are expressing. The VM is intended for use in both one-to-one conversations and group conversations with disoriented people around the age of 80 with DD and no medical history of psychiatric illness or alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421225">Feil, 1992</xref>). VM training is extensive, and takes about one year.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to evaluate the VM, primarily in quantitative studies. A Cochrane review reported insufficient scientific evidence for the efficacy of VM among people with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421225">Neal &amp; Briggs, 2003</xref>). Studies conducted after this review revealed no statistically significant results in favour of the VM regarding cognition, behaviour and emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421225">Deponte &amp; Missan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421225">Schrijnemaekers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421225">Tondi, Ribani, Bottazzi, Viscomi, &amp; Vulcano, 2007</xref>). A study of the effects of emotion-oriented care, including the VM, showed positive effects for people with mild-to-moderate DD in terms of maintaining emotional balance and preserving positive self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421225">Finnema et al., 2005</xref>). This study also showed that nurses who applied emotion-oriented care skills more frequently demonstrated fewer stress reactions than nurses who infrequently used emotion-oriented care skills. This study, however, did not demonstrate any influence specific to the VM.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence regarding VM efficacy. There are a number of possible reasons for this, for example:
<list id="list1-1471301211421225" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The VM is not efficient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The studies have shortcomings; for example, the training programs were not clearly described, and varied in content and duration.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The above mentioned studies mostly focused on residents with DD, and mostly implemented quantitative designs. However, a qualitative design is necessary if we are to gain knowledge about people’s experiences. Therefore, this study uses a qualitative design to study nurses’ experiences of caring relationships when using the VM in one-to-one conversations with residents. It is also important to study what happens over time when nurses have gained extensive experience of using the VM, and so the study also included nurses who had used the VM for a longer period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421225"><title>Aims</title>
<p>The aims of the present study were (1) to elucidate nurses’ experiences of communication and relationships with residents with DD before and after VM training, and (2) to compare their experiences with those of nurses who had extensive experience in using the VM.</p>
<p>The study was part of an intervention project, a VM training program, which was implemented in one nursing home in a large Swedish city: nursing home A (N-HA, group 1). In this intervention project it was assumed that the VM facilitates communication with residents with DD. The comparison group consisted of nurses at nursing home B (N-HB), who had extensive VM experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421225"><title>Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention was implemented for about one year (2005–2006), and consisted of theoretical and practical VM training led by a certified supervisor as per the guidelines of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421225">Validation Training Institute (2011)</xref>. Nurses received 10 days of theoretical training with supervision, spaced over one year, and practical VM training for at least six months between lesson blocks. Documentation of practice and passing a written test led to VM certification.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421225"><title>Content of VM training</title>
<p>Ten VM training sessions in one-to-one conversations were held once a month, and included:
<list id="list2-1471301211421225" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Information about the VM, normal ageing, and dementia diseases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exercises used in the VM (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1471301211421225">Appendix 1</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Immediately after the second training session, the nurses began to practise the VM between sessions. As per the supervisor’s instructions, each nurse chose three residents for the practice, documented their life stories, created a plan for using the VM, practised the VM in conversations two to three times a week, and made notes (reflections) on these conversations.</p>
<p>The practical training also included a video recording of one conversation with the same resident once a month. Nurses were supervised during the monthly training sessions by the certified supervisor. The supervisor and nurses watched the videos and read the notes that had been made since the last training session, and the nurses then received feedback on these.</p>
<p>Early in the training year, the nurses practised the VM weekly with the selected residents. After the nurses gained more experience, they also applied the VM in their daily work with residents other than those participating in the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421225"><title>Study settings</title>
<p>At N-HA, nurses from three traditional nursing home wards participated; 24–27 residents lived in each ward, divided into three groups per ward. Nurses worked in care teams, with each nurse acting as the contact person for one or two residents. At N-HB, nurses from one ward (26 residents) and one day-care unit (10 visitors/day) participated; these nurses had used the VM for several years. The N-HB ward had the same organization as the wards at N-HA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421225" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Managers informed nurses at N-HA and N-HB about the project. Interested nurses at N-HA contacted their managers, and the first author then contacted these N-HA nurses. The interviewer contacted N-HB nurses who agreed to be interviewed.</p>
<p><bold>Note</bold>: In this article, the study participants are referred to as ‘nurses’ regardless of whether they were registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), or nurses’ aides (NAs).</p>
<p>At N-HA, 14 nurses were involved with the VM training program (one RN, seven LPNs and six NAs; all female). Initially, 11 nurses joined the program, but two dropped out due to sick leave and change of employment. Three additional nurses who indicated interest joined the program just after its start, and so 12 nurses completed the entire VM training program. Nine of these had had some DD training previously. Three of the 12 participants did not have Swedish as their native language.</p>
<p>At N-HB, nine nurses participated in the study (six LPNs and three NAs; all female), four from the ward and five from the day-care unit. Seven of the nurses had been trained using the same VM program used in the intervention project, and had a median of 10 years’ (range 1–11 years) experience in using the VM. The other two nurses had taken an introductory VM course and had some experience in using the VM. Data on nurses from N-HA and N-HB are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421225">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Residents with DD from N-HA (<italic>n</italic> = 29; 23 female, six male) were indirectly involved due to their nurses’ practice of the VM. Their median age was 88 (range 77–94). The residents were assessed using the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421225">Hansebo, Kihlgren, Ljunggren, &amp; Winblad, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421225">Morris et al<italic>.</italic>, 1990</xref>) and the MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421225">Hawes et al., 1995</xref>). As per the CPS, 83% had severe to very severe DD. During the intervention, four residents died, and one resident did not respond to the VM and so the nurse stopped using it. Under the guidance of instructions from the certified supervisor, the nurses chose residents who were well known to them.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421225"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Of the 14 nurses at NH-A, nine were interviewed before and after the training program, two only before (due to dropout) and three only after the program (due to joining the program after its initial launch). The nine nurses at NH-B were interviewed once each. All interviews were recorded in undisturbed, quiet rooms at the nursing homes.</p>
<p>During these interviews, all the nurses narrated their experiences of caring for residents and gave examples of caring situations, covering communication disabilities, complex caring situations, and daily life in a nursing home. In the post-intervention interviews, the nurses from N-HA also spoke about their experiences of using VM. The nurses from N-BH, who were interviewed only once, narrated their experiences of using VM in their one-off interviews.</p>
<p>Interviews at N-HA were conducted by the first author, and those at N-HB by a lecturer with an MSc. A professional secretary transcribed the interviews verbatim. Some interviews contained long narrative parts, and others contained mostly answers to questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421225"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Qualitative content analysis was used to capture the nurses’ subjective experiences from the interviews. Content analysis strives to identify core meanings and themes in qualitative data. The analysis begins with descriptions that are close to the text and are subsequently interpreted into themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421225">Patton, 2002</xref>). The first author listened to all tapes and read the transcribed interviews several times to gain insight into what the nurses were talking about. The analysis then continued with these steps:
<list id="list3-1471301211421225" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>– The text was divided into meaning units as per the study’s aim.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Meaning units were condensed and assigned codes that were close to the text.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Codes were compared and grouped according to similarities and differences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– Interviews from before and after the intervention were analysed separately up to this step and thereafter compared.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The text within grouped codes from interviews before and after the intervention was compared according to similarities and differences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– From the pattern of grouped codes, sub-themes were formulated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>– The sub-themes were compared, and the themes were formulated.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The analytical steps were the same for interviews from N-HB, up to comparing and grouping codes. Thereafter, text within the grouped codes was compared with the formulated sub-themes and themes from N-HA. Because the comparison showed that there were close similarities, the sub-themes and themes were retained. The third author performed co-assessment during all steps in the analysis. After discussion, the authors reached agreement about the most reasonable codes, sub-themes and themes. A comparison was made between the findings from N-HA and N-HB. As the experienced nurses from N-HB described similar experiences to those of the nurses participating in the intervention, it is reasonable to assume that they were talking about the same thing. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211421225">Table 2</xref> gives some illustrative examples from the process of data analysis.

<sec id="sec9-1471301211421225"><title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>All participants were informed of their right to discontinue participation at any time without giving any reason, and were guaranteed confidentiality. Nurses and the next-of-kin of the residents with DD received oral and written information and were given the opportunity to raise questions about the research. The next-of-kin signed an informed consent form. Permission from residents was obtained each time nurses practised the VM. Nurses were instructed to stop if the residents showed signs of being uncomfortable; however, no such incidents occurred. The regional research ethics committee (no. 04-704/5) approved the research.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421225" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Most nurses described advantages of using the VM, and some also described disadvantages. The advantages included improved relationships with residents, which had a positive influence on the working environment. Most nurses described that the focus of care had changed from an interaction based around daily activities to a relationship that focused on the residents’ personal needs. Regarding disadvantages, some nurses reported that the VM did not suit all residents; some also criticized the VM training program, as described below.</p>
<p>The intervention seemed to have given N-HA nurses a richer language to express their experiences, because the second set of interviews were longer and richer in content. Nurses from N-HB had the richest descriptions and most nuanced ways of describing communication and relationships. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1471301211421225">Table 3</xref> presents example comments from nurses at each nursing home. Nurses indicated that the program was concrete and that it contained clear instructions for how to help residents express and confirm their feelings, and how to support them. They expressed the wish that everyone caring for residents with DD would have an opportunity to learn the VM.

<p>Nurses at N-HA said that the training program period was too long, and that it was stressful to work in parallel with the program. The most stressful aspect was the lack of time for practising the VM and for making notes (reflection). Information about the training program was unclear, so the nurses did not always understand what was expected of them. Time-consuming practical issues complicated a smooth program launch. Nurses reported that the residents whom they selected for practical training were those who they thought would benefit most from the VM. Later, some nurses realized that they should have selected other residents. Some nurses expressed doubts over whether their colleagues would want to go through the training program, due to the laborious experiences of the participating nurses.</p>
<p>The analysis resulted in four themes with sub-themes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1471301211421225">Table 4</xref>). The themes and sub-themes were mainly based on nurses’ experiences from using the VM. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1471301211421225">Tables 5</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1471301211421225"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1471301211421225"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-1471301211421225">13</xref> display quotations that illustrate themes and sub-themes which were interwoven with each other; that is, they were not mutually exclusive.

<p>When nurses changed their approach from focusing on daily activities to focusing on the individual needs of residents with DD, their relationships became deeper and closer, and the well-being of the residents appeared to increase.

<sec id="sec12-1471301211421225"><title>Having sufficient personal qualifications</title>
<p>Nurses from both nursing homes described the VM as an approach (primarily) and as a communication method (secondarily). They emphasized that approaches and methods could not be used separately and that they were not suitable for all nurses.</p>
<p>The nurses described these requisite personal characteristics: maturity and patience, and these requisite abilities: listening, becoming close to another person, using touch, and putting one’s needs aside. They described the VM as emotionally demanding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1471301211421225">Table 5</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421225"><title>Focusing on the resident as a person, here and now</title>
<p>Before the VM training program, the N-HA nurses described difficulties in communicating with residents. They also said that the complex caring situations in which they worked sometimes left them no choice other than to walk away from the resident.</p>
<p>After the program, nurses said that they had changed their approach to focus on the residents here and now. With this approach it seemed as though the residents felt that the nurses were there <italic>just for them</italic> at that moment, for example, by deliberately using touch. Being present and staying in the moment made residents feel calmer – saving time in the long run and making nurses’ working days less stressful.</p>
<p>Nurses from N-HB said the same thing but were more explicit in their descriptions of the importance of recognizing and internalizing the residents’ feelings and believing in and confirming what was expressed in the situation <italic>without</italic> pretending or lying. This approach seemed to make residents with DD feel more secure and also to stimulate them to be more present in participating in what was happening around them (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1471301211421225">Table 6</xref>).

<p>Before the VM training program, the nurses said that they initiated and led most of the conversations that occurred during daily care, and that most of these conversations were task-oriented.</p>
<p>After the program, nurses said that they had changed their communication strategies in the direction of being a supportive, attentive listener, and trying to follow residents’ conversations by repeating phrases and asking questions. The nurses verbalized the feelings they recognized in conversations with the residents to confirm what they were saying, thus demonstrating respect and empathy. This seemed to affect the content of the communication. The nurses described how they gained confidence from the residents and were surprised that they could communicate ‘at a deeper level’.</p>
<p>Nurses from N-HB had the most explicit descriptions of the importance of being a supportive, attentive listener. They described themselves as facilitators who helped residents avoid fragmentation when connecting various parts of their life stories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1471301211421225">Table 7</xref>).

<sec id="sec16-1471301211421225"><title>Seeing the person beyond the disease</title>
<p>Before the VM training program, the nurses focused on residents’ DD-related disabilities, and described them as demanding and lacking interest in doing things. Few nurses said they knew a resident’s background and life story.</p>
<p>After the program, when nurses focused on the here and now, the person beyond the disease became visible to them. The nurses described how some residents started talking about life events as if they were happening in the present, so the nurses needed to know their life stories to understand. Some of the situations and life events spoken about by the residents were unknown both to nurses and to the residents’ families, for example because they occurred in childhood.</p>
<p>Nurses from N-HB described similar experiences, but emphasized that it was not always necessary to know what the residents were talking about. Instead, they could confirm the residents’ feelings by being <italic>truly</italic> present and by responding to the expressed feelings. Other important issues were letting residents continue to carry out their social roles in daily life, and asking questions to facilitate dialogue, even if they already knew the answers to these questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1471301211421225">Table 8</xref>).

<sec id="sec17-1471301211421225"><title>Tuning in to the resident’s emotions</title>
<p>Before the VM training program, the nurses described difficulties in helping and calming residents during somewhat complex caring situations that sometimes involved aggressive behaviour. This could occasionally result in the resident being left alone. Here, nurses felt powerless and frightened.</p>
<p>After the program, the nurses thought and acted differently. Instead of trying to calm an agitated resident, the nurses stayed with the resident, asked questions, reflected, and confirmed the feelings expressed by the resident, and thus reached some kind of understanding. It seemed as though use of the VM had softened the relationships between residents and nurses, making it easier for the nurses to manage difficult care situations that had previously frightened them.</p>
<p>Nurses from N-HB provided similar descriptions and emphasized the importance of empathizing – of understanding residents’ feelings and demonstrating that their feelings are important. These nurses pointed out that using the VM did not entirely stop behavioural symptoms, but when these symptoms did continue they were less intense (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1471301211421225">Table 9</xref>).

<p>Neither N-HA nor N-HB nurses could describe risks from using the VM if it was used in the way they had learned in the training program.

<p>The VM did not work all the time, and it took time before the nurses could see responses from the residents. Early in the training program, it was difficult for nurses to vary and adapt the VM, and for some residents only singing or using touch worked. Difficulties arose for residents with hearing impairment. Vocal communication methods, such as pitch, could not be used because nurses could not make themselves heard without coming close to the resident. This created difficulties for residents who did not understand the reason for the closeness.</p>
<p>Nurses from N-HB described a constant search for ways to understand and get through to the residents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-1471301211421225">Table 13</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec24-1471301211421225" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed (1) to elucidate nurses’ experiences of communication and relationships with residents with DD before and after VM training and (2) to compare their experiences with those of nurses who had extensive experience in using the VM.</p>
<p>Qualitative content analysis of transcribed interviews resulted in four themes:
<list id="list8-1471301211421225" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Being attentively present in the relationship</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Putting oneself into the resident’s world</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Creating a trusting atmosphere by trusting the resident and trusting one’s own abilities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Difficulties using the VM in the care of residents with DD</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A major strength in this study was the training program with theoretical <italic>and</italic> practical training and supervision. The nurses had to transform theoretical knowledge into a caring intervention, and were given the opportunity to reflect on their caring approach when watching videos.</p>
<p>Nurses’ reflections about their own caring approach are a form of stimulated recall; according to other researchers, this helps to obtain insight, facilitates understanding and develops skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421225">Hansebo &amp; Kihlgren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421225">Skovdahl, Larsson Kihlgren, &amp; Kihlgren, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume from the nurses’ narratives that they had improved in terms of their approach and skills in everyday care situations with the residents. However, it is not possible to know from this study how the nurses actually acted in these everyday care situations; this would have to be further studied with observations.</p>
<p>Before learning the VM, the nurses reported shortcomings in their relationships with residents with DD. Communication ability is an essential part of establishing relationships, and relationship-building with residents who have difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication is more demanding for the nurses. Communication skills have been valued as a key competence in care of residents with DD, and are of importance for the well-being of both residents and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421225">Ward, Vass, Aggarwal, Garfield, &amp; Cybyk, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>After VM training, the nurses used the following approaches for communication: listening attentively, following topics initiated by the resident, adjusting to the resident, sharing situations regardless of time, space or person, and sharing an affective state. It is important to emphasize that similar results have been demonstrated with intervention programs other than VM training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421225">Eggers, Norberg, &amp; Ekman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421225">Häggström, Jansson &amp; Norberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421225">Normann, Henriksen, Norberg &amp; Asplund, 2005</xref>). It is not possible to just learn a method and expect it to work; VM is an approach that requires personal qualifications. To be able to listen attentively and be truly present in relationships, nurses must put the person first. This may be considered something that should be a matter of course; but, as the nurses in the present study expressed, not all nurses have this ability. This is an important aspect in care of residents with DD, because the nurses’ attentiveness in relationships can counteract the residents’ fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421225">Eggers et al., 2005</xref>) and promote lucidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421225">Normann et al., 2005</xref>). Personal and professional maturity has been described as a requirement for being able to enact presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421225">Finfgeld-Connett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, nurses said that adjusting to a resident’s way of communicating and sharing situations had a positive influence on their relationships. The results showed that, before using the VM, nurses and residents seemed to talk over each other’s heads. The nurses were more focused on problems of being understood, in order to complete their daily tasks, than on understanding the residents’ communicated needs. In other words, the nurses were not totally present for the residents when they were trying to express themselves verbally or non-verbally.</p>
<p>The nurses used <italic>affect attunement</italic>, particularly in difficult-to-manage care situations. They reflected on residents’ feelings by sharing an affective state with them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421225">Häggström et al. (1998)</xref> demonstrated that skilled nurses used affect attunement as a way to understand people. One assumption in the VM is that there is a cause for a person’s behaviour, which is then expressed in that behaviour; others have reported a similar assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421225">Graneheim, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The nurses were surprised at the response they received from residents when using the VM. It is possible that they had preconceived ideas about the residents’ communication abilities, which might have hindered true personal encounters. When using the VM, nurses were more open-minded and trusting, and providing care was less stressful. It seemed that the nurses and the residents developed mutual trust in relationships. The nurses were confirmed in being able to help residents with DD, which is a significant experience for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421225">Westin &amp; Danielson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite initial scepticism and what some nurses called a demanding training program, nurses at both N-HA and N-HB talked about advantages of the VM training program, such as its concreteness. Although some N-HA nurses did mention some disadvantages, these might have been related to limited experience with the VM; while nurses at N-HB had internalized the VM, nurses at N-HA might not yet have progressed from learning the VM to integrating it into their work routines. The nurses at N-HB stressed that using the VM did not solve all difficulties in the care of residents with DD.</p>
<sec id="sec25-1471301211421225"><title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>This study was limited to two nursing homes in a big city in Sweden. All N-HA nurses were invited to a meeting in which the VM and the study were presented. It is, however, possible that the participants were those most interested in the VM, which may have influenced the results. The authors had no influence on the selection of the participants or the implementation of the intervention. Nurses selected the residents who were involved in the practical training. It is impossible to know whether the results would have been different if other nurses and other residents in other stages of DD had been involved. An interview guide was used to ensure that both interviewers covered all areas of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421225">Patton, 2002</xref>). The interviews varied in richness and length; several factors might explain this variation. Nurses were not familiar with the interviewer, not used to reflecting on their work, and uncertain of what was expected of them. Some nurses did not have Swedish as their native language and seemed to have difficulties expressing themselves.</p>
<p>To assure credibility of the analysis, one of the authors read interviews from the three occasions, and all authors participated in co-assessment of the codes, sub-themes and main themes. The steps of the analysis were described in detail, and quotations from interviews were presented to clarify the results and to show that the analysis was reasonable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421225">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2002</xref>). Discussion took place between the authors to ensure the most reasonable agreement. The comparison between the findings from N-HA and N-HB revealed close similarities between the nursing homes.</p>
<p>The nurses’ descriptions, the context, the intervention, the data collection and the analysis all support the issue of transferability and applicability to other settings. This study provides knowledge only about how nurses described their experiences of relationships with residents when using the VM. Studies with an observational design are needed in order to investigate how nurses actually act in everyday caring situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1471301211421225"><title>Conclusion and relevance to clinical practice</title>
<p>The nurses in the present study said that VM training and supervision developed their ability to communicate and establish close relationships with residents with DD. From the nurses’ descriptions, it seemed that using the VM could facilitate daily life in the nursing home. The nurses said that the improved communication and closer relationships made it easier for them to manage the difficult situations that can occur when caring for residents with DD. These conclusions need to be further studied using an observational design.</p>
