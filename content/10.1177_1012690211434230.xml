<abstract>
<p>We content analyzed more than 11 years of <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic> (SI) covers (2000–2011) to assess how often females were portrayed, the sports represented, and the manner of their portrayal. Despite females’ increased participation in sport since the enactment of Title IX and calls for greater media coverage of female athletes, women appeared on just 4.9 percent of covers. The percentage of covers did not change significantly over the span and were comparable to levels reported for the 1980s by other researchers. Indeed, women were depicted on a higher percentage of covers from 1954–1965 than from 2000–2011. Beyond the limited number of covers, women’s participation in sport was often minimized by sharing covers with male counterparts, featuring anonymous women not related directly to sports participation, sexually objectifying female athletes, and promoting women in more socially acceptable gender-neutral or feminine sports.</p>

<body>
<p>The media is a powerful purveyor of messages about culture and gender ideology. This is true of the sports media, which sends mixed messages to females about sport participation. On one hand, sport is viewed as a means of achieving health and fitness, personal empowerment, and movement toward equality among the sexes. Yet females are not socialized as strongly into sport as their male counterparts, and strides they make within the sports world are often minimized, for example, considered less important than physical beauty or sexual worth. Socialization into sex roles is shaped, in part, via a lifetime of interactions with the media; thus, media portrayals are instrumental in helping females determine their place in society – and sport. Despite increased sports participation in recent decades, women occupy a marginal place in media coverage of sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211434230">Bernstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211434230">Bishop, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211434230">Fink and Kensicki, 2002</xref>). This blatant example of symbolic annihilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211434230">Tuchman, 1978</xref>) trivializes women’s sports and devalues participants by their omission and the manner in which they are portrayed. The media sends potent messages of what it deems culturally important via what it chooses to omit and include. Through such careful regulation, the media influences how society ‘perceive[s] movements about gender and gender itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211434230">Wood, 2010</xref>: 259). The sports media, then, can reinforce deep-rooted ideologies and stereotypes, but also has the potential to resist sex-role stereotyping by promoting female athletes as talented performers worthy of respect and emulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211434230">Fink and Kensicki, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>What role the media should play with respect to ‘responsible’ portrayals of females continues to be debated, but any discussion of <italic>how</italic> women are portrayed must also consider <italic>how often</italic> women are portrayed. There is emerging evidence that coverage of female athletes may be slipping from already thin levels. Televised sports coverage of females has dropped since 2004, and coverage in 2009 dipped to its lowest level in at least 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211434230">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>). Specifically, women’s sports garnered only 1.6 percent of time on the three major networks and 1.4 percent on ESPN’s <italic>SportsCenter</italic> in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211434230">Messner and Cooky, 2010</xref>). Even when female athletes are featured, limiting and dangerous stereotypes tend to prevail, for example, the emphasis of physical beauty over performance, sexual objectification, women as more fragile and domestically oriented, and that there are ‘inappropriate’ sports for females to play. When females venture into gender neutral or traditionally masculine areas, the sports media often compares them against male counterparts, rather than treating females for their own performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211434230">Jones et al., 1999</xref>). University of Connecticut women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma argued that media attention surrounding his 2010–2011 team’s historic winning streak stemmed from the fact that they were chasing a <italic>men’s</italic> basketball record, that of the UCLA team from 1971 to 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211434230"><italic>Associated Press</italic>, 2010</xref>). Thus, the sports media continues to situate women’s participation within a sports system constructed and controlled by males.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211434230">Hardin et al. (2005)</xref> found that women’s sports magazines launched in the mid-to-late 1990s reflected the growth in women’s sports, especially after the 1996 Olympics, a watershed achievement for women in sport. However, they often folded due to lack of interest or funding; <italic>Women/Sport</italic> was launched by <italic>SI</italic> in 1997 but ended after only four issues, and <italic>SI for Women</italic> was discontinued in 2002 after only 20 months. <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic> offers a litmus test regarding whether media coverage of female athletes has improved over time. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211434230">Salwen and Wood (1994)</xref> found that 1.3 percent of a sample of covers from the 1960s and 1970s contained one or more female athletes, while 5.1 percent did so from 1987 to 1989. Looking at the percentages of articles and pages about women in <italic>SI</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211434230">Reid and Soley (1979)</xref> found no significant change from 1956 to 1976. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211434230">Bishop (2003)</xref> noted an ephemeral uptick in articles and pages devoted to female athletes in the early 1990s, but the broader pattern from 1980 to 1996 evinced a paucity of coverage similar to that reported by Reid and Soley. Bishop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211434230">2003</xref>: 192) concluded that ‘<italic>SI</italic> does not yet reflect the growing popularity of women’s sports.’ Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211434230">Fink and Kensicki (2002)</xref> did not find greater female representation in <italic>SI</italic> articles and photographs for the three-year period after the 1996 Olympics.</p>
<p>We are not aware of published studies that have examined <italic>SI</italic> content after 1999, and especially with a focus on covers. We update and extend earlier analyses of <italic>SI</italic> to assess if women have made strides toward greater representation on covers in the 21st century. As <italic>SI for Women</italic> was discontinued in 2002, it would be interesting to see if <italic>SI</italic>’s flagship publication increased its coverage of women over the remainder of the decade.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1012690211434230">
<title>Data source</title>
<p><italic>SI</italic> is one of the most popular sports magazines, read weekly by nearly 21 million adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211434230"><italic>SI</italic> Media Kit, 2011</xref>) and with a circulation of 3.2 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211434230">Audit Bureau of Circulations, 2011</xref>). Nearly 8 in 10 (77%) subscribers are men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211434230">Echo Media, 2011</xref>). We analyzed 716 <italic>SI</italic> covers from January 2000 through June 2011 (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/home/index.htm">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/home/index.htm</ext-link>) because they provide a spotlight on timely and central matters, are designed to entice casual readers at the newsstand, and should provide a first – and perhaps lasting – impression of their content. The annual swimsuit issue was excluded, as its focus is not on sport performance per se. We also analyzed the first 12 years of <italic>SI</italic> covers (1954–1965) and juxtaposed findings with those after 2000.</p>

<sec id="section4-1012690211434230">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We totaled the number of covers depicting females and derived a percentage for each year. We used a two-way chi-square test to assess whether the frequency of women on covers changed significantly over the period. We also tallied the sports represented to gauge the diversity of the portrayals. Much has been written about the perceived appropriateness of particular sports for women and men, or sex-role typing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211434230">Koivula, 2001</xref>). Following Koivula, we categorized the sport for each female athlete into one of the following: a) feminine sport, b) masculine sport, or c) gender-neutral sport.</p>

<p>From 2000 through June 2011, there were 716 opportunities to depict a figure (or figures) from the sports world on the cover of <italic>SI</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211434230">1</xref></sup> Women appeared on only 4.9 percent of covers, a representation similar to that found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211434230">Salwen and Wood (1994)</xref> from 1987 to 1989. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211434230">Table 1</xref> depicts how the 35 covers including women were distributed over the span.

<title>Manner of portrayal</title>
<p>Although the limited number of depictions on <italic>SI</italic> covers serves to minimize women’s sports, the manner in which females are portrayed may further trivialize their participation. This is done by limiting the number of covers in which they appear as the primary or sole image, placing them in comparable poses with a male so they share the ‘spotlight’, visually minimizing them by including an ‘inset’ or smaller image of the female or including them as part of a collage background, promoting more socially acceptable gender-neutral sports or feminine over masculine ones, sexually objectifying women, or using anonymous women (only connected to sports as a fan or family member of a male athlete) on the cover.</p>
<p>Of the 35 covers including a female, only 18 (or 2.5% of all covers) featured a female as the primary or sole image. Three covers included females but only as ‘insets’ (small boxed image) or as part of a collage background of both male and female athletes, and another three covers featured anonymous women only connected to sports as a fan or family member of a male athlete. An additional 11 covers featured a female in a comparable pose with a man, and nine of these represented basketball, considered a gender-neutral sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211434230">Koivula, 2001</xref>). In fact, the most commonly represented sports were gender-neutral and appeared on 25 covers: basketball (14 covers), tennis (five), skiing (three), swimming (two) and track/field (one). Three feminine sports (cheerleading, figure skating, and softball) were featured on four covers, and masculine sports (soccer and auto racing) were featured on three covers, one with Mia Hamm and two with Danica Patrick, both of whom are considered attractive <italic>and</italic> feminine and likely chosen for those reasons.</p>
<p>Most of the covers included an athlete in sports apparel posing for the camera or actively participating in their sport, but the three covers that did not are blatant examples of sexual objectification. First is the 5 June 2000 cover of Anna Kournikova, lounging on a pillow in her street clothes, peering seductively into the camera, and clearly not prepared for any sanctioned sports activity. Even the author of the interior story suggested she was not on the cover for her athleticism: ‘She won’t win the French Open, but who cares? Anna Kournikova is living proof that even in this age of supposed enlightenment, a hot body can count just as much as a good backhand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211434230">Deford, 2000</xref>: 95).</p>
<p>The second cover (11 July 2005) featured 2004 Olympic softball team member Jennie Finch, holding a ball and bat, but not dressed for softball. Instead, she wore a tank top and mini skirt which revealed part of her provocatively positioned hip on which her hand rested. Finally, the third cover (8 February 2010) depicted Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn in appropriate sports attire and with skiing equipment, but smiling at the camera and placed in a provocative pose, bent forward on her skis with her backside raised. While a natural position for a skier and similar to the 27 January 1992 cover of male skier, A.J. Kitt, there was one marked distinction: Kitt’s cover was an action shot, taken while he was skiing, whereas Vonn’s cover was clearly posed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Are there really so few notable female figures in the sports world to feature? Our findings differ sharply from the early days of <italic>SI</italic> when women were featured more regularly. Much is revealed about the current social milieu if the number of covers reached its zenith almost a half century ago. Of course, it is possible that greater representation and different portrayals might have been found <italic>between</italic> the covers of <italic>SI</italic> over this current period, but we find little evidence of meaningful change on what is tantamount to the face of <italic>SI</italic>, that is, what it presents most prominently – its cover.</p>
<p>We question the practice of so few females on <italic>SI</italic> covers in this ‘age of supposed enlightenment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211434230">Deford, 2000</xref>: 95). It would be instructive to understand <italic>why</italic> certain sports media have been so unresponsive to calls for greater representation of female athletes. Our analysis suggests a continuing pattern of anemic representation of women on the cover of <italic>SI</italic>, a trend that was apparently unaltered by any compensatory coverage after <italic>SI for Women</italic> was discontinued in 2002. Increasing the number of women on covers seems straightforward to remedy, especially since so few covers feature women in the first place. Portrayals of women of color are also affected by the paucity of female athletes; only 11 covers depicted women of color.</p>
<p>The media enjoys a symbiotic relationship with society, influencing ideologies by its language and representations, but it is also influenced by ratings and the level of attention from its audience. Therefore, while <italic>SI</italic> continues to minimize women’s sport participation, society reinforces this by continuing to purchase – and make both popular and profitable – a magazine such as <italic>SI</italic>. For <italic>SI</italic>, then, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!’ However, covers were more than twice as likely to portray women during 1954–1965, an era not known for progressive gender ideologies, but a period in which <italic>SI</italic> featured a wider variety of professional sports, recreational sports, active leisure, and even fashion themes on its covers. In subsequent decades, <italic>SI</italic> covers have both reflected <italic>and</italic> swayed their audience’s interests toward corporate sport, particularly lucrative football, basketball, baseball, and even hockey; female representation on covers dwindled over the period and has remained at low levels for decades. While <italic>SI</italic>’s underrepresentation of women might be said to simply reflect demand from a predominantly male readership for male-dominated sports, sports media also have the power to raise awareness of – and hone appreciation for – women in masculine sports, and sports classed as feminine or gender neutral. A similar phenomenon has occurred with upstart professional women’s leagues, such as soccer and bass tournament fishing. While these organizations may struggle to capture audiences, they often are not provided sufficient – and sustained – media coverage necessary to socialize fans into the sport.</p>
<p>More frequent depictions are one means of promoting women in sport, but the manner of portrayal may be both more important and difficult to change. These images serve as role models for millions of females, who receive the message that athleticism and skill are not enough, but should be supplemented or even replaced by beauty and sexiness. However, following such a prescription may be a risky proposition. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211434230">Harrison and Secarea (2010)</xref> found that when a woman basketball player is portrayed as ‘sexually tawdry’, she is judged by college students to be more feminine, more heterosexual, worthy of greater disapproval, less worthy to pay to see, and, very poignantly, <italic>less athletic</italic>. The sexualization of female athletes also reinforces heterosexism and indirectly suggests that lesbian athletes are less worthy of attention and emulation. Thus, more does not equate with ‘better’ covers.</p>
<p>We concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211434230">Messner and Cooky (2010)</xref> that change is slow because it requires the enactment of simultaneous social forces, for example, greater representation of women in sports organizations and media outlets, as well as fan bases that insist on more quantitative and less sexist media treatment of female athletes. Only then is <italic>SI</italic> likely to fulfill its original goal of being ‘not <italic>a</italic> sports magazine, but <italic>the</italic> sports magazine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211434230">MacCambridge, 1997</xref>: 27); <italic>the</italic> sports magazine would include more females on its covers, show women in more diverse sports, and work diligently to avoid covers which trivialize women’s participation.</p>
