<p>As Hildegard Peplau presciently noted when discussing the advancement of nursing,<disp-quote>
<p>As the 21st century approaches, further progress will be recorded and reported in Cyberspace—the Internet being one conduit for that. Linking nurses and their information and knowledge across borders—around the world—will surely advance the profession of nursing much more rapidly in the next century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313484353">Peplau, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This column will discuss the growing use of online conduits for communication within APNA and will describe the briefing paper as a communication strategy to focus attention and coordinate action on issues that are important to our membership.</p>
<p>Many of us choose to be psychiatric-mental health nurses because we find fulfillment in what Peplau identified as an interpersonal process based on communication. The sense of connection we experience during one-on-one dialogue with a patient, student, or colleague is often what nurtures us throughout the inevitable ups and downs in our careers. Those moments of meaningful life-to-life communication that provide “compassion satisfaction” are a powerful antidote to the “compassion fatigue” that nurses can experience from our continuous efforts to offer care when intimately exposed to human suffering.</p>
<p>Written exchanges don’t provide the same surge of oxytocin as face-to-face contact, and these exchanges may be more prone to misinterpretation because they are stripped of the valuable information provided by tone of voice, body language, and other nonverbal factors. Nevertheless, advantages such as the ability to reach across the globe and to create a lasting record have made written communication more central to our professional lives. Manuscripts have always been central to nursing scholarship and clinical documentation to nursing practice, but newer methods such as e-mail, blogging, tweets, and other forms of social networking are now becoming essential means of communication with our patients and colleagues.</p>
<p>APNA’s Member Bridge is a great example of what Peplau envisioned. Member Bridge could be likened to a heart that circulates communication among our membership, providing us with essential information and collegial support. Daily perusal of the all-purpose discussion forum, as well as periodic analysis to identify leading discussion themes, helps APNA board members keep up with the concerns of our membership and determine priorities. Member Bridge has also been essential to the work of APNA’s various councils, institutes, and communities of interest. Many of these groups’ activities and projects would be impossible without the ability for members across the country (and in some cases the world) to collaborate in these online communities.</p>
<p>As APNA has grown and the number of issues and projects our membership is engaged in has expanded, the Board has instituted the use of briefing papers as a structured means for individuals or groups who are seeking the organization’s response to an issue to initiate dialogue with the Board and other APNA entities. Briefing papers are concise (1-2 page) documents that provide a summary of background information on the topic, make a recommendation or request an action from the Board, and describe any potential downsides to the proposed course of action. The advantages of using briefing papers include the following: (a) writing and circulating the briefing paper builds consensus among the stakeholders, (b) the group making the request can communicate directly to the Board in their own words rather than relying on a Board or staff member to sum up their position, (c) briefing papers provide useful background for the Board and help focus our discussion of the issue, and (d) the information or arguments summarized in the briefing paper often provide direction for whoever is appointed to move the issue forward.</p>
<p>A briefing paper on reducing suicide provides an excellent example of this process. The Continuing Education Subcommittee of APNA’s Education Council developed a briefing paper focused on the need to develop competencies for suicide-specific nursing care for nurse generalists. They provided background information that included a review of research as well as discussion of policies and existing competencies related to assessing and caring for persons at risk of suicide. Their analysis focused on psychiatric inpatients as a population at high risk for suicide and identified key areas in which psychiatric-mental health inpatient nurses could enhance patient safety. Recommendations for action were broad and included the need for research on suicide risk reduction content in nursing educational programs, collaboration with other organizations that have a focus on reducing suicide, and preparation of a white paper that would identify a process for developing and implementing nurse generalist competencies for assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide.</p>
<p>This briefing paper was distributed to the APNA Board in the fall and discussed at the November 2012 board meeting. Since suicidal behavior is clearly a major public health concern on which psychiatric-mental health nursing can have a significant positive impact, the Board agreed that development of competencies for suicide-specific nursing care is an appropriate and timely goal that is consistent with our strategic plan. The Board reviewed the paper’s recommendations, discussed the resources needed to carry them out, and prioritized the development of an APNA white paper on creating and implementing suicide risk assessment and risk reduction competencies for psychiatric-mental health registered nurses in the inpatient setting. This specific charge was then assigned to a task force within the Education Council.</p>
<p>In the future, briefing papers may be circulated to multiple relevant stakeholder groups within APNA for input to inform Board decisions. Projects that grow out of briefing papers will typically be assigned to task forces made up of participants from several councils that have interest and expertise relevant to the topic. At the Council Summit in March, we will be discussing how the Board and the councils can optimize the use of briefing papers to focus attention on key issues, recommend effective actions, and facilitate the formation of task forces to accomplish specific projects such as APNA position papers.</p>
<p>These issue-focused task forces will provide opportunities to engage a broad range of APNA members in time-limited projects that engage their particular passions and use their expertise. Task forces will also provide venues for emerging leaders to develop their leadership and communication capabilities with support and mentoring from long-time APNA contributors. In this way, the value of the specific products developed by the task forces is increased exponentially by the development of APNA’s “hidden treasures” themselves.</p>
<p>As professional offspring of Hildegard Peplau, the “mother of psychiatric nursing,” we should feel great satisfaction as we contemplate APNA’s contributions to advancing the profession of nursing in the 21st century. Just as Peplau’s accomplishments were captured in books and journals, the technology of her time, ours are reported using this era’s dominant technology. I like to think that her spirit is smiling as she reads the record of our progress in cyberspace.</p>
