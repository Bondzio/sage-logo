<abstract>
<p>This article presents an overview of the status of gifted education in Cyprus and argues for the need for a culturally relevant approach. First, the history of education in Cyprus is briefly reviewed. Then, past unsuccessful efforts to provide education for academically advanced students in the public elementary schools are critically examined. This is followed by a discussion of the current interest around the issue. Then, the need for a culturally relevant approach is presented as a solution to the paradox demanding special provisions while resisting the foreign educational practices that were introduced for this purpose. The idea of gifts and talents in the Greek culture is explored, presenting a person-centered philosophy that is compatible with the local social ethos. Finally, the current educational reality is examined against this person-centered belief, including a discussion of the inclusion movement and the barriers to the accommodation of the diversity of students’ abilities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fact that children exhibit diverse abilities and develop at different rates and in various ways is a situation in the public schools that cannot be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353213493535">Borland, 2003</xref>). Still, the way that this situation is perceived, explained, and dealt with is largely determined by the sociocultural context, values, and priorities of each specific culture and country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353213493535">Kincheloe, Steinberg, &amp; Villaverde, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks have been cited as the first to raise the idea of individual differences in ability, referring to Plato’s tale of <italic>Politeia</italic> (<italic>The Republic</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213493535">Gould, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213493535">Ieridou &amp; Zumwalt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353213493535">Passow, Monks, &amp; Heller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353213493535">Tannenbaum, 1993</xref>). Yet, systematic theory and research on the issue of exceptional abilities that gave birth to the construct of giftedness and the field of gifted education has taken place mainly in Western European countries, such as England, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213493535">Davis, Rimm, &amp; Siegle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213493535">Freeman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213493535">Ieridou &amp; Zumwalt, 2013</xref>). As a result, the way the issues of individual differences and giftedness have been approached and the given accumulated knowledge and solutions appear to be interwoven with the dominant Western-European worldview, defined by the values of individualism, capitalism, pragmatism, and materialism.</p>
<p>Greece and Cyprus are two countries in the Eastern part of Europe that share strong cultural and educational bonds; however, a strange silence currently exists over the issues of giftedness and gifted education. Despite the strong belief in the Greek culture about individual abilities and exceptionality that dates back to Ancient Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213493535">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213493535">Ieridou &amp; Zumwalt, 2013</xref>), official inaction characterizes modern times. This inaction may derive partially from culture-specific philosophical beliefs, values, and attitudes that are in conflict with the dominant tenets and practices of the gifted education field and are manifested through the adherence to the mixed-ability classroom. Indicative of this assumption is the acknowledgment of the former Minister of Education of Cyprus of past unsuccessful attempts to experimentally introduce tracking in some classrooms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213493535">Ioannides (2004)</xref> explained that this system failed to be accepted by the social ethos because it was not compatible with the Greek-Cypriot value system, probably referring to the society’s strong resistance to educational categorization and segregation.</p>
<p>It is widely argued that Western culture and thought have been influenced by the Ancient Greeks. Yet, Greek culture has evolved to have a distinctive worldview with beliefs and a value system that differ in many aspects from the Western paradigm. Powerful cultural forces that appear to have shaped the philosophy and approach to education have been the Ancient Greek quest for knowledge, well-rounded development, and excellence; the Greek-Orthodox ideals about the uniqueness and unity of human beings; and the egalitarian ideals of the Enlightenment. By joining the European Union, Western ideals such as human rights have reinforced the cultural interplay that influences the Greek and Greek-Cypriot reality.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the issue of individual differences in abilities and development is perceived and accommodated in ways relevant to the worldview of a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213493535">Ieridou &amp; Zumwalt, 2013</xref>). This essay discusses the need for a culturally relevant approach to gifted education through an overview of the status of gifted education in Cyprus. Past unsuccessful efforts to provide education for advanced students are critically reviewed, along with other issues related to the concept of gifts and talents within the Greek-Cypriot reality. It is difficult to explore or understand any educational issue as an isolated phenomenon. Considering the educational circumstances and the local context and ethos in Cyprus enhances understanding of the long-standing weakness of the system to provide for exceptional abilities, while prescribing future possibilities. Thus, the history of education in Cyprus is briefly reviewed first, highlighting the development of the current educational system through the transitions from the Ottoman to the British rule and, finally, the independence period. This account illustrates how specific sociohistorical conditions promoted uniformity and social coherence rather than differentiation and recognition of individual abilities through the educational system. The struggle between the colonizers and the locals over cultural assimilation led both sides to aim at uniformity. The long-term colonization of the island and the struggle of Cypriots to preserve their national identity and connectedness through education, along with the Greek-Orthodox belief in the uniqueness of human beings as defined by their unity within the society, appear to have shaped distinct ethos of interdependence that strongly resist any form of educational categorization, labeling, or segregation.</p>

<title>A Summary of the History of Education in Cyprus</title>
<p>A brief overview of the development of education in Cyprus, as it was shaped by the distinct sociohistorical, political, and economic situation of the island helps explain the present nature of education and the educational system, the attitudes, values, and expectations that people place on education, as well as the numerous educational traditions that are still alive.</p>
<sec id="section3-0162353213493535">
<title>Cyprus in History</title>
<p>The 9,000 years of Cyprus’s history have been marked by the consequent passage of the island from one conqueror to another—from Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, and Romans in the ancient times, to Lusignans from France, Venetians, Ottomans, and British in modern times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353213493535">Pavlides, 2011b</xref>). Being strategically situated in the far end of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, at the crossroad of three continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, has always made Cyprus enviable loot for other nations that wanted to control the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213493535">Kyrris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353213493535">Pavlides, 2011b</xref>). At the same time, its natural wealth in timber and copper has brought wealth, trade, and welfare to the island, but it has also made the island a target.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, frequent and often harsh efforts of various masters to colonize the people of Cyprus took place. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Cypriots resisted the efforts for cultural assimilation and have struggled to maintain their national and cultural identity, religion, and language that date back to the 13th century B.C. when the Mycenaeans and Achaeans from mainland Greece settled on the island bringing with them the Greek civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213493535">Antoniades, 2011</xref>). During the periods of ancient Greek city-kingdoms, the Hellenistic period of Alexander the Great, and under the Byzantine rule, Cyprus became a flourishing center of the Greek and Orthodox world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213493535">Antoniades, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213493535">Kyrris, 2011</xref>). At the same time, being situated at the meeting point of great civilizations of Europe, Asia, and Africa gave Cyprus the benefit of assimilating various cultural influences and developing a distinct civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213493535">Katsonis &amp; Huber, 1998</xref>), characterized by the predominant Greek and Byzantine elements.</p>

<title>History of Education in Cyprus</title>
<p>In the struggle over cultural assimilation, education has been a powerful weapon for both sides, especially in modern times. Successive masters tried to take control of education in their effort to colonize the people of the island and establish their authority. At the same time, Cypriots relied on education as the only institution that could maintain their national coherence, cultural identity, and free spirit, while strengthening the people’s desire for liberation. In the absence of any political power, the church often became the nation’s leader, systematically supporting education and advocating for the people’s rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Active education has existed in Cyprus since the era of the city-kingdoms of the 13th and 12th century B.C., similar to the ancient Greek model of independent private academies and gymnasiums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213493535">Antoniades, 2011</xref>). Still, an organized educational system was founded during the Ottoman domination and was essentially established during the British domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213493535">Maratheftis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0162353213493535">
<title>Under the Ottoman rule: A decentralized educational system</title>
<p>During the Ottoman domination (1570/71-1878 A.D.), a rudimentary educational system was developed. The Ottoman authorities did not exhibit any interest in the intellectual development of the native Greek community. With the support of the church, the only Greek authority recognized by the Ottomans, and of some local initiative, various private and community schools were founded in all the cities of Cyprus and in many villages. These local schools formed a decentralized educational system that was controlled by local committees and operated based on tuition and funding from the church and various associations of the Hellenic Diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>). Because Cypriots viewed education as a means of national survival, they tried to use curricula, teaching methods, and textbooks that were in use in mainland Greece and hired teachers preferably educated there. Later, the church founded teachers’ colleges in some cities to educate teachers mainly for the primary level. At the primary level, reciprocal and cooperative teaching was very common, where older or advanced students were responsible for teaching younger students in the class with the help of the teacher. Educational resources were limited, while buildings and general educational conditions were highly unsuitable. A large number of students were jostled in overcrowded classrooms, limiting instruction to rote learning. Greek middle schools existed in the main cities but few students were able to attend because of practical or financial reasons.</p>
<p>The elimination of illiteracy was among the first priorities of the church leaders. Still, the widespread miserable conditions of the majority of the population allowed, at best, only for very basic educational skills, often taught by priests, monks, or other minimally educated professionals. During periods of political tension, many schools, including the teachers’ colleges were closed and leaders were prosecuted or executed because they were accused of undermining the Ottoman sovereignty. During these periods, “secret schools” operated during the night at churches, monasteries, or the priests’ homes. Overall, the goal of education during Ottoman domination was to provide at least the minimal educational skills in literacy and arithmetic, but the primary focus was to maintain the language and religion of the people. Highly influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment that they studied in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213493535">Kyrris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>), many church and intellectual leaders of the island set as the utmost educational goal the intellectual emancipation of the people that would pave the way for them to fight for their political liberation and unification with mainland Greece.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162353213493535">
<title>Under the British rule: Gradual transformation into a centralized educational system</title>
<p>The same decentralized educational system was initially sustained when Cyprus was leased from Ottomans to Britain in 1878 A.D., and later became a Crown colony. At first, the British rulers appeared rather indifferent in financially supporting the existing educational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353213493535">Myrianthopoulos, 1946</xref>). However, soon the authorities realized that the existing education was cultivating ideals and attitudes that would undermine the British dominance and thus decided to intervene. While secondary schools maintained relative autonomy by largely avoiding sponsorship from the colonial government, the primary school system was gradually converted into a highly centralized system that was regulated by the British educational authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213493535">Maratheftis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353213493535">Pavlides, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Through a series of educational laws, the authorities gradually took control of elementary education, initiating a long-term war with the local intellectual and church leaders over curricula, textbooks, and teacher education. It soon became obvious that the goals and expectations of education by the colonial government and the Greek-Cypriot community were diametrically opposed or even conflicting. Greek Cypriots envisioned a system that would teach their children the Greek language of their ancestors, history, and religion, transmitting ideals such as national pride and patriotism that would lead to their emancipation. However, the colonial government expected education to maintain the political and social order in the colony by instilling in the locals a colonial identity, destining them to their presupposed subordinate role. Thus, they aimed at supporting and maintaining the largely agricultural and vocational character of the country, while also allowing the development of a loyal middle class that would staff the bureaucratic governmental mechanism.</p>
<p>To primarily serve their political purposes, the British authorities appeared to systematically promote relevant knowledge and regulations, overtly and covertly, initiating a storm of reactions by the local population. Practical subjects, such as carpentry, gardening, and domestic science were introduced in the elementary school curriculum while vocational and technical schools and colleges were established. At the same time, reading textbooks like <italic>The Happy Farmer</italic> substituted for previous Greek textbooks. Educational measures became more harsh and overt after the revolutionary movement in 1931. Colonial authorities closed down the Greek teachers’ colleges, that had been founded by the church and operating since the 19th century. A new teachers’ college was founded under a British principal with English as the main language and a program plan “covering all primary education subjects with a special emphasis in agriculture” (Pantelides, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>, p. 208). English language, as well as history and geography of the world substituted for history and geography of Greece. National Greek celebrations in schools were forbidden and substituted with colonial celebrations such as the Day of the Empire and the King’s birthday. Pictures related to Greek heroes and leaders were replaced by pictures of the Royal family. Any violations of educational regulations led to the closing down of the school and suspension of the teachers. These measures elicited intense protests of the local intellectuals, church leaders, and organized groups who viewed the attempt as a systematic effort to Anglicize the Greek-Cypriot children by distorting their national consciousness and identity. This political and cultural struggle reached its peak with the 1955-1959 liberation fight by the Greeks of Cyprus that led to the declaration of Cyprus as an independent country in 1960.</p>
<p>In the context described above, nurturing individual gifts and talents could not be a priority of either Greek Cypriots or the foreign authorities, as this orientation did not serve their primary goals. Foreign authorities aimed at controlling the native population by allowing the transmission of approved specific knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353213493535">Pavlides, 2011a</xref>) to prepare them for their expected submissive roles. The native population, with minimal resources available, assigned to education the critical role of maintaining the cultural identity of the people and unity of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>), to survive nationally and fight for their liberation. In either case, promotion of uniformity and coherence was more important than the recognition and encouragement of individual differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353213493535">
<title>The period after Cyprus’s independence</title>
<p>In 1960, after centuries of subjugation, the people of Cyprus took the future in their own hands. As expected, education became one of the country’s priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>). According to the constitution, the new state was bicommunal, consisting of the Greek and the Turkish community. Responding to the people’s long-term wishes, the Greek Community Assembly that was responsible for the organization of the Greek-Cypriot education aimed at eliminating any British-colonial remains and aligning it with education in Greece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213493535">Maratheftis, 1992</xref>). However, although colonial elements were eliminated from the curriculum by introducing textbooks and curricula from Greece, or gradually developing new ones in Cyprus, the educational system maintained its highly centralized and bureaucratic character that has remained until the present time.</p>
<p>The years that followed were marked by the impressive advancement of the new country, which was often described as a financial miracle considering the successive misfortunes and obstacles. The main characteristic of education during the period of Cyprus’s independence has been the continuing reforms and innovations aimed at its quantitative expansion and qualitative improvement, while responding to the new demands created by the financial development of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213493535">Maratheftis, 1992</xref>). However, the Turkish invasion of 1974 and the violent division of the island interrupted educational matters, as well as the peaceful and prosperous life in Cyprus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353213493535">Pavlides, 2011a</xref>). The Turkish occupation of the northern part of Cyprus continues to the present day and has defined the direction and the character of education. Once again, the political circumstances of the country have required education to undertake the critical task of preserving the unity of the people, while supporting the social and financial recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 1996</xref>). Thus, again, the sociohistorical conditions have framed the priorities and the goals of Greek-Cypriot education, reflecting the dominant cultural trends. In a country whose political and cultural existence has been traditionally under threat, preserving democracy, homogeneity, and unity have appeared more vital than emphasizing differentiation and diversity.</p>
<p>Maintaining democracy and the national and cultural identity of the people has been, until recently, the first educational priority in Cyprus. However, a major educational reform is currently in process that is shifting educational goals and priorities. This ongoing effort appears to be directed at giving a more global orientation to education. References to national and cultural identities of the former curricula such as the “clear orientation to the idea of a free country, to our Greek identity, and our Christian Orthodox tradition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 1996</xref>, p. 17) have now been replaced by a notion of a citizen of the world possessing “those essential skills needed for the society of the 21st century” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 2010</xref>, pp. 5-6). Time will show how this effort will be enacted, the form it will take, and the level of social acceptance it will receive. Nonetheless, no official policy or provision for developing exceptional abilities appears within this massive educational reform, with the exception of pilot music and athletic middle schools on a personal interest basis, though without a wider framework of gifted education.</p>

<title>Providing for Academically Advanced Students in Public Schools</title>
<p>The preceding review of the history of education in Cyprus provides the context to better understand the efforts to provide for academically advanced students in public schools. Due to the lack of official documentation of these attempts or related literature and research, this issue is explored relying largely on personal communications with key educational officials, educators, and professionals, as the primary sources of information.</p>
<sec id="section9-0162353213493535">
<title>The Issue of Academically Advanced Students Arises</title>
<p>In the 2nd year of Cyprus’s independence, the issue of academically advanced students who appeared to be largely underserved within the system was raised. In his report for the year 1961-1962, Klitos Georgiades, the Head of the Office of Education (the former Ministry of Education), brought up the issue within the broader discussion of effective teaching and learning.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The problem receives today more attention due to the recognition of the fact that the above average ability students, who comprise a valuable national capital, do not have the opportunity within the present organizational and educational conditions to reach their full potential. (Georgiades, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>, p. 82)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Georgiades went on to discuss homogeneous and heterogeneous ability grouping, saying that in Cyprus, heterogeneous grouping was dominant, but there were several proponents of homogeneous grouping. As a working compromise, he proposed the use of in-class ability grouping and group work, based on the students’ performance. Still, he admitted:
<disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, the teacher-centered teaching has a long tradition. As a result, the above and below average ability students do not receive adequate attention and treatment suitable for their ability. This comprises the most serious drawback of the Cypriot primary education. (Georgiades, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>, p. 83)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353213493535">
<title>Efforts to Provide for Academically Advanced Students in the Past</title>
<p>Sporadic efforts to provide for academically advanced students appear to have taken place since Cyprus’s independence. Still, they have been isolated and superficial attempts that did not involve official political decisions or fundamental structural and educational changes. At the same time, they followed the traditional top-down approach of implementing educational methods, based on organizational schemata and practices that were in use abroad and without an in-depth investigation into the reality of Cyprus. Thus, although the attempts were well-meaning and addressed a persistent educational need, they were not accepted and soon withdrawn. Koutselini (personal communication, January 18, 2005), Professor of Curriculum and Instruction and the Chair of the Department of Education at the University of Cyprus, explained that those efforts were microlevel experiments, in a school, or a district that did not prove to be desirable and were discontinued.</p>
<p>Theophilides (personal communication, January 18, 2005), Professor of Education, Dean of the School of Education at the University of Nicosia, and the former Chair of the Cyprus Education Service Committee, described one of those past attempts that he took part in as a young teacher. This attempt appears to be representative of the way similar experiments were initiated and faded away. In 1961-1962, the superintendent of <italic>A’ Astiki Scholi</italic> (First Urban School) in Limassol, Andreas Anastasiades, took the initiative to form an experimental special class for high-performing students. Anastasiades had just returned from the United States and probably was trying to implement new ideas that he had learned about during his postgraduate studies. Under Anastasiades’s supervision, approximately 30 second-grade students who had received a 9 or 10 grade (out of 10) were selected to participate in the experimental third grade that Theophilides was assigned to teach. In close collaboration with his superintendent, Theophilides conducted various enrichment activities within this class and occasionally superintendents from around the country came to observe. Superintendents showed interest in the experiment and invited Theophilides to share his experience at an educational conference. At the same time, though, there was a noticeable skepticism among the community about the appropriateness of the effort. The schoolteachers feared that this attempt would create an elite group of students. The parents of the unselected students began raising issues of discrimination and preferential treatment for the “good students” who were receiving a better education and the best teachers. Theophilides sensed a general mistrust over having a special class for the high-performing students as this would comprise an act of discrimination and would create an elite corps of students at the expense of the others.</p>
<p>The following year, Theophilides was transferred<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162353213493535">1</xref></sup> to a village to establish a model one-teacher school and, thus, he does not know exactly what happened to that experimental class. In a few years, Anastasiades was also transferred to serve as a superintendent at a different district in Nicosia. Consequently, since the main agents of this experiment were moved to other districts or positions, the attempt appeared to have gradually faded away.</p>
<p>After 1969, Anastasiades initiated another project in Nicosia that again lasted for a short period of time (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, February 4, 2005). In the late 1970s, there was another pilot in a particular district in Nicosia. In this case, high-performing elementary school students were selected to participate in a special class where they were accelerated. Once again, the program was quickly canceled and the students were put back into the regular classrooms even though they had completed the curriculum for the following two grades. As a result, some of these students became disinterested in school and had discipline problems (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, February 4, 2005).</p>
<p>Pavlos Ioannides (personal communication, February 8, 2005) who served as a superintendent in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and as the Director of Primary Education in the late 1980s mentioned that most of his colleagues at that time recognized that high-achieving students in Cyprus were neglected. Nevertheless, he regretted to say that all their attempts to provide for those students in the form of special classes or programs were in vain mainly because of the collective reactions of the parents and the teachers. He reported: “Every time we tried to do something for those students, the parents and the teachers reacted” (personal communication, February 8, 2005). It appears that the community resisted those attempts by raising issues of discrimination and inequity; officials had to comply with the communal feelings. Ioannides emphasized that after these unsuccessful efforts, the superintendents tried to emphasize individualized teaching and never abandoned the idea that high-ability students needed support and guidance to develop their aptitudes. He mentioned that in many meetings and conferences, the superintendents advised teachers to be alert for students who exhibited special aptitudes or high ability in a field and to provide them with individualized attention. Yet, it is highly doubtful whether teachers were able to or did provide the individualized learning experiences that the superintendents were suggesting (Theophilides, personal communication, April 8, 2013).</p>
<p>Nikos Leontiou, who also served as a superintendent and as the Director of Primary Education in the late 1980s and early 1990s, reiterated that providing for advanced students had never been an official policy of the Ministry of Education in Cyprus (personal communication, February 9, 2005). Theophilides confirmed that since the late 1980s until the present time, he did not recall any official discussion about the issue of high-ability students in the elementary schools (Theophilides, personal communication, April 8, 2013).</p>

<title>The Issue of Academically Advanced Students Causes Mobility Within the Society</title>
<p>Despite the apparent silence and inaction among the Ministry officials, the issue of academically advanced students has gradually become more pressing within society. An increasing number of people have begun to request improvements to be made to the current system to substantially serve the high-ability students. Numerous cases of children who appeared to be facing problems because of the inability of the educational system to accommodate their advancement or special aptitude spurred a number of professionals and parents to come together with a strong feeling that something needed to be done (P. Evelthontos, personal communication, January 19, 2005). There have been reported several cases of students who were referred to child psychologists or child psychiatrists for exhibiting learning or behavior problems or as potentially having attention deficit disorders, only to discover that these students were highly intelligent but often lacked challenge and motivation at school (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, September 30, 2004/January 17, 2005). There were also cases of children who appeared to be ahead and ready to enter primary school but were missing the school-entry age<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162353213493535">2</xref></sup> by a few days or weeks. The rigidity of the public school system that would not accommodate students on a case-by-case basis, has caused children who were already reading and writing to be held behind a year (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, January 31, 2005).</p>

<title>The “Association of Parents and Friends of Gifted Children in Cyprus”</title>
<p>A series of lectures, organized by private initiatives, have caused a noticeable movement around the issue that led to the formation of an interest group in 2002. In 2004, a group called the “Association of Parents and Friends of Gifted Children in Cyprus” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.giftedchildrencyprus.org">http://www.giftedchildrencyprus.org</ext-link>) was founded. The association has a goal of raising awareness of the issue of gifted children. It provides the platform for people who are interested, such as parents, teachers, and professionals to come together and learn more about the issue, and may gradually become a powerful group that can demand educational improvements. For this reason, the association organizes lectures and seminars for adults, as well as informal gatherings and fieldtrips for children to give them the opportunity to associate with other children of similar abilities and interests (P. Evelthontos, personal communication, January 19, 2005). A long-term goal of the association is to establish centers in each city of Cyprus that will provide enrichment experiences for gifted children as well as enhance their knowledge, motivation, and creativity and “offer what the educational system is not offering” (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, January 17, 2005).</p>

<title>Acknowledgment and Interest Within the Academia</title>
<p>The issue of gifted children appears to receive some acknowledgment within academia. The program plans for teacher preparation at the universities in Cyprus do not offer any course specifically addressing the issue of gifted students and only one offers a course on differentiation of instruction. Yet, a number of professors devote some lessons to briefly talk about these issues within the framework of special education, educational psychology, and theory and methodology of instruction (M. Koutselini, personal communication, January 18, 2005). At the same time, several researchers have begun to engage in studies mainly aiming at identifying gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353213493535">Pitta-Pantazi &amp; Christou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353213493535">Pitta-Pantazi et al., 2011</xref>) or trying out methods of curriculum and instruction differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213493535">Koutselini &amp; Savvides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353213493535">Valiande &amp; Koutselini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353213493535">Valiande, Kyriakides, &amp; Koutselini, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Greece, the issue of gifted children has also begun to receive attention in recent years. Noting the apparent lack of acknowledgment or provision for academically advanced students in the Greek educational system and the reported underachievement or distress of several of these students, a handful of academics and researchers have become interested in the issue of high ability and have begun presenting their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213493535">Davazoglou, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213493535">Kyritsi &amp; Zbainos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213493535">Matsagouras, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353213493535">Meletea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353213493535">Stamovlasis &amp; Tsaparlis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353213493535">Theodoridou, Kokkinos, &amp; Davazoglou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353213493535">Tsiamis, 2011</xref>). Most of them criticize the public school system for focusing on teaching to the average student. Greek schools have recently made special provisions for children with disabilities; however, gifted children remain widely neglected.</p>
<p>At the same time, a few books have been published in Greek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213493535">Davazoglou, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213493535">Matsagouras, 2008</xref>), adding to the minimal literature related to the issue of gifted education in the Greek-speaking world.</p>

<title>Giftedness and Gifted Education: A Note of Caution</title>
<p>Drawing from the existing literature that is mostly American and Western-European, recent discussion of gifted education in Greece and Cyprus has been limited to acknowledging the problem and translating related literature. Although the effort is well-intentioned, suggestions for adopting models and systems for the education of “the special category” of the gifted students that are “in application in other countries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353213493535">Meletea, 2004</xref>, p. 90/92) when the reality is that in other countries, the notion of giftedness undergoing rethinking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213493535">Ambrose, Sternberg, &amp; Sriraman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353213493535">Borland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213493535">Gardner, 2000</xref>), puts Greece and Cyprus in danger of repeating history and making the same mistakes as other countries have made. At the same time, these suggestions imply importing foreign educational practices and wisdom to the Greek world through a top-down approach, without considering the local context.</p>

<title>The Need for a Culturally Relevant Approach to Gifted Education: An Explanation to the Cyprus Paradox</title>
<p>Efforts to import constructs and lines of thinking followed abroad without critical reflection and in-depth study of the native sociocultural reality, and the needs deriving from the lived experience of the people may bring dissonance between the educational system and the society. Attempts to introduce policies and reforms that are incompatible with the social ethos are likely to result in resistance or rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213493535">Ioannides, 2004</xref>) and subsequently the educational status quo will be maintained and leave the situation unaddressed.</p>
<p>Increasingly, voices within the Greek and Greek-Cypriot society ask for educational reform that will also address the issue of exceptional abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353213493535">Evelthontos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213493535">Matsagouras, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353213493535">Penintaex, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353213493535">Tsiamis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353213493535">Varnava, 2011</xref>). Yet, through the preceding historical overview, it has become evident that the Ministry officials in Cyprus have recognized this need and several attempts have been made in the past to address the issue. These efforts proved unwelcome, and thus, short lived. This apparent paradox could be explained within the broader weakness of the Greek and Greek-Cypriot educational system to successfully implement educational reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353213493535">Persianis, 1996</xref>), described as a Sisyphean<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162353213493535">3</xref></sup> drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213493535">Kazamia, 1995</xref>). Many explanations could be given. Still, searching abroad for ready-made solutions to local educational problems appears to be a misleading pattern that government officials, professionals, and educators in Greece and Cyprus typically follow.</p>

<title>Importing foreign educational approaches—Tension, paradoxes, and the risk of failure</title>
<p>In an effort to provide for advanced students in Cyprus, education officials searched for ready-made solutions in the form of educational practices that worked successfully in other countries, such as tracking and special classes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353213493535">Persianis (1996)</xref> explains this attitude as being one of the dominant epistemological traditions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162353213493535">4</xref></sup> that have been developed in Cyprus. The prolonged political occupation of Cyprus and the absence of local universities, until recently, with the consequent migration to other countries for further studies, have not allowed the development of a tradition of local production of knowledge. This has reinforced the dominant belief that “knowledge is a good that is imported from outside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353213493535">Persianis, 1996</xref>, p. 17), which appears to hinder every effort for successful educational reform.</p>
<p>The tendency to borrow foreign policies was questioned in several research studies in the context of Cyprus. These studies discussed multiple unsuccessful efforts for educational reform and highlighted the tensions and paradoxes arising from importing foreign policies, curricula, materials, and practices in different areas of education without adjusting them to the local reality context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353213493535">Karagiorgi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353213493535">Zembylas, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As early as 1955, Spyridakis (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>) remarked that efforts to import educational and organizational schemata and methods that do not take into consideration the local reality are at risk of failing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The mission of the organizers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162353213493535">5</xref></sup> most of whom have received post-graduate education in England, is to introduce new teaching methods to the school teachers. Those [methods] do not result from the study of the circumstances of Cypriot or Greek reality, but are imposed from above as tried in England. For this, the failure of most of them is easily explainable. (Spyridakis, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>, p. 63)</p>

<p>Fifty years later, the former Minister of Education, Ouranios Ioannides, reflects on the efforts for educational reform in Cyprus, raising again the issue of local reality and social ethos as a dimension that needs to be taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213493535">Ioannides, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213493535">Ioannides (2004)</xref> refers to past unsuccessful attempts to introduce a tracking system, probably in some middle or high-school classes in Cyprus, according to which the students would be sorted based on their ability into “more able,” “ordinary,” and “less able” tracks. He admits that this system failed to be accepted and had to be withdrawn. In Ioannides’ words:<disp-quote>
<p>It was considered necessary to divide the children based on their abilities in order to achieve better results for everybody, more able, ordinary, and less able. This system has been in practice in many other countries. But here, after failing to be accepted by the society . . . was withdrawn . . . Resources were available and were provided. The need to be addressed existed. Still, the social ethos did not accept it [the tracking system]. It was not compatible with our value system.

<title>Culture-specific attitudes and social ethos in Cyprus related to gifted education</title>
<p>The culture-specific attitudes and social ethos in Cyprus related to the issue of gifted education have been noticed also by various professionals and educators who are currently advocating for special educational provisions for academically advanced students. In a personal communication with some of them (A. M. Anastasiades, personal communication, January 17, 2005; P. Evelthontos, personal communication, January 19, 2005), they often commented on the fact that many parents, although they realized that their children had special abilities and aptitudes or that they were ahead, and although they wanted to support them, they were often reluctant to use the label <italic>gifted</italic> that was proposed to them. At the same time, they strongly resisted the idea of their children being separated from their classmates, labeled as being <italic>different</italic>. For professionals who were born, raised, and educated abroad, this attitude may be inconceivable.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The cultural piece here in Cyprus is very frustrating. A lot of parents don’t want their child to be different, they want their child to be part of the group, they don’t want the child to be taken away out of the classroom, or to have to deal with the problem of “what other people are gonna say, they’re gonna say that, my kid is better than your kid . . . and aren’t all children gifted?” I mean, it’s <italic>unbelievable</italic>!

<p>Most of the times the parents were telling me: “It is the teacher that told me to come to you . . . Eh, okay he is good” or “he is smart . . . But we don’t want to boast about this . . . ” There was this reluctance that if they say something their environment would criticize them as if they boast about their children and it is not right to do that . . . “You know, we came to you, but we don’t want you to think that we believe our kid is exceptional.” They felt very uncomfortable to tell them that they have something different from the group.

<title>The Idea of Gifts and Talents in the Greek Culture</title>
<p>Having special gifts and talents has not been condemned within the Greek culture. On the contrary, exceptional abilities and achievements in multiple domains of the human endeavor have been traditionally highly admired and embraced. Greeks are known for drawing great pride for others who excel and are recognized internationally in arts, sciences, athletics, politics, and business. This becomes obvious during the Olympic Games or other athletic events where every distinction achieved by a Greek athlete or team is followed by public enthusiasm. Similar public excitement followed the recent distinction and Nobel Prize award to Pissarides, a Greek-Cypriot economist and the European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant award to Patsalis, a Greek-Cypriot scientist. Gifts and talents appear to be embraced and celebrated, as long as they are developed and pursued within the value system and accepted social ethos that highly values modesty, mutual respect, fairness, and sharing. These values are interwoven with the cultural morality of connectedness and appear to suggest a culture-specific perspective of individual differences that strongly resists any form of labeling, categorization, and segregation. This perspective of individual differences and gifts is reflected through the following text that appears in the third grade textbook for Religious Studies in Cyprus:</p>
<p>So Many Gifts!</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a classroom full of children. Many children. Stamatis is playing the flute. For him the world is made of sounds. All admire Stamatis. But he admires Alecos who runs like the wind and always comes first in races.

Stella, though, admires Argyro who draws magnificent landscapes that you are delighted to watch!</p>
<p>It is a classroom full of children. And all of them are gifted! All of them have gifts, even though they are often not visible. Here, like Agni, who at first glance you think she has none, but she has the most important one: A golden heart that could embrace everybody.</p>
<p>It is a classroom full of children. It is the whole world. They enjoy others’ gifts and their own. All are gifts of God and they share them with each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353213493535">Ministry of National Education and Religion, 1998</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously, the text presents an ideal picture of a mixed-ability class. Still, it appears to acknowledge gifts and talents in different fields that are recognized and celebrated within the group. Each child brings something unique to share with the group and the others rejoice for that child as he or she is a member of the group. At the same time each child is modest and respectful by recognizing that others also have unique gifts.</p>
<sec id="section19-0162353213493535">
<title>Difference, equality, and unity—A person-centered philosophy</title>
<p>The idea of celebrating difference in unity with the social group has often been raised among Greek educators and academics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou (2001)</xref> explains that difference, equality, and unity characterize every genuine interpersonal relationship and should also be reflected in the area of education. According to the Orthodox church, every person is a singular, unique, and irreplaceable entity, and should be treated as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353213493535">Yannaras, 2000</xref>). In this person-centered ontology, people are not individuals; an individual by definition exists independently, as a separate being. Rather, people gain their uniqueness only in relation with the others. And equality, which is nothing other than respect for differences, allows this unity to occur. If people existed separately there would be no need for discussions over equality; equality by definition refers to more than one person. Similarly, if people were similar or the same, there would not be any dimensions on which inequity and discrimination could be based; thus, equality would not be an issue. “It is through unity that difference and equality are able to coexist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou, 2001</xref>, p. 10). For this reason, students should not be reducible to anything else; “any classification or ranking of a student using convenient categories entails a distortion of that student’s personal otherness”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0162353213493535">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou, 2001</xref>, p. 9). All the students are simply different, as opposed to any notion of inferior or superior.</p>
<p>Taking difference as a rule, this person-centered philosophy acknowledges the gifts and talents that each student brings as a unique person. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou (2001)</xref>, these gifts are equal in value and must be brought to the surface and nurtured. Still, within the notion of difference-in-unity, gifts should not function only as a means for personal use or gain. Rather, they need to be shared with the group for the common good. At the same time, while a person’s gifts and talents should not be ignored, neither should they be nurtured at the expense of the group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353213493535">Xochellis (2010)</xref> advocated for a balance between the personal and the social dimension of education:
<disp-quote>
<p>The single person cannot be perceived in isolation to the social group. At the same time a pedagogical procedure that absolutely suppresses the person to the social group cannot be accepted either. Thus, extreme weight given to the one of the two dimensions of this interactive relationship distorts the pedagogical procedure and comprises a danger for the person or the society. There are many examples of the hypertrophy of the individual or social factor in the history of education and in current educational orientations. (p. 47)</p>

<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353213493535">Xochellis (2010)</xref> referred to the general education field, there are numerous examples from the gifted education field that reflect a hypertrophy of the individual or the social factor in pedagogical procedures. In extreme cases of placing the social group above the person, the individual has been perceived as a creation (and possession) of the social group and, thus, obligated to serve the social group in specific ways. For example, in communistic countries such as the former East Germany and the Soviet Union, talented athletes were singled out and trained from childhood for the specific role that was assigned to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213493535">Freeman, 1992</xref>). The talents were considered property of the state and the athletes were made “ambassadors” to promote the ideals of the communist state internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353213493535">Urban &amp; Sekowski, 1993</xref>). Still, provisions were often pursued at the expense of the personal welfare of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353213493535">Persson, Joswig, &amp; Balogh, 2000</xref>). At the other extreme, the development of the individual has been sought regardless of or even at the expense of the social group. Critics of tracking and ability grouping have argued that these practices benefit some students at the expense of the majority of students, especially those that are underprivileged. This perpetuates inequality, segregation, and racism in the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353213493535">Oakes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353213493535">Sapon-Shevin, 2003</xref>).

However, educators, including many from the gifted education field, agree that a middle ground needs to be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353213493535">Oakes &amp; Lipton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213493535">Reis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353213493535">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353213493535">Sapon-Shevin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353213493535">Tomlinson &amp; Imbeau, 2010</xref>). Neither sameness and conformity, nor segregation and discrimination should be accepted in the name of individual rights. Critical reflection and questioning of possible dogmatic tenets and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213493535">Ambrose et al., 2011</xref>) define a major shift in the gifted education field toward more balanced solutions. The challenge for educators in the 21st century is not how to distinguish between gifted and nongifted students, but rather how to identify and nurture in young children potential talents in multiple domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353213493535">Von Karolyi, Ramos-Ford, &amp; Gardner, 2003</xref>). Consequently, efforts should be geared to providing for the gifts of each student, while taking into consideration the welfare of the social group. Recognizing and nurturing the diversity in students’ abilities within democratic educational environments appear to validate the difference-in-unity, person-centered philosophy valued in the Greek culture.</p>

<title>The Current Educational Reality in Cyprus: A Procrustean Experience</title>
<p>In a democratic society, equality does not imply sameness. On the contrary, denying individual differences and imposing uniformity has more in common with totalitarian systems than it has with democratic ones. As it was stated earlier in this article, equality signifies respect for differences. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213493535">Fotiou’s (2001)</xref> words, education should try to overcome “any tendency to make all students the same. Herd-like discipline, totalitarian regimentation, standardization, and uniformity must all be rejected” (p. 9). Thus, the strict uniformity that describes current education in Greece and Cyprus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213493535">Matsagouras, 2008</xref>) appears to be in conflict with the social beliefs of balancing the personal and the individual dimension of education and celebrating the uniqueness of every person.</p>
<p>The former official elementary school curriculum stated: “The curriculum respects the uniqueness of the child and responds to the innate or acquired individual differences, the timely diagnosis of which constitutes necessity for suitable planning, correct application, and complete utilization of the available time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 1996</xref>, p. 21). Within the framework of a “humane and democratic school,” the new curricula include an even more general reference to “the fundamental principle that each child is different,” stating that “school learning should be adjusted accordingly to the zone of proximal development of each student” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 2010</xref>, p. 6). Yet, in practice and in the name of equality, the Greek-Cypriot educational system still remains inflexible and monolithic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353213493535">Evelthontos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353213493535">Penintaex, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353213493535">Varnava, 2011</xref>), providing the students with a Procrustean<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0162353213493535">8</xref></sup> educational experience. Procedures and provisions are applied to all students in the exact same way. The prescribed curriculum is taught with the same goals and content through a single textbook, while the dominant teacher-centered instruction posits a one-size-fits-all educational approach that denies the uniqueness of each student and neglects the diversity of abilities. Like Procrustes, the current school expects students to either stretch in areas that they have difficulties with or slow down when they could advance, to fit the standard curriculum.</p>
<sec id="section23-0162353213493535">
<title>Inclusion</title>
<p>The diversity of students’ abilities has been partially acknowledged through recent inclusion reform in Cyprus. An inclusion orientation supports the belief that all students’ educational and emotional needs can be satisfied in the regular classroom. The issue of inclusion has been discussed at length and has been a priority for the Ministry of Education during the past decades. The philosophy of inclusion was compatible with the democratic and humanitarian ideals to which Greek-Cypriot education has been committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 1996</xref>). At the same time, an inclusion orientation has reinforced the comprehensive school model that “aims at serving all students, irrespective of abilities, in mixed-ability classrooms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, n.d</xref>.). By definition, the mixed-ability classroom philosophy recognizes the diversity of abilities that need to be served. However, throughout the discourse on inclusion, it became clear that it refers only to students with learning difficulties and disabilities such as mental retardation, socioemotional problems, hearing loss, low vision, and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213493535">Ministry of Education and Culture, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353213493535">2010</xref>). There is currently no official acknowledgment of the students with special gifts.</p>
<p>Inclusion as an educational reform and the related discourse and policies gave the educational system of Cyprus a progressive nuance. It led to the abolishment of segregation policies and practices and many of the special schools that had existed for children with disabilities. Nevertheless, in practice it appears that the reform has been limited to physically including these children into the regular classrooms, without making the necessary modifications to fundamentally alter teaching and learning practices. Inclusion has made diversity in performance levels more obvious and highlighted the need for more flexible teaching to reach all children. Nonetheless, teachers appear to be unprepared to deal with the variety of students’ needs and provide for the whole spectrum of strengths and difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213493535">Kombos, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213493535">Polydorou, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Barriers to accommodating the diversity of students’ abilities</title>
<p>Having been involved in the educational matters and in teacher education in Cyprus for years, Theophilides explained that most of the teachers continue teaching in the way they were taught, perpetuating the long teacher-centered teaching tradition (personal communication, April 8, 2013). Teachers are expected to use the single official textbook for each subject to teach the prescribed curriculum to their students. The given content that needs to be taught within a specific time frame and the high student–teacher ratio with a single teacher responsible for all students makes the situation more difficult and leaves little room for differentiation. At the same time, Theophilides pointed out that the programs of study of the Greek universities and the recently established universities in Cyprus are mainly devoted to theoretical knowledge. Thus, the new teachers seem unprepared to implement new teaching methods. When confronting with practical difficulties, new teachers turn to the easy solution and teach in the traditional way.</p>
<p>Since 1962, Klitos Georgiades has identified the organizational and educational conditions and the teacher-centered tradition in Cyprus as the main barriers to accommodating the diversity of students in the mixed-ability classroom system (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213493535">Persianis &amp; Polyviou, 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, it appears that 50 years later the situation has changed little. Despite efforts for educational reform, teacher-centered teaching and the rigid educational system still appear to comprise serious drawbacks of education in Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriot educational system lacks flexibility; without a fundamental transformation of the content and internal functioning of the classroom, the acknowledgment and provision for the diversity of students’ abilities, gifts, and talents is hindered.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title>
<p>Conceptions of giftedness depend on the values, beliefs, and priorities, as well as the sociohistorical and political reality of the specific culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213493535">Davis et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, methods to identify and nurture abilities and gifts should be relevant to the dominant ideology and the social ethos of the country. The current field of gifted education has been mainly developed in the United States and Western European countries, and, thus, the meanings attached to its fundamental concepts and practices reflect the dominant Western European history, worldview, and value system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213493535">Ieridou &amp; Zumwalt, 2013</xref>). International collaboration and discussion are essential in the common quest for educational improvement. Still, the great variety of approaches toward the issue of gifted education worldwide and within Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353213493535">Ieridou, 2013</xref>) demonstrates that local answers are needed instead of universal, ready-made solutions.</p>
<p>In the case of Cyprus, the social ethos values a person-centered ontology that recognizes the uniqueness of every person, defined by his or her interdependence in the small community of the country. However, specific sociohistorical and political circumstances have given the existing system a monolithic character that hinders the acknowledgment and provision for the diversity of students’ abilities. Constant threats against the national and cultural existence of the country have directed educational priorities toward preserving homogeneity and unity rather than emphasizing differentiation. Weakness in applying educational reforms that would fundamentally transform educational structure, procedures, and content has perpetuated the educational status quo. Past attempts to provide for the diversity of students have been limited to importing foreign educational practices, like tracking and special classrooms, without taking into consideration the local reality. These practices have been rejected by the community because they are incompatible with a social ethos that strongly resists labeling, categorization, and segregation. Still, the need to acknowledge and nurture students’ gifts and talents was not denied. Rather, it was the specific philosophy and practices used that were rejected because they conflicted with the dominant morality.</p>
<p>Lack of local scholarship on exceptional abilities necessitates the initiation of relevant research and discourse within the context of Cyprus. Culture-specific evidence could inform efforts to develop a culturally relevant approach to gifted education, which could frame policy and practice in the public school system. Research needs to describe the current educational conditions, assess educational needs, and trace areas of dysfunction and ineffectiveness that require reform. Moreover, culture-specific conceptions of giftedness and relevant values and attitudes toward exceptional abilities need to inform efforts for reform. Experimentation with different school structures, instructional models, and types of provisions, while evaluating their effectiveness and social acceptance, will allow the adjustment of successful practices to the Cyprus context.</p>
<p>In this era of globalization, educational borrowing and lending has become popular, but also controversial. Importing and exporting educational philosophies, policies, and practices as ready-made solutions are being questioned as to who benefits from these arrangements, and what are the consequences for less powerful and culturally different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353213493535">Steiner-Khamsi, 2004</xref>) International dialogue and scholarship exchange are crucial. However, adaptation of this knowledge to the local reality, needs, and feelings is necessary to establish promising and culturally relevant educational reforms.</p>
