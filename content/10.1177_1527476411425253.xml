<p>On Monday, 4 July 2011, the <italic>Guardian</italic> first revealed that an investigator working for Britain’s (then) top-selling Sunday newspaper, the <italic>News of the World</italic> (<italic>NOTW</italic>), had hacked into the cell phone of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler. There was immediate public outrage and a huge amount of media coverage. Two days later, corporate lobbyists, public affairs directors, broadcasters, producers and politicians came together in an exclusive Westminster Media Forum to debate “industry priorities for the new Communications Bill.” In the introductory session, leading figures from Britain’s top media companies all agreed that the forthcoming legislation needed to focus purely on strategies for stimulating economic growth and promoting deregulation. There was not a single dissenting voice on the platform. I asked from the floor whether, given the breaking public scandal concerning phone hacking, there were any noneconomic priorities, for example the promotion of ethical behavior, that needed to be a policy focus.</p>
<p>The question was met with stunned silence and some embarrassment that such a question could be asked. Eventually, John Whittingdale, the session chair and also the chair of the powerful House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, replied that “I’m not quite sure how Parliament is going to legislate for ethical behaviour.” The only panel member to reply was Google’s head of UK public policy, Sarah Hunter (formerly a media policy adviser to Tony Blair), who insisted that the idea that, in the digital age, it was possible to “try and create a legislative framework that does lots of other social goods through broadcasting” was “old fashioned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411425253">Westminster Media Forum 2011</xref>, 26).</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, the prime minister, David Cameron, launched a public inquiry into the ethics and regulation of the news media (the Leveson Inquiry). Within two weeks, Britain’s second best-selling newspaper, the <italic>NOTW</italic>, had closed, two of the most senior police officers in the country had resigned along with other top News Corp executives, News Corp itself had called off its bid to take over Britain’s largest satellite broadcaster BSkyB, and a political crisis had unfolded that has since rocked the media, police, and political establishments.</p>
<p>I present this anecdote because it reveals a number of significant points.</p>
<p>First, it demonstrates just how out-of-touch influential industry and political figures can be in thinking through the basis of policy. Despite increasing allegations of complicity between politicians, media elites and the police, the communications industry was determined initially to minimize the significance of this growing scandal and to continue pursuing a resolutely deregulatory economic agenda. It was as if media content and media structures inhabit two separate worlds where the former is linked to the idiosyncratic behavior of “creatives” and journalists while the latter is a more sober universe based on scientific modeling, business imperatives, and sound economic logic.</p>
<p>Since then, the enormous public response to the disgraceful behavior at the heart of the News Corp empire has demonstrated to even the most hardened market liberal that issues of content, responsibility, and ethical behavior are central to the media industry’s capacity to retain legitimacy and the trust of the public.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that the Culture Secretary has launched a review in preparation for a new Communications Bill has been mostly absent from the torrent of comment on the phone hacking scandal and it is still not clear, at the time of writing, what the relationship will be between the Leveson Inquiry and the wider Communications Review. We are thus faced with a puzzling contradiction. On the one hand, it appears that the phone hacking inquiry may call for <italic>more</italic> regulation (e.g., stronger ownership controls to protect plurality and more robust ways of enforcing responsible reporting than those currently offered by the ineffectual Press Complaints Commission [PCC]) while the legislative process is likely to deliver a less regulated communications environment with an eye on international trade more than domestic behavior.</p>
<p>Consider the comments of Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, in his keynote speech to the 2011 Edinburgh International Television Festival, where he argued passionately against the British tendency to overregulate that results in “less flexibility and scope for UK companies seeking to compete on the global stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411425253">Schmidt 2011</xref>, 13). Instead, taking a swipe at the “micro-regulation” of television advertising in particular, “content businesses need the freedom and legal framework to behave more like Internet companies” even if this “runs counter to the public mood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411425253">Schmidt 2011</xref>, 13) following the phone hacking scandal.</p>
<p>It appears, therefore, that we are about to have the most substantial investigation into the practices and regulatory models of the British media yet one that is partially insulated from the cold, hard business concerning the future of the communications industry as a whole. This separation between content and structure is one that industry figures, and it seems policymakers, are still prepared to enshrine and yet one that carries a heavy risk judging by the public reaction to the goings-on at the <italic>NOTW</italic> and News Corp’s attempt to take full control of BSkyB.</p>
<p>The scandal has demonstrated the importance of having a robust and independent news sector (or rather it has shown the implications for democracy of not having one). Yet the whole question of news is entirely absent from the Culture Secretary’s open letter that mapped out the parameters of the communications review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411425253">DCMS 2011</xref>). There is no mention of the potential threat to plurality posed by the takeover of BSkyB by News Corp, no mention of the legal and regulatory uncertainties posed by the emergence of social media like Twitter, no mention of the performance of the PCC in ensuring ethical behavior by the news media, and no mention of the crisis facing many news organizations let alone the government’s responsibility to react adequately to this crisis.</p>
<p>Instead, the emphasis in the letter, just as it was in the Westminster seminar, is on trade, innovation, and in particular, deregulation at the expense of other socially and politically desirable objectives. While “pluralism” is mentioned once, “growth” is referred to 21 times and whereas the “public interest” merits a single mention, “competition” or “competitive” is referenced eight times.</p>
<p>But the third point that arises from the industry’s attempt to insulate questions of content and structure is how quickly things can change. Now, the same institutions whose representatives initially shook their heads in amazement at the idea of being required to act ethically will, in all likelihood, be running around drawing up ethical codes and conduct and “corporate social responsibility” models that ensure they are <italic>seen</italic> to be acting unimpeachably. What transformed the situation, of course, was not the innate good sense of the media establishment or work of existing regulators like the PCC but a combination of the tireless efforts of several individuals—including the <italic>Guardian</italic> journalist Nick Davies and the MPs Tom Watson and Chris Bryant—and a public backlash against corruption and the abuse of power at the highest levels.</p>
<p>This presents those who want to see more democratic forms of regulation and indeed a different kind of media—one that is creative, imaginative, and relevant; is willing to take risks; and is also determined to hold the powerful to account—with a huge responsibility. Unlike the banking crisis and the MPs’ expenses controversy, both of which resulted in only minimal changes to elite power, we cannot afford to waste this change radically to restructure the British media and to break the consensus between media owners and the political elite that has dominated for too long.</p>
<p>It would be a big mistake to underestimate the potential impact of this crisis both on regulatory structures and political power more generally. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp has for years dominated the British media scene and terrified politicians who dared even to contemplate challenging a news agenda based not only on scandal and sensationalism but also unequivocal support for Britain’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, firm backing for public spending cuts, and consistent opposition to Britain’s membership of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Leveson Inquiry and ongoing Communications Review provide opportunities to counterpose one form of media power—concentrated, unaccountable, privileged—with another form that holds elites to account, offers more than a token range of “legitimate” views on urgent matters of the day, and represents British society back to itself. This will require a series of reforms to ownership structures and self-regulatory practices that currently are clearly not operating in the public interest. We are faced, in conclusion, with the most exciting prospects for media reform in the United Kingdom for a generation.</p>
