<abstract>
<p>Despite recognizing that gender identity is a complex compromise formation, psychotherapists struggle to tolerate gender variance. We still tend to favor binary gender identities and clear developmental lines, rather than embracing a stance of subversive curiosity about the variability and fluidity of gender in our patients. When gender identity is fluid or ambiguous, countertransferential affective disturbances can arise that meld states of abjection and excitement, challenging theoretical constructs and threatening therapeutic neutrality. Case material from the treatment of a female-to-male trans person is presented from the perspective of the transference-countertransference matrix.</p>

<body>
<p>A 1999 <italic>New Yorker</italic> cartoon by Edward Koren shows a woman kneeling by a stroller asking the baby’s beaming mother, “How is it gendered?” We click on either male or female when answering questionnaires, boys and girls still line up in elementary school halls in just that order, and baristas say “Sir” or “Ma’am,” even at the hippest coffee shops. Everyone wants and needs to know our gender; in turn, we demand to know his? her? gender. Even the most flexible of us are confused by not knowing; we seem to need the category of gender to make people intelligible. Is the establishment of the category of gender a psychoanalytic task? Why is it so difficult to maintain a psychoanalytic position of uncertainty and subversive curiosity when confronting the seemingly innate, immutable, and cherished fact of gender? In what follows we consider the treatment of a female-to-male transsexual<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065112468489">1</xref></sup> person in an effort to ameliorate the developmental lag between our theorizing of gender and our clinical approach to gender, using the “shift in clinical listening” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112468489">Corbett 2008</xref>, p. 851) needed to better appreciate the gendered experience of our patients. In addition, we hope to show how gender sometimes codes for other issues, serving at times as a marker for deeper anxieties, and how we as clinicians can easily overestimate the value of gender coherence in and of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112468489">Corbett 2008</xref>). The treatment was conducted by one of us (BFM) and is reported in her voice.</p>
<p>My treatment with Casey began with a call from her mother, Mrs. D., who sought help “accepting [her] daughter’s transsexualism.” At our first and only encounter, Mrs. D.’s beauty struck me: shapely and fit figure, sparkling hazel eyes, and a head of shimmering copper curls. She was tastefully and impeccably dressed, but I could easily detect the lacy edge of her well-filled brassiere beneath her apricot silk blouse. As she sat across from me, she leaned in, made riveting eye contact, and said in a conspiratorially hushed tone, “Dr. Marcus, I need you desperately.”</p>
<p>Ostensibly, Mrs. D. wished to know whether her nineteen-year-old daughter was truly a transsexual and, if so, how best to help her. Mrs. D. was depressed and anxious, both about Casey and about her own troubled marriage. I commented on an insistent undercurrent to solicit my support for her wish that I eradicate Casey’s transsexualism, which Mrs. D. was able to acknowledge. She accepted my stated position of neutrality, but mocked Casey’s wish to become the actor Johnny Depp, then a teen icon from <italic>21 Jump Street</italic> and <italic>A Nightmare on Elm Street</italic>. Her concern about Casey’s “violent temper,” reclusiveness, depressive ruminations, and fleeting suicidal thoughts was palpable. Mrs. D. successfully approached her daughter about a consultation with me. It seemed likely to me from Mrs. D.’s description that the Casey<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065112468489">2</xref></sup> I was about to meet was a deeply disturbed, possibly delusional late adolescent for whom psychological work would be anathema given her strongly held conviction of the somatic nature of her problems. I was also acutely aware of the need to consider developmental factors. Adolescence is a time of fluid identity and questioning of self; I also knew that I had to be prepared to have my own gender identity and sexual orientation challenged, both directly by the patient and internally.</p>

<p>Acceptance of the orderly linear development of binary gender identity endures in clinical practice, despite the current theoretical emphasis on the variability and instability of gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003065112468489">3</xref></sup> Even with postmodern intellectual pressure from critics such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003065112468489">Rubin (1975)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065112468489">Foucault (1978)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112468489">Butler (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112468489">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065112468489">2004</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003065112468489">Sedgwick (1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112468489">Bersani (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003065112468489">Prosser (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112468489">Halberstam (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003065112468489">Salamon (2010)</xref>, the dominant social, cultural, and, in many instances, clinical premise persists that the dimorphic category of gender is a given, based on the appearance of one’s genitals, the ensuing assignment of female or male identity, and a satisfactory gender-concordant upbringing. Gender sorting has been considered inevitable, biological, and binary: “we look for the familiar and we find it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003065112468489">Stack 1999</xref>, p. 77). We tend to ignore the fact that Janet Hyde’s meta-analysis of research on gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003065112468489">2005</xref>) shows that males and females are alike on most variables, with only a few exceptions: motor performance (such as throwing velocity and distance), masturbation, physical aggression, and attitudes about casual sex. We overlook the ethical implications that arise from factual and conceptual errors regarding the existence of vast psychological differences between the sexes that are “hard-wired” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003065112468489">Fine 2008</xref>, p. 69). It is easy to fall into pseudoscientific neurosexism. The simple rubric of binary gender identity ignores the truth that there have always been chromosomal and biological gender variants, just as there have always been women who feel more comfortable as masculine and men who feel more comfortable as feminine. Additionally, how do efforts to rebiologize gender and sexual identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112468489">Friedman and Downey 2008</xref>) and to “invoke the vocabulary of immutable difference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003065112468489">Somerville 1998</xref>, p. 73) resonate with existing cultural anxieties and desires about racially mixed bodies? Such attempts echo late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth century perverse medical models of race and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112468489">Gilman 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003065112468489">Moss 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past it was assumed that psychological development and behavior unfold like a physiological trajectory considered natural, programmed, and driven by biological imperatives. Now we know that although there are biological brain differences at birth between males and females, these are subtle predispositions rather than compelling differences. Brain plasticity, the fact that experience itself constantly changes brain structure and function, is more important; experience alters the chemistry and function of the genes, leading to cellular changes and significant effects on growth and development in a complex matrix of looping feedback. This biological model is consistent with Dahl’s radical proposal in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065112468489">1988</xref> that gender organization is a mosaic and that “‘Gender identity’ is not a fixed normative end point in a linear developmental sequence but a complex construction involving the interrelationships between body and mind and between inner and outer reality” (p. 363). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003065112468489">Mayes (2001)</xref> observes about development: “When studied at close range, what looks . . . like an orchestrated, cohesive, even predictable process from a distance takes on a more exploratory, opportunistic, and function-driven character” (p. 148).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112468489">Balsam (2001)</xref> has proposed that the girl’s ongoing encounter with the iconic maternal body, maternality, is the girl’s most important influence, but certainly not the only one, in the development of her adult gender portrait. Balsam’s argument is that “integration of a gender narrative requires an internal, sequenced, opportunistic blending of male and female meanings,” but she retains the traditional emphasis on “clear recognition of the function of the sexed body” (p. 1357). In 2005, Meissner theorized that “the child’s coming to know and experience his or her own body, and coming to know sexual and genital differences, gradually contribute to consolidating a sense of gender identity as belonging to one gender and not the other. But once formed, the core gender identity remains unchanged and persistent” (p. 50). Yet in that very year, the gender theorist Jack Halberstam advanced queerness as an “alternative vision of community, space, time, and identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003065112468489">2005</xref>, p. 95).</p>
<p>In her recent selective review of the contemporary literature on gender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003065112468489">Kulish (2010)</xref> acknowledges the new conceptualizations that stress the fluidity and complexity of gender, though she cautions that we should not throw out the concept of developmental lines, despite the fact that most contemporary psychoanalytic theorists regard the concept as too simple and restrictive. One of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003065112468489">Marcus 1993</xref>) anticipated the idea of the variability of gender development in her report on the vicissitudes of gender identity in the treatment of a gender-dysphoric male patient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065112468489">Harris (2005)</xref> uses chaos theory, that is, nonlinear dynamic systems theory, in which outcomes cannot be predicted from initial conditions, to propose that gender is “softly assembled” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065112468489">2005</xref>, p. xii). She sees gender as a “set of behavioral attractors whose form and stability are quite variable depending on the task at hand, the context, and the person’s life history and experiences” (p. 149). Nonlinear dynamics such as these predict a “very different kind of world,” according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112468489">Galatzer-Levy (2004)</xref>, “a world with abrupt changes, discontinuities, idiosyncratic developmental lines, and disproportions between causes and effects” (p. 419).</p>

<title>“Everything, in Fact, Was Something Else”</title>
<p>I was surprised to find Casey easily engaged (though wary), articulate, forthcoming, reflective, and ultimately enthusiastic about beginning treatment with me.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003065112468489">4</xref></sup> I was impressed by her thoughtfulness and sincerity (pronouns follow the patient’s preferences during the course of treatment), but skeptical about her capacity to entrust herself to the therapeutic process. Initially she presented as a gender-ambiguous, neatly but unfashionably attired teenager who described herself as anxious and depressed. I saw her twice weekly for two years, and then three times a week for the next four. Well-versed on the topic of transsexualism from extensive reading and attendance at a local transsexual club, she felt herself to be male, though biologically female. We agreed that I would take no decision-making role vis-à-vis sex reassignment interventions, and Casey agreed not to pursue medical treatments, hormonal or surgical, without extended discussion.</p>
<p>The youngest of three children, Casey was living at home after withdrawing from a small liberal arts college halfway through her freshman year. She had felt acutely out of place at the college, because of her desire but inability to present as male in this new environment. Too acutely self-conscious about her ambiguous appearance to work, Casey spent her days at home reading, endlessly watching Johnny Depp films and reruns, and hanging out with her high school girlfriend, Marissa. Casey’s father was an accountant whom she avoided, saying she hated him and believed he could be dangerously violent. Her mother worked as a fundraiser for a conservative political organization and had a history of postpartum depression following the birth of Casey’s older brother, Andrew.</p>
<p>Casey was close to her mother until the age of four and a half, when she looked at her mother’s naked breasts and genitals in horror and said, “This will never happen to me!” Her conviction in her own maleness coalesced. Casey described herself as an active, adventurous child who gravitated toward pursuits such as skateboarding, baseball, and martial arts; tutored by Andrew, she excelled at all three. Her mother periodically prohibited such activities, anxious about Casey’s “dangerousness.” Mrs. D. forbade her children to have more than token contact with their father, asserting that she was protecting them from his violence. She became sullen and withdrawn if Casey communicated with him. Mr. and Mrs. D. had a hostile, mutually provocative relationship. Although both parents were overstimulating in their own ways, there was no evidence that Casey was sexually abused.</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, Casey became fiercely attached to Marissa, an older friend who formed a passionate bond with Casey. Peers at school condemned Casey and Marissa as “dykes,” and extruded or ignored them. Casey had vague plans for living on her own and having a career as an actor, but complained that she couldn’t follow through until she had sex reassignment surgery. She also expressed concern about her “out-of-control temper.” Her exquisite sensitivity to slights real and imagined gave sessions the quality of crossing a minefield, Casey acting as a reckless apprentice on my bomb squad.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>(Suspiciously) You and Andrew? What do you mean?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>THERAPIST:</speaker>
<p>(I felt briefly confused. What had just happened? Had I been confusing to her? Had I inadvertently aligned myself with her brother? Was I angry with her, as Andrew had been? I lost and then regained my ability to think.) You told me that you and Andrew had a fight last night. I know that it’s upsetting to you to talk about it with me because you’re afraid I’ll think <italic>you’re</italic> the disturbed one.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>(Softly) I’m terrified that you’ll throw me out, refuse to see me ever again if I tell you what happened. Marissa left me again. Andrew said she wanted a guy and called me a lezzy. I told him I’m not a lesbian— I’m transsexual. I said I was going punch his lights out. Then he told me I was too violent and slammed the door in my face.</p>
</speech>
<p>At times I felt confused in similar ways during other such interactions with Casey. Gradually I came to recognize these as moments in which her feelings of closeness to me triggered intolerable confusion in her. She resolved these feelings by “slamming the door in my face,” which I experienced as an attempt to refortify the boundary between us.</p>
<p>Humor signaled her growing comfort with me. Casey was aware of several unpacked cartons cluttering my office for months while I awaited shelves. She enjoyed teasing me about my housekeeping skills, which seemed related not only to her fear of my possible impermanence and the threat of abandonment, but also defended against her feelings about me as my first pregnancy was becoming visible. Casey denied any awareness of the pregnancy until well into the second trimester, and then only to note that I was fortunate to have the “right equipment for your gender.” I inquired what it meant to her that my genitals and social presentation as female were now so demonstrably concordant, unlike hers. She shrugged, “Luck of the draw, I guess.” In her presence, I was acutely aware of my enlarging breasts and less proud of my fecundity than in other contexts. Instead I found myself reflecting uneasily about a lost sense of my own androgyny and bisexuality. I noticed that my pleasure in learning that I would be delivering a son took on the additional meaning of vicariously acquiring maleness—an awareness that was difficult to reconcile with feeling more fully female and traditionally feminine than ever before.</p>
<p>We resumed treatment when I returned from my six-week maternity leave, still breastfeeding. I was struck by Casey’s lack of overt curiosity about the outcome of my pregnancy, though her nonverbal attitude toward me was one of preadolescent awe. My belly had swollen and then flattened, I had disappeared and then returned, yet my pregnancy had vanished from the therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112468489">Balsam 2003</xref>). The convergence of her breakup with Marissa, my absence, and my return led to Casey’s increasing willingness to reveal her vulnerability, her frail sense of identity, and her panic about being forced once again to rely on her mother, who demeaned signs of her identity as a male. Casey became markedly depressed, realizing that both Marissa and I served as nurturing surrogate maternal figures. At home, Casey derided and once physically threatened her mother as the years of bitter conflict over Casey’s desire to live as a man reached a crescendo.</p>
<p>In treatment, she oscillated between awareness of feeling abandoned by me and suspicions of a conspiracy between her mother and me to force conformity to her anatomical gender.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>It has crossed my mind since you came back from your leave that you may have spoken with her when we weren’t meeting; you have this mother thing in common with her now. And how do I know that you don’t share her wish I’d give up my wish to be a man? How do I know that you truly believe I could be a real man? You’ve never really come out and said that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>THERAPIST:</speaker>
<p>So you’re afraid that now that I left you to have this “mother thing” going on that maybe I really <italic>am</italic> like your mother, that I think you’re either born a “real man” or not, and that your mother and I are in cahoots to convince you you could never be a real man.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, damn right! Why not? You have your secrets, right?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>THERAPIST:</speaker>
<p>Secrets? Like having a baby?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>Fuck babies! I don’t care about your damn baby! I hate babies! All they do is cry, eat, piss, and shit.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>THERAPIST:</speaker>
<p>And take me away from you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CASEY:</speaker>
<p>I don’t want to hear any more about it! We should be talking about me, not you.</p>
</speech>
<p>Subsequently, Casey was able to question the meanings of her aggressive attitude, for which she was always later remorseful. Indeed, she experienced her aggression as ego-dystonic, unable to reconcile personal violence with her pacifist politics. Only later did we recognize that her macho posture was not so much an identification with her father as an identification with her mother’s paranoid and grossly distorted image of him. Casey struggled too with jealousy and resentment evoked by her mother’s sadistic behavior with her father—erotically titillating Mr. D., then taunting him about his impotence with her. Casey began questioning her acceptance of her mother’s proclaimed martyrdom in protecting her from her father. Her greater involvement with her father led to rejection by her mother, who retaliated by attacking Casey’s deepening investment in acting and her plan to attend an academy for the performing arts. Now Casey was able to get to know her father directly and achieve more separation from her mother. Casey started a profitable business doing odd jobs, moved out of the family home to live with Marissa, and joined a community repertory company.</p>
<p>With less contact with her parents, Casey’s life progressed rapidly. Her drama studies revealed a previously unrecognized aptitude for directing, as well as acting. Her relationship with Marissa became less turbulent and more tender. Casey was comfortable in a more androgynous skin. She was less reactive to her parents’ perturbations. Yet Casey’s newly enhanced emotional accessibility posed a different set of challenges in response to my second pregnancy, two years after the first.</p>

<p>Why is it difficult to tolerate gender ambiguity when it should be clear by now that there is no psychobiological essence of gender identity? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065112468489">Chodorow 1996</xref>). After all, “No woman or man fits the universal gender stereotype” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112468489">Fausto-Sterling 2000</xref>, p. 108). The past century has seen a reformulation from the rigid vision of straightforwardly separate and opposite sexes to three categories of investigation: <italic>biological sex</italic>, which includes chromosomes, genes, hormones, genitals, and other physical markers; <italic>gender</italic>, that is, one’s identification with the behaviors, attitudes, and traits that a society in a given culture and historical period designates as masculine or feminine; and <italic>sexuality</italic>, which relates to one’s erotic desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003065112468489">Meyerowitz 2002</xref>). Many consider nature and dimorphic biological sex to be real, “while gender and culture are seen as constructed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112468489">Fausto-Sterling 2000</xref>, p. 27). But <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112468489">Fausto-Sterling (2000)</xref>, a biologist and historian of science, points out that there are many bodies that mix together anatomical components conventionally attributed to either males or females. Nature offers a wide range of genitalia.</p>
<p>Queer and trans<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003065112468489">5</xref></sup> existences challenge institutions of family, heterosexuality, and reproduction, as well as heteronormative constructs of time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003065112468489">Halberstam 2005</xref>). The ensuing affects can be disturbing and make gender identity difficult to think about. There is a long history in psychoanalysis of dismissing trans experience not only as pathological but also as intrinsically psychotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003065112468489">Kubie 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003065112468489">Quinodoz 1998</xref>), as the clinician may be caught up in countertransferential horror, loss of control, and obliteration of the danger by enforcing gender norms. Corbett delineates this regulatory voice in his discussion of the recent republication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003065112468489">Lawrence Kubie’s “The Drive to Become Both Sexes” (1974)</xref>: “Kubie articulates normative anxiety as it seeks to regulate and define that which is normal, qua healthy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065112468489">Corbett 2011</xref>, p. 443). What might then come into play for any clinician is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065112468489">Dimen (2005)</xref> calls the Eew! Factor, an affective disturbance incorporating an excited disgust that is sometimes sexual, sometimes not. Dimen used the Eew! Factor to examine sexual countertransference, but it applies equally well to gender countertransference, the clinician’s gender unease.</p>
<p>One such troubling enactment occurs in the case of “John/Joan/John.” At eight months of age, the penis of one of a set of twin boys was accidentally ablated during phimosis repair by cautery. His young parents brought nineteen-month-old John to the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic for evaluation. Based on John Money’s theory that early gender is undifferentiated and that the fact that it is easier to make a good vagina than a good penis, an orchiectomy was performed, and the toddler was subsequently raised as a girl, Joan, whose past was kept secret. Joan started receiving estrogen at the age of twelve and grew breasts. Money studied Joan regularly, pronounced her adjustment to being female successful, and reported the case as corroboration of his theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003065112468489">Money and Tucker 1975</xref>). By the age of fourteen, however, Joan refused to return to Money’s clinic or live as a girl, and her father finally told her the truth about her history. Joan changed her name back to John, started testosterone, and at the age of sixteen had a double mastectomy and phalloplasty. The sexologist Milton Diamond eventually took over John’s care. In Diamond’s review of the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065112468489">Diamond and Sigmundson 1997</xref>), John described his reaction to Money’s repeated pressure to have vaginal surgery and live as a female because no one would accept him otherwise: “It dawned on me that these people gotta be pretty shallow if that’s the only thing they think I’ve got going for me; that the only reason people get married and have children and have a productive life is because of what they have between their legs” (p. 301). Considering John’s remarks, the gender theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112468489">Judith Butler (2001)</xref> noted, “We might be tempted to say that there is some core of a person, and so some presumption of humanism, that emerges here, that supervenes the discourses on sexed and gendered intelligibility that constrain him” (p. 634). John committed suicide at the age of thirty-eight. Butler comments: “It is unclear whether it was his gender that was the problem, or the ‘treatment’ that brought about an enduring suffering for him. The norms governing what it is to be a worthy, recognizable, and sustainable human life clearly did not support his life in any continuous or solid way” (2004, p. 74).</p>

<title>Oscillating Maternal Representations</title>
<p>Casey continued her modestly successful business, acted and directed as part of the repertory company, and was living with Marissa. As my girth and breast size increased with my second pregnancy two years following the first, this time Casey did not deny its implications; she destabilized, becoming withdrawn, hostile, and disengaged. She accused me of staring at her crotch, and her panic attacks returned, as did her suspicion that I was in league with her mother to “convert” her to female. Initially I denied the increasing masculinization of Casey’s appearance, thinking it a transferential reaction to my very conspicuous female body and its implications. Was Casey’s hair shorter? Was she more hirsute? Was her voice lower? On some level, I admired Casey’s ability to pass as a male. But when my answering service referred to Casey as “he,” and my next patient referred to Casey as “the man you see the hour before me,” it suddenly occurred to me that Casey had been taking testosterone. I was taken aback by this breach of the treatment contract. As we discussed the myriad meanings of this enactment, I suggested that she seek a consultation with another endocrinologist experienced with transsexual individuals. After a consultation in which my participation included only confirmation of the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the endocrinologist informed Casey of the medical risks and benefits, and agreed to administer and monitor the injections.</p>
<p>Casey was profoundly shaken by our exploration of the meanings of this breach and her dishonesty. She became terrified I would terminate the therapy. Silently, I wondered about the viability of the treatment. Together we considered whether her initiation of male hormones was a rejection of her identification with me as a woman, an identification with the baby’s father, an expression of resentment about yet another intruder into our intimate therapeutic dyad, and/or a repudiation of the treatment. I recalled her remark about the secret of my first pregnancy. Her secret “rebirth” as a “real man” bespoke an enactment that contained, among these other meanings, her hostility toward me (Sidney H. Phillips 2011, personal communication). I said, “I concealed my pregnancies; you’ve retaliated by concealing your gender changes.” She replied, “You have a real man who can give you a real baby.”</p>
<p>These developments led to an opening of material related to gender and sexuality, and the restoration of a more positive working alliance. For the first time, I heard of Casey’s anxieties during my first pregnancy—fears that I would burst or that the baby would be deformed by her jealousy and rage. Casey was now vigilant about my bodily changes and more open about her envious and resentful reactions to my second pregnancy, provoking feelings in me of both exhibitionistic pride and anxious self-consciousness. Perhaps it was her sense of such feelings on my part—and the ways that it echoed her shame in the face of seductive maternal narcissistic displays—that was experienced as an assault on her own procreative capacities, whether viewed in male or female terms. Or had she simply become freer to flex her masculine muscle in response to my flaunting my fertility?</p>
<p>Overt sexual fantasies about me emerged. Casey described with great embarrassment that she had begun thinking about me when she masturbated. My uncharacteristic unease in hearing sexually explicit transference material gave way all too quickly to my own sexual fantasies. I found myself daydreaming about what it might be like for both my partner and me to have breasts, vaginas, and penises. I felt aroused by the many combinations and permutations of sexual activities this would open up. For a time, I wrestled with deeply troubling feelings of hatred and disgust about my own body—its fleshiness, its curves, and my own smell. I dreamt that I became a hermaphrodite by fellating a gay man who bore some physical resemblance to Casey. A nightmare version of the dream ended with my face dissolving into the cosmetically transformed featureless face from a <italic>Twilight Zone</italic> episode that had frightened me as a child.</p>
<p>Once I had engaged and wrestled with my countertransferential horror, I could become intrigued by the apparent success of Casey’s presentation as male, as well as by my anxiety about her transformation. Dreams in which I was both male and female <italic>and neither</italic> suggested a more troubling and complex construction. I recognized my attendant panic that I was losing my grip on my own gender clarity—indeed losing my own sense of self-cohesion in response to the activation of Casey’s fantasy of being simultaneously male and female, hermaphroditic. For a time, I was palpably anxious in anticipation of our sessions; on those mornings I might become mired in obsessional thinking about what outfit to wear (a skirt suit or pants?) or be overcome with nausea, though my brief, mild stint of morning sickness had long passed. I wrestled my resistances to understanding the import of my struggle to see her as “real” in her own terms, as whole, yet incompletely formed. Like a fetus, I thought. And like pregnancy, accompanied by the admixture of exhilaration and grandiose fantasies on one hand and the terror of producing some monstrous creature on the other. I came to see my internal struggle as a reflection of the confluence of my work with this adolescent trans patient, my pregnancy, and their mutual evocation of my own gender questions. In this sense, Casey and I shared liminal states of being that offered the potential for transformative creative resolution/dissolution, confusion, and abjection. With this understanding, I was better able to tolerate and make therapeutic use of the ebb and flow of my own cisgendered, transgendered, and genderless internal states and their attendant affects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Casey was not only conflicted about her maleness and femaleness; she also unconsciously maintained ambiguity in order to defend against perceptions of her mother’s fear and hatred of men and perceptions of her father’s fear and hatred of women. Casey recalled thinking as a child how wonderful it would be to be both male and female: “I would be better than anybody else, because I would have it all. And I would be safe because I thought that maybe God was like that.” I offered interpretations of the grandiose hermaphroditic fantasy as a defense against Casey’s profound emptiness, and the humiliating confrontation with her feminine desires. Maintaining the unconscious fantasy of unlimited gender possibilities, “remaining camouflaged” as she put it, was also a defense against a mother who saw Casey only as a narcissistic extension of herself and against the similarly perceived threat posed by her father. My interpretations led to Casey’s developing a profound, debilitating, and extended depression during which she appeared to mourn the demise of her newly conscious hermaphroditic fantasy. Casey stopped working, left her theater studies and her drama group, and angrily withdrew from important relationships.</p>
<p>Yet for the first time, Casey reflected on the feminine aspects of her early life, like her pleasure in doll-play and cooking that previously had been disavowed. She spoke more freely about her relationship with Marissa, and remembered that early in their relationship they would role-play soap opera characters (“I wasn’t half-bad as a girl”), alternating the male and female roles. She remarked, “Sometimes I feel like just a husk—acting the part, so afraid that my femininity will be unmasked.” She was also struck by the lack of any interest or involvement by either of her parents in anything feminine about her. Their indifference to her at those times stirred the most disturbing feelings of all—those of not being real, of being amorphous, invisible, abject. I recalled my own nightmare of becoming faceless, de-faced. I reminded her of her earlier fantasies of God as a hermaphrodite and wondered if her adolescent wish to be everything was an effort to deny the fears of nothingness, of the void, or permeability. Casey responded: “I’m sure that’s why I couldn’t talk to you about being Johnny Depp in the beginning, or about my doubts about my maleness. I needed to believe that I could be male, I could be somebody special and wonderful. Somebody who wasn’t my mother or even anybody my mother knew or cared about. I didn’t believe I was anybody. I thought I was some haphazard, random collection of vapors that could dissipate or reconstitute at any moment. The idea of being Johnny Depp kept me alive.”</p>
<p>Rather than a delusion, Casey’s conviction that she was Johnny Depp had been a cherished adolescent reverie, consolidating the search for a way to feel tangible, viable, solid. It yielded to anxiety, and then to our work unpacking its meaning and function, while Casey maintained her maleness. She began to put her life together again, attending the honors program of a regional liberal arts college, and fending off her mother’s incessant efforts to entangle her. Casey stayed involved with Marissa but dated other women, although she permitted herself greater latitude in her behavior and acted less self-consciously macho. Although at times she could revert to angry suspiciousness with me, it was easier to forestall descent into paranoid thinking. Casey’s shifting states can be understood as a reflection of instability of the self. However, with respect to these cycles of stability/instability, paranoia/depression, and reintegration we must emphasize that they were also late adolescent, largely <italic>progressive</italic> efforts, in the context of a wider social environment hostile to trans people, to consolidate multiple levels of experience within a more complex and nuanced sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003065112468489">Salamon and Corbett 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our understanding of Casey’s shifting states is also consistent with the implications of a point made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003065112468489">Loewald (1951)</xref>: “people shift considerably, from day to day, at different periods in their lives, in different moods and situations, from one such level to other levels. In fact, it would seem that people are more alive (though not necessarily more ‘stable’), the broader their range of ego-reality levels is” (p. 18). He developed this idea further a decade later, noting that “ego-development is a process of increasingly higher integration and differentiation of the psychic apparatus” and that consolidations “follow periods of relative ego-disorganization and reorganization, characterized by ego-regression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003065112468489">Loewald 1960</xref>, p. 17). Although he remained bound by traditional views of the gender binary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003065112468489">Loewald 1978</xref>), his understanding of psychic health contemplates “an optimal, although by no means necessarily conscious, communication between unconscious and preconscious, between the infantile, archaic stages and structures of the psychic apparatus and its later stages and structures of organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003065112468489">1960</xref>, p. 32).</p>
<p>Over time Casey realized that her rigidified masculine presentation and unconscious hermaphroditic gender identity were based not only on efforts to distance herself, but also on a desire to remain connected to her mesmerizing and seductive, yet volatile and malicious, mother. Casey vacillated between tolerating the ambiguities of her gender identities and repudiating her feminine aspects. She requested a consultation with a gender identity clinic in a distant state and, after rescheduling several appointments, was evaluated and approved for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). Casey attributed her fear of going to the gender identity program as anxiety about possibly being denied the approval for SRS. She discussed the importance of permanently removing signs of femaleness, especially her breasts and menses; yet she was “less sure about having a penis, they’re pretty strange.” When Casey was home from college, her mother began demanding rent so as not to provide any financial support, even indirect, for the SRS. It was at this time that Casey changed his name to Brad and asked that male pronouns be used in talking about him. Although I had anticipated this transition from the outset, I found the change embarrassingly difficult. I had fancied myself flexibly cool about these matters and psychologically prepared for this shift, but I stumbled frequently at first and tellingly later on with his new name and with the male pronouns. I was reminded of how stunningly difficult it had been even to construct a coherent sentence when years earlier I had first met a heterogeneous group of pre- and post-transition trans patients at the Gender Dysphoria Program at Case Western Reserve. My experience of confusion, and shame about that confusion, was a powerful demonstration for me that even the most mundane exchanges are prefigured by our presumed knowledge of the other’s gender. For his part, Brad was remarkably forgiving and often amused, but also reflective about its implications both for us and for family, friends, and colleagues who knew him as female.</p>
<p>My slips in using his new name and gender pronouns seemed to occur most commonly in the context of unrecognized aggression, for example during a session following a particularly vivid description of his hatred of his (my?) breasts and his wish to “have them cut away from [his] chest.” I keenly felt, but did not share with him, the sense of assault on my larger, engorged breasts that were a source of pleasure for me. Similarly, when he and his father resumed their mutual interest in gun collecting, Brad, quoting his father, reported, “He said, ‘She’s a beauty!’” which I misunderstood as a reference to Brad, not their recent purchase of an M80. “Hey, Dr. Marcus, even my dad remembers to use ‘he’ now!” In this instance I did share with Brad my associations of masculinity with violence generally and with his own past violent moments.</p>
<p>I had doubts about Brad’s proceeding with SRS; it wasn’t clear to me to what extent my anxiety stemmed from an unconscious agenda to “cure her of her maleness,” of which he had accused me, an “evidenced-based” concern about the outcome, or a projective identificatory process that was occurring in which I became the repository of his anxiety. My own anxiety felt unbearable, as I was tossed between my fascination with his transitioning body as an erotic object and my own wishes to move fluidly between maleness and femaleness.</p>
<p>In his own panic about SRS, Brad spent hours in the medical school library examining surgical textbooks and pictures of “mutilated bodies.” He expressed grave concern about becoming a “freakish in-between,” neither male nor female, noting that he felt acutely uncomfortable as a tuxedoed usher at his cousin’s recent wedding. Brad had disparaged his breasts since puberty, referring to them as “globs of fat on my chest.” On one hand, his diminutive nipples were a bitter reminder that he had a clitoris, not a penis; on the other hand, they were no match for my milk-engorged breasts. He ratcheted up his workout routine to maximize his chest musculature. It was painful and suffocatingly hot to bind his breasts daily with tight elastic bandages in order to pass as a male. He worried about being discovered through inadvertent contact or what we might call a “wardrobe malfunction.” He was concerned about scarring. While he abhorred having his breasts touched, he also realized that they were a potential locus to give and receive pleasure. He mourned their impending loss.</p>
<p>Although Brad withdrew his application for SRS at that point, and was more questioning of his maleness, after extensive exploration of the multiple meanings and myriad irrevocable implications, he had “chest surgery,” a double mastectomy, in order to bring his body into alignment with his experience of himself as male. Over time Brad and I understood that, paradoxically, his more secure maleness was enhanced by divesting himself of his actual breasts, while simultaneously embracing the female sources of nurturance in himself and me. Brad had no intention of having phalloplasty, preferring the use of dildos to a functionally and cosmetically inferior penis, giving him a mixed body. Such bodies resonate with our associations to miscegenation, and questions as to how gender is located in the body.</p>

<title>Subjectivity and Objectivity Converge</title>
<p>Our experience is consistent with those who argue that gender identity is configured differently in different people and follows multiple pathways toward uncharted outcomes, all of which are compromise formations that have degrees of adaptive value and that may share commonalities, while being unique to the individual and his or her personal history. What we hope for our patients’ explorations of gender is not different from what we strive for in any other realm of psychoanalytic inquiry and for ourselves as psychoanalysts and psychotherapists: a spirit of open-minded inquiry unencumbered by prejudice; receptivity to the myriad, often incongruent, evolving crosscurrents of unconscious fantasy in ourselves and others; the ability to move fluidly between the conscious mind and multiple levels of the unconscious in ways that enrich our experience; and the capacity to integrate new or previously disavowed experiences of self into an ever expanding, more complex yet differentiated awareness of self.</p>
<p>Something holds us back from full acceptance of the no longer revolutionary concept that gender identity is a compromise formation unconstrained by the feminine/masculine binary. Like Kubie, we still insist “that the recognition of sexual difference—anchored in anatomy and reproduced in the natural order of heterosexual complementarity—is the linchpin of psychic reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065112468489">Corbett 2011</xref>, p. 446). Psychoanalytic journals have regularly published gender theorists who have written convincingly about the importance to the health of both patients and psychoanalysis of subjecting categories of gender, sexuality, and desire to critical scrutiny and of deemphasizing or eliminating developmental rubrics. Most contemporary theorists have rejected the use of causal or predictive models of identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112468489">Auchincloss and Vaughan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065112468489">Chodorow 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065112468489">Corbett 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065112468489">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065112468489">Dahl 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003065112468489">Dimen 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003065112468489">Harris 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003065112468489">Mayes 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003065112468489">Yanof 2000</xref>). But “we are still drawn to taking normative gender as the superior outcome, even though it hurts and is harmful” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003065112468489">Goldner 2011a</xref>, p. 154). “Analytic deconstruction too easily drifts into a search for psychopathology, which makes the search for meaning unsafe” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003065112468489">Goldner 2011b</xref>, p. 167). Additionally, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003065112468489">Moss (1992)</xref> points out, little appears in the psychoanalytic literature about racisms and “the eroticized disaffinities”—about homophobia rather than retheorizing homosexualities, or about misogyny rather than reproblematizing female sexuality. We have a blind spot around the meaning and impact of being (hetero)normative in a queer society. As the baseline, the standard, cisgender heterosexual men and women are very special, the uniquely standard people, much the same way that for many whites, white people are the uniquely standard people and for many Americans, English is the uniquely standard language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112468489">Altman 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Transphobia appears to generate extreme and unbearable states of mind perhaps similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003065112468489">Moss (2002)</xref> has described as occurring in internalized homophobia in both homosexual and heterosexual men. Moss conceptualized internalized homophobia as multilayered, incorporating both relatively accessible ideas and “profoundly inaccessible unconscious dynamics,” whose original source of anxiety is “the idea that a particular homoerotic impulse is dangerous” (p. 29). Violence toward homosexual men occurs when repression, displacement, fear, and hatred have failed and what is left is “an intolerable mix of sexual and murderous impulses” (p. 24). But although one can correlate homophobia and transphobia, Moss’s conceptualization is predicated on the binaries of heterosexual/homosexual and masculine/feminine, so subject and object are easily identifiable as me/us or them.</p>
<p>For queer or trans identities, we can follow Dimen and invoke Julia Kristeva’s ideas about abjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003065112468489">1982</xref>), a state of being wretched, degraded, or debased, and its affects of humiliation, shame, and disgust. The abject has to do with “what disturbs identity, system, order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003065112468489">Kristeva 1982</xref>, p. 4). According to Kristeva, the abject is “radically excluded and draws me toward the place where meaning collapses.” The abject is neither subject nor object: “Not me. Not that. But not nothing, either. A something that I do not recognize as a thing” (p. 2). Abjection is a liminal state, represented by aspects of the body that disturb singular bodily integrity and evoke fascinated disgust, such as corpses, feces, snot, or menstrual blood. Similarly, when gender is fluid or ambiguous, the therapist may react with the primal fear caused by the breakdown of distinctions, rather than “staying in the only place that is his, <italic>the void</italic>” to begin hearing, “actually to listen to himself build up a discourse around the braided horror and fascination” (p. 209). For Kristeva, the first abject(ion) is birth, with its primary repudiation of the maternal. Both of us are fascinated that the major turning point in Brad’s psychotherapy was his therapist’s second pregnancy, when both patient and therapist were in uncannily fluid/liminal states of abjection. This is consistent with nonlinear dynamic systems theory, in which development is not incremental, but abruptly discontinuous.</p>
<p>In a psychoanalytic world that embraces both modern, epigenetically informed science and postmodern receptivity to a multiplicity of gender narratives, how do we conceptualize optimal psychological health without resorting to a mindless essentialism, a disembodied infinitude of unspecifiable gender (or genderless) paradigms, or an insistence on restrictive and prescriptive developmental lines leading to a binary gender outcome? One’s own fascinated disgust threatens therapeutic neutrality yet provides a window into countertransferential degendered horror. As in <italic>A Nightmare on Elm Street</italic>, successful work with trans patients challenges the analyst to enter liminal states on the frontier of real and imagined genders.</p>
