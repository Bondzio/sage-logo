<abstract>
<p>Information on state-level health information technology (HIT) adoption will become increasingly important with the implementation of incentive payments to accelerate uptake. Recognizing this, the Rhode Island Department of Health selected physician HIT adoption as a subject for its legislatively mandated quality reporting program. This article discusses the state’s process for developing HIT adoption measures, including the importance of stakeholder involvement in the development of a survey and the difficulty of accurately defining electronic medical record (EMR) adoption. This article describes the challenges in defining “true” EMRs, which may be addressed, in part, by ensuring local consensus about EMR measures and by piloting the survey and measures, prior to public reporting or the calculation of a statewide baseline. It also presents results from the 2009 administration of this survey to all 3,883 Rhode Island–licensed physicians providing direct patient care.</p>

<p>Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve quality by increasing compliance with recommended standards, reducing medical errors, and otherwise improving coordination of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558711423839">Chaudhry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711423839">Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558711423839">Parente &amp; McCullough, 2009</xref>). Recognizing this, in 2008, the Rhode Island Department of Health selected physician HIT adoption as a new focus area for its legislatively-mandated healthcare quality reporting program and embarked on the development and implementation of a physician HIT survey. The survey was piloted statewide in 2008 and was first publicly reported in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558711423839">Rhode Island Department of Health, 2010</xref>). As the first and only state in the nation to publicly report structural and process measures of HIT adoption for every licensed physician providing direct patient care, Rhode Island’s process to date and 2009 results provide direction for others systematically assessing the adoption and use of electronic medical records (EMRs) and e-prescribing.</p>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558711423839">Office of the National Coordinator for HIT (2011)</xref>, comprehensive and easily accessible health care data can enhance the delivery of high-quality health care by ensuring that physicians have access to accurate information and evidence-based decision support at the point of care. This has the potential to shift medical practice from reactive to proactive care management models, such as the patient-centered medical home model, and support physicians in better diagnosis and treatment, through real-time access to medical histories, risk factors, and past treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558711423839">Buntin, Burke, Hoaglin, &amp; Blumenthal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558711423839">Hansagi, Olsson, Hussain, &amp; Ohlen, 2008</xref>). HIT may also enhance health care efficiency and patient safety by eliminating the duplication of tests and procedures while also preventing medication errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558711423839">Bates et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558711423839">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, opinion leaders such as the Institute of Medicine have advocated for the systematic implementation of EMRs, e-prescribing, and other core functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711423839">Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite widespread potential, HIT adoption remains limited in both acute and ambulatory care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558711423839">Ash, Gorman, &amp; Hersh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711423839">Hing, Burt, &amp; Woodwell, 2007</xref>), with recent surveys by the American Health Association (in 2008) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, in 2009) estimating the use of basic functionalities at approximately 10% for hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558711423839">Jha et al., 2009</xref>) and 25% for ambulatory care, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711423839">Hsiao, Hing, Socey, &amp; Cai, 2010</xref>). The implementation of EMRs, in particular, incurs significant up-front investment of direct financial costs and changes in workforce culture and practice, so it is not surprising that evidence suggests that physicians’ uptake of functionalities with financial benefits (which help them recoup costs) is outpacing the use of functionalities directly related to quality and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558711423839">Poon et al., 2006</xref>). It may also partially explain why studies evaluating the association between EMR adoption and improved outcomes report mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558711423839">Linder, Ma, Bates, Middleton, &amp; Stafford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558711423839">Welch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558711423839">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), despite randomized, controlled trials linking electronic decision support use, specifically, with improved quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558711423839">Dexheimer, Talbot, Sanders, Rosenbloom, &amp; Aronsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558711423839">Sequist et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This article describes the stakeholder consensus process by which the Rhode Island Department of Health and its public reporting contractor, Healthcentric Advisors, developed and refined a survey to publicly report Rhode Island physicians’ HIT adoption. Rhode Island’s public reporting of physician HIT adoption aligns with local and national policies to provide incentives both for HIT adoption and for the use of specific functionalities to improve patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558711423839">Office of the National Coordinator for HIT, 2011</xref>). Between 2007 and 2009, the state’s Medicaid managed care program and two largest commercial insurers began offering HIT-based payments. Nationally, the 2008 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated close to $30 billion in Federal funding to support the widespread adoption of HIT. Beginning in 2011, physicians and acute-care hospitals are eligible for payments through the Medicare and Medicaid programs for meaningful use of HIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558711423839">Blumenthal &amp; Tavenner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558711423839">Bruen, Ku, Burke, &amp; Butin, 2011</xref>). As a result, the Rhode Island Department of Health’s structural and process measures of HIT adoption are intended to capture both the adoption of HIT and its “meaningful” integration into patient care, as defined by local stakeholder consensus.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077558711423839">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Although national surveys estimate physicians’ EMR adoption in acute and ambulatory care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558711423839">Jha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711423839">Hsiao et al., 2010</xref>), these studies are based on representative samples and not comprehensive identifiable data, and do not include both hospital and office practice settings. To our knowledge, Rhode Island is the first and only state to publicly report structural and process measures of HIT adoption for every licensed physician providing direct patient care, regardless of practice site. As a result, this article contributes to the public reporting and HIT adoption literature in several important ways. First, the Rhode Island Department of Health’s survey development process can inform other states’ efforts to convene stakeholders and develop or tailor a survey instrument. Second, although home health, hospital, and nursing home clinical outcomes data are reported at both the state and the federal levels, public reporting remains uncommon for physicians, in part, because no uniform administrative dataset exists for clinical reporting. Previous physician-specific reporting efforts have focused largely on outcomes, such as the release of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Mortality in New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558711423839">New York State Department of Health, 2010</xref>). While physician reporting may increase as greater numbers of physicians enroll in Medicare’s Physician Quality Reporting System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711423839">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2011</xref>) or apply for Meaningful Use reimbursement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558711423839">Blumenthal &amp; Tavenner, 2010</xref>), other states may be interested in adapting Rhode Island’s survey instrument and metrics to undertake primary data collection. Finally, this article presents publicly reported data from the 2009 baseline survey, illustrating how Rhode Island used these data locally to focus public attention on physicians’ integration of HIT into patient care, encourage peer competition, and tailor EMR adoption strategies to physician groups.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1077558711423839">
<title>Survey and Measures</title>
<p>The Rhode Island Department of Health and its public reporting contractor, Healthcentric Advisors, adapted EMR prevalence and use questions (with permission) from an instrument developed by Drs. David Bates and Steven Simon for use in Massachusetts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558711423839">Simon, Kaushal, Cleary, Jenter, Volk, &amp; Orav, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558711423839">Simon, Kaushal, Cleary, Jenter, Volk, &amp; Poon, 2007</xref>) and then used a public-private partnership to tailor the survey to suit local stakeholders’ needs. The objective was to develop a survey instrument to administer annually to all physicians. By partnering with stakeholders and then making data publicly available, we aimed to eliminate duplicate or competing requests for information from physicians and ensure alignment among local measurement efforts. Alignment included consensus around definitions (e.g., what do we consider an EMR?) and how to aggregate and present the data (e.g., composite measures reflecting the extent to which EMRs are used for “basic” and “advanced” functionalities). A copy of the survey instrument is available from the lead author on request.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077558711423839">
<title>Target Population</title>
<p>The Department of Health and Healthcentric Advisors used the state’s physician licensure database to target licensed physicians who currently provide direct patient care. We included medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathy (DOs) with active Rhode Island licenses; all physicians who indicated in their licensure applications that they provide direct patient care or had missing responses to this question; and physicians with mailing addresses in all states, not just Rhode Island and its immediate neighbors (practice locations may change during the two years between licensure and relicensure). We then verified eligibility by asking respondents for their Rhode Island license number, license type (MD, DO, or nonphysician), and if they currently provided direct patient care services (Yes/No).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077558711423839">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>We administered the survey electronically over the course of three weeks in January and February 2009 using a web-based survey tool, SurveyMonkey. We sent hard copy letters to all 3,883 physicians in the Rhode Island licensure database who met the above criteria, notifying them of the requirement to complete the survey. The survey is part of a legislative mandate for health care quality reporting (State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, 1998), and physicians were warned that they would be penalized for nonresponse by receiving “failing” scores for the HIT measures (i.e., being publicly reported as not using HIT). Additionally, we emailed the 2,004 physicians (51.6%) who provided the Department of Health with an email address in their licensure application and had not previously unsubscribed from SurveyMonkey email. This subset of the total population received the hard copy letter, an initial email, and up to two follow-up emails (two weeks and two days prior to the deadline), if they had not responded using the emailed link prior to those time points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558711423839">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We linked survey and licensure data to create an analytic data set including physician identifiers (licensure number and National Provider Identifier or NPI), survey data elements (see Survey Instrument), year of graduation from medical school, and demographics from either the survey (respondents) or the licensure (nonrespondents). We limited analysis to the 1,893 respondents who were physicians with current addresses in Rhode Island or one of the two adjacent states (Connecticut or Massachusetts). All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). To determine statistically significant between-group differences, we performed chi-square tests of significance for categorical variables and <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables.</p>

<title>Survey Development</title>
<p>After adapting EMR prevalence and use questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558711423839">Simon, Kaushal, Cleary, Jenter, Volk, &amp; Orav, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558711423839">Simon, Kaushal, Cleary, Jenter, Volk, &amp; Poon, 2007</xref>), the Department of Health and its public reporting contractor, Healthcentric Advisors, met with a series of stakeholders in Fall 2007 to vet the draft survey instrument and measures. Stakeholder meetings included the Department of Human Services (Medicaid), commercial health plans, and existing workgroups, including a physician group regularly convened by the Director of the Department of Health and an HIT adoption group led by the Rhode Island Quality Institute, the state’s regional health information organization (RHIO). Stakeholder meeting participants included academics, physicians, and HIT professionals. We also obtained feedback from a survey design expert at Brown University’s Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research.</p>
<p>At each meeting, we shared draft copies of the survey instrument and measures, and then completed informal cognitive testing. During the group discussion, we asked stakeholders to “walk through” the survey verbally, as though completing it—sharing their interpretation of the questions and answer choices, as well as their thoughts on questions to add, delete, or edit. We also asked for consensus on five metrics for public reporting, including how to categorize and aggregate data reflecting physicians’ use of 16 EMR functionalities into composite measures of “basic” and “advanced” EMR adoption (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558711423839">Table 1</xref>). These composite measures assign scores based on the frequency with which physicians use each functionality (0%, &lt;30%, 30% to 60%, &gt;60%), rather than present dichotomous data (Yes/No) indicating whether or not they are used. This was an important outcome, since it enabled the Department of Health to distill granular information for health care consumers and allowed all stakeholders, including the Department of Health, to easily and consistently track longitudinal trends. After incorporating stakeholder suggestions, we returned to each group twice: first to obtain their endorsement of the final survey instrument and measures and then to share the 2009 baseline results. This iterative process allowed us to demonstrate to stakeholders that their feedback was heard and incorporated, while resolving any remaining questions. By the end of the process, there was substantial consensus about the survey instrument, with the only disagreements centered on the feasibility of asking physicians to provide data annually.</p>

<p>Most stakeholder suggestions involved minor edits and additions, such as adding local EMR vendors to the answer choices or linking to information about e-prescribing Schedule II-IV medications. Some of the edits reflected unique local needs. For example, the Rhode Island Quality Institute, the state’s RHIO, asked for group consensus and input on high-performance benchmarks for EMR and e-prescribing adoption, to enable longitudinal tracking for its strategic plan. Notably, the health plans requested edits to help them use survey data to determine primary care physicians’ (PCPs’) eligibility for their HIT-based payments (incentives or fee increases). This included Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Rhode Island requesting an additional EMR adoption measure, matching “qualified” EMR criteria for PCP fee increases. The most substantial edits, made after a statewide pilot in 2008, involved asking EMR adopters about their perception of barriers and tailoring the survey wording for office- and hospital-based physicians to reflect the specific nature of each practice site’s clinical practices. The EMR barrier question was originally asked only of nonadopters, but we found that EMR adopters wanted an opportunity to provide thoughts, feedback, and policy direction, even though these data are not publicly reported.</p>
<p>The final survey instrument includes the following key features: physician identifiers (license number and NPI); demographic data, such as specialty; practice information, including site (hospital or office) and size; information about the adoption and frequency of use of key EMR functionalities, when the functionalities are applicable to their practice; information about the use of e-prescribing; and perceptions of barriers to HIT adoption. The 2009 results are the state baseline, the first data to be publicly reported at the individual physician level.</p>

<title>Electronic Medical Record Adoption</title>
<p>Overall, two-thirds of respondents (67.6%) report using an integrated electronic clinical information system that tracks patient health data in their main practice or any other practice site (Measure 1), although a more restrictive definition limiting EMRs to “qualified” systems (Measure 2) that are Certification Commission on Health Information Technology (CCHIT) certified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558711423839">CCHIT, 2010</xref>) and support certain functionalities, such as e-prescribing, reduces prevalence to 12.5% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711423839">Table 3</xref>). If CCHIT certification is excluded from the measure, the prevalence rises to 22.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 429). Both measures differ by practice site, with office-based physicians less likely to have an EMR (58.4% vs. 83.4%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) but more likely to have a “qualified” EMR (16.4% vs. 5.8%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Overall, more than half of respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 685, 53.4%) report EMRs from vendors classified by the authors as recognized commercial vendors, more than a third “don’t know” their vendor (<italic>n</italic> = 472, 36.9%,), and nearly one in 10 are noncommercial/homegrown systems or non-EMRs, such as e-prescribing systems (<italic>n</italic> = 116, 9.1%). Among 685 commercial vendors, respondents self-reported 268 (39.1%) as CCHIT certified, though the authors’ analysis indicates that CCHIT certification could be as high as 90.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 621), depending on the product and version.</p>

<title>Electronic Medical Record Use</title>
<p>When examining physicians’ use of various EMR functionalities among respondents with any EMR (Measure 1), average use is higher for basic versus advanced functionalities: 63.6 on a 100-point scale for basic functionalities (Measure 3) and 44.1 points for advanced functionalities (Measure 4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711423839">Table 3</xref>). Basic EMR functionality use is higher, on average, among office-based respondents (66.5 vs. 60.2 points, <italic>p</italic> = .0003) and lower in advanced functionality use (37.8 vs. 51.4 points, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). The measures of EMR functionality use have wide variation across the 100-point scale, with a peak at 0 points for the advanced functionality measure (Measure 4) and a peak at 100 points for both functionality measures (Measures 3 and 4). The frequency of use of each the individual functionalities included in the calculation of Measures 3 and 4 also shows significant variation, from use in 0% of applicable patient encounters to use in more than 60% of encounters. However, a majority of EMR users (<italic>n</italic> = 731, 57.5%) are using all six basic functionalities at least 60% of the time and nearly half (<italic>n</italic> = 577, 45.1%) are using all 10 advanced functionalities at least 60% of the time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although information on state-level HIT adoption will become increasingly important with the implementation of state and federal incentive payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558711423839">Blumenthal &amp; Tavenner, 2010</xref>), to our knowledge, Rhode Island is the first and only state to publicly report HIT adoption for every licensed physician. By publishing physician-level data, the Rhode Island Department of Health aims to evaluate longitudinal trends in HIT adoption and also accelerate uptake, by encouraging benchmarking, by encouraging peer competition, and by tailoring EMR adoption strategies to specific physician groups. This article discusses Rhode Island’s process for developing a standardized physician HIT adoption survey and tailoring it to local needs, providing a framework that others can adapt when embarking on efforts to systematically measure, track, and report HIT adoption over time. The Department of Health uses this survey to publish annual reports assessing HIT adoption for every physician providing direct patient care, regardless of practice site (office or hospital). The structural and process measures in these reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558711423839">Table 1</xref>) allow healthcare stakeholders throughout the state to assess longitudinal trends in EMR and e-prescribing penetration and use, using common definitions, metrics, and benchmarks, thus helping to align intra-state efforts to promote HIT adoption and also to streamline data requests to physicians, increasing the likelihood that they respond.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and its public reporting contractor, Healthcentric Advisors, met with numerous stakeholders to tailor the survey instrument and measures and to generate buy-in for the survey process and results. We specifically sought physician input and involvement, meeting with a physician group regularly convened by the Director of the Department of Health and an HIT adoption group led by the state’s RHIO. These groups include opinion leaders who are well respected within the physician community and reflect a diverse array of specialties and practices settings. We use a similar provider engagement model for public reporting in the home health, hospital, and nursing home settings; convening open meetings with clinicians who work in those settings; and piloting data collection before publicly reporting identifiable results. Our experience demonstrates that active and sustained engagement is vital to ensuring that providers trust published data and use the information to elevate quality. Physician participation was particularly important for this survey, given physicians’ competing priorities, time constraints, and the fact that physicians are accustomed to receiving payment to respond to surveys or otherwise provide data. The Department of Health’s survey request did not offer monetary compensation, although response was “mandatory”: Physician-level data in the public reports identified nonrespondents as failing the measures (i.e., not using EMRs and not e-prescribing).</p>
<p>Other states may be interested in adapting Rhode Island’s survey instrument and metrics to undertake primary data collection. As described above, public reporting remains relatively uncommon for physicians, in part because no uniform administrative dataset exists for clinical reporting. This may change over time as greater numbers of physicians enroll in Medicare’s Physician Quality Reporting System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711423839">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2011</xref>) or apply for Meaningful Use reimbursement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558711423839">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009</xref>). However, in the absence of interoperable EMR reporting systems or other databases that can automate data collection and analysis, minimally burdensome measures are essential markers of HIT adoption. Engaging physicians and other stakeholders helped us build local consensus about essential EMR functionalities. The five measures that resulted from this process are relatively simple structural and process measures of HIT adoption and use, which are easy to capture using self-reported data.</p>
<p>Our composite measures (basic and advanced EMR use) summarize the detailed functionalities shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711423839">Table 3</xref> and are intended to move beyond the dichotomous structural measures of EMR presence to process measures assessing level of adoption: the extent to which physicians use EMR functionalities, when these functionalities are present. The composite measures facilitate Rhode Island’s longitudinal tracking and distill complex information for consumer audiences, who may have low health literacy. Although the way in which our state has categorized functionalities may appear arbitrary to some audiences, these composite measures are consensus-based and reflect local stakeholders’ input. The measures illustrate the difficulty of systematically capturing and presenting EMR adoption and use in the absence of nationally-validated and endorsed metrics (e.g., from the National Quality Forum). Other states may choose to present their results differently, depending on local preferences or needs.</p>
<p>We include baseline results from the 2009 survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711423839">Table 3</xref>), which further demonstrate how difficult it is to capture uniform information on HIT adoption and use. Although our e-prescribing estimate (Measure 5) is consistent with the Department of Health’s internal data from a local vendor, EMR data are more difficult to capture and validate. Our data indicate that there is a wide discrepancy between physicians who respond “Yes,” that they have an EMR (Measure 1) and those whose electronic systems local stakeholders consider ‘true’ or ‘qualified’ EMRs (Measure 2). This is an expected consequence of limiting qualified EMRs to those with specific functionalities and national certification. This measure also incorporates commercial health plans’ standards for HIT-based incentive payments, which are understandably stringent; office-based Rhode Island PCPs are eligible to receive these payments. However, the variance between the two estimates illustrates the wide range in physicians’ perception about whether their electronic system is considered an EMR. Our analyses of EMR vendor data (not shown) demonstrate that 10% of the EMRs identified by physicians are noncommercial systems or are not EMRs (e.g., practice management software). Altogether, these findings highlight the importance, both locally and nationally, of developing structural measures of EMR adoption that embody consistent definitions and expectations.</p>
<p>While we do not have data to compare respondents to nonrespondents, the survey data have several limitations that suggest that respondents differ significantly. First, we administered the survey electronically using a web-based survey tool, requiring respondents to have access to an Internet-enabled computer (or request assistance). We also notified physicians that nonresponse would be reported as nonuse of HIT, so physicians without HIT (for whom this assumption was correct) may have elected to ignore the survey. Altogether, these factors likely resulted in a sampling bias favoring physicians with HIT. Second, the state’s two dominant commercial health plans provide HIT-based payments to PCPs and used survey data, to varying extents, to verify eligibility for their payments. As a result, PCPs may have been more likely to respond to the survey than specialists. Finally, knowledge that the Department of Health would publicly report data at the individual (identifiable) physician level may have also motivated respondents to overestimate their HIT use, whether consciously or unconsciously. Our experience demonstrates that providers are highly motivated by reputation (among patients/consumers) and competition (with peers). For PCPs, any affidavits or audits that the health plans require for their HIT-based payments may mitigate this effect. Although the Department of Health does not audit results, future enforcement efforts may include tying participation to the state licensure process.</p>
<p>Based on Rhode Island’s experiences, we recommend that other states considering the systematic collection and reporting of physicians HIT adoption engage stakeholder groups, including health plans and physicians; use metrics that take into account local priorities and national criteria, such as Federal Meaningful Use; assess the feasibility of collecting data at regular intervals; and evaluate both the presence (structural measures) and use (process measures) of HIT. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558711423839">Table 3</xref> illustrates the challenges that remain in increasing physicians’ actual use of available functionality, but the implementation of policies and payment structures to support increased uptake show promise and we will continue to evaluate change against the 2009 Rhode Island baseline. Future research will also include analyses to assess response bias, barriers to EMR adoption, and the association between incentive payments and self-report of HIT adoption.</p>
