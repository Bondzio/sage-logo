<p>Discussions of networked journalism stretch back at least as far as the arrival of the telegraph in the mid 19th century, when it became apparent to commentators of the day that technological imperatives were recasting journalism’s relationships with time, space and place. Efforts to rethink the nature of these relationships in a digital era received fresh impetus following the publication of Manuel Castells’s <italic>The Rise of the Network Society</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712473416">1996</xref>. The first volume of a trilogy intended to map the global forces transforming ‘the space of flows and timeless time’ indicative of ‘the material foundations of a new culture’ (p. 375), it represented a key intervention for critical research into how networked media and communication technologies were reshaping the role of news organisations in modern democracies. Castells’s subsequent contention that information be regarded as the ‘privileged political weapon in the Internet Age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712473416">2001</xref>: 158) has continued to resonate, inviting lively debate about how online journalism needs to evolve in order to better serve the civic priorities of globalising public spheres.</p>
<p>The books under review make a compelling case for further elaborating the concept of networking when exploring diverse modes of news-making in public culture. Of the two, Russell paints with the broader brush, striving to capture the shifting features of what she calls a ‘transformative era in the history of media’ on a canvas stretching from 1990 to 2010. Networked journalism, by her definition, is ‘journalism that sees publics acting as creators, investigators, reactors, (re)makers, and (re)distributors of news and where all variet[ies] of media, amateurs and professionals, corporate and independent products and interests intersect at a new level’ (p. 1). The ‘new news reality’ revolves around a shift in power, Russell argues, which can be demonstrated by closely scrutinising what she considers to be three crucial dimensions: ‘amateur and non-market production; the role of niche and special-interest groups in opening up and “networking” the news environment; and the ascendance of the aesthetics of parody, remix, and appropriation’ (p. 21). Using these mutually reinforcing characteristics as the organising structure of the book, she proceeds to develop a conceptually led enquiry informed by analyses of different instances of news reporting, as well as by data drawn from more than 60 interviews with news media producers working in the different national contexts.</p>
<p>Following the introductory chapter, Russell turns to the interlinkages between changing conceptions of journalism on the one hand and those of networked publics on the other. In discerning tenets of what she terms the ‘empowered publics narrative’, particular attention is devoted to the ways in which news organisations (e.g. the BBC’s User-Generated Content Hub) and related projects (e.g. the <italic>Huffington Post</italic>’s collaboration with Jay Rosen’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Newsassignment.net">Newsassignment.net</ext-link> to create ‘Off the Bus’ election campaign coverage, or Swiss magazine <italic>L’Hebdo</italic>’s Bondy Blog to cover the 2005 riots in France) draw ordinary citizens into the production process. Such initiatives often prove to be remarkably successful, she finds, though tempered by a certain institutional reluctance to fully embrace the participatory potential of the ‘new news environment’. Chapter 3 signals a more challenging stance by bringing the ‘narrative of decline’ to the fore, namely the perception that the quality of news reporting – and thereby public life – is being eroded by emergent technologies combined with market demands. Taking issue with overtly negative inflections of this narrative, Russell traces how early attempts at the personalisation of the news (‘the daily me’) evolved via ‘Web 2.0’ technologies into the socialisation of the news (‘the daily we’). Online news coverage of the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in December, 2009 serves to illustrate how new partnerships, platforms and practices converged to generate richly interactive forms of reporting of considerable value to communities otherwise neglected by ‘old-style journalism’. Chapter 4 further extends this line of critique in a somewhat surprising way, namely by examining the history of <italic>détournement</italic> as a political tactic to turn the tables on established media. News parody, satire and remix – fake news, in short – as exemplified by the likes of <italic>The Colbert Report, The Daily Show</italic> and <italic>The Yes Men</italic>, deserves credit for creating new forms of engagement with the potential to revive civic culture, Russell argues, particularly where otherwise news-indifferent citizens are concerned.</p>
<p>Rounding out the discussion, chapter 5 aims to complicate pessimistic scenarios about the future of journalism by suggesting specific strategies to help secure the conditions necessary for vibrant, deliberative forms of journalism to flourish. With the public’s right to know representing a guiding principle, Russell briefly touches upon examples of user-led innovation – such as WikiLeaks and Ushahidi – to point the way toward opportunities for reimagining news reporting. Policy recommendations, such as upholding net neutrality in order to ensure an adequate diversity of voices or enhancing Creative Commons licences to facilitate the creation and circulation of news by otherwise excluded groups, ground normative ideals with pragmatic strategy. All in all, this is a decidedly upbeat appraisal of inchoate possibilities for change, yet one suitably alert to how narrowly defined ‘meaningful public participation’ in news-making can be when corporate agendas are brought to bear in the name of profitability. Russell is to be commended for offering such a lucid, engaging treatment of a complex set of issues, one certain to be appreciated by students, researchers and journalists alike. It promises to spark vigorous conversations, not least among those committed to fashioning ‘new-style journalism’, despite the rather formidable obstacles on the path ahead.</p>
<p>In contrast to the breadth of Russell’s survey, Ansgard Heinrich offers an in-depth empirical study of network journalism. She introduces several of the themes she intends to explore with a poignant example drawn from the ‘global flow of news’, namely the citizen video footage of Neda-Agha Soltan’s violent death during the Iran election protests in June 2009. In describing the process whereby the footage ended up being relayed by the world’s news media (and in so doing turning Neda’s image into an iconic symbol of reformist opposition), Heinrich underscores how its status in this regard signified ‘a radical change in patterns of information dissemination and newsgathering in a restructured, network system of journalistic production’ (p. 1). Rather provocatively, she proceeds to argue that ‘[w]ithout the far-reaching distribution of the pictures of her death, a worldwide support for the Iranian protest movement and the incredible speed with which this support was gathered would not have occurred’ (p. 4). As assertions go it is a little extravagant, but the main thrust of her point is fair enough, namely that this startling imagery played an exceptionally important role in focusing the attention of news organisations – and their audiences – on the plight of ordinary Iranians protesting against their repressive government (a government that remains firmly in power as I write this review three years later, such brave efforts notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Heinrich is intrigued by two characteristics of what she terms ‘the evolving sphere of journalism’ brought to light by this example, namely ‘the <italic>decentralization</italic> of news production and dissemination processes of news and the <italic>non-linearity</italic> of news flows in an increasingly global news environment’ (p. 4). Strictly what decentralisation and non-linearity entail gradually becomes apparent as the discussion unfolds, but from the outset they help to frame the enquiry in a productive direction. The book divides into two main sections, the first offering ‘theoretical reflections’ on the development of the ‘network journalism paradigm’, while the second provides a series of short case studies, each aiming to further illuminate the contours of this paradigm via a qualitative critique of incipient types of news reportage and user engagement. Castells’s conception of the network society figures prominently in chapter 1, serving to anchor Heinrich’s evaluation of different attempts to theorise how technological innovations facilitate a global flow of news, as well as corresponding views about the attendant implications for journalistic practice. Chapter 2 reverses the clock, going back to the introduction of the telegraph and with it the creation of the news agencies, thereby offering a welcome historical perspective on structural factors shaping journalism’s evolution. Against this backdrop, chapters 3 and 4 further extend ‘network journalism’ as a paradigm in its own right, setting in motion Heinrich’s alternative approach to elucidating the ways in which news organisations are being reorganised so as to better adapt to wider processes of globalisation under way, in general, and those associated with advances in digitalisation, in particular.</p>
<p>Section Two turns to the empirical work, based in the main on interviews conducted with media practitioners and educators in the UK, US and Germany, which takes us into the day-to-day realities of life in converged multimedia newsrooms. Heinrich makes effective use of this data, comparing and contrasting her interviewees’ perceptions of how the ‘implementation of digital tools’ impacts on journalistic work. ‘I wanted to find out,’ she writes in chapter 5, ‘how journalistic organizations can be reinvented as communication nodes within the complex, decentralized network journalism sphere in a transnational context’ (p. 87). Over the course of the remaining chapters, she examines the advent of digitalization in newsrooms (chapter 6), the role of user-generated content (UGC) providers, citizen journalists and media activists as information nodes (chapter 7), the influence of blogs on journalism (chapter 8), the changing behavioural patterns of users (chapter 9), sourcing options for foreign reporting – with particular attention to coverage of the war in Iraq – made possible by digital distribution methods (chapter 10), and the strategies employed by news organisations to position themselves within these fast-changing networks of interactive collaboration. The final chapter briefly revisits central themes before suggesting, in turn, that the book be ‘read as a voice in support of a new model of journalistic organization, a call to action for journalists to revise the tools they use for their work as well as to renew their networks in order to navigate through today’s restructured, decentralized information flows’ (p. 229). A fitting note to end what is an impressive, thought-provoking investigation of journalism in the network society.</p>
<p>To close, both Russell and Heinrich succeed in fulfilling their respective objectives, providing the reader with useful vantage points from which to assess the emergent, socially contingent ecology of journalism evolving across multiple digital platforms. Most readers will find arguments for the importance of privileging networking as a research problematic persuasive, I would imagine, though both authors would likely agree that much work remains to be done. Relevant here, at least for me, is further consideration of how journalism, from its earliest days (that is, from its uneven inception as a recognisable genre of discourse), has necessarily relied upon varied conceptions of networking, typically corresponding to the gradual consolidation of its prescribed forms, practices and epistemologies in contested circumstances over the years. Precisely what counts as ‘networking’ in online contexts demands close attention in this regard, lest the concept be conflated with the rise of the web, or so all-encompassing in its heuristic scope that it risks losing its analytical purchase. Both books are at their most interesting, in my view, where they provide us with insights into the lived materiality of networking, showing us where its declared affordances for new types of journalism are intimately imbricated with negotiated compromises wrought by structural pressures and constraints. In seeking to move debates about how best to develop journalism’s potential as a public service in democratic cultures beyond the soaring rhetoric of advocates and critics alike, a duly modest appraisal of these conditions of possibility becomes all the more pressing. This more measured approach will be enriched, in my view, by the contributions made by these two books.</p>
