<p><italic>Ghazi Sultans</italic> primarily focuses on three medieval monarchs—Mahmud (d. 1030) of the Ghaznavid dynasty, Murad II (d. 1444), the Ottoman sovereign, and Babur (d. 1530), the founder of the Mughal Empire—to tell a comparative story about the centrality of <italic>ghaza</italic> (approximately, holy war) for each of their political identities. This is an ambitious and insightful book that, especially in the context of Mughal Studies, promises to generate a lot of debate. Testifying to Professor Anooshahr’s erudition and capacity to work with multiple languages, it not only engages wide-ranging Persian, Arabic, Ottoman Turkish and Chaghatai Turkish sources but also puts them in unlikely conversations with one another.</p>
<p>The chronological starting point of Professor Anooshahr’s story is tenth-century critiques of the contemporary Baghdad-based Abbasid dynasty for its failure to live up to <italic>ghaza</italic> ideals. Over the course of the next century these critiques were first picked up by Ghaznavid historians and panegyrists and slightly later the renowned Seljuk <italic>wazir</italic> Nizam al-Mulk who all wrote of the connection between a successful dynasty and the willingness of individual rulers to wage <italic>ghaza</italic>. Professor Anooshahr adeptly shows how Ghaznavid kings like Sebüktigen and his son Mahmud sought to project themselves as keen and successful <italic>ghazi</italic>s. Especially noteworthy is the discussion of Mahmud’s efforts to resituate his reign in the first/<italic>ghaza</italic>-loving/expansionist phase of the Ghaznavid dynastic cycle in order to create some temporal distance from the approaching final/<italic>ghaza</italic>-losing/decline phase. Mahmud’s selective periodising foreshadowed similar efforts by the Ottoman dynasty following its crushing defeat by Amir Timur in 1402.</p>
<p>Against much of the historiography on the early Ottomans, Professor Anooshahr asserts that <italic>ghaza</italic> was not central to Ottoman dynastic identity until the last years of Bayazid I’s reign (r. 1389–1402) when he found himself in intense political competition with the great Central Asian conqueror Amir Timur. Over the course of a two-year long epistolary exchange, however, both Bayazid and Timur discovered the value of portraying themselves as the only true <italic>ghazi</italic> (roughly, holy warrior) in order to delegitimise the political claims of the other. Although Timur’s 1402 victory over Bayazid temporarily unbalanced Ottoman imperial ambitions, Professor Anooshahr expertly shows how subsequent rulers (Mehmed I and, especially, Murad II) resuscitated Ottoman sovereignty by loud and deliberate assertions of their superiority over all other contemporary <italic>ghazi</italic>s. Inasmuch as Professor Anooshahr agrees that battlefield successes against Christian opponents were an important part of this story, he effectively argues that it was Ottoman-sponsored translations and historical accounts of <italic>ghaza</italic> in Anatolia (including the <italic>Battalname, The Histories of the Seljuks of Rum</italic> and the <italic>Ghazas of Sultan Murad</italic>) that effectively sealed public perceptions of a dynasty recommitted to waging <italic>ghaza</italic>. Capping a remarkable revival of fortunes, by Murad II’s reign, the Ottomans had not only successfully airbrushed Bayazid’s earlier defeat but also reinvented themselves as a rising dynasty once more in the first phase of imperial expansion.</p>
<p>Although the Mughal emperor Babur had no way of comprehending the various sleights of hand engaged in by the Ghaznavids and the Ottomans, he was—according to Professor Anooshahr—extremely familiar with the figure of the heroic <italic>ghazi</italic> in both literary traditions. Babur also went to great lengths to control his image following the successful example of his own ancestor, Amir Timur. These threads came together in Babur’s autobiography, the <italic>Baburnama</italic>, which Professor Anooshahr describes as less a historical source than a ‘kind of novel or even a script for performance’ (p. 4). Recognising that his Timurid lineage offered little justification for his aspiration to rule northern India post-1526, Babur arguably used the <italic>Baburnama</italic> to stake a different and unlikely claim: that he was a <italic>ghazi</italic> king in the same tradition as the long deceased but still widely revered Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud. Thanks to the continued popularity of Ghaznavid sources in sixteenth-century India as well as a determined cohort of literary supporters, Professor Anooshahr suggests, Babur successfully established Mughal political legitimacy.</p>
<p>I was especially impressed by two elements in this densely layered book. Rather than simply mining his sources to judge the validity of claims by Mahmud, Murad II and Babur to be <italic>ghazi</italic> kings, Professor Anooshahr uses an inter-textual approach to highlight how these kings asserted <italic>ghazi</italic> status. The results are quite striking. Take the case of Babur and the <italic>Baburnama</italic>. Professor Anooshahr not only uncovers the impact of previously unrecognised heroic or <italic>ghaza</italic> texts on the royal autobiography but also highlights their influence on Babur’s public actions. We learn that inasmuch as the image of Babur in the <italic>Baburnama</italic> was intentionally distorted to resemble earlier <italic>ghazi</italic> kings, Babur also deliberately moulded his actions to reflect what he had read in texts, thus collapsing the distinction between text and <italic>hors-texte</italic> (outside of text). ‘In sum’, Professor Anooshahr posits, ‘shedding light on the interplay of other narratives (such as the tales of ghazis) with the text of Babur’s memoirs is fundamentally interrelated to understanding his actions as well’ (p. 17). This is a provocative, if also potentially controversial, argument.</p>
<p>The second element that struck me was the way in which Professor Anooshahr reads texts to engage in the difficult task of retrieving the sultan’s actual ‘voice’. While this may be straightforward in the case of an imperial autobiography like the <italic>Baburnama</italic>, it is far more complicated when applied to texts compiled by someone other than a given king. And yet Professor Anooshahr offers moments when he discerns a sultan’s own authorial hand. One standout example is Mahmud’s direct role in creating a standardised template (comprising seven distinct stages) through which he expected others to discuss his campaigns in India. For me, kings like Mahmud and Murad II came alive in a way that I have only rarely encountered in contemporary scholarship.</p>
<p>Despite the many strengths of <italic>Ghazi Sultans</italic> I would point out that the historical contexts and the book’s arguments might have been clearer had Anooshahr picked a different organisational structure—one that placed the chapters focused on Babur <italic>after</italic> those about the Ghaznavids and Ottomans. In order to better appreciate the impact of the Ghaznavids on prevalent <italic>ghaza</italic> discourses I would have also liked to know more about the rise and development of the <italic>ghaza</italic> genre prior to the eleventh century. Some discussion, probably in the conclusion, would have helped clarify why the Ghaznavid model lost its salience (if it did) after the sixteenth century and what, if anything, took its place. In light of the comparative nature of the book, I was curious if the early Safavids leaders (men like Junaid, Haidar, Isma‘il) were also following the Ghaznavid template? Or were there alternative (Shi‘ite?) models for being a <italic>ghazi</italic> king?</p>
<p>While I accept Professor Anooshahr’s assertion that Babur sought to portray himself as a <italic>ghazi</italic> king, it is worth noting that this was not an exclusive strategy. Babur cultivated other public personalities as well. Indeed titles like the Arabic ‘Sultan al-A‘zam’ (the supreme king) and the hybrid Turkish-Arabic ‘Khaqan al-Mu‘azzam’ (the great khan of khans) in Babur’s post-1526 royal nomenclature point to the multiple intellectual and political models he chose to buttress his legitimacy. Might the same have been true for Mahmud and Murad II? Furthermore, might Professor Anooshahr not be overstating the extent of Babur’s transformation into <italic>ghazi</italic> king? For, judging by the <italic>Baburnama</italic>, following the first proclamation in the aftermath of the Battle of Khanua, Babur never returns to the subject of <italic>ghaza</italic> or himself as a <italic>ghazi</italic> king. The claim that Babur only understood India through his reading of Ghaznavid literature seems overstated in light of his frequent raids into India from 1505 onwards as well as the large-scale presence of itinerant communities who shuttled between Kabul and the lands to the east. This brings up a crucial point in the book about the relationship between text and context. While I agree that men like Babur or Murad II were likely deeply influenced by the example of their heroic forerunners, I remain agnostic on the extent to which Professor Anooshahr suggests they re-enacted earlier stories or followed existing scripts.</p>
<p>Two final points of detail: Professor Anooshahr insists that <italic>Ghazi Sultans</italic> is not a history of great men. He hopes that ‘what we can learn about these men as individuals can be equally applicable (with some modifications of course) to others from different socio-economic backgrounds’ (p. 10). Yet given the position of rulers and their almost unique access to resources, I do not quite see how this story can be stretched to include, say, ‘‘tribal looters, orthodox theorists, and antinomian Sufis’ (p. 10). Finally, I found the decision to avoid the Arabic ‘kafir’ because of its linguistic association with the former apartheid regime in S. Africa baffling; more so because of the author’s preference for ‘caffre’ (an antiquated and equally charged word used by colonial British travellers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries). Nonetheless, this book is groundbreaking and compelling.</p>
