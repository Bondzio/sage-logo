<p>Comparative effectiveness research (CER) is an important foundation in the development of scientific evidence that can assist patients, clinicians, and policy makers in making decisions that improve patient and system outcomes, including cost. CER is a part of what is now called dissemination and implementation science, which focuses on translating knowledge into practice by facilitating stakeholder access to more interpretable findings. CER has evolved from a rich history that aims to compare the effectiveness of select clinical treatments, approaches, or programs. This article describes the development of CER, approaches to designing and analyzing this research, and resources useful in generating such knowledge by nurse scientists.</p>

<p>Better health outcomes and lower costs are a high priority for providers, patient groups, policy experts, and economists. One means to advance health care quality and outcomes is to improve the way health research is conducted and translated into clinical practice. Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) provides an approach to understand which interventions yield the best outcomes for the right patients, at the right time, with an awareness of economic impact. CER may take many forms, however; this article provides a general overview of CER rather than focusing on specific types. The purpose of CER, relationship to other research approaches, and role in health care information dissemination and implementation (D&amp;I) is discussed. We explore data and analysis considerations, as well as available resources and implications for nurse scientists.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945912474501" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction to CER</title>
<p>Efforts to promote the use of evidence which demonstrate clinical effectiveness and create changes in practice are referred to as D&amp;I science. D&amp;I science falls under the broader umbrella of translational research that is used to describe both the generation and implementation of research evidence into clinical practice and health policy decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945912474501">Woolf, 2008</xref>). Translational research has been defined as having two phases, “T1” and “T2.” During the T1 phase, discoveries that have direct applicability to clinical diagnosis, management, and prevention are made. Work in the T2 phase focuses on strategies to bring these discoveries to the practice and policy arenas and is D&amp;I science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945912474501">Woolf, 2008</xref>). CER is a critical T1 phase activity with strong implications for T2 work.</p>
<p>CER refers to the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition or to improve the delivery of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945912474501">Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2009</xref>). Five proposed subgoals include (a) documenting performance and extent of variation in outcomes, (b) identifying sources of variation in outcomes, (c) designing and testing interventions that address known sources of variation in outcomes, (d) identifying barriers and facilitators to implement and maintain effective interventions, and (e) translating effective interventions into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945912474501">Voils &amp; Maciejewski, 2011</xref>). CER offers an approach that can be useful in detailing a foundation of evidence that identifies which treatment is most effective for which patient in specific practice settings.</p>
<p>To achieve the goals of CER, several discrete, interrelated steps are proposed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945912474501">Table 1</xref>). Effective execution of CER mandates the use of a variety of data sources and methods to conduct timely and relevant research and then disseminate the results in a form that is quickly usable by clinicians, patients, policy makers, and health care plans and other payers. The core benefit of CER is the ability to study the care of patients in day-to-day practice, where conditions that impact variability in care and health outcomes are considered, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945912474501">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<td>A nurse researcher in a large community-based practice notices that providers are prescribing various classes of antihypertensive medications for patients with HTN, making it nearly impossible to evaluate “best practice.” The community providers’ prescribing decisions are based on individual characteristics of their patients such as age, race, comorbidities, regimen ease, treatment costs, and potential medication interactions. NP providers want to determine the most effective medication for their individual patients. Patients and family members want the best treatment, given their unique comorbidities and risk factors. Leaders and administrators in the community practices want to understand the cost/benefits of HTN treatments over time, and policy makers want to estimate the cost of covering HTN medications for growing numbers of Medicare and Medicaid recipients.</td>

<td>In this example, a clinically important research question might be “Which antihypertensive medication is most efficacious in which group of patients?” A literature review of prescribing practices, formulary limitations, clinical tasks, and epidemiologic information gives further context to the research problem. Hypothetically, there may be RCTs that demonstrate the efficacy of thiazide diuretics in lowering blood pressure, but these studies may well exclude patients with renal failure, heart failure, and/or orthostasis who represent a significant percentage of those with HTN. The medications in RCTs may be provided cost-free, so compliance rates in these studies may not represent future compliance rates in practice. In other words, though these studies may have strong internal validity, they may not be applicable to present clinical situations.</td>

<p>CER activities are useful for clinical guideline development, evidence-based health care, and broader social and economic assessment of health technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945912474501">C. Clancy &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>). Using terms such as <italic>health technology assessment</italic> (HTA) or <italic>evidence-informed policy making</italic>, other industrialized countries have established processes to evaluate health technologies and management strategies to inform health care policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912474501">Chalkidou et al., 2009</xref>). England, Australia, France, and Germany are among those countries using CER to make treatment funding decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945912474501">Chalkidou et al., 2009</xref>). In the United States, however, use of CER findings to make decisions about health financing is controversial and is not the present intent. Philosophical differences among policy makers about the way health costs are measured and the ethics of allowing costs to guide treatment decisions have contributed to the controversy.</p>

<sec id="section2-0193945912474501">
<title>Framework for Evidence: Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), HTA, and CER</title>
<p>Rigorous, well-designed, and executed CER is needed to realize its value as an effective approach for improving the quality and effectiveness of care. Historically, these approaches have been given various names, including EBM/Evidence-Based Practice (EBP), HTA, and CER, yet these terms have been used inconsistently because they have overlapping, but different emphasis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945912474501">Luce and colleagues (2010)</xref> attempted to clarify these processes, defining EBM as evidence about the effectiveness of interventions and patient (individual) values and decisions; HTA as a method that ascertains evidence regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness, as well as safety, when the information is broadly applied; and CER as evidence comparing intervention effectiveness in routine settings. At the heart of the issue is the lack of a consensus related to what constitutes “evidence.” Some consider evidence to be limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) whereas others include well-designed observational studies.</p>
<p>The manner in which evidence is generated for clinical effectiveness needs to move beyond the RCT, which is time-consuming and expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912474501">Luce et al., 2009</xref>). Redefining CER and clarifying the relationships between evidence processes, CER is conceptualized to include both evidence generation and evidence synthesis, with primary emphasis on assessment of interventions in routine practice settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945912474501">Luce et al., 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945912474501">Figure 1</xref>). The goal of CER is to provide actionable health care information that will contribute to improved decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945912474501">Krishnan, 2011</xref>) by “evaluating and comparing health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness, risks, and benefits of two or more . . .strategies . . . used in the treatment, management, and diagnosis of, or prevention of illness or injury in individuals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945912474501">111th Congress of the United States of America, 2010</xref>, p. 609).</p>

<title>Historical Development of CER</title>
<p>In the United States, CER is not a new concept. For more than 40 years, health care leaders and the federal government have used several approaches to improve health care quality, consistency, and value. In the 1970s, HTA was established and provided rigorous appraisal of the effects and impact of a health care technology or treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945912474501">Tunis, Benner, &amp; McClellan, 2010</xref>). The 1980s focused on effectiveness research, and in the 1990s, outcomes research took prominence when legislation created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to support clinically focused outcomes research. Meanwhile, academic and private efforts such as the Cochrane Reviews established systematic review processes to investigate the effects of interventions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation in a variety of conditions for specific patient groups and settings. EBM/EBP, a systematic approach to clinical problem solving, integrates the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values and gained popularity at the start of the 21st century. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 earmarked US$1.1 billion to start federally endorsed CER. Finally, in 2010, Congress established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), as a component of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945912474501">Selby, Beal, &amp; Frank, 2012</xref>). As a result of a rapidly evolving health care environment, it remains to be seen how funding for CER will impact health care delivery over time.</p>
<p>Despite impressive knowledge advances in health care research, clear and dependable health information is difficult to find and interpret. This limits the ability of both patients and providers to choose appropriate health care treatments. Without the best interpretable, available evidence about treatment and prevention choices, consumers struggle to make informed health decisions. This is complicated by the fact that some treatments do not work for everyone, some work better for subgroups of the population, and some are downright harmful. The strength of CER is its potential to help identify treatments that work best for a given individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945912474501">Stubenrauch, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A major advantage of CER is that it takes into account varying patient circumstances and may potentially aid clinicians in making recommendations among treatment options. Clinically important questions are answered most effectively when multifaceted aspects of the health experience are considered in study design. A multitude of characteristics will change the outcome, even if the treatment is highly effective. In the complex practice setting, treatment decisions need to take into account many unique patient and environmental factors over time. These factors are both direct and indirect and impact desired clinical and patient outcomes. Incorporating clinical factors is a very different model than the one that is often tested in a RCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945912474501">Luce et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, RCT participants may include those with a better than average prognosis or education level and may exclude women, older adults, and those with common comorbid medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945912474501">Van Spall, Toren, Kiss, &amp; Fowler, 2007</xref>). RCT study procedures provide intensive diagnostics and follow-up care that is difficult to achieve in the “real world,” and outcome measures may be impractical for clinical practice. Although a well-designed and executed RCT may have strong internal validity, it is unlikely that the approach is fully applicable to complex clinical situations.</p>
<p>CER allows researchers and clinicians to analyze a problem in the practice setting. Proponents of CER recognize the value of RCTs at the right time and place but acknowledge limitations and appreciate the benefit of alternatives to the classic experimental design. Controversy exists in relation to differences between efficacy and effectiveness, the need to include cost-effectiveness, selection of a clinically representative sample, and the research questions most appropriate for CER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945912474501">Krishnan, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945912474501">
<title>The Difference Between Efficacy and Effectiveness</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945912474501">IOM (2009)</xref> published the top 100 priorities for CER. Nearly half were described as optimally studied in RCTs designed to determine whether a treatment is efficacious. Knowing the treatment is efficacious, however, is not sufficient for knowing it is effective. There are key differences between studies of efficacy and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945912474501">Morton &amp; Ellenberg, 2012</xref>). Efficacy tests the benefits of an intervention under the best possible circumstances and answers the question “Can it work?” Effectiveness is generally understood to test the effects of an intervention under ordinary practice and answers the question “Does it work in real clinical situations?” As currently designed and conducted, RCTs are not suited to compare the effectiveness of interventions among patients in usual patient care settings or alter treatments to individual patient needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945912474501">
<title>Study Design Approaches</title>
<p>The approach to a given research question will vary with the strength of evidence that currently exists. The research process typically begins with a literature review to assess current knowledge of a given topic and to provide context to the research question. The literature helps frame the focus of investigation, clarifying a variety of parameters such as current prescribing practices, formulary limitations, clinical risks, and epidemiologic information about the subpopulations of interest. Where limited literature exists related to the research question, descriptive studies become important in generating study of a given clinical phenomenon and serve as the basis for subsequent investigations utilizing a wide variety of design strategies.</p>
<p>True experimental research designs are characterized by careful manipulation of variables, control over treatments and exposures, and random assignment. In observational studies, individuals are observed or certain outcomes are measured but no attempt is made to manipulate, control, or randomize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945912474501">National Cancer Institute, 2010</xref>). Smaller observational studies may be conducted to contribute to the pool of evidence and a clinician may want to prospectively follow various subpopulations with a given treatment. Finally, analysis of existing large practice data sets, a previously underutilized approach, can provide important insight into treatment effectiveness for varying populations under different circumstances. Recent advances in statistical methodology now permit more effective analysis of large data sets.</p>
<p>Determination of treatment effectiveness requires a balance between observational studies and RCTs. Observational studies provide context and help identify potential sources of variation that may not be apparent from RCTs. The most informed decisions will benefit from considering the full range of high-quality research. Arguments about the relative importance of varied research designs are divisive and an unnecessary distraction at a time when a diversity of approaches is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945912474501">Rawlins, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0193945912474501">
<title>Data and Analysis Considerations</title>
<sec id="section7-0193945912474501">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Implicit in CER is the goal of moving toward a model where rich data sources are available to provide timely answers to clinical and research questions. The data should be considered high quality and available for the entire population and thus generalizable to the patient population of interest. Although this is the ideal to which to strive, there may be limitations to currently available data such that the data may be expensive, of poor quality, generalizable only to subsets of the population, or inadequate to answer one’s specific research question. Despite these limitations, many potential data sources can be identified, including electronic health records (EHRs), medical claims data, registries, and national surveys (e.g., Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey [MCBS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/MCBS/index.html">http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/MCBS/index.html</ext-link>] and Health Outcomes Survey [HOS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/HOS/index.html">http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/HOS/index.html</ext-link>] through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm</ext-link>] and the National Health Interview Survey [NHIS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm</ext-link>] through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to name a few). Investigators should be proactive in identifying potential data sources, but realistic in terms of what each source may offer in terms of providing timely and accurate results.</p>
<p>For optimal results in conducting CER, information from multiple sources of data that may be integrated, rather than simply using just one data source in isolation, is ideal. For example, data may be integrated within a health care network or across multiple organizations in similar or different same sectors of the economy (e.g., nonprofit, government). DARTNet (Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network) demonstrates another example. A federated network of EHR data from eight organizations including large clinical practice sites, national research networks, and technical partners, DARTNet uses existing EHR data and point-of-care data collection techniques to supplement data from large administrative data sets enabling comparative effectiveness and safety research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945912474501">Pace, West, Valuck, Cifuentes, &amp; Staton, 2009</xref>). CER through DARTNet has conducted varied studies including the use of over-the-counter medications and herbs in treating hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945912474501">Libby et al., 2010</xref>), and the value of adding depression severity and prescription fulfillment data to the EHR to improve diagnosis and management of depression in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945912474501">Valuck et al., 2012</xref>). Such data enable more robust CER on medications and other treatment approaches.</p>
<p>Even after data sources have been identified, considerable expertise is needed to manage the data, prepare it for data analysis, and protect the data. Investigators frequently are required to pay for use of large data sets. Furthermore, there is a steep learning curve for each database. The data are often not in a form immediately needed for analyses because the data are often not collected for research purposes, in general, or one’s individual research question specifically. For example, multiple data files may need to be merged into a single file of all relevant variables to answer the research questions; the identification of a common unique identifier across files is necessary to complete this step. Identification of variables to best answer the research question may be extremely time-consuming because large data sets often include hundreds or thousands of variables and it can be difficult to understand nuances between similar sounding variable names/labels without first gaining expertise on the specific data set. Furthermore, the variables available for analysis might not fully meet one’s needs and thus it may be important to allow for some flexibility around the focused research question. Once appropriate variables have been identified, they may need substantial recoding to be appropriate for analyses. Specialized expertise for working with large data sets is necessary to analyze the data appropriately, particularly when the data include complexities (e.g., sampling weights, nesting). The nature of the available data needs to be considered such that longitudinal data sets where the same individuals are tracked over a period of time will provide richer information than cross-sectional data (single point in time) or multiple cohort data (different individuals tracked over time). Finally, permission and access issues need to be considered prior to data analysis. Institutional Review Board approval to analyze the data may be necessary and privacy (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or “HIPAA”) considerations should be taken into account.</p>

<title>Analytic Approaches</title>
<p>Once appropriate data sources have been successfully identified, managed, merged, and cleaned, there are challenges to analyzing the data to draw appropriate conclusions. One big hurdle is that of establishing causal inference from CER analyses, a problem that is common among observational studies. In the absence of random assignment to conditions, groups may be considered nonequivalent and there are often many alternative explanations for observed findings due to issues with selection bias and confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945912474501">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>). Treatment may be administered in a nonrandom fashion where sicker patients may be more likely to get one therapy over another; for example, those receiving treatment may be at the greatest risk for negative outcomes given that those not receiving treatment (intended as a control group) were not identified as having as high of a need. Treatment may also be based on age, SES, or any variety of demographic factors, many of which may relate to better or worse outcomes. This makes it difficult to determine whether differences between treatment and control groups (or two treatments) can be attributed to the treatment itself or the confounding factors. A key problem with observational data is that there can be any number of confounding variables that influence type of treatment or whether or not treatment was received at all and that also influence observed outcomes. It is easier to control for the impact of extraneous variables that are likely to impact the outcome and that may systematically differ between conditions when there has been random assignment to condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945912474501">Rubin, 1974</xref>), thereby making RCTs the gold standard for drawing causal inferences. However, RCTs are sometimes not feasible or ethical in a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945912474501">Smith &amp; Pell, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In instances where RCTs are not feasible or appropriate, investigators should have awareness of the potential for alternative explanations for research findings as a result of selection bias or confounding variables (e.g., treatment administered in nonrandom fashion, sicker patients selected for study) and should reduce the impact of such explanations using statistical and logical procedures. Analytic techniques that offer particular utility in conducting CER include use of propensity scores (PSs) and instrumental variable analysis. These techniques both allow alternative means of addressing confounding variables in observational settings and improve causal inferences made by scientists conducting CER.</p>
<sec id="section9-0193945912474501">
<title>PSs</title>
<p>PS analysis represents one methodology for addressing the impact of confounding variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945912474501">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983</xref>). There is an extensive literature on PS modeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945912474501">Bai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945912474501">Brookhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945912474501">Luellen, Shadish, &amp; Clark, 2005</xref>), but in brief, this approach involves modeling the effect of confounding variables on treatment so that the effect of these confounders can be removed. PS analysis is a multivariable scoring method where multiple predictors of a treatment are collapsed into a single value. In other words, a single value is created based on scores of all measureable covariates in the data set being used where the value represents the probability that the person would receive treatment based on their combination of scores. Once the PS is created, it can be used to match or stratify participants or can be used in modeling. As an illustration, a nurse researcher could carry out a PS analysis by (a) identifying a variety of demographic and disease characteristics that may relate to treatment selection, (b) estimating the probability a patient has received one treatment over another based on their scores on all the potential covariates, and (c) finding a control group (or alternative treatment group) that can be matched to the treatment group based on the observed PS. As an example from the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945912474501">Wright, Romboli, DiTulio, Wogen, and Belletti (2011)</xref> used PS matching to examine blood pressure control among patients with hypertension who were managed by nurse practitioners versus physicians. Prior to PS matching, there were several demographic and clinical differences between the patients in each of the two groups. After creating a PS based on a variety of variables (e.g., age, sex, body mass index [BMI], medication use, diabetes status, smoking status) and matching the nurse practitioner–treated versus physician-treated patients based on this score, there were no longer any baseline differences between the matched groups and they could be reasonably compared on the outcome of interest (blood pressure control).</p>
<p>PS modeling provides one means for adjusting for selection bias and may be useful for ruling out alternative explanations when comparing treatments, particularly when there is ample information regarding how treatments are selected. However, there are several caveats for using this technique. First, the model is only as good as the covariates that were available and selected into the model; if critical covariates weren’t available or identified as important by the investigator, then the PS will be biased. Use of PSs is thus contingent on thoughtful consideration of measured variables (e.g., covariates available in the data set that may relate to treatment selection) and unmeasured variables (e.g., constructs that may relate to treatment selection but that were either overlooked or not available in the data set). A second issue is that comparisons will not be possible if the two groups do not overlap in terms of the covariates. For example, if all patients who received one treatment are above 80, female, and severe and all people who received the second treatment are below 60, male, and not as severe, it will not be possible to estimate a PS. Even if there is overlap between groups, many patients will not be included because there is no match for them and a substantial proportion of patients may thus be dropped from analysis. Finally, there is no way to verify that the patients who are matched on the PS values have the same characteristics on each of the variables given that these variables are “averaged” in developing the PS probability value; matching on specific variables may yield different results than PS matching.</p>

<sec id="section10-0193945912474501">
<title>Instrumental Variable Analysis</title>
<p>Instrumental variable analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912474501">Angrist, Imbens, &amp; Rubin, 1996</xref>) represents a second way to address confounding effects. The logic behind these analyses is to identify an “instrumental” variable that is expected to be correlated with treatment but that should not be related to confounding variables or directly to the outcome (the instrumental variable should only relate to the outcome through association with treatment). The instrumental variable is then used as a proxy for group assignment. As one example from the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945912474501">Stukel et al. (2007)</xref> used instrumental variable analysis to test the impact of cardiac catheterization following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on mortality. Because there might be bias between groups that receive cardiac catheterization or not due to confounding variables, the authors chose regional cardiac catheterization rate as the instrumental variable. In this case, the instrumental variable (region) was not expected to be directly related to mortality but would be expected to relate to treatment, as AMI severity and other risk factors were found to be similar across regions even though there were regional variations in cardiac catheterization rates. Although instrumental variable analysis can be useful for controlling for underlying differences in groups that are unobservable, there are also several considerations for using this approach. These include the difficulty of identifying appropriate instrumental variables from a conceptual perspective and difficulties related to empirically verifying that the assumptions that the instrumental variable is unrelated to confounders and the outcome hold true.</p>
<p>Beyond PS modeling and instrumental variable analysis, there are a range of quasi-experimental designs and analytic procedures that may be appropriate for CER. A complete discussion of these methodologies is well beyond the scope of this article (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945912474501">Shadish et al., 2002</xref>, for a comprehensive review of quasi-experimental techniques and threats to validity). In brief, designs to consider might include the regression discontinuity design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945912474501">Marsh, 1998</xref>), difference-in-differences methods when data are available for two or more time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945912474501">Card &amp; Krueger, 1994</xref>), and interrupted time-series analysis for use with a great deal of observations measured over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945912474501">West, Hepworth, McCall, &amp; Reich, 1989</xref>). Given that there are advantages and disadvantages across methods, it may be advisable to conduct sensitivity analyses in CER where treatments are tested using several analytic methods to determine whether the same conclusion about treatment effectiveness can be reached across methods. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945912474501">Stukel et al. (2007)</xref> compared four analytic methods when testing the impact of cardiac catheterization on mortality and observed that their conclusions were sensitive to methodology.</p>
<p>In summary, it may be possible to obtain useful and meaningful conclusions by using existing data sources. However, there are several considerations around data acquisition and analysis. In terms of acquisition, it is important to consider quality of the data source, usefulness of the data and available variables in answering the specific research question, and expertise needed to successfully manage and analyze the data. Once quality data have been identified, analyses need to address possible selection bias and confounding. PS analysis and instrumental variable analysis represent two potential ways to do this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912474501">Angrist et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945912474501">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983</xref>), although there are certainly other analysis options and careful measurement of confounders, and instrumental variables is critical for the results of either technique to be valid. There may be additional analysis considerations, such as analyzing data where patients are nested within a practice or care provider where multilevel modeling (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling) would therefore need to be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945912474501">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Multilevel modeling allows for the explicit modeling of individual (e.g., patient-level) and environmental (e.g., provider-level) factors that may influence outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945912474501">Singer, 1998</xref>). If available, it is preferable to use longitudinal data with at least several time points of measurement per patient as a way to track both average and individual progress over time. Irrespective of the method of analysis selected, resources need to be examined to overcome restraints which might preclude the design of treatment effect studies.</p>

<title>Resources</title>
<p>A foundation for transformational change through D&amp;I science is clearly taking hold in nursing with varying models for translating evidence into practice now proposed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945912474501">Newhouse &amp; White, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945912474501">van Achterberg, Schoonhoven, &amp; Grol, 2008</xref>). Understanding CER is crucial in creating high-impact D&amp;I science.</p>
<p>Knowledge of available resources is an important consideration in the design of effective CER studies and promotion of patient-centered outcomes research. The federal agencies of the new PCORI, as well as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institutes of Health, and the IOM, bear primary responsibility to effect D&amp;I efforts. While all of these agencies emphasize evidence to improve the health of the nation, each agency addresses varied aspects of that process (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193945912474501">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the challenge of funding the myriad of studies needed, it has been proposed that a central body make these decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945912474501">French &amp; England, 2010</xref>) and it is crucial that nursing be part of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945912474501">C. M. Clancy, 2012</xref>). The Improvement Science Research Network, a nurse-led, virtual, interprofessional, research collaborative, provides infrastructure for testing of improvement interventions and is a prime example of the role nurses can play in building a foundation for CER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ISRN.net">http://www.ISRN.net</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Development of Nurse Scientists</title>
<p>To effectively partner with interdisciplinary colleagues in the translational science community, substantial emphasis is needed to develop nurse scientists who are proficient in CER. Restructuring doctoral programs to promote work as part of interprofessional and interdisciplinary teams is essential, as is exposure to academic–industry partnerships, which will become increasingly crucial as economic policies challenge funding mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945912474501">Meyers &amp; Pomeroy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While discipline-specific training is essential, doctoral nursing education can no longer afford to engage curricula that allow students to work in silos. Structured teamwork experiences and interdisciplinary training will promote innovation and leverage nurse scientists as important partners in D&amp;I science. An important corollary to restructuring basic nursing doctoral education is the need to promote postdoctoral work in proliferating clinical and translational science programs. Failure to engage in substantial reconsideration of training approaches will leave nurse scientists at the margins of a new and exciting paradigm shift designed to improve public health.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Comparative examination of different treatments for the same conditions embodies CER and is an important component of D&amp;I science. Methodologies that need to be utilized to provide evidence to determine which treatments are most likely to improve overall health include observational studies, evaluation of data from large databases, and modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945912474501">French &amp; England, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945912474501">Lohr, 2010</xref>). Qualitative and quantitative approaches will be needed to explore barriers to and strategies for implementation of CER findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945912474501">Bonham &amp; Solomon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945912474501">Leeman &amp; Sandelowski, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses, as important health care decision makers, need to be able to participate with highly diverse, multidisciplinary working groups in the design and implementation of CER studies which is key to meeting the objectives of CER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945912474501">Tunis et al., 2010</xref>). CER holds promise for providing evidence that will be important to not only promote an effective personalized medicine approach, but to also rid clinical care of harmful practices.</p>
