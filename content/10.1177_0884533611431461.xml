<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Recent research has linked inadequate vitamin D levels with risk of breast cancer, but there are less data regarding the actual concentrations of vitamin D in women who have survived breast cancer. The objective of this study was to determine if vitamin D insufficiency is a prevalent problem for female breast cancer survivors who have completed treatment for breast cancer. <italic>Methods</italic>: Ninety-nine breast cancer survivors and a control population of 54 women with no history of breast cancer participated in this study. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were measured throughout 2007. Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamin D was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Zip code of residence was used to evaluate potential for skin production of vitamin D. <italic>Results</italic>: Vitamin D insufficiency (&lt;32 ng/mL) was observed in 76 of 99 (77%) of breast cancer survivors and 51 of 54 (94%) of controls. Women taking vitamin D supplements &gt;1000 IU/d were less likely to exhibit vitamin D insufficiency, but supplementation did not guarantee sufficiency. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Vitamin D insufficiency appears to be prevalent among both controls and breast cancer survivors. Vitamin D status should be routinely evaluated for all women as part of regular preventive care if supplemental vitamin D intake is &lt;1000 IU daily.</p>

<body>
<p>Vitamin D insufficiency was thought to be a problem of the past in the United States. However, recent studies have documented a surprisingly high prevalence of insufficiency across all age groups worldwide. As more becomes known about vitamin D, debate continues about what concentrations are adequate for all aspects of health.</p>
<p>The nutrition science community most often defines serum vitamin D insufficiency as a concentration &lt;30 ng/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611431461">1</xref></sup> However, some studies and the 2010 Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin D use &lt;20 ng/mL as the cutoff value for vitamin D insufficiency, which results in a much smaller percentage of persons being labeled “insufficient.” The 2010 DRI update was based on recommendations for adequate bone health outcomes. The reviewers noted that evidence of the effects of vitamin D on overall health outcomes other than bone health is less than consistent and clinical trials currently inadequate to advise a higher concentration as required for health. Vitamin D deficiency is well agreed upon as concentrations &lt;10 ng/mL.</p>
<p>The discovery of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in more than 30 body tissues has provided data as to how vitamin D may play a role in the development of chronic diseases, including cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611431461">2</xref></sup> Epidemiological evidence has shown a correlation between higher levels of sunlight exposure and decreased mortality from breast, colon, and prostate cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611431461">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current theories as to how vitamin D may affect cancer development and growth focus on its effects on cell cycle growth regulation, activation of apoptotic cell death, and modulation of growth factor signaling through VDR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533611431461">4</xref></sup> These actions have been documented in several cell lines, including breast cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611431461">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611431461">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Female breast cancer survival has been correlated with season of diagnosis and with cumulative sunlight exposure in the months preceding diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611431461">7</xref></sup> Increased dietary intake of vitamin D and sunlight exposure is also associated with reduced risk of breast cancer occurrence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611431461">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because many women with breast cancer can expect a long survival time postdiagnosis, maintaining quality of life after treatment is an important goal. Women who have received treatment for breast cancer are acutely at risk for osteoporosis due to detrimental effects of chemotherapy, radiation, and supportive care drugs (glucocorticoids) on bone, as well as reduced estrogen concentrations. Breast cancer survivors have been shown to have significantly lower bone mineral density than controls after adjusting for age, race, and years since menopause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611431461">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the extent of vitamin D insufficiency among our cohort of breast cancer survivors. It was hypothesized that vitamin D concentrations would not be different between breast cancer survivors and women with no history of breast cancer.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533611431461" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The present research project was an observational, case-controlled study that was conducted from January to December 2007. The 99 female experimental participants involved in the present study were recruited from a larger group of 150 breast cancer survivors (BCS) derived from our facility cancer registry who had no active cancer and had completed chemotherapy and/or radiation at least 6 months prior to the study. They were invited to participate by mail and returned for a regular follow-up analysis at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) at Midwestern Regional Medical Center (MRMC), Zion, Illinois. The 54 control participants were female employees of MRMC without a history of breast cancer and were recruited using a public e-mail invitation. No power calculation was performed because of the limited size of our facility cancer registry and a time constraint of 12 months to accrue participants.</p>
<p>Individuals with the following medical conditions were excluded from the study: undergoing current dialysis treatment, elevated liver enzymes, primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or Paget disease. Prior to taking part in the study, all participants had to provide informed consent.</p>
<p>Breast cancer survivors provided a one-time nonfasting serum sample for determination of 25(OH)D concentration during their appointment at MRMC throughout all months of 2007. The control group provided a serum sample during the months of April (n = 27) or October (n = 27) 2007. Serum was collected at the MRMC laboratory and sent to the Laboratory Corporation of America (Raleigh, NC), where a chemiluminescence procedure was used to measure 25(OH)D. Serum 25(OH)D measurements included both vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>. Serum samples were incubated with anti–vitamin D–coated microparticles and isoluminol derivative-conjugated 25(OH)D before measurement of chemiluminescent signals. Analysis was completed within 48 hours of collection. In 2007, vitamin D concentrations between 32 and 100 ng/mL were considered sufficient by the outside laboratory facility that completed vitamin D testing for our hospital. For this reason, as well as the lack of consensus regarding optimal vitamin D concentrations at that time, we accepted the above range as sufficient.</p>
<p>All participants were surveyed at their appointment to obtain demographic information and medical history. The principal investigator (a registered dietitian) met with each participant to review all surveys upon completion.</p>
<p>Demographic information collected included each participant’s age, sex, race, stated height, weight, and zip code of residence. Medical histories for all participants included non-cancer-related medical information; type, stage, and date of breast cancer diagnosis if applicable; completed cancer treatment regimens; and current medications. Medical records were used to obtain pertinent health and cancer treatment-related information when participants could not answer relevant questions.</p>
<p>Dietary intake of vitamin D was determined using data from a modified food frequency questionnaire originally developed by Blalock et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611431461">10</xref></sup> This questionnaire provided data regarding dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D intake as well as intake of other vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. No data were collected regarding sunlight exposure, sunscreen use, or time spent outdoors.</p>
<p>Participants were stratified for statistical analysis on the basis of age, race, stage of cancer, body mass index (BMI) (calculated from height and weight), latitude of residence by zip code, level of dietary intake of vitamin D, and level of supplemental intake of vitamin D. Univariate and multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Student paired <italic>t</italic> test as well as basic averages and medians were performed to compare these groups for differences in vitamin D status. Analysis was completed using the Java Memory Profiler (JMP) 5.1 software developed by the SAS Institute (Cary, NC). A <italic>P</italic> value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. The MRMC Institutional Review Board and the Eastern Michigan University Human Subjects Committee approved this study.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Ninety-nine women of the eligible 150 women participated in the study, resulting in a 66% accrual rate. The women who chose not to be included were not significantly different from the participants in any of the measured variables except that 2 BCS had recurrence of breast cancer and had to be excluded from the study. Most of the women who did not participate either did not want to take extra time to complete the study or did not schedule a follow-up appointment during 2007.</p>
<p>Vitamin D concentrations were not significantly different related to age, and ages were similar between controls and BCS. Stated height and weight were used to calculate BMI, which was not different between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .08). Vitamin D concentrations did vary by BMI (<italic>P</italic> = .03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533611431461">Figure 1</xref>). Ethnic distribution was different between the 2 groups, with slightly more Asians in the control group and slightly more African Americans in the BCS group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533611431461">Table 1</xref>). Vitamin D levels were potentially clinically different between African Americans and whites (<italic>P</italic> = .13). Although not statistically significant, a mean vitamin D concentration of 17.9 ng/mL for African Americans is in the level of insufficiency, whereas a mean vitamin D concentration of 23 ng/mL for whites is classified as adequate per the 2010 DRI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533611431461">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Most (80%) of the BCS had been diagnosed with stage 1 or stage 2 breast cancers. Seventy-two percent of the BCS had estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) tumors, 60% had progesterone receptor–positive (PR+) tumors, and 80% had HER2/neu-negative tumors. Most of the BCS had received surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation as their treatment for cancer. One participant had undergone a stem cell transplant. A majority of the BCS (71%) were not taking hormonal therapy for breast cancer at the time of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533611431461">Table 2</xref>). Sixty-seven of the participants were diagnosed less than 5 years before the study took place. No differences in vitamin D concentrations were seen based on estrogen receptor status for the BCS (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .37; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533611431461">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Only 7 of 99 breast cancer survivors (none of the controls) were noted to live in areas where year-round skin production of vitamin D is possible (latitudes &lt;35°).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611431461">11</xref></sup> Those 7 women did not have significantly different serum concentrations of vitamin D compared to women who lived farther north. Although controls provided serum only in spring or fall, vitamin D concentrations were not different related to season of blood draw, even when analyzed by univariate and multivariate ANOVA (<italic>P</italic> = .6).</p>
<p>Average daily intake of vitamin D among BCS was 140 IU/d, and among controls, it was 135 IU/d, not significantly different between the 2 groups. Dietary intake of vitamin D did affect vitamin D concentrations among BCS (<italic>P</italic> = .01) but not among controls (<italic>P</italic> = .28).</p>
<p>Supplement intake of vitamin D was the main variable found to affect vitamin D concentrations for BCS (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) but not for controls (<italic>P</italic> = .95). This may be due to outliers as 3 BCS had supplemental D intake &gt;6000 IU daily, whereas no control subject even approached an intake of 3000 IU daily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533611431461">Figure 2</xref>). Average vitamin D intake from supplements was significantly different (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .01) between groups, with BCS consuming 1025 IU/d and controls consuming 421 IU/d. Most participants (73% of BCS, 89% of controls) took supplements containing vitamin D. Most vitamin D supplements were consumed as multivitamin/calcium supplements. Few participants consumed separate vitamin D supplements, and most consumed &lt;1000 IU vitamin D/d or less from supplements. No difference was seen in serum vitamin D concentrations between those who took vitamin D supplements with food and those who took vitamin D only with water. Individuals with a supplemental vitamin D intake of 1000 IU/d or greater were more likely to be vitamin D sufficient.</p>

<p>Vitamin D insufficiency, as defined in this study by a serum concentration &lt;32 ng/mL, was observed in 77% of the BCS and 94% of the controls. Even if the 2010 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendation of 20 ng/mL was considered adequate rather than 32 ng/mL, 40% of BCS and 64% of controls still exhibited vitamin D insufficiency in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611431461">12</xref></sup> The controls (women with no history of breast cancer) had significantly lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (including serum D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>) than the BCS by univariate and multivariate ANOVA and paired <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that most BCS and control women were insufficient in vitamin D. Control women had significantly lower concentrations of vitamin D than BCS. Demographics such as age and race had no significant effect on vitamin D concentrations. In addition, tumor receptor status, stage of breast cancer and type of cancer treatment, and season of blood draw did not affect vitamin D status. Only supplemental intake of vitamin D &gt;1000 IU daily and BMI were found to affect serum vitamin D concentrations in BCS. BMI and dietary intake of vitamin D were the only variables related to serum vitamin D concentrations in controls, possibly because of overall lower supplemental intake of vitamin D compared to BCS. This is in agreement with other studies that suggest the obese and overweight may have an increased requirement for vitamin D due to deposition of vitamin D in adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611431461">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 1997 DRI for vitamin D was 200 IU daily for persons aged 19–50 years, 400 IU for persons aged 51–70 years, and 600 IU for persons 70 years and older at the time of this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611431461">14</xref></sup> Only 9 participants met the 1997 DRI for vitamin D solely with food intake (8 BCS, 1 control). Eight of these women consumed fatty fish regularly (about 1 serving/d). One BCS consumed 72 oz of whole milk daily. Only 3 BCS and none of the controls met the 2010 DRI (600 IU/d for persons aged 19–70 years) for vitamin D with dietary intake alone.</p>
<p>It is significant that supplemental vitamin D intakes greater than both the 1997 and near the 2010 DRIs for vitamin D failed to result in adequate concentrations of vitamin D (as defined by ≥32 ng/mL). However, according to the IOM 2010 DRI (published after our study completion), mean serum vitamin D concentrations for BCS but not controls were in the range of sufficiency.</p>
<p>Studies suggest that persons who have survived cancer are more likely to take vitamin or mineral supplements than persons who have no history of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611431461">15</xref></sup> A more recent survey of cancer survivors found that 73% took supplements of some type. In addition, CTCA is a unique hospital in that patients typically meet with both their dietitian and naturopathic doctor along with their medical oncologist as part of each follow-up visit. Recommendations from these complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers may increase the likelihood of supplementation.</p>
<p>Finding a majority of participants to have an insufficient concentration of vitamin D was not surprising, considering the epidemic of vitamin D insufficiency in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611431461">16</xref></sup> The finding of exceptionally high rates of vitamin D insufficiency were consistent with other results reported in studies that evaluated the vitamin D status of breast cancer survivors. Neuhouser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611431461">17</xref></sup> and Waltmanet al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611431461">18</xref></sup> found insufficiency rates of 75.6% and 86%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533611431461">Table 4</xref>). Neuhouser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611431461">17</xref></sup> noted differences in serum vitamin D concentrations related to stage of disease and race but did not explicitly measure quantity of vitamin D intake. Similarly, they found no differences in serum vitamin D related to season. Waltman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611431461">18</xref></sup> noted that serum vitamin D concentrations were low despite supplemental and dietary intake of vitamin D. Their cohort of BCS consumed on average 665 IU vitamin D daily from supplements and 95 IU vitamin D from dietary sources. These average total intakes of vitamin D were less than intakes in our group of BCS. This corroborates our findings that intakes of vitamin D equal to the 2010 DRI did not produce adequate serum vitamin D concentrations for most participants. They did not assess seasonal variation of vitamin D as all serum samples were collected in 1 month but hypothesized that low concentrations could be related to use of aromatase inhibitors.</p>

<p>This study has several limitations. First, sun exposure was not explicitly measured. A single, cross-sectional vitamin D serum concentration was drawn per participant after diagnosis and treatment due to funding constraints. Finally, a convenience sample of controls failed to match controls with BCS on all seasons of serum sampling. No power calculation was performed because of the limited resources outlined earlier. Furthermore, limitations are inherent in the use of food frequency questionnaires to capture all food intake and discrepancies in self-reported intake. Also, participants were not asked about any changes in diet and supplement intake since cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Little is known about the effects of vitamin D concentrations on quality of life or other outcomes in BCS. It would be valuable for future studies to further investigate these relationships and to determine if vitamin D supplementation has any impact in BCS. In addition, more data are needed regarding what concentrations of vitamin D are optimal for overall health.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Vitamin D insufficiency is prevalent in both BCS and healthy women irrespective of which definition of sufficiency is used (20 ng/mL or 32 ng/mL). Lower concentrations of vitamin D were found to be related to higher BMI in both controls and BCS. Supplemental intake of vitamin D affected concentrations of vitamin D in BCS but was not significant in controls. BCS did take higher doses of vitamin D supplements compared with control women, and women who took vitamin D supplements were more likely to exhibit vitamin D sufficiency. Considering the relationship of low vitamin D concentrations and bone health, assessing vitamin D status and correcting vitamin D insufficiencies should be a critical goal for both BCS and women without a history of cancer. Practitioners should query their patients for use of supplemental vitamin D. Persons supplementing &lt;1000 IU vitamin D daily should be considered for serum vitamin D testing.</p>
