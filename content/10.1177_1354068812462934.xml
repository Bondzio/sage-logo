<abstract>
<p>This article argues that historical context can be a strong force for the origins of an ideologically and behaviourally moderate religious political party. It explores the origins of Italian Christian Democracy, following the trajectory of the Partito Popolare Italiano and Democrazia Cristiana in order to highlight a path to religious party moderation that excludes extremism and violence at all stages. That path includes the development of a moderate ideology prior to inclusion in the democratic system, influenced by efforts to reconcile Catholicism with democracy. Extremist alternatives are eliminated not through the moderating tendencies of a democratic political system but by historical events and by efforts of the moderate religious party to ensure that the democratic system does not collapse. Ideological and behavioural moderation are understood as acceptance of democracy and promotion of civil liberties, not as the notion that a party becomes in some way less religious.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How did a political party that was stridently anti-Communist, that was pro-Catholic church, and a refuge for post-war conservatives come to be known as a moderate centre-right party? How did it retain the votes of practising Catholics while distancing itself from the Catholic Church? How did this religious party become moderate? The party in question is Democrazia Cristiana (DC), Italy’s post-war Christian Democratic party. The fate of its predecessor, the Partito Popolare Italiano, and the DC’s long dominance of Italian politics may provide some insights into the party moderation thesis. As Schwedler points out (2011), there are various angles to this thesis, some emphasizing moderation of process (party rejection of violence to attain its ends), some emphasizing moderation of ideology (party rejection of extremist positions). The main question of both strands of the literature is how do religious parties become moderate? Much of the literature has focused on whether, how and why party participation in democratic system processes leads to party moderation. Yet the history of Christian Democracy in many countries suggests that ‘external’ historic factors may create moderate religious parties; inclusion in a democratic system is not necessary for moderation. Instead, for such parties, their initial concern in the democratic system may be to prevent the emergence of rival, radicalized faith-based splinter parties or wholesale collapse of the democratic system.</p>
<p>This article, in exploring the evolution of Italian Christian Democracy from the PPI to the DC, points to the role of religious ideologies and external context as possible forces for moderation. To understand the DC’s moderation, one has to understand the impact of major historical events on the party’s evolution, including the development and fate of its predecessor, the PPI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354068812462934">1</xref>
</sup> Christian Democracy itself, as an ideology and as a party in Italian politics, was moderate from the outset. Events external to the operations of the democratic system, such as Fascism and World War II, with the ensuing presence of a strong Communist bloc, served to constrain rival manifestations of political Catholicism in Italy. The ideological and social commitments of the DC’s leadership, as well as the historical circumstances, led the DC to be a moderate party and to work to prevent a splintering of political Catholicism into radicalized parties in the early years of post-War Italy.</p>
<p>In order to describe and track this alternative pathway to party moderation – the ‘external’ pathway – this article is limited to a study of the DC and its predecessor. Obviously, it is not possible to assess which factors were necessary and sufficient causes. What this essay hopes to show is that first, the historical origins of the Catholic parties, the PPI and then the DC, were such that they were moderate from the outset. In that regard, the PPI’s situation was a bit more complicated, but overall, partly thanks to defections of Catholic politicians and voters who saw in Fascism a solution to Italy’s and the Church’s troubles, the PPI remained, for its short life, a supporter of democratic policies and principles. The DC’s ideological origins as a Christian, social democratic party and in between the extremes of Fascism and Communism, defined its ideological and behavioural moderation. Second, the article discusses the possibility that the DC’s efforts to prevent a breakdown of the democratic system in the immediate post-war years, and its efforts stay in power and manage its relations with the Catholic Church, led it to limit the extent to which it pushed for more civil liberties. The DC’s history shows that the moderation of a religious party can be unrelated to inclusion within a democratic political system.</p>
<p>Italy’s DC has been studied as an example of numerous political phenomena, including as a case of a religious party originating in church–state conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354068812462934">Lipset and Rokkan, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>); as a case showing the lasting impact of the origins of a party on its ideology and organizational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1354068812462934">Panebianco, 1982</xref>); as a case of a one party dominant regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1354068812462934">Pempel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1354068812462934">Tarrow, 1990</xref>); as a driver of polarized pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1354068812462934">Sartori, 1976</xref>), and as a case dominated by internal factions and distribution of office portfolios and patronage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1354068812462934">Mershon, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1354068812462934">2002</xref>; Zukerman, 1979), to name but a few. For the purposes of this article and special issue, this analysis focuses on the DC as a case of religious party moderation.</p>
<p>This essay is organized into four parts. The first is a brief review of the party moderation thesis with a statement of how that thesis is interpreted and operationalized in this article. The focus is on the party and its leaders, not its voters. The second part analyses the development and orientation of the DC’s predecessor, the PPI, and then the DC. It shows that the PPI and the DC’s ideologies were moderate from the outset. The historical context and strategic setting certainly facilitated this stance. What it also shows is that there were anti-democratic strands in political Catholicism that were largely eliminated or discredited due to Fascism and World War II. The third part shows how one task of party moderation may be to prevent external radicalization of religious elements and breakdown of the nascent democratic system. The DC had to work to avoid the emergence of a rival right-wing Catholic party that the Church would support, to prevent a number of Catholics from voting for the far Left, and prevent what it perceived as a possible collapse of the democratic political system. This section also analyses how, with participation in, indeed dominance of, the democratic political system, the party used tactics that in some ways limited the reach of democracy. Due to the importance of understanding the historical context of the DC’s origins, it is not possible in this article to cover the DC’s entire lifespan, through 1994. Instead, the focus is on its early years, between 1944 and 1958, and on the PPI in the inter-war years. The fourth section concludes with some comments about what the DC and Christian Democracy show about religious parties, and about how factors external to the democratic political system may have a significant effect on party moderation. We are also reminded that religious parties participating in the democratic process may to some extent limit the expansiveness of that democracy or engage in corruption for reasons that have little to do with religion and much to do with party office-seeking.</p>

<title>Party moderation literature: Brief survey</title>
<p>The perspective that religion and democracy may not be compatible has developed due to several historical episodes and to the nature of religion and the state. First, the early modern history of the Catholic Church seems to reveal more conflict than cooperation between organized religion and democracy. It seemed the only way for European countries to develop their nascent democratic institutions was to banish the Church from the political and public spheres. The Church itself condemned liberalizing governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>). Later events of the 20th century, such as the aborted Algerian elections of 1990, gave rise to pessimism about Islam being compatible with democracy. An Islamic party looked set to win the second round of the elections, likely giving it a majority in parliament. The military-backed secular government cancelled the second round. Various scholarly interpretations have suggested this was because the Islamist party could not or would not commit to sustaining democratic institutions once in office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 2000</xref>). Second, scholars have reasoned that religious parties have divided loyalties, due to organized religions asserting that their religion is the locus of ultimate authority, and that their religion has broad claims over individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354068812462934">Gill and Keshavarzian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354068812462934">Kniss and Numrich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354068812462934">Lincoln, 2003</xref>). Scholars have also hypothesized that religious parties might use the democratic system to overthrow it from the inside. Some have re-examined these episodes and others, and these conceptions of religion, in an effort to assess whether inclusion in democratic processes leads religious political parties to be moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1354068812462934">March, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1354068812462934">Schwedler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1354068812462934">Tezcur, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1354068812462934">Wickham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1354068812462934">Woodward, 2008</xref>). Here I am restricting the definition of moderate to that which the guest editors are using: the acceptance in principle and practice of democracy and/or liberalism, not the reduction in the extent to which the party is religious, and the rejection in principle and practice of the use of violence as a means of attaining office. In other words, the party’s secularization is not a necessary condition of moderation.</p>
<p>There are indications that participation in and dominance of the governing system contributed to the secularization of the Italian Christian Democratic party over many decades. By that term, I mean both the diminution of the party’s dependence on the Church for electoral support and a reduction in the Church’s influence over the party’s policy positions, particularly by the 1970s. Also contributing was the secularization of the Italian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068812462934">Cipriani, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354068812462934">Ignazi and Wellhoffer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354068812462934">Marchisio and Pisati, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354068812462934">Pollard, 2008</xref>: 117–119, 128, 130–151; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1354068812462934">Warner, 1998</xref>). In keeping with the scope of this special issue, these manifestations of party moderation are not analysed here.</p>
<p>As has been summarized elsewhere, the logic of inclusion leading to moderation is that the rewards of office, including patronage, and the requirement of gaining votes lead parties to become invested in the survival of the democratic system and to moderate their platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068812462934">Elman and Warner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354068812462934">Meguid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1354068812462934">Schwedler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1354068812462934">Wuhs, forthcoming</xref>). Religious parties might attain ‘their interests via participation in the democratic political process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068812462934">Elman and Warner, 2008</xref>: 3). Since the party started with a religious orientation and likely had to some degree support of its namesake organized religion, the party may also be in perpetual tension with that religious organization and some of its followers. The moderation thesis expects that due to the benefits of office-holding, parties can withstand such tensions.</p>

<title>The historical sources of moderation: Development and orientation of Italian Christian Democracy</title>
<p>In the wide spectrum of political movements and parties that claim a religion as their inspiration, Christian Democracy is moderate. Its roots are in Catholic thinking and action that found it possible to reconcile democratic principles with the teachings of Catholicism, and, more controversially, with the authority of the Papacy. Christian Democracy as an ideology evaluates social, economic and political issues and situations using Christian principles. It values democracy for its individual freedoms and as the fairest means to solve economic, political and social inequalities, but, contrary to classical liberalism, sees the individual as an essential member of a family, a spiritual, even supranational, community. It stresses social solidarity, compassion for the poor and state intervention to ameliorate the ravages of industrialization, seeing class divisions as artificial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354068812462934">Kalyvas and van Kersbergen, 2010</xref>). Christian Democratic parties need not be exclusively ‘Catholic’: some parties were developed by Protestants (e.g. the Dutch Christian Historical Union); others are ‘bi-confessional’ (Germany's Christian Democratic/Christian Social Union and the Netherland’s Christian Democratic Appeal).</p>
<p>Like parties in other ideological families, individual Christian Democratic parties differ in the emphasis they place on points in their programmes, on the electorate they target and on the interest groups they prefer. The parties are, nevertheless, usually classified as centre or centre-right parties. While their economic programme moderates capitalism (and hence differentiates them from liberal parties) and places them in the centre of the spectrum, their social programme has both conservative (pro-family and church) and non-conservative elements (social welfare programmes). Some scholars hold that the parties are ‘conservatives of the pragmatic and reformist tradition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354068812462934">Layton-Henry, 1982</xref>: 17). Yet many of the 19th-century Catholic or Christian Democratic parties were anathema to conservatives, as was the short-lived mid-20th century French Christian Democratic party, the Mouvement Républicain Populaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1354068812462934">Warner, 1998</xref>). While ‘democracy’ is an essential part of the definition, Christian Democratic parties often have within them, or must deal with, the clerical right, whose commitment to democracy has often been questionable, at best. As with other religious ideologies, the notion of Christian Democracy is broad enough to allow for a variety of political strategies and interpretations. For instance, the ‘integralist’ strand accepts democracy, but only within the narrow framework of a Christian state. In contrast, the ‘autonomist’ strand accepts a plurality of ideologies, and views the separation of church and state as essential. Other variants of Christian Democracy have a strong leftist streak that challenges class hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068812462934">Chassériaud, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068812462934">Fogarty, 1957</xref>: 3–11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068812462934">Hanley, 1994</xref>: 4–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068812462934">Irving, 1979</xref>: xvii–xxii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354068812462934">Mayeur, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1354068812462934">van Kersbergen, 1994</xref>: 31–47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1354068812462934">von Beyme, 1985</xref>: 81–96).</p>
<p>One might say that the historical roots of Christian Democracy and moderate political Catholicism lay in the liberal Catholic reaction to the Restoration across Europe. A variety of Catholics in Italy opposed the idea of an Italian state united under the papacy, and of state and Church linked in government. They also opposed state encroachments on the Church. This tendency persisted in various permutations through the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1354068812462934">Woolf, 1979</xref>: 338). The Jesuits strongly supported a ‘throne and alter’ regime but were later marginalized by the convulsive events of the century: the 1848 revolutions, wars over the papal states, and the unification of Italy, 1861–1871, under a liberal monarchy. Prior to the unification years, Italy had been ruled by disparate political systems. In the 19th century, the south was governed by the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, the centre by the papacy, the north by the House of Savoy, and Austria. The Church was on good terms with the Kingdom of Two Sicilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068812462934">Jemolo, 1960</xref>: 9); the Church in Piedmont was not. The Italian Monarchy (House of Savoy) was instead allied with the liberal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354068812462934">Hearder, 1983</xref>: 236; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068812462934">Jemolo, 1960</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1354068812462934">Webb, 1958</xref>: 6). While there were ‘clericals’ (conservative Catholics) in the northern government, it would be an exaggeration to say they constituted an organized political party. Further, they accepted the parliamentary system of government (Pollard, 2008: 21–22). The Church thus was isolated. Pius IX (1846–1878) was adamant that the Church not compromise with secular governments. Rather than give ground, he issued the ‘<italic>non expedit’</italic> bull (1868), barring Catholics from participating in Italian politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354068812462934">Pollard, 2008</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>Italy was formally unified in 1871. The Kingdom of Italy had been declared in 1861, but the Papal States, separating northern from southern Italy in a belt running approximately east/west across the centre of Italy, interfered with the realization of unity. The Papal states were forcibly pried loose from Pius IX, and the capital of one of them was designated the capital of Italy: Rome. The pope became, technically, a mere citizen of the secular Italian state. Priests were made subject to military conscription, and the income on which the episcopal sees and parishes depended was now subject to royal decree. The state renounced control over new ecclesiastical laws and acts of ecclesiastical authorities but the monarchy retained the right to appoint southern bishops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812462934">Clark, 1984</xref>: 81–84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068812462934">Guasco, 1997</xref>: 77; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068812462934">Jemolo, 1960</xref>: 49–50). Religious marriages were not recognized by the secular government and divorce became legal. The so-called Roman Question (i.e. the issue of the Church's status) was born.</p>
<p>Nor was it one easily resolved. The Church, seeing itself as the centre of Roman Catholicism, demanded complete freedom of action and sovereignty for the Pope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068812462934">Jemolo, 1960</xref>: 77). The Vatican lacked powerful allies, making it difficult to gain political concessions. Worse yet, a new political enemy had appeared: socialists. Where liberals at least believed that the Church could have some place in society, socialists believed it had none. Some laity organized defensive movements on their own initiative and sometimes obtained papal blessing. Perhaps the most significant of these was the Opera dei Congressi e Comitati Cattolici, founded in 1872. It was made up of youth and adult Catholic movements intended to oppose the liberalizing Italian state. The movement did not want to participate directly in party politics, though it sought to counter socialist organizations, and it staunchly defended the pope on the Roman Question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068812462934">Clark, 1996</xref>: 87). In 1882, Leo XIII issued a formal call in the encyclical <italic>Esti nos</italic> for ‘Catholics to form lay organizations throughout the country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>: 217). The aim was still to limit the liberalizing state. The Opera dei Congressi was, however, disbanded by Pius X in 1904 just two weeks after its progressive president, referring to the Church–state conflict, declared that Catholics were ‘anxious that the work of the living should not be impeded by dead issues’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068812462934">Clark, 1996</xref>: 147). It and other lay movements were reorganized, and put directly under the control of their diocesan bishops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>Catholicism had two main political tendencies at the turn of the century that confound placement on ‘left–right, moderate–immoderate’ spectrums. One, ‘intransigent’, advocated the creation of a Christian republic; one in which the morals and teachings of the Catholic church were embodied in law and policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 4–5). The other, ‘conciliatorist’, accepted the liberal republic and was willing to work with secularists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 6). The latter tended to be more socio-economically conservative than the intransigents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068812462934">Chassériaud, 1965</xref>: 16). The roots of the post-World War II Christian Democratic party’s moderation were written in both tendencies, as both accepted, in some manner, democracy as the basic mode of government. There was yet another view of Catholicism in Italy that advocated a social role for Catholicism but eschewed direct involvement in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>The <italic>non expedit</italic> was gradually transgressed – by the pope. This likely helped the pro-democratic tendencies within some strands of Catholicism to develop in Italian politics. First, in June of 1905, Pius X let each bishop decide whether the Catholics in his diocese should vote in the upcoming legislative election in order to prevent the election of a Socialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354068812462934">Mack Smith, 1969</xref>: 225; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068812462934">Baget-Bozzo, 1974</xref>, I: 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>: 219). Second, the liberal-dominated parliament extended suffrage just prior to the 1913 elections. In order to prevent a Socialist victory, the Church formally revoked the <italic>non expedit</italic> and sought out politicians supportive of the Church's goals. It found a number of liberal politicians willing to strike an electoral deal, the so-called Gentiloni Pact. In return for the candidates agreeing to protect the Catholic Church, the Church directed Catholics to vote for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812462934">Clark, 1984</xref>: 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068812462934">Jemolo, 1960</xref>: 134–135; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354068812462934">Pollard, 2008</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>After World War I, moderate lay Catholics founded in 1919 the Italian Popular Party, or Partito Popolare Italiano (PPI), Italy's first Christian Democratic party. It was led by a priest from Southern Italy, Don Luigi Sturzo (secretary of the national Azione Cattolica office) and animated by a number of priests. Despite the presence of religious officials in the party, the PPI declared its political independence from the Vatican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>: 247). The confessional PPI was ‘an uneasy fusion of Right, Centre and Left-wing Catholics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812462934">Clark, 1984</xref>: 211). It tried both to advance the conditions of workers and rural farmers and labourers, and to balance the claims of capitalists and large landholders. It had been able to diffuse socio-economic conflict in several local areas, though the pressures of the aftermath of World War I were immense. Largely due to the significant Socialist threat, the PPI had the support of the Church and its organizations. With that, the PPI won 20.5 percent of the national vote in 1919 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812462934">Clark, 1984</xref>: 211; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>: 216–221; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>: 47–51). The Church found, for a time, that the PPI was a useful tool by which to fend off ‘creeping socialism’ in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068812462934">Corsini, 1985</xref>). Pope Benedict XV (1914–1922) neither condemned nor blessed the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354068812462934">Mack Smith, 1969</xref>: 326). He explained to a politician: ‘I have not recognized [the PPI] as a party and do not want to recognize it as such in order to be free to disavow it when I want to’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812462934">Falconi 1967</xref>: 146–147). Suffrage had been extended to all adult males, World War I had mobilized and then de-mobilized millions of now unemployed men, and the Socialists and, soon, the Communists, recruited many of them. In the face of such a threat, the PPI was, in the words of Cardinal Pierre Gasparri, merely the ‘least worst of all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812462934">Falconi, 1967</xref>: 147). The conservative elite of the Catholic laity had not developed a party of their own, and even if they had it is unlikely such a party would have had the necessary popular appeal to compete with the parties of the Left.</p>
<p>That the PPI was moderate certainly did not mean all Catholics and especially Catholic political and economic elites were moderate. To the consternation of PPI leaders, many Catholics fell under the sway of what Sturzo labelled ‘clerico-Fascists’, those Catholics and Catholic movements who thought that Fascism could be reconciled with Catholicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068812462934">Gentile, 2006</xref>: 151; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068812462934">Griffin, 2007</xref>: 213–214; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 119–136). The PPI, however, remained moderate, too moderate for its organizational allies, the Catholic Church and local notables. With the Fascists promising a domestic politics favourable to the Church on the one hand, and the Socialists promising increased agitation on the other, the clergy and influential former Partito Popolari candidates, some labelled ‘clerico-Moderates’, threw their support behind ‘the party of order’, Mussolini's Fascists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068812462934">Borzomati, 1972</xref>: 169; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068812462934">Corsini, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068812462934">Farneti, 1978</xref>: 22–23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354068812462934">Kelikian, 1986</xref>: 169–174; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 119).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354068812462934">2</xref>
</sup> With that, the PPI's vote dropped to 9 percent nationally in 1924. The haemorrhaging was high all across Italy, and in 1926 the PPI effectively ceased to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068812462934">Chassériaud, 1965</xref>: 373–375).</p>
<p>Pius XI had found fault with the PPI for two main reasons: first, its 1921 electoral showing gave it only one-fourth of the seats in the parliament, making it too small ‘to steer the solution of the Roman Question through Parliament’ on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812462934">Falconi, 1967</xref>: 186). Second, the Fascists, not the PPI, appeared to be tougher on Socialism and more amenable to the Church's demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812462934">Clark, 1984</xref>: 223).</p>
<p>During the Fascist years, many moderate political Catholics went underground, into exile or into the employ of the Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354068812462934">Moro, 1979</xref>). The ignominious end of Fascism and the Italian monarchy left the Church, the rump of the Christian Democrats and the Communists as the main social and political entities to emerge from the War. Clerico-fascism had largely been cleared away by the events of the War and the demise of Mussolini’s regime. The moderation of the nascent Christian Democratic party, the DC, was strongly shaped by these prior events, by the discrediting of Fascism and a Fascist state that had been supported by many Catholics and Catholic organizations.</p>
<p>The Vatican’s reluctant conclusion in 1945 that Fascism couldn’t survive and that democracy was an acceptable form of government had a major impact, giving the green light to religious parties to form and participate fully in Italian politics, and to Italians to accept democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068812462934">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354068812462934">Pollard, 1996</xref>: 69–85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>: 43–56). Europe was becoming divided into Eastern and Western blocs, and the Italian Communist party emerged as a major political force. The first parliamentary elections under the new Constitution were held in 1948. It was in this context that Democrazia Cristiana was established, with the help of the Catholic Church. Indeed, the Church was a major organizational and electoral campaign activist on behalf of the DC in the early post-war years, and the party acknowledged this. The party’s reliance on the Church was not done uncritically. The DC wanted to dominate Italian politics, and because the Church was the only Italian institution to survive Fascism and World War II with its prestige and vast resources largely intact, the Church was an attractive resource. But also important, and instructive in the context of concerns about religious parties, was the fact that the DC leadership viewed the Church's support of democracy as essential to democracy's survival. It is to the DC’s effort to prevent the collapse of the nascent democracy, the second phase of the DC’s moderation pathway, that we turn next.</p>

<title>Preventing the breakdown of democracy and the rise of splinter Catholic parties</title>
<p>The historical, strategic context strongly affected the DC’s ideological and behavioural moderation. During the Fascist years, seeing the disastrous results of Catholic support of Fascism, the men who later became DC leaders had become convinced of the necessity to sustain democracy. They knew that the Church tended to support whichever form of government best protected its interests, and thus would not be automatically supportive of democracy. They also knew of the Church's potential to undermine democracy. As an Azione Cattolica leader noted in June of 1944, if ‘one thinks of the actual structure of the parties, of the still scarce political education and knowledge [of the population], the lack of parliamentary control [of the interim government]’, the possibility of a coup d'etat was not far-fetched. DC leader Alcide De Gasperi expressed his worries as late as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1354068812462934">1952</xref> that ‘[a]ll our argumentation in favor of a democratic regime does not succeed in persuading [the Vatican], because it believes that democracy is too weak to resist the extreme [Left]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068812462934">De Gasperi, 1974</xref>: 346; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>: 77–121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354068812462934">Pollard, 1996</xref>: 86–87; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 160).<sup>

</p>
<p>De Gasperi, well aware of the history of the PPI and of clerico-Fascism, knew that only a party with the full support of the Church and Catholics could help consolidate the democracy. If the Catholic left were to form its own party, De Gasperi and other centrists feared the Catholic right would ally with the neo-Fascists, somewhat emulating a highly consequential break in ranks by right-leaning PPI deputies in 1923 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1354068812462934">Pollard, 1996</xref>: 81). In a situation with multiple Catholic parties, the DC leadership feared the Church would ally with the right, and perhaps lead to a return to Fascism or precipitate a civil war leading to a Communist takeover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>: 638; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354068812462934">Magister, 1979</xref>: 41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354068812462934">Malgeri, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 128–129). In 1944, the DC declared that political action was to be ‘the projection of religious life into the political field’, with laws based on ‘the traditional Catholic spirit of the Italian people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068812462934">Falconi, 1955</xref>: 61). Declaring its link to the Church, De Gasperi stated in a speech in Rome in 1946 that ‘our party is an organization of believers who, on the politico-economic plain want to bring about true democratic politics and a profound, just, social transformation; but in entering the party, the activist does not change belief, he does not cut the umbilical cord which unites him with his spiritual Mother’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>: 630). To prevent the Church from turning against democracy, and to block the Communist party (PCI), the DC's leadership tried to bring together within it all strands of Catholicism. The party was particularly sensitive to the dangers for a Christian Democratic party, and for democracy, of the Church's attraction to authoritarian solutions to its perceived problems. De Gasperi and others argued that the mistake of the DC’s predecessor’s right after World War I had been to try to enact all reforms at once, thus alienating powerful interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068812462934">De Gasperi, 1974</xref>: 273, cf. 342). For this and other reasons, the DC, as the lead party in government, moved slowly on enacting reformist policies it supported and that the secular left was demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068812462934">Ginsborg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1354068812462934">Pasquino, 2007</xref>: 273–285). The DC found itself in what Giovanni Sartori classifies as a system of ‘polarized pluralism’, with an ‘anti-system’ party at each end of the political spectrum, and the DC occupying part of the centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1354068812462934">Sartori, 1976</xref>: 131–140). The immediate post-World War II, post-Fascism, nascent Cold War context helped to define the party and its moderation: it could easily differentiate itself from Fascism as well as from Communism.</p>
<p>The prior experiences of DC activists affected the party’s moderation. Because DC founders ‘had grown up under the supervision and protection of the bishops and the Holy See’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354068812462934">Moro, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 172), they would seem to be inclined towards the anti-democratic position of the Catholic Church during the Fascist years. In addition, of 207 deputies in the Constituent Assembly, 122 had been members of the lay Catholic social movement, Azione Cattolica (Catholic Action). Many in the DC's leadership had come from one of two branches of Azione Cattolica, the Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana (FUCI) and the Movimento Lauriati di Azione Cattolica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>: 622; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354068812462934">Moro, 1979</xref>: 20–22). In the Constituent Assembly of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068812462934">1946</xref>, half the DC politicians were former PPI politicians; and two/thirds of the DC’s Constituent Assembly senators had been PPI politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068812462934">Chassériaud, 1965</xref>: 218). However, although the DC’s politicians were students of the Church, these politicians had seen the fiasco of Catholic alliances with Fascism. They hoped to reconcile Christianity and democracy and to bring Christian (Catholic) principles into politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1354068812462934">Webster, 1960</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>Inclusion in the democratic process was not the source of the DC’s moderation, which the reader will recall is here limited to acceptance of democracy; instead, the historical context was. The party, while emphasizing its Catholic orientation and inspiration, started as a moderate party, supportive of democracy. Its factions accepted democracy. For example, one left-wing faction, Politica d'Oggi (Today’s Politics), argued that no government was possible without the continued support of the secular left, particularly of the Nenni Socialists (PSI). They also argued that democracy could not co-exist with the monarchy, because the latter, failing to protect the former, had collaborated with Mussolini. The other, more important left-wing factions, those of Catholic Action's Giovanni Gronchi (Politica Sociale, Social Politics) and of Giuseppe Dossetti (Iniziativa Democratica, Democratic Initiative), made similar arguments. Among other grievances, they cited the party's strident anti-Communism, its collaboration with the small centre and right parties, and its limited support for various reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068812462934">Chassériaud, 1965</xref>: 273–291; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1354068812462934">Pridham, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1354068812462934">Zuckerman, 1979</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068812462934">4</xref>
</sup> In contrast, the current on the right, the Vespisti, argued that Italy could not exist without having a constitutional monarchy, and that it could not exist in government with the socialist or communist left. Excluding from consideration the idea of forming a coalition with another party does not necessarily indicate an anti-democratic stance; indeed, that is a standard positioning tactic of most parties in parliamentary systems. Even the left and right-wing factions of Christian Democracy did not advocate a non-democratic government, nor the use of violence to implement their policies. On those scales, the party’s ideology and process preferences were moderate to start with. The common denominator of the DC's various ideological strands was the view that the DC's role was to keep Italy free of Fascism and Communism and to bring Christian ideals and policies into politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068812462934">Acanfora, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068812462934">Capperucci, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354068812462934">Magri, 1954</xref>: 314; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 271–272).<sup>

In 1944, Alcide De Gasperi stated: ‘Our party is an organization of believers that on the political-economic terrain, wants to bring about a sincere political democracy and a profound social transformation based upon justice’ (De Gasperi, 1944: 18). De Gasperi stressed that the DC considered its fundamental inspiration to be Christian, though it did not have a rigorous religious programme: ‘We are not searching for some formula to adopt, but we hold present that the fundamental laws of civilized living must start from the bases of the Christian conviction in its social duty, in the sense such that the principles which inspire it do not have to remain only lived in the internal conscience, but must be realized in political life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354068812462934">Magri, 1954</xref>: 50).<sup>

</sup> The party also emphasized a catch-all position; Catholicism was to be the binding agent.

<p>Above all, the DC founders' conception of the party was that of a Catholic party of government that would control the state and keep Italy free of Communism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354068812462934">Magri, 1954</xref>: 314).<sup>

The DC recruited, and indeed was shaped by, anyone who was willing to claim Catholicism as their religion and anti-Communism as their creed. These minimal prerequisites enabled the DC to have as candidates and activists those who were sincerely committed to Catholic social justice and those who were merely political opportunists.</p>
<p>Studies comparing the policy positions on standard left–right scales of the immediate post-war main parties place the DC in the centre-right of the spectrum, flanked by a more extreme Left party (the PCI, and, in the 1948 election, a combined PCI–PSI), and a more extreme Right party, the MSI, that gave ‘voice to those who still identified with the past [fascist] regime) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068812462934">Albright, 2008</xref>: 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068812462934">Farneti, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068812462934">Ferraresi, 1996</xref>: 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068812462934">Ginsborg, 1990</xref>: 144–145; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354068812462934">Kertzer, 1980</xref>).<sup>

<p>To understand the DC’s ideological and behavioural moderation, one also has to understand the context created by the Catholic Church in post-war Italy, and by the Cold War. The DC came into post-war politics with few resources of its own. The party was organizationally rather thin on the ground in many places; in contrast, the Church had an extensive network of parishes and secondary organizations, such as branches of Azione Cattolica, and was able to conduct a massive pro-DC vote mobilization campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812462934">Casella, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812462934">Durand, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>: 77–86, 108–110, 168–170). The DC had been careful to win the Church’s support for that campaign, and the party went on to win a near absolute majority of votes in the election (48.5 percent), something almost unheard of in proportional representation parliamentary democracies. That victory, which gave the DC the majority of seats in one chamber and a near majority in the other, enabled the DC to begin its almost 50-year dominance of the Italian government and state apparatus.</p>
<p>The Church in Italy in the immediate post-war years was a dominant socio-political institution, and under Pius XII, conservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354068812462934">Pollard, 2008</xref>). No confessional party wishing to be successful could ignore the Church, yet at the same time ecclesiastical support could not be taken for granted, and the voting preferences of Catholics and even of the clergy could not be assumed to be DC.<sup>

</p>
<p>In those crucial early years, the DC risked losing Church support through its actions in the Constituent Assembly and in its governing coalition strategies. Hoping to prevent a resurgence of Fascism, the DC chose to work, briefly, with the Communists and Socialists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1354068812462934">15</xref>
</sup> The risk was that the Church and voters would see this as being soft on Communism; that democracy would not provide a sufficient barrier to potential Communist takeover. The party did not support the Church's bid to have divorce outlawed by the Constitution or to keep the Monarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 241–243, 201–252). As a result, the Church in early 1947 was expressing ‘disillusionment’ with the DC, ‘because it did not see in that Party a sufficient barrier against the overflow of Communism and anti-clericalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 245, 260–262). The Church and its organizational affiliates began to talk of alternative parties. For example, in the northern province of Brescia in 1946 and 1947, some priests were openly helping the Uomo Qualunque organize. They viewed as ‘suspicious’ the ‘ambiguous surrendering of the DC to too many initiatives [which were] of a demagogic nature’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1354068812462934">16</xref>
</sup> Since the UQ's leader had declared ‘God is the only boss of the UQ which only to him [God] and his laws [the UQ] declares itself unconditionally the subject’, that party had the potential to siphon off a number of Catholic votes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068812462934">Ghini, 1968</xref>: 66–67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354068812462934">Pallotta, 1972</xref>: quote on p. 141). Some priests noted that it was hard to convince their congregations to support the DC when the party appeared less than Catholic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1354068812462934">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In response, to manage its relation with ‘its’ organized religion and obtain its full-fledged electoral support, the DC in May of 1947 forced the Communist party out of the government. This reassured the Church that the DC was serious about fighting the Communist party. The result for the DC was to gain the benefits of the Church's endorsement and extensive organizational resources, resources which were crucial in the 1948 campaign, persuading voters to support the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812462934">Casella, 1992</xref>: 73–74; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068812462934">Ginsborg, 1990</xref>: 111–112). They did; the DC won 48 percent of the vote and 53 percent of seats in the lower house of parliament, defeating the combined Communist–Socialist party list, which won 31 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>That Church support was attained in 1948 did not mean it would be again in 1953. The DC had done poorly in its first electoral test since the victory of 1948: in the provincial council elections of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1354068812462934">1952</xref>, the DC's total dropped to 35 percent, that of the neo-Fascists rose from 2.2 to 6.9 percent. The Monarchists also doubled their votes (from 2 to 4 percent). Votes on the left did not increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068812462934">Bachelet, 1973</xref>: 117–141; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068812462934">Caranti, 1954</xref>: 70). The Vatican was irritated and worried; De Gasperi stated privately that he feared ‘the worst, that is that they [the Vatican] are thinking about an initiative for a new party … Every one of our real or presumed insufficiencies will be a pretext’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068812462934">De Gasperi, 1974</xref>: 209–210).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1354068812462934">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The DC also had to get the support of Catholic voters themselves, not just priests and the Catholic hierarchy. With the presence of Western Europe’s largest Communist party, the Italian context allowed the DC to present itself as moderate, even if with a religious ideological basis and even if stridently anti-Communist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068812462934">Blackmer and Tarrow, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1354068812462934">Tannahill, 1978</xref>). The challenge for the DC was that unless it was brought to their attention, many Catholics did not see Communism as a threat to their religion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1354068812462934">19</xref>
</sup> The Communists had been telling voters to leave religious matters to the Church, and political matters to the Communists, and in 1947 voted for the article in the Constitution that enshrined the Lateran Pacts, those having given the Church its freedom in religious matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068812462934">Ginsborg, 1990</xref>: 101). The PCI was stressing that Communism and Catholicism were reconcilable – the former dealt with material matters, the latter with spiritual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 152–153).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1354068812462934">20</xref>
</sup> In the Communist party stronghold of Bologna, the Bishops warned their constituents that ‘they [the Communists] try to make us believe that Catholic faith and Catholic life can coexist with <italic>atheist</italic> marxism’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354068812462934">Kertzer, 1980</xref>: 109, italics in original). A regional party secretary of the Uomo Qualunque stated in 1947 that' Not all the Christians are in Christian Democracy, not all the Catholics are in Azione Cattolica’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068812462934">Chiarini and Corsini, 1983</xref>: 53, fn. 33). For the 1948 parliamentary election campaign, the DC worked with the Church to develop the Catholic electorate’s fear of Communism.</p>
<p>The context enabled the DC to underscore its moderation (as understood in this article, as pro-democracy). To convince practising Catholics that Communism was a threat to religion and a threat to a decent life, the DC framed elections as a battle between good and evil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068812462934">Bocca, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1354068812462934">Sbarberi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1354068812462934">Scoppola, 1988</xref>: 295–299). Pressured by competition from the neo-Fascists in 1952 and 1953, if the DC wanted to retain Catholic organizations' support and continue to be a large party, the DC had to magnify the Communist threat and portray the DC as the answer. In a 1950 speech, Alcide De Gasperi warned Italians against ‘the work of Cain’ being done by those who were vigorously protesting the DC dominated government. The parties in question were unmistakably the PCI and PSI. Instead, ‘with us is security, with us is peace, with us is, above all, the blessing of Providence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354068812462934">Magri, 1954</xref>: 21).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1354068812462934">21</xref>
</sup> It was the effort to win the election and sustain democracy that led the DC to characterize a major political competitor as absolute evil, and to have a policy stance of excluding that competitor from participating in government.</p>
<p>Even for the municipal elections of 1956, the DC's general secretary, Amintore Fanfani, was warning that it was still possible that the electorate would ‘chose the path which subtly would carry the Communists to the Viminale [Interior Ministry's office]’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1354068812462934">22</xref>
</sup> For the 1958 elections, the DC again emphasized the need to vote DC in order to give Italy ‘a secure and effective anti-Communist action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068812462934">Ghini, 1975</xref>: 164). With the PCI on the left and the neo-Fascists on the far right, the DC’s initial moderation as a pro-democratic party persisted. It then exploited the political system and bureaucracy to establish its hold on power, and to prevent a splintering and re-radicalization of Catholic political tendencies. It became Italy’s dominant centre-right party until its demise in 1994.</p>

<title>Democratic system engagement: Reflections on moderation</title>
<p>As Percy Allum has argued in this journal, one must be cautious not to over-state the DC’s commitment in practice to all aspects of democracy. The DC under De Gasperi evolved a concept of ‘protected democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068812462934">Allum, 1997</xref>). By the early 1950s, for De Gasperi's party, [t]o hold power in the face of the enemy became almost an end in itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068812462934">Ginsborg, 1990</xref>: 144; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354068812462934">Kogan, 1983</xref>: 73; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1354068812462934">Orfei, 1976</xref>: 181; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1354068812462934">Rossini, 1984</xref>). Through its control of the Ministry of the Interior, the party could and usually did hamper not only the activities of the Left but of Monarchists, neo-fascists and potential splinter parties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1354068812462934">23</xref>
</sup> It used patronage and then corruption coercively to win office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068812462934">Allum, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068812462934">Caciagli, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812462934">Chubb, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068812462934">Graziano, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1354068812462934">Warner, 1998</xref>). Importantly, these strategies also limited the options of politically ambitious Catholics: for access to power, it was the DC or nothing. That is not to say that other parties did not engage in patronage or corruption, but to emphasize that the DC, in using these tools of office holding, limited the ability of potential splinter Catholic movements to become successful rival political parties – that rivalry was largely contained within the party. This helped sustain its position as the dominant party in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068812462934">Allum, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068812462934">Barbacetto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068812462934">Della Porta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068812462934">Della Porta and Vannucci, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068812462934">Golden and Chang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1354068812462934">Zuckerman, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to retain Church support, the party went along with the Church’s preference for limiting civil liberties in the spheres of family law, the rights of non-Catholic religious organizations and employment. The Lateran Pacts were formally included in the 1948 Constitution, and the status of other religions not revised (slightly) until 1984. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1354068812462934">Pollard (2008</xref>: 118) notes that the ‘quasi-constitutional status of the Concordat led to the development of a body of case law clearly in conflict with the constitutional principles of freedom of religion and freedom of conscience’. The DC also left on the books numerous restrictive laws enacted during the period of Fascist rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1354068812462934">Orfei, 1976</xref>). Working within the democratic institutions, the DC did not find it useful to expand some civil liberties.</p>
<p>This article has described the DC as a moderate religious party, and noted that moderation had its limits at times. Certainly at the end of Fascism and the beginning the Cold War, the DC’s anti-Fascist and anti-Communist stance could not be described as immoderate; the party supported and was immersed in the democratic political system. The party, however, selectively applied the rule of (democratic) law and famously came to use corruption, not ‘just’ patronage, to win elections and enrich its politicians and activists. Furthermore, as has been well documented, the DC missed numerous opportunities for significant progressive reforms of the state and economy. The party’s history indicates that while patronage and corruption may reduce the influence of organized religion in a political party, by enabling the party to distance itself from the religious institution it may lead the party to violate other tenets of democracy, such as the use of public office for public purposes.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, as expected by some party moderation scholars, the institutions of the political system (and politicians’ manipulations of them) have had an impact on the tenor of religious politics in Italy. From 1948 to 1994, Italy had a proportional representation system which fostered a proliferation of parties and rewarded politicians who made extensive use of patronage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068812462934">Chang, 2005</xref>). It also forced the DC to form coalition governments with other, and secular, parties, reaching compromises of which the Catholic Church did not approve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354068812462934">Mershon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1354068812462934">Warner, 2000</xref>). Yet the focus of this article has not been on whether democratic inclusion leads parties to become less ‘religious’; it is on whether that leads to commitment to democratic principles and liberal rights. And on that, the DC is more of an exception: the source of its moderation was in its earlier ideological development, the colossal failure of clerico-Fascism, and in the strategic party and broader socio-political context the DC faced at its birth. In power, it was committed to preventing a political system collapse into Fascism or Communism, and the formation of splinter Catholic parties that, with the centrifugal tendencies of the political system, could have emerged to challenge the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1354068812462934">Sartori, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the questions motivating this article, what causes the moderation of religious political parties, Italy’s PPI and DC suggest we need to consider that some religious parties start as moderate parties, due to earlier historical trajectories that affect party system and ideological developments in a country. Since its inception, Christian Democracy itself has been an ideology holding that the two elements of that term are compatible and should be expressed in politics. Christian Democracy becoming institutionalized in a major party in any given country has depended, as is evident in the Italian case, on favourable historical trajectories as much as, if not more so, on any internal pressures from the democratic political system. Christian Democratic parties arrive as moderate parties even though there may be strong immoderate trends in other political and religious movements. In the Italian case, due to the experiences of Fascism and World War II, the anti-democratic threads in some Catholic movements had little chance of becoming viable political parties in the post-war era. The greater threat was from the secular extreme Left and Right. It would be absurd to characterize any of Italy’s Christian Democratic parties (the PPI or DC, or present-day variants) as radical (anti-democratic, advocating violence and a theocratic state).</p>
<p>Operating in the context of democratic institutions that they have had a hand in shaping, at times Christian Democratic parties in various countries have set aside obtaining religious goals in order to form or be included in governing coalitions, participate in legislative quid-pro-quos and adjust to constituencies which become less religiously observant than they were when the parties were established. For the DC, strategic context and choices, the management of the relationship with the dominant organized religion, and use of patronage all were important to its establishment. The party used the support of the Catholic Church, its ancillary organizations and Catholic voters to win the dominant position in government shortly after World War II. Other possible Catholic parties were rapidly eliminated as politicians and voters converged on the governing party. During the Cold War, the DC retained the votes of devout Catholics, and could count on the Church’s endorsement at every election, given the lack of viable alternatives to the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354068812462934">Pasquino, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1354068812462934">Pasquino and McCarthy, 1993</xref>). The DC’s access to the spoils of office, its evoking the Communist threat, and its monopoly of the Catholic vote, enabled it to shelve the essence of its Christian Democratic message and instead create a polity in which the party and its coalition partners immoderately plundered the state.</p>
