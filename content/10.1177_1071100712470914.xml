<sec id="section1-1071100712470914">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Syndesmotic injuries occur in up to 11% of all ankle injuries. Whereas the optimal fixation of syndesmotic injuries remains controversial, pitfalls in their management can lead to poor outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712470914">
<title>Materials and Methods:</title>
<p>This is a retrospective study of all ankle fractures operated on at a level 1 trauma center over a 7-year period. All cases with syndesmotic fixation were classified and patients’ notes and x-rays were reviewed. The timing of definitive syndesmotic fixation, the type of fixation (screw size and number, number of cortices), and the number of unplanned, syndesmotic-related reoperations were recorded. Seventy syndesmotic ruptures were operated on during the study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712470914">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were 19 unplanned reoperations. The 3 reasons for reoperation identified were failure to diagnose the syndesmotic injury 9/19 (47%), failure to achieve an anatomic reduction 6/19 (31%), and loss of reduction due to fixation failure 4/19 (21%). The type of fixation was not correlated with the failure rate, nor were the experience of the surgeon, the gender or the age of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712470914">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The reoperation rate for syndesmotic fixation may be higher than previously thought. In order to reduce the pitfalls in their treatment, we emphazise the importance of 3 critical points in the management of these injuries: suspect the injury, document the stability of the syndesmosis, and reduce the fibula anatomically.</p>

<body>
<p>Syndesmotic injuries are common, either as isolated injuries or in combination with ankle fractures. Failure to diagnose them and inadequate fixation of the syndesmosis complex lead to predictably poor clinical results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712470914">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712470914">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712470914">26</xref></sup> However, little is known about the incidence of the delayed diagnosis and the rate of unplanned, syndesmosis-related reoperations in a clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712470914">16</xref></sup> Moreover, the most common pitfalls in their management have not been outlined and categorized in a simple and reproducible manner. Finally, the demographics of the patient population and the incidence of concomitant injuries have not been thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>The current retrospective cohort study was an effort to address these issues. The cohort represents one of the largest series of syndesmotic injuries treated in a tertiary trauma center studied. The patients’ demographics and types of injury were analyzed. Individual reoperations were identified, their rate calculated, as well as the correlation between the event of failure with patient-, surgeon-, and implant-related factors. In the process, 3 distinct modes of failure in treatment were identified and classified.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712470914" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study included all patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center with an ankle injury over a period of 6.5 years with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. All patients who had operative fixation of a syndesmotic injury were identified and their notes and radiographs were retrieved. Patients with pilon-fractures or concomitant midshaft tibia and fibula fractures were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>The injuries were classified according to the AO/Weber classification of ankle fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712470914">25</xref></sup> Patients with an isolated soft tissue injury were identified and formed a separate group. The classification was performed on plain radiographs by 2 independent observers who were not involved in any of the operations. A random sample of 20 patients’ radiographs was initially used to test the researchers’ intra- and interobserver reliability in the classification of the injuries according to previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712470914">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The age and gender of the patients were recorded. Patients were divided into groups according to the mechanism of injury (high or low velocity) and the presence of concomitant injuries (isolated ankle injury or multitrauma patients).</p>
<p>The type of operative fixation was documented, including number and diameter of screws and number of cortices. The 2 most common methods of fixation were:
<list id="list1-1071100712470914" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A: 2 3.5 mm cortical screws with 3 cortices fixation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>B: 1 4.5 mm fully threaded cancellous screw with 3 cortices fixation.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The other fixation modes were:
<list id="list2-1071100712470914" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>C: 1 4.5mm cortical screw with 4 cortices fixation,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>D: 1 or 2 3.4 mm screws with 3 or 4 cortices fixation,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>E: 2 4.5 mm screws with 3 or 4 cortices fixation,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>F: pure plate osteosynthesis of a distal fibula fracture without syndesmosis fixation.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>Furthermore, the fixation was classified as open or percutaneous. All surgeons involved in the primary operation were classified according to their level of experience as senior (consultants), intermediate (fellows), and junior (registrars, residents). We looked at the timing of the initial surgical treatment, either on planned day lists or on after hours and weekend lists. The total length of stay and the time from injury to definitive syndesmotic fixation was recorded for each patient. The total number of radiographs taken for each case, from presentation to final follow-up, was recorded.</p>
<p>All unplanned, syndesmosis-related reoperations were classified as failures. Procedures involving routine removal of syndesmotic fixation screws without revising the syndesmotic fixation were not considered unplanned and were not included in the study.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the study, 3 different modes of failure were identified:</p>
<list id="list3-1071100712470914" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Diagnosis: Missed diagnosis of the syndesmotic injury with no syndesmotic fixation during the primary operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduction: Failure to anatomically reduce the syndesmosis in the primary reduction of the fibula in the incisura fibularis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fixation: Early postoperative loss of fixation despite initial adequate reduction and fixation of the syndesmosis complex.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Data were analyzed computing a 2-tailed Pearson’s correlation to check for pairwise correlations. All reported <italic>P</italic>-values were 2-tailed with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 considered as significant, and analyses were conducted using SPSS 15 for Windows of the ETH Zürich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland). In order to detect a 5% prevalence of fixation failure with a precision level of 5%, it was calculated that 73 cases would be needed, assuming a 5% significance level and 80% power. The baseline characteristics of the study cohort were collected and registered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712470914">Table 1</xref>), and outcomes were assessed according to 7 parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712470914">Tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712470914">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1071100712470914">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From October 2000 until March 2007 (6.5 years), 824 patients were admitted to our hospital (tertiary trauma unit) with an ankle injury. Seventy cases of syndesmotic injury were operated on in 68 patients (2 bilateral cases). The incidence of syndesmotic injuries in the ankle injuries was 8.5% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712470914">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of syndesmotic injuries showed 70 injuries, 63 with fractures and 7 purely ligamentous injuries without fracture. According to the AO classification, there were 7 type B3 fractures, 27 type C1, 18 type C2, and 11 type C3 injuries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1071100712470914">Table 2</xref>). The inter- and intraobserver variability in classifying the fractures was 90% agreement in trial x-rays with a K variability index greater than 0.8.</p>
<p>Unplanned syndesmosis-related reoperations were performed in 19 of the 70 ankles, which resulted in a reoperation rate of 27%. In 2 cases bilateral reoperations were performed, and in 1 case the syndesmotic fixation was revised twice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1071100712470914">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The average time to the definitive fixation was 7.6 days (range, 0-93 days) for the whole study group. For the subgroup of 51 ankles that required no reoperation, the time to surgery was 2.5 days (range, 0-20). For the remaining 19 ankles that required reoperation, the average time to definitive fixation was 22 days (range, 0-93). The average number of radiographs taken until definitive treatment was 18, whereas in 1 case with bilateral reoperations the patient had a total of 61 foot and ankle radiographs taken from admission until final discharge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712470914">Table 1</xref>). One patient required a number of repeated syndesmosis-related admissions, which reached a total duration of 93 days; nevertheless, he also suffered from associated injuries.</p>
<p>The reoperation rate was not related to the type of the injury, screw diameter, number of screws, number of purchased cortices, type of fixation, and the seniority of the operating surgeon. After hours surgery and operations performed on weekends were related to a higher reoperation rate (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1071100712470914">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The incidence of syndesmotic injuries varies from 11% in ankle injuries of the general population up to 40% in sport-related trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712470914">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712470914">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712470914">16</xref></sup> The analysis of demographic data in the relevant literature mainly relates to male athletes whereas the older, more sedentary population has received less attention. In our series, the percentage of syndesmotic injury requiring operative treatment was 8.5% in a general population of 824 patients admitted for an ankle injury. Weening et al report a 14.1% incidence of synesmotic fixations among 425 ankle fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712470914">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, an unexpectedly high rate of unplanned reoperations was found in comparison with the relevant literature. There were a total of 19 reoperations in 70 ankles (27% reoperation rate). One in 4 patients with a syndesmotic injury required at least 1 additional, unplanned operation. Almost half of the failures were due to a missed initial diagnosis. In these cases, the ankle fracture was treated with open reduction and internal fixation without fixation of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis.</p>
<p>Others have reported an insufficient reduction of the syndesmosis in 16% of the cases, a number corresponding to the average failure rate according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712470914">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712470914">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objective was to identify the modes of failure and to correlate the event of failure with patient- and doctor-related parameters in order to improve future outcomes.</p>
<p>The management of a syndesmotic rupture remains somewhat controversial with most of the relevant information derived from biomechanical and cadaveric studies with few relatively small, clinical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712470914">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712470914">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712470914"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712470914">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712470914">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712470914">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712470914">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Common fixation techniques include the use of cortical screws, whereas other methods such as suture-button devices are gaining popularity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712470914">23</xref></sup> In the case of screw fixation, most authors support the use of either 4.5 mm screw or 3.5 mm screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712470914">28</xref></sup> With the exception of the so-called Maisonneuve fracture, where the 2 3.5 mm screws configuration may be superior, both methods of fixation may be used interchangeably, and this has been the standard practice in our series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712470914">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the abundant relevant literature, in this study the classification of the injury, the screws used (number and diameter), the number of purchased cortices, and type of fixation were not related to the failure rate of syndesmotic fixation. In a large review of 126 syndesmotic disruptions, no significant difference could be found between 3.5 mm screws using 3 or 4 cortices for fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712470914">15</xref></sup> The difference in the outcome was a presence of 5% loss of reduction in the group using 3 cortices, while in the other group the reduction was maintained during the follow-up of 140 days. Stoffel et al demonstrated similar results in his comparative cadaveric work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712470914">22</xref></sup> In a prospective, randomized study of 64 patients, Hoiness et al were not able to show any significant difference in the outcome of 3 cortex compared to 4 cortex fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712470914">12</xref></sup> In the clinical setting, the major determinant of failure of treatment of syndesmotic injuries may be the failure to recognize or to anatomically reduce the diastasis and not the type of fixation used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712470914">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent comparative study by Pelton et al in Maissoneuve injuries showed that an open repair resulted in a better anatomical reduction and recommended abandoning percutaneous fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712470914">20</xref></sup> We were unable to demonstrate such a difference between the closed and open methods in our study group. We agree though that consideration should be given to arthrotomy and open anterior syndesmosis repair in pure ligamentous injuries or high Weber-C injuries, as well as paying attention to the syndesmosis in the open fixation of ankle fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712470914">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712470914">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, the seniority of the surgeon was also not related to the outcome. One would expect that junior surgeons would have more failures, but this was not the case in the present study. We were not able to find previous studies that evaluated the surgeons’ seniority in relation to failure in ankle surgery. Such a correlation has been found in the treatment of “technically demanding” proximal femoral fractures. In their study, Palm et al showed a higher reoperation rate when the procedure was performed by juniors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712470914">19</xref></sup> On the other hand, Toh et al did not find seniority to be a predictive factor for success in the treatment of intracapsular hip fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712470914">24</xref></sup> We think that syndesmotic fixation can be technically demanding, and this partly explains the high rate of syndesmosis reoperations even among experienced surgeons.</p>
<p>Of the parameters measured in the current study, only operating after hours and on weekends was related to a poorer outcome. Again, to our knowledge this parameter has not been evaluated in the relevant foot and ankle literature. Similar to our findings, after hours operating has been related to a higher rate of unplanned reoperations in a recent study for intramedullary nail fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712470914">21</xref></sup> This may indicate inadequate preoperative evaluation or poor intraoperative documentation of the syndesmotic stability with well-established intraoperative tests such as the Cotton test or the external rotation test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712470914">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712470914">28</xref></sup> According to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, syndesmotic ruptures cannot be precluded by using radiographic measurements alone because not every syndesmotic injury results in a visible diastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712470914">17</xref></sup> This may partly explain failures in after hours surgeries, where the intraoperative provocative tests for diastasis testing were not performed.</p>
<p>A weakness of the study is that most malreductions of the syndesmosis were evaluated with the use of plain radiographic criteria only. Computed tomography is more accurate in detecting missed reductions, which has been shown by several authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712470914">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712470914">11</xref></sup> Gardner et al found in their series that more than half of the patients treated with syndesmotic fixation were not anatomically reduced according to CT measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712470914">11</xref></sup> There are however limitations in the routine use of CT in syndesmotic injuries. Important anatomic variations of the incisura fibularis have been documented in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712470914">1</xref></sup> These include the lack of a tibiofibular overlap and a flat incisura fibularis found in normal individuals, which would necessitate inclusion of both ankles in the CT for comparison with the normal side. Moreover, the threshold of 2 mm for intrarticular syndesmotic congruity in CT scans is rather arbitrary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712470914">11</xref></sup> Using this criterion, the malreduction rate would probably be even higher in our cohort. However, unlike the radiographic criteria for evaluating malreduction, this type of incongruity has not been related to a worse clinical outcome. Therefore, revising all CT detected malreductions may have actually led to overtreatment. Another weakness of the current study is that according to the power analysis, it is underpowered by 3 patients. Still, it is one of the largest series of syndesmotic injuries in the literature, evaluated with objective criteria by independent observers with a high inter- and intraobserver reliabili.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this retrospective study the authors found a high failure rate of syndesmotic fixation and classified 3 modes of failure in the treatment of syndesmotic injuries. Our findings reinforce the importance of general principles in syndesmotic fixation, such as suspecting the injury, documenting the stability of the syndesmosis intraoperatively, and reducing the fibula anatomically in the incisura fibularis. Interestingly, in our series half of the failures were due to a missed diagnosis, which would have easily been made with the use of radiographic criteria only. Operating after hours and on weekends was also related to a higher reoperation rate. We believe that syndesmotic injuries need to be regularly followed and documented in any hospital treating trauma patients.</p>
