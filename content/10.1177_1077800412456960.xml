<abstract>
<p>This poetic-narrative autoethnography employs expressive writing in exploring the author’s experiences of living and growing up as a second generation Kindertransport survivor. The methodological approach involved selecting poems from two books of poetry written about the Holocaust by the author during the 1980s and adding narrative reflections explicating the author’s perspectives and understandings of his experience. The poetic-narrative autoethnography focuses on the difficulties in connecting to an unspoken, painful past family history and explores the difficulties of writing and telling this particular story. This study offers a first insight into the experience and consciousness of being a second-generation Kindertransport survivor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The poetic-narrative autoethnography presented here explores my experiences of living and growing up in a family under what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412456960">Barnett (2004)</xref> has defined as “the unseen shadow of the Kindertransport” (p. 105). In 1939, my father who was a ten year old child was sent by his parents from Germany on one of the limited number of transportations of Jewish-German children to England known as the Kindertransport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412456960">Benz, 2004</xref>). This little known Holocaust experience involved parents parting from their children during a time of persecution and pending war without knowing what would become of them or if they would ever see their beloved children again. In itself, this parting is an act of bravery and self-sacrifice that is difficult to comprehend. Psychological research into the lives of Kindertransport-Holocaust survivors has characterized their experiences as a case of repeated-multiple trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412456960">Gopfert, 2004</xref>) with <italic>Kinder</italic> contending with survival guilt, suppressed identities, migration, war, separation, fear, lack of knowledge of the fate of their families and ultimately difficulties in mourning and grief.</p>
<p>Children of the <italic>Kinder</italic> have themselves faced a range of psychological issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412456960">Gopfert (2004)</xref> states that “the second generation has suffered a loss too: the lack of knowledge of their roots, the inhibition of dialogue with their parents, the absence of their grandparents” (p. 105). Contending with their parent’s strange behaviors and trying to connect to a past unspoken and unseen, created psychological complexities difficult to live with and even more problematic to express. In an attempt to mollify this situation, in the U.S.A. and under the heading of KT2, second generation Kindertransport survivors have attempted to come to terms with the history of their families through documentation of their parents stories and lives. The current manuscript is part of a similar process and offers some insight into my personal experiences and thoughts in growing up under the shadow of the Kindertransport.</p>

<sec id="section2-1077800412456960" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological Approach: Poetic-Narrative Autoethnography</title>
<p>The writing of personal narratives can be a form of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412456960">Richardson, 2000</xref>). This happens when, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412456960">Ellis, Adams and Bochner (2010)</xref> point out, the writing of personal stories makes “witnessing possible” and that this allows “participants and readers to observe and, consequently, better testify on behalf of an event, problem or experience” (p. 6). Writing and the act of witnessing one’s own life offers the option of exploring the complexities of personal experience and presenting it for observation by another. Through personal narrative and poetry writing a conceptual, psychological and emotional space can be opened between propagated societal discourses of anticipated and expected existence and phenomenological personal experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412456960">Hanauer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412456960">Adams and Holman-Jones (2011)</xref> in their discussion of the intersections of autoethnography and queer theory point out that within autoethnography, identity and experience are “uncertain, fluid, open to interpretation, and able to be revised” (p. 110). It is this fluidity and shifting perspective on personally accessed, cultural valued experiences that makes the investigation of phenomenological knowledge important as a research method. Rather than broad generalities concerning life and how it is experienced, methods such as autoethnography provide insight into the uncertainties of living through experiences. These insights often stand in opposition to accepted and propagated societal discursive positionings.</p>
<p>The role of witnessing one’s life takes on a special meaning within the body of literature on the Holocaust. With increasing urgency as the years and decades pass, Holocaust survivors have been requested to witness their personal experiences. The fear is that these personal stories of the deepest horrors of human inhumanity and survival against all odds will be lost if not told and documented. The imperative is even more pronounced against the backdrop of the silence of many of these survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412456960">Fresco, 1984</xref>). Stories too painful to tell and parents who wish to save their children from the unspeakable experiences of the past leave a void of silence.</p>
<p>Ironically perhaps, it is often children of Holocaust survivors who wish to have their parents witness and tell them about their familial past. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412456960">Hirsch (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412456960">2001</xref>) children of survivors often long for the presence of a clarified parental and familial narrative history and when this does not emerge from their parents, they construct one themselves from archival resources and imaginative processes. To a large extent, these children of survivors long for personal narratives as a way of contending with the void. At the same time, they also battle with the unfathomable depth, horror and power of the imagined and ever present, unspoken narratives of their parents.</p>
<p>The current study employs expressive writing of both poetry and narrative in exploring my experiences as a second generation Kindertransport survivor. This research approach is autoethnographic and art based. As an autoethnography, this study involves “setting a scene, telling a story, weaving intricate connections among life and art, experience and theory, evocation and explanation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412456960">Denzin and Lincoln, 1997</xref>, p. 208). The attempt is to provide voice and insight, opening up new spaces for understanding the transmission of trauma within families including Kindertransport-Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>The study is art-based in that it accepts the philosophical position articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412456960">Alexander (2003)</xref> that arts-based inquiries involve a “whole thinking person” in order to construct a lived “virtual reality” (p. 5) and aims to explore the complexities of lived experiences. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412456960">Hanauer (2010)</xref> in relation to poetic research the “actual experience of the art work by the research recipient is the understanding of the phenomenon under investigation” (p. 2). In other words, reading the expressive writing presented here, becoming engaged and seeing the experiences through the eyes of the speaker is a form of learning and understanding concerning specific life experiences and as such is a research product.</p>
<p>The particular approach to autoethnography used here is borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456960">Furman (2007)</xref>. In exploring his own understanding of existential themes that are relevant to his therapeutic practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456960">Furman (2007)</xref> presented selections from a collection of poems that he had written about the issues of death, meaning, identity, and nothingness accompanied by personal narrative reflections designed to “focus on the specific existential theme explored” in each poem and to contextualize “personal insights into broader cultural issues” (p. 3).The current paper follows a similar methodology and addresses sections of two books of poetry (<italic>Quiet Words</italic>, 1984; <italic>the meeting</italic>, 1987 both unpublished) that I wrote in an attempt to understand the Holocaust and my relationship to it. As with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412456960">Furman (2007)</xref>, these poetic selections are interspersed with narrative reflections aimed to contextualize and explicate personal experiences and insights concerning my experiences.</p>

<p>This is a deeply personal story and one that I have not really managed to tell before although I have tried many times. Part of the problem rested with the difficulty in finding a way and reason to tell the story. Often I have wondered whether this is my story at all and whether I should tell it. I used to think that this story started 32 years before my birth, in a place and language that are both foreign to me—in German, in Germany and in the years immediately preceding the Second World War and in a story of parting, migration and murder. This is a story characterized by a cruel splitting of lives and families.</p>
<p>Now I think this story starts on a night when I was more or less eight years old. In my parent’s house, in small side street of a suburb of London, I had a visitation from my grandparents who were murdered by the Nazis many years before. I lay in bed and two figures came to see my face. I knew they were my grandparents. They wished me no harm but just to see that someone had survived and that I was the grandchild born and breathing past the Holocaust from their only son. They wished me no harm but the presence of the dead is unnatural in the most essential sense and as such the body responds with utter terror. The experience of this visitation is one which involves complete physical paralysis, panic shrouded in the inability to move. To be visited by the dead even with benign intentions, understandable even laudable aims, does not overcome or mitigate the terror of their presence. I lay in bed terrified, unable to move and aware of the presence of the ghosts of my grandparents visiting me in London.</p>
<p>It does not matter whether this is a dream or real. For me the visitation was so visceral and physically present that it is a reality in my life and the mere fact that I know that this cannot be true and that it must be a reality generated by my own mind is unimportant. I have had this dream 8 times in my life. Now as a grown up, I scream in terror when they come and ask, beg that someone will wake me up and break the paralysis of the dream state, the physicality of the visitation. I shout into the darkness “help me, help me” and my wife shakes me into consciousness and the contact is broken. I have grown to understand that this dream-visitation is the point at which the story I wish to tell is mine. The visitation is my experience and the terror of my meeting with my murdered grandparents is my direct connection to my family’s history of the Holocaust.</p>

<p>My connection to the Holocaust is not a given. When I was growing up my parents thought it was best not to mention the Holocaust or expose their children to the horrors of the past. In addition, my father who came to England on the Kindertransport and was not in a concentration camp secretly thought for many years that he was not really a Holocaust survivor since so many others had suffered so much more than he had. His story is one of leaving his parents at the train station and being cared for by a loving host family who treated him as one of their own. My father’s perspective is one of the kindness of some people in the world and the hate of others. He tells his story as one that avoids suffering and focuses on the positive and lucky aspects of life. He was loved by his parents and looked after in difficult circumstances by a family that truly cared about him in England.</p>
<p>I never heard a full version of my father’s story until I was 48 years old. I used to think this was my father’s reluctance to tell this story. But I have grown to realize that this is part of a much wider family reluctance to have my father tell this story. The telling of my father’s story was orchestrated by myself in an attempt to hear the story in first person so that it could be recorded while my father was still well and able to tell his own story. I thought we could gather the family in my parent’s apartment and he could tell his story to the grandchildren and it could be recorded. He was willing to tell the story for the grandchildren. On the days preceding the event both my mother and my sister expressed concern about this story telling. They worried about the emotions it would raise in my father, perhaps the past was best left untold. I felt that the story needed to be told. I needed to hear the story at least once from my father. I also felt that both my sister and my mother had their own difficulties with hearing the story. After all what did this story mean to those of us born into it and living with it on a daily basis. This story is incendiary and painful.</p>
<p>As it happened, my father told a benign story, starting out by saying that this was not a story of suffering but rather of kindness. It was a story of parting but without the expression of personal pain. I recorded the story but it did not help and visitations and nightmares have continued. I think that deep down I believed that hearing my father’s story from my father instead of imagining it would purge the ghosts from my dreams. But I am glad my father told the story, now we have his version of the events of the Holocaust that so influenced my internal perception of my life and the world around me. The Holocaust did not happen to me and according to my father the Holocaust did not happen to him either. The Holocaust happened to my grandparents many years before I was born. What does this event have to do with my life? And yet, it occupies a large part of my hidden thoughts, raises its head in the form of fears of uniforms, hate for the military and the police, verbal attacks on a particular form of rigid totalizing thinking and in nightmares throughout my life. So it means, it connects, it exists within me but is not historical except in the visitations that physically leave me drained and fearful. This paradox and uncertainty of connection until I recognized the legitimacy of my own dream-visitation as an experience, part of my life, made Holocaust storytelling, personal meaning making difficult to complete.</p>

<p>There is something shameful about being a second-generation, Kindertransport-Holocaust survivor. The shame comes from the inability to explain the connection to the past. The shame comes from the nothingness of it all. I never even knew these people who were murdered and there is no grave site, no verbal memories, no last stories, no last words and no one wants to speak of such things. They are best left unsaid. It is shameful in the sense of the inappropriateness of it all. Also, there is something fearful about being Jewish in an age close enough to feel the stories of the Holocaust. In my childhood, I was sure that I would not live to the age of twenty. I imagined that the authorities (an abstract term designating anyone wearing a uniform) would invade our house and round me up and take me to be killed. How does one explain to people that deep down inside you know that there are people out there, regular people like the postman and the grocer, who in an instance can become antisemitic thugs who see you as inhuman, a disease? The shame and fear made me very quiet.</p>

<p>The story of the Kindertransport is one of parting. It is the story of parents who loved their children so much that they were willing to send them off to a foreign land with the knowledge that they would never see them again. This is the story of parent sacrifice, when you give everything that your child may live. As a parent I cannot imagine the pain of this parting. I often think about what my grandparents thought as they said goodbye to my father. I would give my life for my children but for me this is just an empty statement. For my grandparents this was reality. Think of this parting at the train station. To trust your child to the unknown, to let him go at 10 with just a teddy bear and story book about boat travel. To lie and say that we will see you in a few months. I think that my father might have preferred to die there with them—at least they would have been together.</p>
<p>I do not believe in the afterlife, but I have been visited by my dead grandparents. I hope that my father will one day in the afterlife be united with his parents. What we could not heal in life can be healed in the afterlife. United after all these years and then perhaps the tear in the fabric of my fathers untold narrative could be mended in the hands of a loving G-d with life after death. If anyone deserves to be reunited with his parents it is my father and I pray that this will happen. I am a religious person who cannot bring himself to believe in G-d. What type of G-d would create my father’s life? My father prays every night and morning and finds sanctuary in G-d and prayer. He is, as I said, a positive person who can overcome this deep parting to see life and people as kind. I inherited the deep desire for the language of religion and the hope of a salvation that will wash away the horror of the Holocaust and allow my father to meet his parents once again.</p>
<p>For my father’s 79th birthday, I gave him a teddy bear. I had the bear especially made as a replica of the original teddy bear that still lives today, old and worn out, in a cupboard in my parent’s apartment. I so deeply want to heal the wound and turn history back. I want to restore my father’s parting so that I can sleep at night. And I know that this cannot be achieved and that this is all part of my imagination. My father liked the bear and put him next to his bed. I have a picture on my camera phone.</p>

<p>Relationships are fragile in my family. We all worry about my father and his physical and mental health. The presence of his unspoken story looms large in our family consciousness and its shadow has stretched from the past across the lives of my mother, my sister and myself. Growing up, having emotions was subtly discouraged in my family. At its source, we all worried that any emotion and particularly emotions about the Holocaust would open a Pandora’s box of hidden feelings that would destroy the whole world. We worried that my father would not be able to handle it.</p>
<p>My mother protected my father from the presence of the story that only my father knew. She protected my sister and myself from this story through silence and the request for calm. She herself was horrified by visions of the concentration camps and knew in her own soul that we should not see them till we were much older. However, the time for seeing and speaking never arrived till my sister forced it upon us all a year ago by travelling to Germany and unearthing the original Gestapo files of my Grandparents. Emotions are not hidden anymore.</p>
<p>My father never blamed the Germans or Germany for the Holocaust. He was always angry at the rest of the world for doing nothing about it. Why wasn’t he angry with Germany? I was very angry although I was very quiet about it. I was so quiet that even I did not know I was angry. I was scared of being angry. I hid it well. But hiding anger is not healthy as any therapist will tell you.</p>
<p>Once with my family on the way to America, we were forced to stay in the place that my grandfather had been first imprisoned. Here we were staying in Frankfurt. As we drove unexpectedly out of the airport, a sign appeared in front of me, a sign to the city of Hanau, the source of my surname, the surname I inherited from my murdered grandparents. A year later, I took my family in a taxi to Hanau. I stood with my wife and three kids in the central square of Hanau looking at the buildings. In one I saw an opening exhibition. It was of pictures of the gravestones of Jewish families that had lived in Hanau. I looked for one with the name of Hanauer. I found nothing. But as we left the exhibition, I asked to sign the ledger. I put my name down and looked deep into the eyes of the poor man who was in charge of the show. He glanced and asked me if I want to tour the gravesite myself. “We could go in the afternoon” he said. I declined. Back in the central square in Hanau, I heard many people speaking Russian and I thought to myself that although I had never been to this place and could not speak German, I felt that I had more right to this place than anyone else who was in the square. I walked around with the name of this place, it characterized me for myself. It is a name that I love and value. All these people around me had no idea that I was anything but a tourist. I was in reality nothing more than a tourist. But the linguistic remnants of this place were with me and connected me to this place that I knew nothing about and had visited for only a few hours. The old man in the exhibition knew, he knew and had seen before that look of anger and sadness of belonging and alienation. Perhaps a grave would have helped or perhaps it would have made me cry. Perhaps to cry would have helped.</p>
<p>I need many hours of sleep but sometimes I cannot sleep and wake up during the night. I wrote both my books of poetry during the night hours. At night it was quiet and I was very tired. When I write poetry, I have a deep sense of my self, of my literate emotions. Perhaps what I cannot feel in my internal life, I can feel through literature. I am deeply sensitive to how language means and what it feels like. All my creative writing is about the Holocaust.</p>
<p>I have written two books of poetry and one novel in the attempt to connect to the Holocaust and find my meaning in this event. The poems presented in this autoethnograpy come from these two books of poetry—<italic>Quiet Words</italic> and <italic>the meeting</italic>. The two books are different in their intent. <italic>Quiet Words</italic>, the earlier work, is an attempt to find peace and salvation in the everyday experiences of life against a backdrop of the supernatural visitation of the ghosts of my grandparents. The unseen shadow of the Kindertransport and the Holocaust hides in the beauty of the language and in the deceit of life that just continues to evolve as if nothing has happened. The second work—<italic>the meeting</italic>—as the book title suggest, allowed me to imaginatively meet in the flesh with my murdered Grandparents. It documents rituals of memory and the aftermath of appropriating a deeply intimidating history. Neither of my books of poetry brought me the salvation that I so desire.</p>
<p>Both these books of poetry end through the discussion of language. In one I call out my name and listen to the echo of my name in a desert: a hollow image of presence in emptiness, of language disembodied but reflective. In the other, I find sanctuary in the writing of poetry. I have made a career as an applied linguist interested in literary texts and inquiry trying to find ways in which language solves the core human question of meaning. Perhaps in the end I am an optimist like my father. What could not be achieved in life, can be achieved in poetry and in retelling. As I once articulated in therapy, perhaps my role in this world is just to enable myself and others to explore the meaning of their own experiences and this in itself is enough justification for my continued existence.</p>

<title>Postscript</title>
<p>In June 2011, my father, mother, sister, myself and our extended family travelled to Wurzburg in Germany for a memorial service and Stolper Steine stone setting in front of the house of my grandparents—Alfred and Hella Hanauer - who were deported from Germany and murdered in the Jungfernhof concentration camp in Riga, Latvia in 1941. This was the first time that we as a family had the opportunity to mark my grandparent’s death, to receive information on how they died, to mourn for them and symbolically reunite them with my father. As I stood there at this ceremony and spoke, I felt the presence of grandparents in the audience. This was an important moment in my life and I hope a starting point for a long process of healing. Since this event, I have felt the need to explore and express my own and my family’s experiences through writing. This manuscript results from such a process. This autoethnographic investigation offers some insight into a consciousness influenced by a traumatic family history and the option, for me, of some personal salvation of meaning, however fluid and constructed that meaning may be at the time of writing.</p>
