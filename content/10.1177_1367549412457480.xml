<p>Drawing on current research about food-related anxieties, this article argues for an expanded understanding of the presence and location of anxiety in the social. It contends that anxiety is usefully conceptualised as collective and distributed, rather than solely as a property or experience of the individual. Focusing on anxiety as a social condition, the article explores how anxieties become embedded and embodied within routinised practices, technologies and institutions. It draws out and demonstrates the processes and practices through which anxieties are socially constituted and culturally mediated, and through which they travel across spaces and scales. This is exemplified through the case of <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> (a 2008 television series and media campaign featuring the British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver). The article shows how food serves as a vehicle for the circulation of a variety of related concerns, including anxieties about class and gender relations, notions of place identity and regional stereotyping.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the context of our current research on ‘Consumer Culture in an “Age of Anxiety”’, we have been investigating the nature of consumer anxieties about food at a range of geographical scales, from global concerns about food insecurity to the household level of domestic food practices. The project takes a ‘whole chain’ approach, examining food-related anxieties at all points along the supply chain ‘from farm to fork’, combining a political economy perspective (focusing on globalised systems of agri-food production, industrialised methods of food manufacture and highly concentrated retail markets) with a moral economy perspective (observing how food is infused with a wide range of meanings, including notions of ethical and moral responsibility, enforced and legitimated through complex systems of governance and regulation). Attracted by its psychosocial dimensions, we have employed the concept of anxiety in our research, aware that it has been relatively under-theorised compared to related concepts such as risk and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457480">Jackson and Everts, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549412457480">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recognising the concept of anxiety as a concern for individual consumers, we also seek to locate it as a wider social condition, the variable contours of which can be traced across space and time. We begin by considering current debates about how far the present time can be fairly represented as an ‘age of anxiety’ (compared to other periods of human history). This provides the basis for articulating an understanding of anxiety as a social condition, rather than solely a property of particular individuals, through an exploration of recent food-related anxieties. Drawing on current theories of practice (as summarised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367549412457480">Reckwitz, 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1367549412457480">Warde, 2005</xref>), we emphasise the way that anxiety is located within the routine, collective and conventional nature of contemporary consumption practices, understanding anxiety as relationally constituted and having consequences for different elements of the social. This understanding of the way that anxieties are located within routine consumption practices establishes the grounds for exploring how anxieties circulate between and become sedimented within routines, technologies and institutions. We go on to exemplify this argument through a discussion of audience responses to <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic>, a 2008 television series and media campaign featuring the British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. Through this case study, we explore how food-related anxieties are circulated and reproduced between the technologies, institutions, conventions and routines of media representation and audiencing. Through their social circulation and cultural mediation, we argue, food-related anxieties are caught up in, and co-productive with, a series of other concerns about class, gender and place-based identity formation. We conclude by arguing for further research to provide a ‘mapping’ of the circulation of other anxieties, as they move between geographical sites and different sections of the public.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367549412457480">
<title>An ‘age of anxiety’?</title>
<p>Whether the present time can be described as an ‘age of anxiety’ compared to previous historical periods is highly debatable. Many writers refer to the contemporary period as one in which consumers are anxious about the quality and safety of food, although few discuss the term in any detail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549412457480">2</xref></sup> Often, current debates about the future of food and farming in advanced western economies are cast in terms of ‘insecurity’ alongside concerns about food shortages in developing and emergent economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549412457480">Foresight, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367549412457480">Research Councils UK, 2011</xref>). Survey evidence also shows that western consumers remain anxious about food safety and quality despite (or perhaps because of) recent advances in food technology and risk management strategies, a condition that has been exacerbated by recent ‘food scares’ (from BSE to E.coli). In a recent European survey, for example, undertaken on behalf of the European Food Safety Authority and representing the views of more than 26,000 consumers in 27 European states, 48 percent of participants felt that food-related problems were very or quite likely to affect their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412457480">Eurobarometer, 2010</xref>). Although opinions varied between Member States, across the whole sample 68 percent were worried about the quality and freshness of food, and only 42 percent felt that food was safer today than 10 years ago. In this article we do not attempt to judge whether consumer anxieties about food are justified in relation to ‘objective’ levels of risk (however they are assessed). Rather, we seek to understand the circumstances that have generated these widespread concerns, approaching anxiety as a social condition rather than as a purely personal pathology, tracing the contours of these food-related anxieties as they are mediated and circulate within society. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457480">Ahmed’s (2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549412457480">2004b)</xref> work on emotions, we seek to trace the work that such anxieties do as they circulate within society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549412457480">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In exploring consumer anxieties about food, we have sought to distinguish analytically between individual and collective anxieties, identifying the <italic>social condition</italic> of anxiety which may or may not correlate with the level of specific individual anxieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457480">Jackson, 2010</xref>). So, for example, when governments impose a ban on importing certain foods, or when supermarkets withdraw a food item from their shelves as a result of a current food scare, we are all drawn into and affected by a condition of anxiety (sometimes described in terms of a moral panic), whether or not we are individually anxious about the particular issue. Similarly, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457480">Joanna Bourke (2006)</xref> writes about the social history of emotions such as fear or anxiety, she is interested in tracking the ‘language of fear’ as it peaks and troughs through time rather than analysing the incidence of individual emotions or affects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367549412457480">4</xref></sup> The geographers Rachel Pain and Susan Smith reach similar conclusions in their work on the geopolitics of fear and everyday life. Fear, they stress, is ‘a social or collective experience rather than an individual state . . . embedded in a network of moral and political geographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367549412457480">2008</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>In our previous work on consumer anxieties about food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457480">Jackson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457480">Jackson and Everts, 2010</xref>), we have followed a similar path, seeking to trace how anxieties are framed, mediated and institutionalised; how they spread and/or are contained; how they move between social fields (from public health to environmental sustainability, for example); how they vary historically, geographically and sociologically; and how they proliferate in conditions of uncertainty (such as in the gap between ‘expert’ knowledge and ‘lay’ understandings). While we do not wish to argue that the present day is a peculiarly anxious age in the sense that consumers are now demonstrably more anxious than in previous historical periods, many contemporary observers are happy to advance such claims. As Wilkinson suggests:<disp-quote>
<p>It is now a matter of sociological common sense to identify ourselves as living through a period of acute insecurity and high anxiety . . . the brute facts of anxiety appear to be almost beyond dispute. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1367549412457480">2001</xref>: 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furedi boldly asserts that people in western societies are today living in a ‘culture of fear’:<disp-quote>
<p>Compared with the past, people living in Western societies have less familiarity with pain, suffering, debilitating disease and death than ever before. And yet, despite an unprecedented level of personal security, fear has become an ever-expanding part of our life. Western societies are increasingly dominated by a culture of fear. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457480">2002[1997]</xref>: vii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The association of anxiety with modernity has long been debated and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1367549412457480">Wilkinson (1999)</xref> argues, is almost impossible to verify empirically (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457480">May, 1950</xref>). According to Ulrich Beck’s risk society thesis, modern anxieties are particularly oppressive because of the way that they travel invisibly through the conduits of everyday life. Beck warns of the invisible risks associated with air pollution, radiological hazards and food contamination: the ‘stowaways of normal consumption’ that ‘travel on the wind and in the water’, passing through ‘all the otherwise strictly controlled protective areas of modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549412457480">1992</xref>: 40–41). Whether or not modern anxieties are deeper or more pervasive than those of previous periods, Beck argues, they have a reflexive quality which adds to their intensity, resulting from human intervention rather than natural causes.</p>
<p>Referring literally to a constriction of the throat or a sensation of choking, anxiety can be defined as a state of agitation, being troubled in mind and having a sense of uneasiness about a coming event. It frequently prompts particular kinds of action (such as aggression towards socially defined others or withdrawal from society: fight or flight). Recent reviews of the nature of anxiety (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549412457480">Salecl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1367549412457480">Tyrer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1367549412457480">Wilkinson, 2001</xref>) have concluded that the concept is embodied, affective and behavioural. These ideas have been augmented in recent work on the sociology of emotions and emotional geographies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549412457480">Burkitt (1997)</xref> argues that emotions should be understood as complex modes of communication within relationships and interdependencies, rather than as expressions of inner processes. Burkitt also shows how powerful emotions such as love and aggression are complexes rather than things, involving the articulation of specific speech genres, bodily activity and social relationships. They are corporeal and embodied as well as sociocultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549412457480">Burkitt, 2002</xref>). Similarly, Bondi et al. argue that emotions are ‘never simply surface phenomena, they are never easy to define or demarcate . . . not easily observed or mapped although they inform every aspect of our lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412457480">2005</xref>: 1). However defined, emotions such as anxiety are clearly a salient feature of modern life and central to our current work on food.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367549412457480">5</xref></sup> In this article we focus on just one aspect of our larger interest in contemporary anxieties, seeking to identify the location of anxiety. Building on the work reviewed above, which locates emotions including anxiety as relational effects which are not contained by individual psychological states, we explore the extent to which anxiety also exists as a social (collective) phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367549412457480">
<title>Individual versus collective anxieties</title>
<p>In conventional uses of the word, anxiety is a psychological (and to some extent physiological) condition experienced by individual human subjects. As such, the concept does not immediately seem to travel well to intellectual positions such as the theories of practice approach we draw on here, which decentre individual subjects and human minds in social enquiry. However, within our current research we seek to understand anxiety as a presence or force within the social in ways that are not reducible to the sum of individual subjective experiences of anxiety. Given the gap between the conventional meaning of anxiety and our theoretical framing of the term, this is a position which requires further justification and elucidation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367549412457480">6</xref></sup> What does it mean to understand anxiety as something with presence and force, located in the social?</p>
<p>To argue that anxiety is not reducible to individual subjective experience is not to say that it can float entirely free from embodied human subjects experiencing the distinctive symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety only has full coherence as a phenomenon referred to by that name as it coalesces with embodied subjective experience. However, we can recognise that the moment of subjective experience has both a before and an after, which stretch beyond the personal biography of the individual concerned (and beyond the immediate time and place of that subjective experience). First, anxiety has presence in the social <italic>through the relations which constitute moments of individual subjective anxiety</italic>. Anxiety as subjective experience is constituted relationally from direct personal interactions with other people, material things (e.g. packaged foods with health warnings and date labels), particular spaces and places (e.g. supermarkets), specific institutions (including regulatory authorities such as the European Food Safety Authority), or discourses and representations circulating through the media (such as stories about food safety scares or the ‘obesity epidemic’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367549412457480">7</xref></sup> The diversity of social entities involved in the articulation of anxiety shows that, while sited within an embodied human subject, anxiety is a relational effect.</p>
<p>Second, anxiety has presence in the social <italic>through the consequences which flow from those moments of subjective experience</italic>. This is true across scales, from consequences at the level of individual action in response to anxieties, to legislative and regulatory action at the level of national or supranational governments in response to anxieties which take on significance as collective concerns.</p>
<p>Turning for inspiration to current theories of practice, a parallel to our work on social anxiety might be found in Theodore Schatzki’s argument about ‘practice memory’, a type of collective or social memory. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367549412457480">Schatzki (2010)</xref>, it is no longer controversial to argue that the contents and uses of an individual’s memory are shaped by social phenomena such as texts, media, communication and rituals. More controversial is the idea of memory as a property of social entities as opposed to individual people, whether or not they are seen as aggregates of individual memories. This idea has been debated since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549412457480">Halbwachs’ (1950)</xref> work on collective memory which raised the spectre of a reified collective conscience, as debated (among others) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549412457480">Samuel and Thompson (1990)</xref> in their work on national memory and ‘the myths we live by’. Schatzki argues that it is possible to attribute memory to social entities without ascribing to society some sort of reified or quasi-reified mind or consciousness. For example, it is possible to think of a community of people who are held together by collective memories that are shared via common narratives and public memorials. Schatzki argues that this ‘presence in public’ demonstrates the existence of social memory without hypostatising the existence of any kind of collective mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549412457480">Connerton (1989)</xref> makes a similar argument about ‘how societies remember’, drawing attention to bodily practices and rituals to argue that memory is a cultural rather than a purely individual phenomenon. Extending this notion of practice memory to the context of food anxieties, we might look, for example, to the way that wartime rationing (in force in the UK until 1953) has led to deeply sedimented social attitudes towards thrift and waste, institutionalised through agencies such as the Ministry of Food, whose cultural resonance continues to be felt today.</p>
<p>These ideas are articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412457480">Hunt (1999)</xref> in his essay on anxiety and social explanation, where he argues against the invocation of some unconscious collective psychological force in accounting for social phenomena. He is particularly wary of situations in which anxiety is adopted as a ‘submerged middle term’ in sociohistorical thought: for example, when the anxieties of the Victorian bourgeoisie are explained with reference to anxieties about the changing role of women in society. Hunt does not wish to outlaw such arguments; rather, he seeks to pin down the causal significance that is attached to them. This is particularly important, he argues, when a cause is identified which does not form part of the consciousness or discourse of the participants themselves, and where historians claim to be able to identify what was really going on, although it may not have been apparent to those directly involved in the phenomenon being examined. For example, historians might argue that anxieties over prostitution in 19th-century North America might be explained in terms of underlying anxieties about nation-building, racial degeneration or urban decay, which themselves involved the repression of deeper anxieties about gender, ‘race’ and class. In such cases, Hunt urges historians to go beyond the principles of convergence, where several phenomena converge on a particular focal point, to specify the processes that are thought to underlie what otherwise are merely inferential connections. Historians, he suggests, should be particularly careful in applying the attributes of individuals to social aggregates, or in using the logic of displacement to indicate where the ‘true’ source of social anxieties actually lies. Similarly, Hunt warns against the logic of discursive affinity, where a causal link is inferred through linguistic association (such as a common vocabulary of ‘decline and fall’ applied to imperial narratives at the level of the nation, and to the plight of ‘fallen women’ at the level of the city). Such links, he suggests, are plausible rather than causal, implying a conjunctural rather than a necessary connection. We will attempt to bear these cautionary points in mind as we pursue our own enquiry into the nature of contemporary social anxieties about food.</p>
<p>However, as we have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457480">Jackson and Everts, 2010</xref>), social anxieties frequently circulate in unpredictable ways. For example, the fear of avian influenza (bird flu) spreading to human populations may start off as a legitimate concern about public health, but may quickly assume a more troublingly racialised form through popular anxieties about farming standards and practices in different parts of the world. Debates about the assumed safety and quality of imported foods often take this form, reflecting longstanding (colonial) discourses about racialised constructions of hygiene, dirt and pollution (as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412457480">McClintock, 1995</xref> and others). The sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1367549412457480">Sheldon Ungar (2001)</xref> has traced this process in terms of the shifting sites of social anxiety, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549412457480">Sean Hier (2003)</xref> has shown how this process can give rise to what he calls the ‘moralisation’ of risk. We will explore these ideas further through our empirical example, observing how social anxieties about food and health shift between social sites (from the household to the nation), and how they unfold in different directions (from an initial concern with cooking skills and childhood obesity to encompass wider concerns about class, gender and place). We begin by examining the routinisation and institutionalisation of food-related anxieties from which, we argue, they derive their social force.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367549412457480">
<title>The routinisation and institutionalisation of anxiety as a social force</title>
<p>At the level of individual action, complex actual and potential anxieties have to be negotiated simultaneously, each potentially pulling people in different directions. For example, someone with responsibility for feeding their household can feel at different times the pull of diverse potential causes of anxiety from different public and market organisations. Particular ideas about ‘healthy eating’ or responsibility for food safety can pull against a public agenda to reduce food waste when it comes to practices of provisioning and deciding what is still edible, and what should be constituted as waste. However, public discourses such as these are not the only anxieties being negotiated; they have to be brought together with other, more embedded concerns about care, love and the maintenance of family, such as through shared mealtimes, performances of responsibility and competence in household management, ideals of good parenting or culinary skill and so forth. It is clear that these diverse sources of potential anxiety are not being constantly weighed against each other anew. Rather, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457480">Giddens’ (1984</xref>) understanding of the role of routinisation in the accomplishment of everyday life, our paths through daily choices and activities which enable us to accommodate diverse and conflicting anxieties adequately become more or less routinised, throughout the complex activities comprising the regular provisioning of households. As recent research on domestic practices confirms, most groceries coming into a household are the same as the week before; things are stored in routine ways, rendering the capacity and organisation of storage in fridges, freezer cupboards and drawers in some sort of functional equilibrium with the flow of groceries coming into the home; kitchens are maintained within an established range and rhythm of relative chaos and order, dirt and cleanliness, which becomes established as a practicable compromise between functional adequacy, aspirations of fashionable display and the harsh realities of time and effort; most meals come from a relatively narrow repertoire; and mealtimes follow an established (if not entirely regular) pattern (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549412457480">Evans, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1367549412457480">Shove, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1367549412457480">Shove and Southerton, 2000</xref> for further details). Thus anxieties around household provisioning become sedimented to routines. What was, or could be, subjectively experienced as anxiety becomes displaced to routine activities, which the anxiety and its negotiation have helped shape, and to the material and temporal arrangements which enable those activities. At the level of individual activities, then, anxiety exceeds subjective experience through its sedimentation into the materialities and routines through which it is accommodated. In this way, anxiety can be argued to be present, even if the individual human is not subjectively experiencing the physiological or psychological symptoms of anxiety.</p>
<p>However, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412457480">Hunt (1999)</xref>, we recognise that this can be a slippery idea when pursued empirically. If we do not find tangible evidence of anxiety in our empirical work, we might argue that anxiety is present nonetheless in a latent form, but that it has been assuaged by some routinised practice or technological intervention. For example, consumer squeamishness about raw poultry has been successfully negotiated through the commercial invention of ‘oven-able trays’, which mean that consumers can cook a meal without having to touch raw meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457480">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). If consumers no longer express anxiety, is it legitimate to draw attention to the anxieties that have been bypassed via these new culinary practices?</p>
<p>At the level of the household, anxieties are partly negotiated through technologies – a new fridge incorporating a temperature display, the use of anti-bacterial sprays and more hygienic food preparation surfaces could all be interpreted as efforts to assuage anxieties over food safety. Insofar as the product world is reshaped by the opportunities which arise in response to consumer anxieties, anxiety can be identified as a force within product innovation and the market. Regulatory authorities also use technologies such as date labels, in part, as a response to anxieties about food safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457480">Milne et al., 2011</xref>), but their use gives rise to new anxieties as uncertainties about the freshness and durability of foodstuffs are placed in tension with anxieties about food waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1367549412457480">Watson and Meah, forthcoming</xref>). From this perspective, then, technologies, companies and markets are not ‘anxious’ in any literal sense; but clearly it is possible to locate anxiety as a social force within these entities.</p>
<p>From here it is a small step to seeing anxiety as a force or presence within social institutions more broadly. As the media reshape and imperfectly reflect so much else in the social, so they do with anxiety. This is clearest where the news media relay stories of collective anxieties such as contagious diseases or risks of terrorist attack, where state institutions and the legal system are shaped around actual and potential anxieties and by state attempts to modulate or engineer them. Through the consequences that flow from moments of individual subjective experience, anxiety becomes a presence and a force within the social. Through these relations, anxiety travels across social spaces and over time. Embedded within durable technologies or obdurate social institutions, anxieties which may not have been subjectively experienced for decades continue to resonate and have an effect in the present.</p>
<p>Of course, the range of social entities within which anxieties become sedimented and solidified is the same range of entities identified earlier as constituting the ‘before’ of moments of subjective experience. Insofar as routines, arrangements, technologies and institutions are shaped by responses to anxieties, the ‘after’ of some anxieties participate in the ‘before’ of new ones. This can operate to embed, propagate and deepen the same anxiety through successive cycles of subjective experience and broader social response. This can be exemplified most easily through analysis of a food scare where initial localised anxieties are picked up by the media, eliciting broader experiences of anxiety which provide fertile ground for the escalation or amplification of public anxiety to the point where other institutions such as supermarkets or the state are compelled to respond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1367549412457480">8</xref></sup> However, such cycles also can lead in more surprising directions: for example, where the combined technological responses to anxieties over food safety – packaging, technologies of cooling, high speed transportation, etc. – collectively add up to a substantial contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and so contribute to anxieties over climate change.</p>

<title>The mediation and circulation of anxiety</title>
<p>Having established the way that anxieties exist as a social force, their strength and persistence deriving from the way that they are routinised and institutionalised, we turn now to an empirical example which illustrates some of the ways in which food-related anxieties ‘circulate’ between institutions, media representations, public discourses and communities, highlighting how anxieties in different fields of concern can work in tension or in synergy, often taking unanticipated directions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367549412457480">9</xref></sup> Our analysis builds on previous work on ‘food TV’ as a specific genre of programming – from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412457480">Dickinson et al.’s (2001)</xref> analysis of breakfast TV, which forcefully demonstrated broadcasting’s embeddedness in the social and temporal rhythms of domestic organisation, to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549412457480">Lewis’ (2008)</xref> account of the role of ‘lifestyle experts’ in recent cooking and makeover programmes. Within the study of media representations more widely, we align ourselves with those who have approached audiences as an empirical object, rather than assuming the existence of an imagined audience whose reactions can be gauged through purely textual analysis, however creatively and critically such work is undertaken.</p>
<p>Pioneering work in this tradition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549412457480">Ang (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549412457480">Morley (1992)</xref> demonstrated the active capacity of audiences to make sense of televisual content and the need to examine the social context of consumption, whether this takes place in the sitting room or in subsequent circuits of interpretation and discussion of what was actually viewed. As conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457480">Fiske (1992)</xref>, ‘audiencing’ is part of a wider and continuous social circulation of meanings, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549412457480">Abercrombie and Longhurst (1998)</xref> as involving an inter-relationship between media meanings and social life whereby the media provide a subject and a vocabulary for social interaction. It is this process of mediation and circulation that we seek to trace in what follows, extending beyond the actual audiences of a particular programme to include wider processes of cultural transmission. As will become clear, food is a particularly good vehicle for the expression of a wide range of social sentiments, its powerful symbolic qualities deriving from the way that, as we eat, it is literally incorporated within the body. As our analysis of audience reactions to <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> will make clear, a discussion that begins with food can move on quickly to a range of other issues, as has been argued elsewhere in relation to the links between our culinary and carnal appetites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549412457480">Probyn, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis is influenced also by Skeggs’s recent work on audience reactions to reality TV and lifestyle programming. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1367549412457480">Skeggs and Wood (2008)</xref> suggest that audiences engage with reality TV as an ‘extended social realm’, whereby viewers identify with the apparent immediacy of the broadcast material to enhance notions of community and intimacy through the use of imaginary parasocial relationships. Skeggs identifies different class positions in the audiencing of reality TV, whereby middle-class viewers employ a different cultural logic from working-class viewers when confronted with their ‘shameful’ viewing practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1367549412457480">Skeggs et al. (2008)</xref> also reflect on the role of the research process in shaping these class positions as audiences are pushed into a reflexive analysis of their viewing practices, justifying their consumption of reality TV in terms of its educational and cultural value. Audiences may be relatively unreflexive while watching a particular show, they suggest, but subsequent analysis and discussion may encourage a change of position.</p>
<p>We focus on a particular TV series (<italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic>) and an associated educational campaign to get people cooking, featuring the British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. Oliver was discovered while a television crew were filming at London’s River Café, where he was working as a chef. He was given his own TV series, <italic>The Naked Chef</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549412457480">Oliver, 1999</xref>) which ran for several series. Oliver’s celebrity status developed further as a result of his high-profile public campaign to improve the quality of British school meals (<italic>Jamie’s School Dinners</italic>, 2005). He also runs a series of successful restaurants, is the author of numerous bestselling cookbooks and has provided commercial endorsements for the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1367549412457480">10</xref></sup> <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> series ran on Channel 4 in September–October 2008, taking inspiration from the UK government’s wartime Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>Based in Rotherham, a former mining town in South Yorkshire, <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> set out to ‘teach a town to cook’, reacting to current concerns about the alleged decline of cooking and parenting skills, particularly among working-class mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1367549412457480">11</xref></sup> <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> also can be situated in relation to current debates about childhood obesity, the quality of children’s diet and the alleged decline of the family meal (as summarised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549412457480">Jackson, 2009</xref>). In the midst of these debates and dynamics, media attention focused on the Rawmarsh district in Rotherham and on a particular incident in 2006 when a group of mothers – dubbed ‘sinner ladies’ by a tabloid newspaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549412457480">Perrie, 2007</xref>) – were reported to have passed junk food through the school railings when their children objected to the imposition of a new regime of healthy school meals of the kind that Oliver had been promoting on his TV shows. Although the details of the case have been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549412457480">Fox and Smith, 2011</xref>), it became a national <italic>cause célèbre</italic>, and it was no surprise that Oliver chose to locate his next campaign and TV series in Rotherham.</p>
<p>The following analysis draws on field research by one of the present authors (Piper) which aims to compare audience responses to <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> in Rotherham, where the TV series was filmed, with the responses of a very different group of viewers in Tunbridge Wells, an archetypal southern town, known for its white-collar prosperity and general affluence. The data in this article come from a series of interviews and focus groups conducted in both towns. Sixteen focus groups and 13 in-depth interviews were conducted between September 2010 and August 2011. Focus group participants were recruited from existing groups of people who met socially or as work colleagues on a regular basis. Some of the interviews and focus groups in Rotherham targeted specific individuals or groups on the basis that they were already deeply invested in Oliver’s work in the town. For example, focus groups were held at two schools, one of which was heavily engaged in events that led up to the filming of the series, and the other included pupils who had made a video response to the show. Most participants from Rotherham were recruited from voluntary organisations, the local council and from local businesses. In Tunbridge Wells, participants were recruited from local voluntary organisations, the local council and via snowballing from existing friendship networks in order to approximate those carried out in Rotherham. Focus groups were not explicitly stratified by class, gender or ethnicity, but reflected the ‘natural’ composition of the groups recruited. Most focus groups involved both men and women, with the exception of a Women’s Institute group conducted in Rotherham. Focus group participants were aged from 22 to 80 and came from a variety of class backgrounds. All of the interviews and focus groups were tape-recorded and transcribed in full. Some participants also made video responses to Jamie Oliver and engaged in other forms of public debate.</p>
<p>Although the focus groups were intended to provide empirical material concerning the audiencing of <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic>, the objective was to prompt the kind of free-flowing conversations that might have occurred without the researcher being present. Recruiting groups of people who were already known to each other prior to the research helped fulfil this objective, as did the way the groups were moderated, with as little direct questioning as possible (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457480">Holbrook and Jackson, 1996</xref>). Some focus groups were conducted at dinner parties or as informal conversations in coffee shops and cafes. While focus groups provide access to a relatively public discourse about Oliver and related food media, individual interviews allowed for more personal reflections to be recorded. All of the material was then subjected to thematic coding by the researcher in consultation with his supervisors. Therefore, the material does not provide a statistically significant sample of audience responses to Oliver, as might be derived from market-research methods. Rather, it provides case study evidence whose significance should be judged in terms of the principles of logical rather than statistical inference (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549412457480">Mitchell, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> is clearly premised on contemporary food anxieties, with concerns about healthy eating as the grounds for Oliver’s intervention, providing the purpose and storyline for the series. According to the present focus group and interview research, the series served to represent, embed and propagate anxieties around food, also working with and through a range of other concerns that were apparently inseparable from the ways in which food anxieties circulate and work in the social. For example, residents in Rotherham were clearly concerned about the way that the town had been represented in the TV series, but their anxieties focused on a variety of related issues such as regional stereotyping, class and gender issues, rather than directly on the food issues that were the ostensible focus of Oliver’s interest in the town. One participant in his early thirties, who lives with his wife and children in Rawmarsh, said he was embarrassed by the way that Rotherham was depicted in the series because of the association of the area with poverty and ‘bad eating habits’:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s probably why I was embarrassed, because I naturally associate bad eating habits and obesity levels of the kids and adults . . . with poverty and that embarrassed me, the fact that I would be associated with a poverty-stricken area. (Martin)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Martin was anxious that he might be associated (by other viewers) with a ‘poverty-stricken area’, he was clear that Rotherham should not be so comprehensively stereotyped, as ‘there’s good places and bad places in every town’. However, Martin did not credit other people with the same understanding, seeing TV characterisations of places as dominating the popular imagination. In particular, he was worried about how his friends in London might see the show and jump to conclusions, not just about the place (Rotherham) but also about his own parenting skills and eating habits. While perhaps inevitably the TV series focused on a few extreme cases, Martin and others were adamant that ‘we’re not all like that’ (invoking comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1367549412457480">Skeggs’ 1997</xref> work on the way that formations of class and gender involve processes of identification and dis-identification).</p>
<p>In another case, Sue (a 34-year-old charity worker from Rotherham) found herself denying her connection with the town while on holiday abroad, claiming to be from nearby Sheffield in order to avoid a perceived sense of guilt by association. Asked if she worried about how other people would see her, she acknowledged the media’s need to distort and exaggerate reality, but replied ambivalently:<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, but I’m in two minds . . . because I know why they did it, and I understand that they did it to get the ratings, you’ve got to be confrontational to get the ratings on TV nowadays . . . But I think for me I was a bit worried that everybody would think that, ‘Oh she’s from Rotherham, she must be like them on TV’, you know, ‘she must be a bit dim’ . . . I remember actually we went on holiday not long after and . . . I used to tell people I was from Sheffield which I’ve never done before. I don’t know why – I just can’t bear the thought of people thinking that about me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sue’s sense of embarrassment was all the more pronounced as the interview took place in a coffee shop which she described as ‘nice’ and ‘classy’, underlining her uneasy sense of (dis)identification with Rotherham and its perceived lack of culinary capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1367549412457480">12</xref></sup> As this interview extract demonstrates, Sue was prepared to lie about where she came from in order to avoid the imagined sleight of being considered ‘dim’ through her association with the town. Whether other television viewers would have made this connection is beside the point: Sue’s anxieties are premised on the fear that such connections might be made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1367549412457480">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The participants rarely questioned Oliver’s intentions in trying to get unhealthy people to eat more healthily. Apart from a minority of residents who campaigned against Oliver’s presence in the town under the slogan ‘Jamie Go Home’, most people broadly accepted his good intentions. Asked his opinion, for example, Mark (a chef in his late thirties who worked with Oliver in Rotherham during the filming of <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic>) expressed a rather mild sense of discomfort:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know, it’s a tricky one. I think overall his ethos for the whole thing about getting people eating and . . . cooking proper food is really good, and I think his morals are proper and he is a really nice guy. He’s definitely got everybody’s best interests at heart. But I don’t know, it just came over on the telly a bit, a bit wrong, I thought.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While such ambivalence was not uncommon, most residents and viewers were prepared to give Oliver the benefit of the doubt, summarised in the popular view that ‘at least he’s doing something’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549412457480">Hollows and Jones, 2010</xref>). Most participants also acknowledged that television shows may have to exaggerate to make their point. While they understood these conventions themselves, many were less willing to trust other viewers to be equally reflexive or media-savvy, fearing that they would accept media stereotypes of Rotherham and its residents in an unquestioning manner.</p>
<p>These examples all show the relevance of our theoretical framework regarding the circulation of anxieties among the audiences of <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic>; how popular food anxieties are reworked in ways that are class and place-specific; and how differently positioned audiences respond to such representations. Above all, they show how food-related anxieties circulate socially rather than functioning at a purely individual level. The interviews also demonstrate how food-related anxieties serve as a vehicle for a variety of other concerns, including anxieties about gender and class. For example, we might suggest that middle-class viewers enjoy the programmes as a form of voyeurism, allowing them to watch working-class families (and mothers in particular) displaying what might be considered poor taste or a lack of good judgement. In one iconic scene, for example, Oliver focuses on a woman from Rawmarsh (Natasha) and her children eating takeaway food on the living room floor. The following discussion is taken from a focus group in Tunbridge Wells with a group of participants aged 22–62. There were six people in the group and they were discussing this particular scene with a view to demonstrating to each other (and to the researcher) what kind of work they think the scene performed. One informant (Catherine) called this scene ‘a bit freak-showy’, wondering if that was part of its appeal for middle-class viewers such as herself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1367549412457480">14</xref></sup> Her friend Jess agreed, adding: ‘Because that’s what we want to see and be shocked by.’ Describing how Oliver is positioned within this scene, Catherine’s friend Alec surmised: ‘We all know what he’s thinking, he’s thinking you dirty bitch for feeding your kids takeaways . . . Yeah, you slag.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1367549412457480">15</xref></sup> However, Catherine goes on, more reflexively, to wonder what the show implies in terms of the woman’s education and (perceived lack of) culinary skills:<disp-quote>
<p>But in a way it’s all about education though, isn’t it, because if she doesn’t know about boiling the bones to get the stock out and make a bloody minestrone soup out if it, then she’s not going to, and so it’s about education and I think it’s all a bit freak-showy!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While her friend Jess thought that the ‘freak-show’ element might be justified in terms of the social changes that it might prompt, Catherine worried that working-class viewers would not see the show (‘Because nobody in that council estate is going to be watching Jamie Oliver’). The show’s target audience, she felt, was ‘middle-class wankers like us, sitting there going . . . that’s shocking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1367549412457480">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In these extracts, consumer anxieties about food blend into a range of other concerns about the identity of place, class relations and media stereotyping. Anxieties circulate in a complex fashion where residents in one place are confident of their own ability to challenge stereotypes and to see through media contrivances, but they do not trust viewers in other places to exhibit similar levels of reflexivity and media awareness. That their suspicions may be well founded is suggested by the way that these programmes were viewed by middle-class viewers in Tunbridge Wells as a kind of guilty pleasure, revelling in a sense of disgust at watching other people transgressing the boundaries of good taste. At one level, viewers in Tunbridge Wells can be as critical as viewers in Rotherham, aware that TV shows such as <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> are unlikely to provide a representative view of the town and its residents. At another level, the show encourages viewers to suspend their disbelief and enjoy the sense of shock that the programme generates, taking pleasure from their sense of disgust and moral outrage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1367549412457480">17</xref></sup> In this sense, then, viewers’ anxieties about food are readily displaced onto a wider set of anxieties about class and place which circulate through viewers’ perceptions of how they may be perceived by others who are credited with variable degrees of reflexivity in their viewing practices. As the conventions of reality TV amply demonstrate, shock and disgust are now well-established tactics for entertaining audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549412457480">Andrejevic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549412457480">Hill, 2005</xref>). It is also apparent from contemporary newspaper accounts that other readings are possible, as <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> prompted a range of reactions to what the show was thought to reveal about the relationship between food and class in contemporary Britain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1367549412457480">18</xref></sup> However, as several critics have observed, these programmes contribute to a decontextualisation and moralisation of health inequalities in the UK, positioning individuals as uniquely responsible for their dietary choices and ignoring the wider social forces that shape such individualised decisions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549412457480">Fox and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457480">Rich, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Understanding anxiety as a social condition rather than as a purely individual affliction opens up distinctive lines of enquiry which we are pursuing in our current research on consumer anxieties about food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457480">Jackson, 2010</xref>). From this perspective, the actual embodied, subjective experience of anxiety is not necessarily at the core of enquiry. While embodied experience is the ultimate grounding of anxiety as a social phenomenon, we focus instead on its presence and force as a collective dimension within the social. Approaching anxiety in relational terms, as routinised in practice, we ask: how are anxieties constituted and reproduced through social relations, technologies and practices, and what are the implications of anxieties for moral and political economies, such as those circulating around food? Highlighting the implication of institutions (governments, supermarkets, TV companies, etc.) in the shaping and reproduction of food-related anxieties opens up compelling questions about the modulation (or ‘engineering’) of anxiety as a technology of governmentality, reshaping human subjectivities in accordance with particular objectives and political ends (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457480">Milne et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As our empirical work demonstrates, studying how food-related anxieties are represented, circulated and re-embedded into practices of both social interaction and food provisioning can reveal a great deal about contemporary society. A TV series that ostensibly set out to transform people’s diets and to address perceived deficiencies in cooking skills also served as a vehicle for the expression of a range of other anxieties about class and gender relations, place attachment and regional stereotyping. The circulation of these anxieties and their social effects was not predetermined, but needs to be mapped empirically. What emerged in this case was a complex cartography of desire and disgust, where people in one place (Rotherham) acknowledged the power of the media to exaggerate and stereotype, focusing on extreme behaviour and employing shock tactics in order to garner audiences. However, despite their own critical understanding of the media, the audiences in Rotherham were anxious about the way that they (and people like them) were represented, and how these representations would be read by audiences in other places (such as Tunbridge Wells). Talking to people in Tunbridge Wells confirms that their concerns were well founded, to the extent that residents were willing to suspend their critical judgement of the media in order to indulge in the guilty pleasure of watching other people ‘behaving badly’, revelling in their disgust at other people’s lack of good taste – albeit that some, when asked, could later reflect critically upon such media representations and their own engagements with them. This case also demonstrates the value of following the unexpected paths through which anxieties travel as they are worked on and through in the production and audiencing of national media representation. As represented on millions of TV screens, and as re-represented in countless conversations and personal reflections, the mix of food, class and place-based anxieties plays out in diverse ways, as indicated by the very different audiencing of <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> in Rotherham and Tunbridge Wells. Such programmes, we argue, build upon and feed into the ongoing sedimentation of anxieties, which then provides the basis for future mediated circulations of anxiety. However, we acknowledge that this is just one case which draws attention to particular modes of representation, circulation, use and effects of anxieties.</p>
<p>Our wider research programme aims to explore the circulation of social anxieties in a range of other spheres, varying in scale from global concerns about food security through national and international concerns about food safety, to the household scale of domestic hygiene and anxieties about feeding the family. It also encompasses the scale of state regulation and food governance and the commercial response to consumer anxieties about food. This article is just one example of a wider argument about anxiety as a social condition whose changing contours we plan to continue to trace in future work. In making these arguments we are also pushing at the boundaries between the cultural and the psychosocial aspects of anxiety, tracing the cultural mediation of anxiety as a social condition.</p>

For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1367549412457480">Woodward (2006)</xref> discusses the notion of ‘consumption anxiety’ in the context of consumers’ aesthetic choices, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1367549412457480">Warde’s (1997)</xref> earlier work about consumption, identity formation and uncertainty. Woodward asks how consumption anxieties surface in particular social settings (including his own research interviews), where consumers are obliged to justify their aesthetic choices. Warde’s conceptualisation is closer to our own, asking how consumer anxieties are embedded within wider social configurations, including how they are mitigated through processes of habituation and routinisation.</p></fn>

<p>While some authors seek to make a clear distinction between rational, object-centred fear and irrational anxieties where no specific object can be discerned, we argue that the distinction is less clear-cut. For example, while a specific food scare concerning the outbreak of salmonella or E.coli might be thought of in terms of a direct threat to public health, provoking justifiable fear among those most directly affected, such outbreaks have a history and are part of a larger and more diffuse set of anxieties about food safety, as reflected in the Eurobarometer survey findings reported above.</p></fn>

<p>At a recent British Sociological Association meeting, Anne Murcott challenged us to specify how we will know anxiety when we see it, whether we can define and measure it, and how we will distinguish it from related issues and concerns. This article is in part a response to her welcome provocation, seeking to define and chart the course of social anxieties rather than insisting, in some <italic>a priori</italic> fashion, on the salience of anxiety in contemporary society. We would argue also that anxiety is rarely experienced in isolation from other emotions. Rather, our attitudes to food are characteristically comprised of a complex mix of conflicting emotions combining pleasure and pain, desire and dread, fascination and fear. Our work seeks to trace how social anxieties are defined and expressed, not whether they are ‘real’ or rational.</p></fn>

<p>For more information on Oliver, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457480">Hollows (2003)</xref>. Through the combination of his campaigning work and cooking programmes, Oliver has been referred to as a ‘lifestyle expert’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412457480">Lewis, 2010</xref>) or ‘public pedagogue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457480">Rich, 2011</xref>).

<p>Besides the TV series and book of the same name, Oliver took over a vacant store in the centre of Rotherham, called The Ministry of Food, which served as a cafe and as a venue for training courses designed to further the cause of passing on cooking skills to the people of Rotherham.</p></fn>

<p>Oliver has expressed exactly such sentiments occasionally. In <italic>Jamie’s Return to School Dinners</italic>, filmed in 2006, he expostulated: ‘I’ve spent two years being PC [politically correct] about parents. It’s kind of time to say if you’re giving very young kids bottles and bottles of fizzy drink you’re a fucking arsehole, you’re a tosser. If you’re giving bags of shitty sweets at that very young age, you’re an idiot’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549412457480">Rich, 2011</xref>: 16).</p></fn>

<p>The self-deprecating reference to ‘middle-class wankers like us’ also suggests a degree of reflexivity about viewing practices that is characteristic of the way that consumer anxieties circulate and help shape the boundaries of class and gender.</p></fn>

<p>Compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457480">Miller’s (1998)</xref> analysis of the anatomy of disgust, which centres on such visceral reaction to food taboos as a means of policing social boundaries.</p></fn>

<p>Writing in <italic>The Guardian</italic> (1 October 2008), for example, food journalist Felicity Lawrence described <italic>Jamie’s Ministry of Food</italic> as ‘a powerful portrait of the socially excluded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412457480">2008</xref>: 6). She continued:<disp-quote>
<p>Whether by intention or accident, the naked chef [Jamie Oliver] has entered the domestic life of a British town and captured a snapshot of the country’s social health. The result is an indictment of the current political system as disturbing as any ideological tract. Food, and real people’s experience of it, is still all about class. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412457480">2008</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lawrence then cited George Orwell’s analysis of working-class diet in <italic>The Road to Wigan Pier</italic> (1937) as evidence that these class-based patterns have a long history in British society.</p></fn>
