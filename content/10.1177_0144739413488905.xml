<p>Performance contracting is a key tool of performance management which, in turn, is also a distinct element of public sector reforms. Performance contracts (PCs) or agreements – as used in the public sector – specify standards of performance or quantifiable targets that a government requires public officials or the management of public/state-owned agencies or ministries/departments to meet over a stated period of time, and also provides incentives for achieving these targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0144739413488905">Petrie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0144739413488905">Hope, 2001</xref>). At the end of the stated period, performance can then be measured against these standards or targets. As part of the performance management orientation in government, the common purposes of performance contracting are to clarify the objectives of public service institutions and their relationship with government, and to facilitate performance evaluation based on results instead of conformity with bureaucratic rules and regulations. Performance contracting has been found to be quite successful in a large and diverse set of countries such as France, Pakistan, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, South Korea, Ghana, and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413488905">Hope, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0144739413488905">Xavier, 2010</xref>). However, the debate about “subjective” versus “objective” measures of performance still continues whether performance is measured in the context of a performance contract or otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0144739413488905">Van Dooren and Van de Walle, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The establishment of performance management systems is regarded as a means of getting results from individuals, teams, and the organization at large within a given framework of planned goals, objectives, and standards. It allows for the setting of targets and the development of indicators against which performance can be later measured. It is an integral part of the public service delivery mechanism and is a process by which an organization can assess whether or not it is delivering the appropriate services, according to its mission and objectives, in the appropriate quantity, at the appropriate cost, at the appropriate time, and to the appropriate people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0144739413488905">Holloway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0144739413488905">Xavier, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, how governments use the performance information generated under performance management systems is still a critical issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0144739413488905">Moynihan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This work provides an analysis and assessment of performance contracting as a performance management tool for improving public sector performance in Kenya and its implementation through practice and learning. It sets out to demonstrate that, through practice and learning, performance contracting remains a viable and important option for improving public sector performance as a key element of the on-going public sector transformation strategy for achieving the country’s long-term development goals.</p>
<sec id="section1-0144739413488905">
<title>The public sector performance contracting process in Kenya</title>
<p>The performance contracting process in Kenya is currently administered by the Performance Contracting Department (PCD) of the Government of Kenya (GOK). The literature on performance contracting in Kenya suggests that the concept was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0144739413488905">Kobia and Mohammed, 2006</xref>). In 1989, Kenya Railways was subjected to PCs and in 1990 the National Cereal and Produce Board also signed PCs. In 2003, the GOK re-introduced performance contracting – in its <italic>Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation 2003</italic>–<italic>2007</italic> – for adoption as a tool in the management of public resources and as a key element of the civil service reform strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0144739413488905">Republic of Kenya, 2003</xref>). Consequently, a Performance Contracts Steering Committee (PCSC) was also established by the GOK in August 2003 and in 2004 PCs were piloted in 16 state-owned commercial enterprises that were selected based on representation of a wide cross-section of sectors and the existence of their Strategic Plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413488905">Obong’o, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, and in a gradual manner, the implementation of performance contracting was expanded and by 2006 almost the entire Kenyan public service on the executive side was participating in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0144739413488905">Trivedi, nd</xref>). That meant that almost all ministries, state corporations, and local authorities had become engaged in performance contracting. That group, by 2011, included 46 ministries and departments, 178 state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 69 tertiary institutions, and 175 local authorities (municipalities, local, county, and urban councils; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2012</xref>). For ministries and departments, the performance contract is signed between the Cabinet Secretary (principal) and the relevant Permanent Secretary (agent). For SOEs, the performance contract is signed between the Permanent Secretary of the administrative ministry responsible for supervising that SOE (principal) and the Board of Directors of said SOE (agent). For local authorities, the performance contract is signed between the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Local Government (principal) and the Council of the local authority (agent). Each performance contract is then also countersigned by the relevant Cabinet Minister to ensure that it receives full recognition and support from the political leadership and government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are two entities that have been put in place by the GOK to assist with the design, implementation, and evaluation of the PCs. The first is the previously mentioned PCSC and the other is the Ad Hoc Negotiation/Evaluation Task Forces, more commonly referred to as The Ad Hoc Task Forces (AHTFs). The PCSC is responsible for the overall administration and coordination of PCs in the public service including developing policy frameworks, providing technical support to the performance contracting parties, and advising the government on the enabling legal and institutional framework for smooth implementation of the performance contracting process. The PCSC is assisted by AHTFs in the process of implementing the PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488905">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The AHTFs consist of experts drawn from professional associations, academia, the business community, and retired public servants. They are to be a completely neutral third party for ensuring the quality and integrity of the PCs. These AHTFs are responsible for negotiating the PCs and evaluating and moderating the performance of ministries and departments on behalf of Permanent Secretaries, and the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Public Service. The AHTFs also evaluate and moderate the performance of SOEs, local authorities, and tertiary institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488905">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Kenya, performance contracting is a part of the on-going broader public sector reforms that are aimed at improving efficiency and effectiveness in the management of the public service. The country’s public sector PCs are therefore seen and regarded as embracing the national management accountability framework ‘premised on the need to build the country’s competitive advantage around the performance of the public service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0144739413488905">Odinga, 2010a</xref>: v). ‘The system redefined public sector “performance” to mean focusing on outputs and outcomes, not on inputs, processes, or preoccupation with activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0144739413488905">Odinga, 2010a</xref>: v).</p>
<p>PCs in Kenya are freely negotiated agreements between the government and the management of a public entity. It is a freely negotiated performance agreement between the government, acting as the owner of a public agency, and the management of the agency. The performance contract specifies the mutual performance obligations, intentions and responsibilities of the two parties. Each performance contract quite clearly specifies the intentions and obligations, as well as responsibilities and powers of the contracting parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>). It also addresses economic, social and other tasks to be undertaken for economic or other desired gain. ‘It is therefore a [performance] management tool for ensuring accountability for results by public officials, because it measures the extent to which they achieve targeted results’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0144739413488905">OPM/PSRPC, nd[a]</xref>: 1) and, as the maxim says, ‘if you cannot measure, you cannot control, if you cannot control, you cannot manage, if you cannot manage, you cannot deliver’.</p>
<p>The expected outcomes of the use of PCs in Kenya include: (1) improved efficiency in service delivery to the public by ensuring that holders of public office are held accountable for results; (2) improvement in performance and efficiency in resource utilization and ensuring that public resources are focused on attainment of the key national policy priorities; (3) institutionalization of a performance-oriented culture in the public service; (4) ability to measure and evaluate performance; (5) ability to link reward for work to measurable performance; (6) instilling accountability for results at all levels in the government; (7) ensuring that the culture of accountability pervades all levels of government; (8) reduction or elimination of reliance on Exchequer funding by public agencies; (9) ability to strategize the management of public resources; and (10) recreating a culture of results-oriented management in the public service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413488905">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>One significant aspect of PCs in Kenya is the involvement of citizens in the process through the use of Citizen Service Delivery Charters (CSDCs). The CSDCs are key performance indicators in the PCs of the public institutions. These charters are written statements that indicate the nature, quality, and quantity of service that citizens should expect from a respective institution. They provide information on (1) what services are provided; (2) the standard of the services to be provided; (3) the time frame within which services will be provided; (4) any user charges; and (5) the manner in which clients (users) may seek redress if they are not satisfied with services received or if they are of the view that an institution is not living up to the commitments in its charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0144739413488905">Trivedi, nd</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0144739413488905">OPM/PSRPC, nd[b]</xref>).</p>
<p>Each performance contract is subjected to evaluation based on a set of indicators (measures by which the performance of an institution is assessed). These indicators and their associated weights are updated and published regularly by the PCD in the guidelines which it issues to provide guidance on the process of implementing performance contracts in the public service. Institutions are expected to select, as much as possible, indicators from the <italic>Sector Performance Standards</italic> (the composite set of sector performance benchmarks, including performance levels, based on international best practices) that have also been issued by the PCD. Also, institutions are to ensure that each performance target (the desired level of performance for a performance indicator) progressively approaches and/or exceeds the levels set out in the <italic>Sector Performance Standards</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, nd</xref>). The assessment measurement of the extent to which public agencies achieve negotiated performance targets are to be established using the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, nd</xref>):</p>
<p>Managerial Performance = Agency Performance ± Exogenous Factors<bold>
<sup>a</sup>
</bold>
</p>
<p>
<bold>
<sup>a</sup>
</bold>Where exogenous factors refer to those events that cannot reasonably be planned for, controlled or predicted by the manager.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the performance of public agencies entails the rating of actual achievements against performance targets negotiated and agreed upon at the beginning of the fiscal year. The resultant differences are resolved into raw and weighted scores, and ultimately denominated into composite scores. The performance rating of the institutions is based on the following achievement or criteria, and each performance rating is accordingly translated into a composite score and graded, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0144739413488905">Table 1</xref>:<list list-type="simple">

<p>Currently, the process for evaluating how Kenya’s public entities have performed is undertaken in three stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>). First, there is a self-evaluation by each institution, utilizing the evaluation methodology in the performance contracting guidelines. The second stage is the primary evaluation where a group of experts undertake what is supposed to be an exhaustive assessment of institutional performance in the performance contract year, and then assign a composite score that indicates the overall performance of the institution. This score is adjusted for factors beyond the control of the manager during the performance contract year to determine the performance of the manager. The final stage is the quality control or moderation stage, wherein a team of independent experts attempt to ensure that the evaluations have been completed within the guidelines and that all relevant tools and instruments have been uniformly applied. Any contentious issues are also considered at this stage, the institutions are then ranked based on their performance, and the final evaluation report is prepared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2010</xref>). A full explanation of the performance evaluation and computation methodology can be found in several PCD publications (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0144739413488905">OPM/PCD, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0144739413488905">2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance contracting as a performance management tool in Kenya: analytical assessment</title>
<p>Among the key elements of good public sector performance are: the existence of a public sector that is responsive to the needs of the citizenry (its clients); a public sector that creates an enabling environment for the private sector to sustainably be the engine of growth for the economy; a public sector that conducts its business with transparency and accountability as fundamental principles of its functioning in support of its delivery of public goods and services; a public sector that subscribes to the values of integrity and ethics; a public sector that demonstrates a total and complete intolerance for corruption and financial mismanagement; and a public sector that is goal-driven in support of the national vision and socioeconomic and political development priorities. In Kenya, many of these characteristics of the public sector are envisaged in the <italic>Public Sector Transformation Strategy: From Reform to Transformation 2010–14</italic> (PSTS) that was released in early 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0144739413488905">OPM/PSTD, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Performance contracting, as a tool of performance management, is also crucial for achieving the objectives of the <italic>Kenya Vision 2030</italic> through the <italic>First Medium Term Plan (MTP) 2008–2012 (MTP 2008–2012)</italic> and its updates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0144739413488905">Republic of Kenya, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0144739413488905">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0144739413488905">2011</xref>), complemented by the PSTS. The <italic>Kenya Vision 2030</italic> is the country’s development blueprint, covering the period 2008 to 2030, with the objective ‘to create a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life by 2030. It aims to transform Kenya into a newly industrializing, middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0144739413488905">Republic of Kenya, 2007</xref>: vii). An efficient, motivated and well-trained public service is one of the major foundations of that vision, with public service reforms further enhancing, among other things, performance contracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0144739413488905">Republic of Kenya, 2007</xref>). It is being implemented in successive 5-year medium-term plans, with one of the targets of the first medium-term plan having been the establishment of a Kenya School of Government (KSOG) to build capacity and inculcate public service values and ethics for national transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0144739413488905">Republic of Kenya, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0144739413488905">2010</xref>). The PSTS outcomes, and consequently those of the <italic>Kenya Vision 2030</italic>, are ultimately about improving public sector performance in Kenya. As the then Prime Minister Raila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413488905">Odinga (2010b</xref>: 4) noted in his Foreword to the PSTS:<disp-quote>
<p>The Public Sector exists to translate the priorities and directions of the Government into tangible benefits and results for Kenyans. Today it is more important than ever that the Public Sector carry out its mandate as effectively as possible and adhere to the highest standards of public [performance] management so that it justifies the confidence of the Government and the thrust of Kenyans. The Public Sector is the face of the Government and each citizen will judge how well the Government represents their interests by the manner in which the Public Sector serves them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister further observed that ‘the overarching goal of transformation must be to create a Public Sector that is trusted, goal driven and responsive to the needs of Kenyans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413488905">Odinga, 2010b</xref>: 4) and that ‘public sector transformation affords an existing opportunity to make a dramatic leap toward our shared goal of a just, equitable, and prosperous Kenya’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0144739413488905">Odinga, 2010b</xref>: 4). Through performance contracting, the performance of public sector institutions can be better managed, monitored, and measured – the three M’s of performance contracting – in a transparent manner for the benefit of the citizenry. PCs are tools of performance management that are intended to commit public officials to, and hold them accountable for, specified results. The desired outcome is to improve the efficiency of public service delivery while creating transparency in the management and use of public resources. In this regard, the use of CSDCs contributes to the strengthening of performance by involving and empowering the public to demand transparency and accountability from public servants and the holders of political office. So, whether by accident previously, or by design as espoused by the former Prime Minister Odinga, performance contracting in Kenya is a primary tool in the performance management arsenal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, whether public sector performance is seen from the perspective of improving public sector management and performance, or simply as strengthening government capacity to perform essential functions and deliver goods and services to the citizenry, the use of PCs as a performance management tool to get there can materially provide at least the following three benefits: (1) greater transparency; (2) improved public accountability; and (3) strengthened capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0144739413488905">Fryer, Antony, and Ogden, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0144739413488905">
<title>Greater transparency</title>
<p>Transparency is taken here to mean that reliable, relevant, and timely information about the activities of government is available to the public. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0144739413488905">Schiavo-Campo and Sundaram (2001)</xref> have argued that transparency is one of the four pillars of good government, with the other three being accountability, predictability, and participation. Transparent government means that the citizens know what the public administration is doing, how it is doing it, and why it is doing it, including its planning for the future. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0144739413488905">Pardo (2007</xref>: 10):<disp-quote>
<p>There is [also] a strong belief that a transparent administration and a transparent decision-making process strengthen the democratic nature of institutions and the public’s confidence in the administration. It gives the administration democratic legitimacy.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Associated with transparency is the concept of openness whereby public participation in shaping and implementing government policy is encouraged and guaranteed. Openness of public information and universal access to it have become key mechanisms for obtaining good government, since citizens can hold their government accountable by knowing what that government is doing and how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0144739413488905">Pardo, 2007</xref>). Open governments are institutional structures where all public servants are held responsible for their decisions, where public actions can be closely monitored and where citizens can obtain all relevant information to accomplish both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0144739413488905">Pardo, 2007</xref>). In other words, and as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0144739413488905">OECD (2005</xref>: 29), an open government is one in which:<disp-quote>
<p>citizens, businesses and civil society organizations have: firstly, the ability to request and receive relevant and understandable information; secondly, the capacity to obtain services and undertake transactions, and thirdly, the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>Where there is transparency, government officials will be prevented from exercising discretionary powers and will be taken to task, by the public in general and the press in particular, for violating the terms of their PCs – which are public documents, open to scrutiny, and readily available online. Transparency, therefore, complements and reinforces predictability, reduces uncertainty, and inhibits and reduces the scope for corruption and unethical behavior among public officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0144739413488905">Schiavo-Campo and Sundaram, 2001</xref>). Greater transparency also exposes the shortcomings and any deliberate secrecy or misreporting of the operations of any given public institution.</p>
<p>Generally, countries characterized by a relatively high degree of transparency have been able to achieve a more robust political and economic performance compared to countries with less transparent policies. PCs, to the extent that they enhance transparency in Kenya, will raise the domestic legitimacy of the government. On the other hand, transparency will also increase the political risk arising from the real or perceived non-performance of public sector institutions. Transparency is a prerequisite for genuine accountability and reinforces predictability.</p>

<title>Improved public accountability</title>
<p>Transparency is also vital for accountability. In fact, a system of government that is open and transparent is also likely to be accountable. Accountability means that systems are in place and are facilitated by public institutions to hold public officials to account for their behavior, actions, and decisions. A system of public accountability is required so that public officials and governments act in ways that are broadly approved by society. Public institutions are created by the public and for the public, and need to be accountable to it. The concern with public accountability expresses the continuing need for checks, oversight, surveillance, and institutional constraints on the exercise or potential abuse of power.</p>
<p>Related to public accountability is the notion of responsibility. Responsibility refers to those rules that influence the behaviour of public officials in ways that encourage them to be responsive to public demands and act in the interest and welfare of citizens. PCs provide for all of these elements. The measurement and evaluation of performance in the context of the contents of the PCs will therefore expose any deficiencies in accountability by public officials and public institutions alike. In other words, the application of PCs will determine where public accountability is greatest, and where it is faulty and what should be done to improve it. Improved public accountability will also improve the performance of public institutions while the public scrutiny derived from PCs will provide the impetus for conscious efforts at improving public accountability and overall institutional performance.</p>

<title>Strengthened capacity</title>
<p>Through performance measurement and evaluation, in the framework of PCs, any capacity constraints will be identified and recommendations offered on how to develop Kenya’s required indigenous capacity to improve institutional performance. It has become recognized in the development literature that sustainable development can best be achieved in environments of developed human and institutional capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0144739413488905">Hope, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance contracting outcomes</title>
<p>It was generally agreed in the literature that performance contracting had been showing some success in Kenya (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0144739413488905">Hope, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0144739413488905">Obong’o, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0144739413488905">Kobia and Mohammed, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0144739413488905">Trivedi, nd</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413488905">LOG Associates, 2010</xref>).

</p>
<p>However, recently there has been some debate and criticism, both inside and outside of government, on the measurement of performance in the public sector institutions and the consequent rankings of those institutions based on that performance in the context of their PCs. Public sentiment has indicated that the rankings of some public sector institutions are not consistent with their performance as the public perceives it. That is to say, that some questions have been raised on how some public sector institutions got such high rankings when the public perception (and perhaps the reality) reveals that those entities have not performed to those standards. Similarly, for instance, some Ministries that had been perceived by the citizens to have performed well were lowly ranked.</p>
<p>The debate on the perception (both inside and outside of government) of performance in public sector institutions versus the official performance rankings of those institutions was aptly captured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413488905">Kimani (2010</xref>: 5):<disp-quote>
<p>Over the past three weeks since the 2008/2009 performance evaluation results for Government agencies were released, tens of institutions have raised queries over the ranking.… Several Government institutions.… Were questioning the results, as it emerged some of them were marked down during the final stage of the three-level evaluation process without explanation.… The development comes at a time when concerns are piling that the tool is far from achieving its main goal – perfecting management of public affairs.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In response to this state of affairs, then Prime Minister Odinga appointed a panel of experts in May 2010 to review the performance contracting system, ‘amid rising disquiet among State institutions that the measurement tool is flawed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413488905">Kimani, 2010</xref>: 5). He noted that ‘the performance contracting process is facing several challenges, prompting the need to refine the system’ and that ‘the urgent issue is to ensure that it captures and reports on results that affect the lives of ordinary Kenyans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0144739413488905">Kimani, 2010</xref>: 5). The panel submitted its report in November 2010 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0144739413488905">OPM, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>PCs generally have inherent difficulties. There is the classic principal-agent information asymmetry and moral hazard problem. Managers enjoy an information advantage over owners and can negotiate targets that are difficult for outsiders to evaluate and/or are very easy to achieve. Some managers tend to operate as opportunistic agents who exploit the inherent asymmetries in information – by knowing more about what they are doing, and what they may or may not be accomplishing, than their bosses, they put self-interest above the public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0144739413488905">Schick, 2003</xref>). In fact, in this case of Kenya, one consultancy report noted that ‘some institutions have developed methods where they deliberately set low targets for themselves. Such institutions therefore are able to score highly without “stretching” so high. This has been one of the biggest challenges to the performance contracting system as currently implemented’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0144739413488905">LOG Associates, 2010</xref>: vi). In addition, in some PCs, the incentives and penalties may not be credible or sufficient. And, political owners may not always be committed to performance management or improved efficiencies in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>However, having said that, and as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0144739413488905">Greiling (2006)</xref> more generally, there is a need to build on international experience and best practice in designing these contracts, and then to be able to evaluate performance more effectively for increasing the efficiency of public service delivery. The Performance Contracting Department needs to deal purposefully with the challenges of information asymmetry, smart incentives, and credible commitments, for instance.</p>
<p>As the foregoing demonstrates, performance contracting can and should be used as a powerful tool for strengthening public sector performance in Kenya. The country, now suffering from major governance deficits – as measured by such indices as corruption (real and perceived), public financial mismanagement, state weakness, and centralization of power, for example – needs to utilize performance contracting, as a performance management tool, in a much more robust way as part of its arsenal for improving institutional performance – particularly in the context of the <italic>Kenya Vision 2030</italic> and the PSTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0144739413488905">Hope, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0144739413488905">2012b</xref>). A significant element of such an approach would, however, require a much more credible measurement and evaluation of public sector performance in relationship to the PCs.</p>
<p>In 2011, a Policy Steering Committee on Performance Management was established by the government and given overall responsibility for the management and coordination of performance management in the three arms of government, including oversight of the implementation of reforms in the performance contracting system. Those reforms will also entail implementation of the recommendations made by the panel of experts referred to above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0144739413488905">OPM, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Lessons learned</title>
<p>The performance contracting experience, as a performance management tool in Kenya, has yielded, for the most part, the desired results as originally intended. When some of the evaluations indicated that some performance results were at odds with the views of the public, it provided the opportunity and the space to engage in a thorough review of the PC process, conducted by a panel of experts appointed by the then Prime Minister, as discussed above.</p>
<p>The lessons learned, among other things, allowed the Kenyan government to determine how skills and knowledge are transmitted and acquired within the public sector through the PC process, as well as for the application of the change principles, as explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0144739413488905">Hope (1997)</xref> – for example, in the modification and update of that process. More particularly, the lessons learned, and reflected in the report of the panel of experts, are being applied by the Policy Steering Committee on Performance Management that was established by the government. The key lessons learned included the following:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The need for adequate linkages between the Vision 2030 and its Medium-Term Plans and PC targets</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>That public confidence in the public service is not influenced by the performance results and rankings of the public entities but by perceptions of actual service delivered</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>That the PC implementation calendar must be strictly adhered to if the process is to be fairly applied across the board</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The importance of an enhanced information management system to track PC results and to allow for data and other information sharing among the public entities, such as successful practices employed by some of those entities</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The significance of having in place a rewards and sanctions system that must be applicable not only to individuals and institutions within a framework that addresses the maintenance of high-level performance; improvement when performing poorly; and the sanctions for poor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0144739413488905">OPM, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PCs represent a state-of-the-art tool for improving public sector performance. They are being used as a performance management tool in Kenya to help public sector executives and policy makers to define responsibilities and expectations between contracting parties to achieve common, mutually agreed goals for better service delivery. In fact, they are now considered an important tool for enhancing transparency, accountability, and strengthened capacity for results in the public sector. Kenya’s public sector performance contracting process had been somewhat successful and provided some of the desired outcomes related to improved institutional performance. However, some recent results of the evaluation of the performance of some public agencies were not consistent with the perception (both inside and outside of government) of the performance of those agencies and that brought to the surface that there are some flaws in the administration and evaluation of performance through PCs. These flaws have now been rectified through the lessons learned from the implementation and administration of that process.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis and findings of this work, it is fair to also conclude that the long-term success of Kenya’s performance contracting regime appears to rest on the three key underpinnings identified by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0144739413488905">OECD (1999)</xref> in its synthesis study that evaluated lessons from performance contracting case studies as a framework for successful public sector performance contracting:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>An environment that maintains and supports a trust-based relationship that includes a balance between the formal and informal, on-going dialogue, information sharing, negotiation, and clarity of purpose. Performance contracting requires good faith efforts from all sides of the contractual relationship. It must have continued strong support at the highest political and managerial levels on both sides of the agreement. It is also suggested that performance contracting requires a mature and well established public service culture and a stable political and policy environment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>An ongoing commitment to mutual purpose and accountability for results activated through one or more performance contracts. Such contracts must always provide for goals, objectives, and targets; incentive systems to achieve in the current period and also for the future; and agreed processes for managing the contract and assessing results. Moreover, the staff involved with the delivery of the programs and services under the PCs need to have (or be supported in gaining) the appropriate skills, attitudes and experience to ensure the agreement delivers the results expected.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A “big picture” focus that does not expect performance contracting to address the whole spectrum of factors related to performance management, but rather continues to be seen as one tool in the performance management system. A performance contracting regime is not a substitute for overall performance management. It is merely one element of a performance management framework. It is an increasingly important performance management tool within the context of resource allocation and strategic management processes.</p>
