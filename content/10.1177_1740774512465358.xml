<title>Background</title>
<p>Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) collect cost-effectiveness data. Without appropriate sample size calculations, patient recruitment may cease before the cost-effectiveness of the intervention can be established or continue after the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is established beyond doubt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512465358">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>We determined the frequency with which cost-effectiveness is considered in sample size calculations and whether RCT-based economic evaluations are likely to come to inconclusive results at odds with the clinical findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512465358">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We searched the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) to identify RCT-based cost-utility analyses. RCTs that collected individual patient data on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were eligible. Studies using models to extrapolate the results of RCTs or with insufficient information on incremental costs and QALYs were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512465358">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 38 trials met eligibility criteria. Only one considered cost-effectiveness in sample size calculations. RCTs were less likely to reach definitive conclusions based on the cost-effectiveness results than the primary clinical outcome (15.8% vs. 42.1%; McNemar; p = 0.01). In trials that provided sufficient data, exploratory analysis indicated that the median power to detect important differences was 29.5% for QALYs, 94.1% for costs, and 78.7% for the primary clinical outcome. In three trials (7.9%), a definitely more effective intervention was found to be expensive and probably not cost-effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512465358">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our results reflect trials where authors considered within-trial estimates of cost-effectiveness to be meaningful. In focusing on one primary clinical outcome from each RCT, we have simplified the clinical effectiveness results, although the primary outcome will usually be one that policy makers use in judging the ‘success’ of the intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512465358">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Economic evaluations conducted alongside RCTs are valuable, but often present inconclusive evidence. Trial results may lead to discordant messages when the most effective intervention is probably not the most cost-effective. Despite methodological advances, trialists rarely assessed the extent to which their trial might resolve the key uncertainties about the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We recommend that grant funders should do more to encourage trialists to include economic end points in sample size calculations, particularly when the majority of costs and benefits of the intervention occur within the time frame of the trial.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Policy makers often demand evidence on cost-effectiveness before adopting new health technologies. As a result, a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) collect resource-use data. The RCT design minimizes the risk of selection bias, and therefore, the economic evidence derived has high internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512465358">1</xref>]. However, RCTs have several limitations as a vehicle for economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512465358">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512465358">3</xref>]. Most notably, the truncated follow-up period and limited number of interventions compared in most RCTs may lead to misleading conclusions if cost or benefits accumulate during the remaining lifetime of patients or if relevant comparator interventions are excluded from consideration. Therefore, the goal of some trial-based economic evaluations is estimation rather than hypothesis testing in order to inform models incorporating prior evidence, extrapolating over a longer time period, or broadening the decision problem to include all relevant interventions and settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512465358">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, guidelines recommend that trialists consider the ability of the RCT to test economic hypotheses at the design stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512465358">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Sample size formulas were initially developed to determine whether trials have sufficient statistical power to detect differences in the cost-effectiveness of treatments based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512465358">5</xref>] and net benefit statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512465358">6</xref>]. These methods have been extended to incorporate considerations such as Bayesian approaches where ‘assurance’ is broadly analogous to the frequentist concept of statistical ‘power’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512465358">7</xref>] and the expected value (and costs) of trial information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512465358">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512465358">9</xref>]. Despite methodological advances, many RCTs including economic evaluations may still be designed without any consideration of their ability to inform the economic decision. In such trials, it is possible that recruitment may continue after the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is established beyond doubt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512465358">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Conceptually, RCTs may have diminished statistical power or assurance for economic analyses for several reasons. Costs data often have high variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512465358">11</xref>] and positive skew, which may have a deleterious effect on the ability to identify differences in group means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512465358">12</xref>]. In addition, cost calculations are prone to missing or censored data as resource-use measurement relies on multiple components (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, personal costs, etc.) ascertained at every trial follow-up time-point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512465358">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512465358">14</xref>]. Methods to address missing or censored data, such as complete-case analysis, multiple imputation, or Kaplan–Meier sample average estimators, reduce the sample size or inflate the confidence intervals (CIs) around trial results. Furthermore, there is some evidence that generic health-related quality of life measures in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512465358">15</xref>] and health preference measures in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512465358">16</xref>] are less responsive to small changes in health status than disease-specific measures, potentially making it more difficult to demonstrate effectiveness using a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) outcome. Therefore, it is often assumed that RCTs frequently have insufficient power/assurance on economic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512465358">1</xref>] and that the larger sample sizes needed to prove cost-effectiveness may not be ethically acceptable if effectiveness is already demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512465358">2</xref>]. However, there is little empirical evidence to substantiate this.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to review the literature of cost–utility analyses conducted alongside RCTs to (1) determine the extent to which cost-effectiveness is considered when calculating sample sizes, (2) estimate the frequency and extent to which economic conclusions differ from clinical conclusions, (3) assess whether economic evaluations are more likely to come to indeterminate results, and (4) discuss the circumstances in which economic sample size calculations might be appropriate.</p>

<title>Study identification and data extraction</title>
<p>Our search strategy was designed to provide a snapshot of the literature rather than an exhaustive systematic review. Therefore, we searched the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) to identify cost–utility analyses conducted alongside RCTs. NHS EED systematically identifies economic evaluations and contains over 7000 quality assessed economic evaluations. We used the search terms ‘random*’ AND ‘QALY’ AND ‘controlled’ to identify cost-utility analyses conducted alongside RCTs. We focused on cost per QALY studies as this common metric makes comparisons between studies more straightforward and they represent a subgroup of studies where willingness to pay thresholds for the outcome (i.e., a QALY) are reasonably well defined, making sample size calculations more feasible. This generated 717 articles published in 293 journals. We initially selected all the articles from four high-impact journals (<italic>British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet</italic>, and <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic>) and five journals that publish a high volume of economic studies (<italic>Value in Health, Pharmacoeconomics, International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care, Annals of Internal Medicine</italic>, and <italic>Current Medical Research &amp; Opinion</italic>). The purpose of this selection process was to identify cost–utility analyses likely to be of good quality that contained sufficient detail on the mean and variance of cost and QALY end points. We also selected all the articles from a random sample of 50% of the remaining journals that published three or more economic studies. This resulted in 302 articles published in 36 journals for review.</p>
<p>The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) studies that were not RCTs; (2) studies that did not measure preference scores or costs on individual patients; (3) publications with insufficient information to make inference on whether the intervention was cost-effective (i.e., standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), p value, CIs, or cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC)); and (4) studies that were models based on RCT data where it was impossible to distinguish the ‘within-trial’ results from the modeling results. The studies excluded by this final criterion ranged from simple extrapolation models of costs and effects beyond the end of a single trial to complex models synthesizing evidence from numerous trials and observational studies. Two authors (D.M.R. and W.H.) reviewed the full text of the first 25 articles. Thereafter, one author (D.M.R.) reviewed the abstract and, where necessary, the full text, of the remaining articles, consulting the other reviewer if a second opinion was required.</p>
<p>For the included studies, one author (D.M.R.) extracted study characteristics into an MS Access database, which were then verified by a second author (W.H.). Characteristics included year of publication; country of lead author; funding source; disease group; type of intervention; RCT design (parallel, factorial, clustered, noninferiority, or equivalence); number of trial arms; number of patients randomized; the method used to calculate QALYs; duration of trial follow-up; and method of reporting economic results. We also recorded whether the initial cost of the intervention was high (≥£500) and whether the costs/savings and health benefits of the intervention might reasonably be expected to extend beyond the end of the trial. We reasoned that trials of high-cost interventions that had cost and health consequences beyond the end of the trial would be unlikely to test within-trial hypotheses of cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Where necessary, we converted uninflated results to GB pounds using 2010 purchasing power parity rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512465358">17</xref>]. Where the number of trial arms differed between the clinical study and the economic evaluation, for instance, due to pooling of arms for economic analysis, we recorded the number of arms used in the economic evaluation. We designated the intervention with the highest QALY gain as ‘Intervention A’. In two-arm trials, the other intervention was designated as ‘Intervention B’. In trials with three or more arms, we designated ‘Intervention B’ as the intervention that provided the next best QALYs and was also not dominated. In some factorial studies, the authors did not present sufficient details on these two interventions. In these cases, we selected the two trial interventions on which the authors placed most emphasis and/or provided clear incremental results.</p>

<sec id="section10-1740774512465358">
<title>Outcome data</title>
<p>We recorded the mean (and incremental) primary clinical outcome, QALYs, and costs; the ICER; and the net monetary benefit (NMB) at all the threshold values reported. For each, we recorded the SE, SD, 95% CI, and p value. If a CEAC was presented, we estimated the probability that ‘Intervention A’ was cost-effective at the £30,000 per QALY threshold as this is the upper threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512465358">16</xref>]. Many studies did not provide data on all the measures listed above. In some studies where there were multiple ‘primary’ clinical outcomes, we chose the outcome reported first in the abstract.</p>
<p>We classified the results for ‘Intervention A’ as (1) definitely more effective, (2) probably more effective, (3) probably less effective or (4) definitely less effective based on the point estimate and the CI or p value (reported by the authors or estimated from the information reported; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512465358">Table 1</xref>). A similar method was used to classify the cost–utility results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774512465358">Table 2</xref>). We also classified ‘major’ and ‘minor’ discordances between the primary clinical outcome results and economic results. A ‘major’ discordance occurred if, for example, the primary clinical outcome indicated that ‘Intervention A’ was definitely more effective, while the cost per QALY outcome indicated that ‘Intervention A’ was definitely less cost-effective. If instead the cost per QALY outcome indicated that ‘Intervention A’ was probably less cost-effective, we classified this as a ‘minor’ discordance. We use the term discordant to indicate situations where the implications for current practice based on the primary clinical outcome alone would be reversed once the cost-effectiveness results are known.</p>

<title>Exploratory analysis of power for costs, QALYs, and the clinical end point</title>
<p>We compared the statistical power of the RCTs to detect differences in costs, QALYs, and clinical end points. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the ability of the RCTs to identify important differences in these end points within the time frame of the trial and therefore help us interpret why trial-based analyses of economic end points may be more likely to come to indeterminate conclusions. With this analysis, we do not imply that all trials should be designed to have 80% (or any other degree of) power to detect differences in cost, QALY, or cost-effectiveness end points. It has been argued that Bayesian methods are more appropriate in the design and analysis of economic evaluations because of the relative ease of incorporating all available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512465358">18</xref>]. However, we calculated statistical power, rather than Bayesian assurance, because all the studies in our sample that described their sample size calculations had used frequentist methods.</p>
<p>We extracted information on the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) specified by the authors; if this was not stated directly, we recorded the difference at which power was evaluated by the authors. We assumed that the MCID was independent of length of the follow-up. For trials that made repeated measurements on clinical outcomes, we compared statistical power at the longest QALY follow-up time. In one trial, the primary clinical end point was not measured at the time when QALYs were assessed; in this case, we calculated the statistical power based on the clinical end point that was. There is currently no consensus on what constitutes a minimum economically important difference (MEID) in costs or QALYs between treatments. For the purposes of our exploratory analysis, we defined an important difference as 0.05 in mean QALYs, equivalent to about 18 quality-adjusted life days or £1500 at a willingness to pay threshold of £30,000. In recognition that this is an arbitrary threshold, we also conduct sensitivity analyses at two different thresholds (0.025 QALYs/£750 and 0.10 QALYs/£3000).</p>
<p>Clinical end points included continuous, binary, survival, and Poisson data. Power for continuous clinical end points was calculated as the power to detect the MCID in means (or mean changes from baseline if that was used by the authors) assuming that variances in both the study arms were equal to the reported pooled estimate. This represented a conservative estimate of power when analyses were adjusted for baseline covariates or longitudinal measurements. For trials with binary end points, we calculated the power to detect the MCID in proportions assuming that the probability of a successful outcome on ‘Intervention B’ was equal to the observed study estimate. For survival, power was calculated either for the log-rank test or Cox regression depending upon the statistical method used in the study. The power of tests based on Poisson data is calculated as the power of the Wald test based on the sample mean rate.</p>
<p>While economic data may be skewed, comparisons of arithmetic mean costs are most pertinent for informing health policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512465358">19</xref>]. Although more sophisticated methods may be appropriate in some circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512465358">12</xref>], standard t-tests can perform adequately for cost data even in moderate sample sizes. Therefore, the power of each trial to detect a MEID in costs was based on an unpaired t-test using a Satterthwaite adjustment to allow for unequal variances of costs across treatment arms. The sampling distribution of this t-statistic may be reliably approximated by a normal distribution since the adjusted degrees of freedom exceeded 91 for all the trials in our analysis. Power to detect a MEID in QALYs was based on an unpaired t-test using a pooled estimate of variance.</p>
<p>Power calculations were based on randomized sample sizes and so assume no missing data. For survival trials, the power for the clinical end point was calculated based on the number of events observed. If the trial was cluster randomized, or there was a natural clustering of responses (e.g., by practitioner), an ‘effective sample size’ was calculated as the randomized sample size divided by a ‘design effect’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512465358">20</xref>]. The design effect is a function of cluster size and the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). We assumed a common ICC for the clinical and QALY end points; cost data were assumed to behave as a process variable. If, from the study report, neither estimates nor <italic>a priori</italic> guesses at the ICCs could be extracted, their values were imputed as the ICC estimates for outcome (ICC = 0.030) and process (ICC = 0.063) variables reported by Campbell <italic>et al</italic>.

<title>Descriptive statistics</title>
<p>Thirty-seven of the 302 (12.3%) studies from 17 journals met the inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512465358">Figure 1</xref>). One article contained two RCTs, therefore 38 trials are included in our review (see supplementary material appendix). The majority of ineligible studies were models based on RCTs. Most eligible studies were publicly funded, conducted in the United Kingdom and published since 2004 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512465358">Table 3</xref>). The typical trial was an individual patient randomized two-arm superiority trial with a moderate (n = 200–500) sample size. A minority of trials (18%) had more than two arms. The EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to generate QALYs in 81% of the studies with a median of 1 year of trial follow-up. Most trials summarized economic findings using the ICER and CEAC; the NMB was less frequently used. In just over one-third of trials, any health benefits of intervention were judged likely to occur within the time frame of the trial. In almost all the cases, these were trials of relatively cheap interventions where the majority of subsequent costs/savings of the intervention were also within the time frame of the trial. For example, Soares <italic>et al</italic>.

<title>Role of economic analysis in the sample size calculation</title>
<p>Only one RCT explicitly considered cost-effectiveness in sample size calculations. Delaney <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512465358">24</xref>], comparing a test and treat strategy versus proton pump inhibitor in the initial primary care management of dyspepsia, considered the incremental cost per QALY in their sample size calculation. The subsequent RCT, which randomized 699 patients, failed to recruit the number of patients (2000) indicated by the sample size calculation and did not achieve statistical power targets for the anticipated cost and QALY outcomes. Two other trials considered costs, but not cost-effectiveness, in their sample size calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512465358">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512465358">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Primary clinical outcome versus QALY findings</title>

Therefore, there was weak evidence of a difference in the strength of conclusions between clinical and QALY outcomes (McNemar; p = 0.08). In most studies, the QALY and primary clinical outcome conclusions were broadly concordant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1740774512465358">Table 4</xref>), with minor discordance in just three trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512465358">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512465358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512465358">29</xref>]. For example, in a trial comparing laparoscopic hysterectomy versus abdominal hysterectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512465358">30</xref>], the primary clinical outcome, rate of major complications, was higher in patients treated laparoscopically (11.1% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.02).

<title>Analysis of power for costs, QALYs, and clinical end point</title>
<p>Seventeen (45%), 18 (47%), and 27 (71%) of 38 trials provided sufficient information for QALY, costs, and clinical end points, respectively. In these subgroups, the median power to detect important differences was 29.5% for QALYs, 94.1% for costs, and 78.7% for the clinical outcome. In the 13 trials that provided sufficient data on all the three end points, power on the clinical outcome was below 70% for 4 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774512465358">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774512465358"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774512465358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512465358">35</xref>] (Trial IDs 16, 23, 26, and 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512465358">Figure 2</xref>). Reasons for the lack of power included the following: underestimation of response variance, baseline scores meant relative differences corresponded to smaller absolute differences than expected, and the original sample size was too small to detect the stated effect of interest. The power to detect the MEID in mean costs was highly variable between studies, ranging from 4.3% up to 100%. Seven studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512465358">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512465358">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512465358"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774512465358"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512465358"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774512465358"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512465358">40</xref>] (Trial IDs 1, 5, 20, 26, 31, 34, and 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512465358">Figure 2</xref>) were almost certain to detect a difference of £1500 in mean costs and were characterized by interventions where individual patient costs were relatively tightly spread about a low average cost. For trials of more expensive treatments where the variability of individual costs was much greater, the power to detect an important difference in mean costs often fell below 60%. The majority of trials have low power to detect the MEID in mean QALYs. The two exceptions to this trend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512465358">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512465358">40</xref>] (Trial IDs 34 and 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512465358">Figure 2</xref>) are characterized by relatively low SDs around the QALY mean. The power of trials to detect important within-trial differences in costs and QALYs varies with our definition of the MEID. Halving the MEIDs in costs and QALYs sees the median power of trials to detect important differences drop to 10.6% for QALYs and 42.7% for costs; doubling our definition of the MEIDs increases the median power of trials to 81.2% for QALYs and 100% for costs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the longstanding availability of sample size formulas for cost-effectiveness analyses, they very rarely feature in the design of RCTs. The RCTs were much more likely to reach definitive conclusions about the effectiveness than the cost-effectiveness of interventions evaluated. The power of RCTs to detect differences in costs and QALYs was highly variable, and within trials, there was little correlation between attained power for costs, QALYs, and clinical outcomes. In a minority of trials, policy decisions based purely on the primary clinical outcome might be reversed as a result of the cost-effectiveness considerations.</p>
<sec id="section19-1740774512465358">
<title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
<p>We believe that this is the first review to explore the frequency with which cost–utility analyses conducted alongside RCTs reach definitive conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of interventions and how often these cost-effectiveness conclusions might conflict with evidence on effectiveness. This is an important topic, because of the increasing emphasis that health-care payers place on economic evidence and the substantial investment by research funders in generating that evidence.</p>
<p>Our search strategy was not designed to be exhaustive or identify a completely representative sample of studies. Instead, we focused on studies published in high-impact journals and those that published a high volume of economic studies. A broader search strategy would probably have identified more lower quality studies, but it is unlikely to have altered our finding that trialists rarely consider economic outcomes in their sample size calculations. By selecting economic evaluations that reported within-trial cost–utility results separately from any model-based analyses, our results reflect a minority of trial-based economic evaluations where authors considered within-trial estimates of cost-effectiveness to be meaningful. We speculate that trials of expensive or preventative interventions unlikely to prove cost-effective over the typical 1- to 2-year RCT follow-up period are less likely to be included in our sample, although there were exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512465358">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512465358">27</xref>]. In focusing only on one primary clinical outcome from each RCT, we have simplified the clinical effectiveness results, although the primary outcome will usually be one that policy makers use in judging the ‘success’ of the intervention. While we arbitrarily defined the MEID for costs and QALY outcomes, the MCIDs for the clinical end points were selected by the study authors, and therefore, the power calculations may not be fully comparable between the three end points and should be considered exploratory. Our definition of MEID was the same as that used in the one trial that performed a cost-effectiveness sample size calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512465358">24</xref>]; however, the uncertainty is underscored by our sensitivity analyses that demonstrated large changes in estimates of trial power for costs and QALYs, depending on the definition of MEID. In the minority of trials with more than two arms, we selected two interventions for review. While we endeavored to select two most effective interventions likely to be of interest to policy makers, a different selection procedure might have affected our findings.</p>

<title>Previous research</title>
<p>Very little research has been previously conducted in this area. A review of cost data collected alongside RCTs published in 1995 found that none of the 45 trials reported sample size calculations for costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512465358">41</xref>]. Our data suggest that despite methodological advances, this situation has not changed much. Only 8% (3/38) of trials in our sample considered costs, and only one trial considered cost-effectiveness in the sample size calculation. Retrospective analyses based on trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512465358">42</xref>] have demonstrated that the sample size required to detect important differences in cost-effectiveness may be much greater than that needed to demonstrate effectiveness alone. This is not necessarily so, an RCT evaluating a marginally effective but highly cost-saving intervention would typically need a smaller sample size to reach a definitive conclusion on cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512465358">43</xref>]. Nevertheless, our review confirms that in practice, a higher proportion of trials came to a definite conclusion on the primary clinical outcome than either the QALY or cost per QALY results.</p>
<p>The apparent lower responsiveness of QALYs compared to the primary clinical outcome may or may not be a cause for concern. On the one hand, health preference indices used to estimate QALYs are designed to overlook negligible changes in disease status that might be picked up by a disease-specific outcome measure. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the original EQ-5D descriptive system and valuation that results in a large discontinuity between the best health state (index score = 1.000) and the next best health state (index score = 0.883) may lead to a lack of responsiveness for mild health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774512465358">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774512465358">45</xref>]. It remains to be seen whether the recent development of an expanded five-level EQ-5D will resolve this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512465358">46</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section21-1740774512465358">
<title>Implications of this research</title>
<p>One potential, but in our view incorrect, implication of our findings is that research funders should be routinely requiring power calculations on economic end points and larger RCTs to increase the likelihood that trials detect differences in cost-effectiveness between interventions. However, these enlarged trials may not be desirable ethically or economically. An illustration of these points comes from a trial in our sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512465358">28</xref>], which found strong statistical evidence (p &lt; 0.05) that early cataract surgery decreased the number of falls in elderly women but had a cost per QALY of £35,704 and a 35.6% chance of being cost-effective over a 12-month time period. A larger trial might have produced a more definite within-trial cost-effectiveness result, but would have exposed more women in the control group to harm from falls and would probably not have changed the authors’ conclusion, based on an extrapolation model, that over a lifetime, early cataract surgery was very probably (&gt;90%) cost-effective. Sample size calculations to ensure that a trial achieves statistical power to test a within-trial economic hypothesis are not appropriate when a substantial proportion of incremental costs and benefits are likely to extend beyond the end of the trial. At the same time, there is a subset of trials within our sample, characterized by interventions of short duration with short-term health benefits, where the failure to consider cost-effectiveness in the trial design is not justified. In these trials, recruitment may cease before the cost-effectiveness of the intervention can be firmly established or continue after the cost-effectiveness of the intervention is established beyond doubt. A potential example of the latter issue is provided by Hollinghurst <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774512465358">47</xref>] where the comparison between exercise therapy and normal care for chronic back pain demonstrated that exercise therapy was definitely more cost-effective despite not being definitely more effective. The cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy could have been demonstrated with a smaller sample size, but the sample size calculation was complex as this was an eight-arm factorial trial.</p>
<p>Arguably, uncertainty about cost-effectiveness resulting from a single RCT is not pivotal for policy decisions and should only be used to determine whether additional research should be commissioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512465358">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774512465358">48</xref>]. Under this argument, policy decisions, to approve the intervention or not, should be based on the mean net benefit estimated from all the available evidence. Interventions that are probably, but not definitely, cost-effective could be approved, but subject to the caveat of ‘only in research’ or ‘approval with evidence development’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774512465358">49</xref>]. The implication of this is that clinical and economic sample size calculations for any RCT should be made with reference to what is already known about the decision problem and the cost and benefits of obtaining new evidence (i.e., value of information (VOI)). VOI sample size calculations have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774512465358">50</xref>]. However, they require intensive evidence synthesis and modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774512465358">51</xref>], currently beyond the resources of most trialists preparing grant applications. In our view, grant funders and reviewers should encourage trialists to quantify the extent to which their trial will resolve the key uncertainties about the costs and effects of interventions. In trials evaluating interventions where the key outcome is resource use (e.g., interventions to reduce hospital length of stay) or where the majority of costs and benefits will occur within the time frame of the trial (e.g., interventions for acute disease or cheap but potentially highly effective care), a power calculation based on economic end points could be required. For the more expensive trials, where existing evidence is already ‘rich’ or where the costs and benefits of intervention are likely to extend beyond the end of the trial, evidence synthesis and VOI calculations could optimize trial design or lead to a more appropriate research agenda.</p>

<sec id="section22-1740774512465358">
<title>Future directions</title>
<p>It is possible that some RCTs included in our review included economic sample size calculations at the design stage but did not report them in the publication. We believe that this is unlikely, but future research could explore this by examining protocols available in the trial registries. The elements required for a simple economic sample size calculation, frequentist or Bayesian, comprise the expected variances of and correlations between the costs and effects of both interventions, the societal willingness to pay for a QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512465358">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512465358">7</xref>]. One barrier to the incorporation of economic data in trial design is the lack of information on the variance and correlations of cost and QALYs. However, this hurdle could be reduced by routine use of feasibility or internal pilot studies to adapt trial design based on initial findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774512465358">52</xref>], for some trials, this would result in a trial better designed to answer key issues about cost-effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1740774512465358">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Economic evaluations conducted alongside RCTs are valuable, but often present policy makers with inconclusive and incomplete evidence. Less frequently, trial results also lead to discordant messages when the most effective intervention is probably not the most cost-effective. Despite methodological advances, trialists rarely explicitly assessed the extent to which their trial might resolve the key uncertainties about the cost-effectiveness of interventions. We recommend that grant funders should do more to encourage trialists to quantify the extent to which their trial will resolve the key uncertainties about the costs and effects of interventions, particularly when the majority of costs and benefits will occur within the time frame of the trial.</p>
