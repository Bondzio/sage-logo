<p>At 585 (relatively small-print) pages in length, comprising 38 chapters written by academics in 33 countries representing most regions of the world and based, for the most part, on 42 national journalist surveys, <italic>The Global Journalist in the 21st Century</italic>, it would be fair to say, is something of a collective <italic>magnum opus</italic>. This claim is not based on these impressive features alone, however, but also its steadfast empirical approach to the study of national journalists around the world. Thanks to the editors, David H. Weaver and Lars Willnat, and their cast of contributing authors, we are now all in a much stronger position to analyze, discuss and compare the current state of play of national journalisms, whether in respect of journalist demographics, the profession’s adherence to various norms, their shifting values and attitudes, or responses to changing news technologies and news organization in different national contexts. As highlighted below, there are many good things in this weighty volume, not least of which is the editors’ recruitment of academics from so many countries to analyze and account for the state of the journalism profession in their respective countries, as well as their efforts to encourage comparative analysis of the same.</p>
<p>This same approach nonetheless also betrays something of a conceptual myopia that gives rise to an evident misnomer in its title. Surprisingly, <italic>The Global Journalist in the 21st Century</italic> has very little to say about either global journalists or journalism practised in the contemporary global context. The ‘global’ in the field of journalism today, I would suggest, and contrary to the predominantly nationally focused and empirically disaggregated thrust of this volume, is about much more than the accumulation of analyses of different journalist professions in different countries around the world, or even comparative analyses based on the same. I’ll return to this conceptual myopia toward the ‘global’ in ‘global journalism’ presently, but first more on the book’s <italic>magnum opus</italic> qualities and its undoubted contribution to the field.</p>
<p>The book clearly states its ambitions and approach in the publisher’s opening summary page. ‘<italic>The Global Journalist in the 21st Century</italic>’, it states, ‘systematically assesses the demographics, education, socialization, professional attitudes and working conditions of journalists in various countries around the world’. And continues: ‘The book updates the original <italic>Global Journalist</italic> (1998) volume with new data, adding more than a dozen countries, and provides material on comparative research about journalists that will be useful to those interested in doing their own studies’ (p. i). This is a book with an empirical mission, clearly. And it is one cognizant of many of the changes impacting contemporary journalism, including ‘dwindling audiences, shrinking advertising revenues, reduced operating budgets, and fierce competition from new online media that have undermined the business structure of an entire industry’ (p. 1). It is in these ‘structural’ terms that the editors invite not only their 33 contributors but us, its readers, to address how these changes have ‘influenced the demographic composition of the profession and how they have affected the professional values and attitudes of journalists around the world’ (p. 1).</p>
<p>In substantial measure and within its own parameters, the book delivers on this promise across its 38 chapters. Eight chapters variously describe, analyze and evaluate journalism in eight different Asian countries; two do the same for Australia and New Zealand; 14 for 14 different European countries; two for North America; four for South America; and three for the Middle East (though none, disappointingly, for Africa). Invariably, each is based on statistically robust inventories of the contemporary character of national journalist professions. To take two at random. Chapter 13, ‘Media Professionals or Organizational Marionettes’ by Morten Skovsgaard, Erik Albæk, Peter Bro, and Claes de Vreese, delivers a wealth of empirical data about the demographic background and political and professional dispositions of Danish journalists. This includes, inter alia, their perceptions of journalist roles, the norm of objectivity, actual and ideal news selections, and professional autonomy and identified influential aspects in their work. Much of this holds intrinsic interest and equips the authors to reflect on the current state of Danish journalism, its demographics, norms and professed practices. Chapter 28, ‘Brazilian Journalists in the 21st Century’ by Heloiza Golbspan Herscovitz, in contrast, but no less interestingly, provides data broken down by different media sectors, statistically detailing, inter alia, demographic journalist profiles and job satisfaction, daily use of internet or computer resources, things journalists do online, their perceptions of blogs and perceived importance of different media roles, as well as views on Brazil’s current state of journalism. These and other chapters, then, provide an excellent resource of up-to-date, or at least fairly recent, statistics, mapping national journalism characteristics and current professional dispositions. They are, I would suggest, a useful starting point for any further study, whether quantitative or qualitative, of journalism practised in different national contexts.</p>
<p>The different chapters generally adopt a similar statistical approach, reviewing and documenting aggregate patterns of national journalist characteristics. Whether based on the author’s own original survey categories or those mined from available secondary sources, however, the findings and discussion are presented differently. This inevitably makes strict comparison and generalizations less than easy, though not impossible. Possibly aware of this limitation, the editors include a penultimate section, ‘Comparative Studies of Journalism’. Chapter 35, the first of these three chapters, is based on Thomas Hanitzsch’s own <italic>magnum opus</italic>, the ‘Worlds of Journalism’ project, which has involved a consortium of researchers from over 20 countries. Here this finds a summary appearance as ‘Worlds of Journalism: Journalistic Cultures, Professional Autonomy, and Perceived Influences across 18 Nations’, a comparative discussion co-authored remarkably by no less than 17 named authors. ‘Foreign Correspondents – An Endangered Species’, a chapter by the editor Lars Willnat and Jason Martin follows, pulling together previous research and seminal studies and arguing for renewed research in this critical area. Finally, in this section, Arejen Van Dalen and Peter Van Aelst empirically address how political journalists perceive their role and position in eight different western democracies in their chapter ‘Political Journalists: Covering Politics in the Democratic Corporatist System’, also founded on survey research.</p>
<p>The editors bring their impressive survey of journalism around the world to a close in a final conclusion that reinforces once again their commitment to their statistical and comparative national approach. Here they pull together different national threads and comment on possibly converging journalist characteristics and trends across nations, whilst also being careful to point to continuing national differences whether measured in terms of demographic profiles (age, gender, total numbers employed, marital status, minorities, college degree education, those majoring in journalism, etc.) or claimed adherence to different professional values, roles and other dispositions. In these ways, then, this book delivers a wealth of empirical findings and grounded commentaries based predominantly on national and, to a lesser extent, comparative multi-national surveys of journalism. As the editors comment, they find little evidence, by these means, of a trend toward a shared ‘culture of global journalism’ (p. 545).</p>
<p>And this returns us to the conceptual myopia mentioned earlier and implicit to the book’s approach to ‘the global journalist’. In an increasingly globalized age of interconnection, interdependency and shared threats we may want to ask how adequate or productive is it to regard ‘the global’ as simply the sum of national parts, including different national journalisms or journalist cultures found in different national contexts? The flows and formations of journalism, we know, increasingly extend beyond national frontiers and interpenetrate within today’s complex world news ecology. The professional frontiers of journalism are themselves becoming increasingly porous with the rise of new social media and citizen journalists injecting a flood of images and ideas from afar and sometimes directly (but also indirectly) informing mainstream news agendas and/or bypassing traditional gatekeepers. This new ferment in the field surely requires that we seek to map and explore, not only journalism’s demographics and continuing or changing commitments to different professional norms and values ‘contained’ within particular national contexts and imagined traditions, but also how journalism horizons may now also be on the move, infused by, but also contributing to, a more globalized awareness and outlook on events, processes and issues in the world today. This, it seems to me, is a ‘global journalist’ project worthy of our globalized times, but it is one that can easily become lost from view when approaching traditional journalist formations through a national cultural lens. What are the journalist practices and dispositions today that may exist both inside and outside of nationally conceived journalism formations and that could yet serve to address or deepen our understanding of our global age? To what extent and how do journalists help us to make sense of those breaking and routine news stories that speak to an interdependent and impacting world of interests and identities? How can and how should ‘global journalists’ help to recover and illuminate the complex interconnections and inequalities, causations and human consequences of living in a globalized world? To speak of the ‘global journalist’ today necessarily means conceptualizing and approaching journalism, its production, practices and performance, in globalizing context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884913479473">Cottle, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In an age of accelerating and interlocking global crises, whether those of economy, ecology or energy that intermittently and continuously disrupt life chances or, for some of the world’s 7 billion inhabitants, destroy the very chance of life itself, the ‘global journalist’ has a responsibility to recognize and report on global issues, their interdependencies and what’s at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884913479473">Cottle, 2009</xref>). This requires that journalism researchers, as well as some journalists, occasionally step outside of the conceptual prism that Ulrich Beck calls ‘methodological nationalism’ and begin to explore how journalism can yet contribute to a global awareness and political consciousness of the same. Here the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884913479473">Peter Berglez (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884913479473">2013</xref>) is of undoubted relevance and significance. Global journalism, suggests Berglez, ‘is the form of journalism needed in times of globalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884913479473">2008</xref>: 855); it is a journalism that does not simply invoke extensive geographical or global reach, but depends rather on the extent to which news, whether situated at local, national, international or transnational levels, becomes properly contextualized and explained in terms of wider and reciprocally interacting global social relations and contours of power. This is a necessary departure from the national or even nationally comparative focus of much contemporary scholarship today and throws up a host of methodological as well as conceptual challenges of its own. It is vitally necessary nonetheless.</p>
<p>There is no inherent reason of course why national surveys couldn’t also be put to work in exploring current and possibly changing journalist global horizons, in terms of how they currently conceive, and may yet conceive, the intertwining and interdependencies of critical world events. Climate change and recent financial meltdowns in the world’s economy, for example, are likely to be instructive barometers of how, over time and unfolding events, national reporting orientations may be forced to grapple with wider, impinging, global realities. Ethnographic studies of journalists at work and correspondents in the field are also no less needed if we are to meaningfully map contemporary journalist outlooks on global issues and critical events and better understand how journalist practices shape media representations and also become conditioned in practice. Recent work on the internally differentiated nature and forms of news reporting, including compelling stories ‘bearing witness’ to crises and humanitarian disasters around the globe, further suggests that journalism can, sometimes at least, both contribute to and express wider and historically shifting civil society norms of care and compassion when recognizing the world’s ‘others’. In such ways, journalism’s ‘thick’ cultural responses take place not only <italic>around</italic> the world, but are also practised and performed <italic>in</italic> the world and helping thereby to <italic>constitute</italic> it as an imagined co-habited place.</p>
<p>The possible rise of a more affective, emotionally infused public sphere(s) and emergence of a transnational civil society prepared to recognize and respond to the humanity of distant others, can also sometimes feature in and through forms of global journalism today, and does so as the news media become increasingly plugged into surrounding local-global communication networks and informed by transnational communication flows. It is in the midst of this journalistic flux and global context that the search for the ‘global journalist’ now needs to take place; and if we look hard enough and refocus our conceptual lenses we may even glimpse its emergent figure both in and above the world’s nations and news cultures.</p>
<p><italic>The Global Journalist in the 21st Century</italic>, then, provides an impressive assembly of national and nationally focused comparative studies and, in part, this approach can also contribute a useful empirical platform for the pursuit of the ‘global journalist’ practising ‘global journalism’ in different national contexts. In a rapidly globalizing and threat-filled world, however, it is now also necessary to redraw our research parameters and reconceptualize our understanding of ‘the global journalist’ if we are to ask and pursue pertinent questions more suited to our global age, its endemic challenges and journalist responses. To repeat, the global journalist can only properly come into view when conceptualized in globalized times.</p>
