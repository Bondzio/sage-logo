<p>In <italic>Darwin, Divinity and the Dance of the Cosmos</italic>, Bruce Sanguin brings together aspects of his personal experiences and intellectual learning to argue for the necessity of an ecological updating of Christian faith and practice. The current phase of Sanguin’s personal journey towards the embrace of green spirituality began in Milton, Ontario, when he was able to appreciate a well-crafted omelette with a sense of wondrous awe. Later, while making a spiritual retreat, reading Brian Swimme’s <italic>The Universe is a Green Dragon</italic> helped Sanguin to solidify connections amongst such awe, his seminary training and the new cosmology. Despite its title, <italic>Darwin, Divinity and the Dance of the Cosmos</italic> is much more influenced by cosmological spirituality inspired by the likes of Swimme, Thomas Berry and Matthew Fox than by Darwinian evolutionary theory. As such, while evolutionary consciousness is cited as an aspect of his programming for ecological updating, it is really cosmological consciousness that principally informs the monograph’s suggestions for a greener Christianity. To be sure, Sanguin’s suggestions are grounded in ecological concepts and in the Earth community. However, they also strive to foster an eco-spirituality based upon an understanding of humanity’s location within an enchanted universe that is itself in relationship as the “kin-dom” (rather than the kingdom) of God.</p>
<p>To support this relational model for updating Christianity, Sanguin brings into play what would be, save for his excellent prose, a bewildering number of authors and concepts. For instance, he builds a large portion of his case upon the concept of Sophia (Wisdom), which enters Judaism and, later, Christianity, through cross-cultural contact. The Wisdom tradition applied to the contemporary ecological crisis is used to imply the foolishness of biocide, which he understands as the “killing” of Earth and biological systems. He also references everything from gravity’s correlation with alluring love to the example of scuba divers freeing a humpback whale from crab nets being seen as acting as God’s children. Some of the connections Sanguin makes in this monograph are a bit tenuous, especially when, despite avowed support for a postmodern ethic of acceptance, he applies theories in ways their originators never intended, and shades peoples’ experiences outside of categories to which they would themselves subscribe. Additionally, perhaps as part and parcel of the price paid for crafting an accessible book, <italic>Darwin, Divinity and the Dance of the Cosmos </italic>is rather under-referenced by academic standards, making it difficult to discern where and when Sanguin might be moving beyond creative synthesis towards a more unique contribution to scholarship in the area of Christianity and Ecology.</p>
<p>Despite such tensions, Sanguin successfully illustrates aspects of the integration of evolutionary cosmological consciousness in his daily life, including examples arising from his frequently referenced practice of Bikram Yoga and his work as a United Church minister at Vancouver’s Canadian Memorial Church and Centre for Peace. In the end, this connection to the material, his sharing of personal anecdotes and the practical suggestions growing from his ministry will likely combine to leave the reader with the impression that Sanguin is genuinely committed to participating in an ecological updating of Christianity. It is ultimately this feature of <italic>Darwin, Divinity and the Dance of the Cosmos</italic>, along with its accessible prose, that is well poised to hold the interest of both general readers and students assigned this text as part of coursework dealing with issues at the intersection of Christianity and Ecology. In the latter context, Sanguin’s book would be particularly useful for introducing the subject matter of green Christian spirituality because the breadth of <italic>Darwin, Divinity and the Dance of the Cosmos</italic> is well suited to fostering classroom conversation and will give an instructor numerous points of entry to discuss convergent and divergent suggestions for an ecological updating of Christianity.</p>
