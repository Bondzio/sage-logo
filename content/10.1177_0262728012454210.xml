<p>This book is an immensely useful reader, primarily for all those interested in the history of the British Raj and the disinformation and repression dynamics functional to the Imperial aims of control and exploitation. But there is much more to this somewhat exoticised phenomenon. The so-called ‘Thuggee Campaign’ of the 19th century exemplifies how a local and quite marginal phenomenon can be exaggerated and given virtually global media exposure in order to exploit it for several different socio-political purposes.</p>
<p>Victorian literature quickly became obsessed with the nature of crime and the image of ‘the thug’ provided a perfect character: heinous, abominable, exotic enough to shock and disturb the Victorian mind. India, close to becoming the shining Jewel of the Crown, was home to the merciless, barbaric, blood-driven cult of a murderous Goddess, worshippend by half-naked and blood-thirsty stranglers.</p>
<p>It seems now that the pan-Indian conspiracy against Civilisation and the British Raj was a fantasy of Imperial intelligence. In reality ‘thuggee’ was probably closer to a widely extended phenomenon of banditism, spreading mainly from areas of political and economic unrest after the dissolution of pre-Raj states and societies. Drawing parallels with some of today’s insurgencies all over India may not be unreasonable. It is well known that many of the so-called thugs were former mercenaries once fighting for local overlords, now resorting to the murderous life of the highwayman because of the changing political landscape. Current scholarship might, then, even link this to increasingly fashionable discussions of post-conflict reconstruction. Though religious affiliation to some temple is not to be excluded, the social analysis of the thugs reveal a multitude of people coming from different religious backgrounds, undermining the idea of a definable religious practice <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>As noted by C. Ginzburg in his famous works on witch-craft and witch-trials, since we have no words or documents from the apprehended and subsequently hanged thugs, we are forced to rely only on the words and evidence of their prosecutors. The thugs are, nonetheless, speaking through the lines written about them: Glimpses and echoes of their voices can be found between the lines of Sleeman’s famous reports or through the pages of <italic>Confessions of a Thug</italic>. Due to the absence of the thugs themselves, in their own words, we can only have hints of the real nature of the phenomenon. But, in the process of studying this, we become aware of the dynamics of creation, use and abuse of ideas of crime, and of criminals to be prosecuted and eradicated: the permanent temptation of Power.</p>
<p>Wagner’s anthology collects a wide range of sources, from pre-colonial accounts and poems to judicial documents from the trials and the press, police reports and fictional works. The first section (‘Thuggee in Pre-colonial India’) brings together early accounts taken from Indian literature and European travellers’ memories. The following sections (‘The Discovery of Thuggee’ and ‘The Anti-Thuggee Campaign of the 1830s’) depict in rich detail the ‘classic’ thug paradigm, as seen through the eyes of western popular culture, administration and repression apparatuses. The last section is probably the most useful, collecting and presenting several academic excerpts highlighting the debate on the nature of ‘the Thuggee’ from the 1950s to the most recent years. Post-modern, post-colonial theories and socio-political analyses inspired by Hobsbawm’s works on social bandits and by Said’s <italic>Orientalism</italic> show the thuggee phenomenon in a different light, and analysis from several points of view becomes possible.</p>
<p>The work under review seems to collect materials used by Wagner to write a previous book, <italic>Thuggee: Banditry and the British in Early Nineteenth-Century India</italic> (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007). In that book, for the first time, the author tried to bridge the gap between representation and reality of such a controversial phenomenon. The current study thus serves well as a companion volume to Wagner’s previous book and gives everyone the opportunity to access a wider range of relevant readings, each properly contextualised. Historical, literary and ideological dimensions of ‘the Thuggee’ are here interwoven, as they were and are in real life. Since the debate about this phenomenon continues, historiographers, students and scholars of Indian or South Asian history will find in this book a very useful compendium of sources addressing the many facets of this intriguing phenomenon, which lies somewhere between reality, meaning and representation.</p>
