            <p>Graves’ disease is an autoimmune syndrome with symptoms such as tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and psychiatric symptoms. Limited evidence exists for the treatment of Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis with atypical antipsychotics. A 47-year-old female with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder presented for the first time to the psychiatric hospital. She was agitated and grossly psychotic with delusions. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Drug screen urinalysis was negative. Endocrine workup resulted in a diagnosis of Graves’ disease (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: 0.005 μIU/mL, triiodothyronine [T3]: 537 ng/dL, thyroxine [T4]: 24 mcg/dL, free T4: 4.5 ng/dL, positive antithyroid peroxidase antibody, and antinuclear antibody). Aripiprazole 10 mg daily was initiated and titrated to 15 mg daily on day 4. On day 16, her suspicious behavior, judgment, and insight improved. Other medications given included aspirin 325 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg twice daily, titrated to 12.5 mg twice daily, and methimazole 30 mg daily, titrated to 20 mg twice daily, and discontinued on day 29. The patient received radioiodine I-131 treatment 1 week later. We report the first known case on the use of aripriprazole to treat Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis. Further studies examining the long-term effects and appropriate dose and duration of aripiprazole in this patient population are needed.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Graves’ disease is an autoimmune syndrome that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, affecting approximately 1% to 3% of the general population.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451934">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451934">2</xref>
            </sup> Common symptoms may include atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. However, psychiatric manifestations, such as mania or psychosis, may occur.</p>
         <p>Available evidence regarding the use of antipsychotics to treat Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis is limited. No published data exist on the use of aripriprazole to treat Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis. Accordingly, we report the first known case in which symptoms of Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis gradually improved with treatment of aripiprazole.</p>
         <sec id="section2-0897190012451934">
            <title>Case Report</title>
            <p>A 47-year-old Russian female with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder (diagnosis date unknown) presented for the first time to the psychiatric hospital with bizarre behavior and psychotic symptoms. Her husband reported religious delusions which led to smearing feces on walls of their home. Her medical history included congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and hyperthyroidism. Five months prior to admission, the patient was hospitalized at another institution due to exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Upon discharge, she was prescribed oral medications, including methimazole 20 mg 3 times daily, allopurinol 100 mg daily, haloperidol 1 mg 3 times daily, benztropine 1 mg twice daily, metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, digoxin 0.125 mg daily, and diltiazem 90 mg 3 times daily. However, the patient reported discarding all medications when she arrived home and refused follow-up care. After admission to the inpatient psychiatric unit, patient was agitated, responding to internal stimuli, and grossly psychotic with paranoid, persecutory, grandiose, and religious delusions.</p>
            <p>Patient’s physical examination at admission revealed tachycardia at 108 beats/min, goiter, and bilateral exophthalmus. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Drug screen urinalysis was negative. Thyroid tests were abnormal (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]: 0.005 μIU/mL, triiodothyronine [T3]: 537 ng/dL, thyroxine [T4]: 24 mcg/dL, and free T4: 4.5 ng/dL) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody and antinuclear antibody were positive. Thyroid uptake scan showed enlarged thyroid with diffusely increased activity and elevated radioactive iodine uptake of 68.5%. After an endocrinology and cardiology consultation, a diagnosis of Graves’ disease was established.</p>
            <p>The patient was hospitalized for a total of 43 days. On day 2 of admission, oral aripiprazole 10 mg daily was initiated and titrated to 15 mg daily on day 4 for psychotic symptoms. Within 10 days of treatment, symptoms of paranoia and delusions were less prominent. Her thought process changed from disorganized to organized and linear. She was cooperative, although her judgment and insight were still poor, and she remained withdrawn and suspicious toward the staff and peers. On day 16, her suspicious behavior, judgment, and insight improved. However, she continued to deny any physical or psychiatric illness.</p>
            <p>Patient presented with atrial fibrillation secondary to her hyperthyroidism. Consequently, she received aspirin 325 mg daily on day 4. Additionally, metoprolol 25 mg twice daily was initiated and then tapered to 12.5 mg twice daily on day 38. Methimazole 30 mg daily was initiated, and on day 23 free T4 was 2.68 ng/dL. Methimazole was titrated to 20 mg twice daily on day 25 for the management of Graves’ disease and then discontinued on day 29. Interdisciplinary consultation recommended thyroid ablation with radioiodine I-131 as a therapeutic approach 7 days later. The patient was discharged on day 43 with a recommendation for follow-up at endocrinology, psychiatric, and nuclear medicine clinics.</p>
            <p>The discharge diagnosis for this patient included psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified, probably secondary to uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. Her psychotic symptoms improved throughout her hospitalization after the start of aripiprazole and management of Graves’ disease. Upon discharge (6 weeks after admission), she was calm, well-oriented, and conversing coherently, without delusions or bizarre behavior. Discharge medications included oral aripiprazole 15 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 mg daily, and aspirin 325 mg daily.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>There are currently no studies investigating the use of aripiprazole in patients with psychotic manifestations due to Graves’ disease. However, a review of the literature found case reports of the use of other antipsychotics for the treatment of this disorder. In a case reported by Mahmood et al, a 25-year-old male with no prior history of psychiatric illness, diagnosed with Graves’ disease, subsequently experienced acute psychotic symptoms, including paranoid ideations, as well as visual and auditory hallucinations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451934">3</xref>
            </sup> These symptoms resolved after the use of risperidone 1 mg twice daily, along with metoprolol extended release 50 mg daily, and methimazole, which was added and titrated to 20 mg daily. Initially, he was noncompliant with his medications and endocrinologist follow-up. However, he later took his medications and agreed to follow-up with an endocrinologist for a subtotal thyroidectomy. The dose of risperidone was gradually decreased by 0.5 mg/month and discontinued after 3 months with no recurrence of psychotic symptoms. Adverse effects and time frame of when psychotic symptoms improved were not reported.</p>
         <p>A second study reported a 40-year-old woman with Graves’ disease and psychotic symptoms including psychomotor agitation, paranoia, and auditory hallucinations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451934">4</xref>
            </sup> She was treated with haloperidol (4-8 mg/d intravenously or oral), lorazepam (1-2 mg/d), along with propylthiouracil 1200 mg/d, saturated solution of potassium iodide 200 mg/d, and dexamethasone 4 mg/d. She was diagnosed with Graves’ disease 5 years earlier, which was in remission after thyroid treatment. The patient’s psychotic symptoms improved with treatment on day 3 and fully resolved after 2 weeks, except for occasional insomnia. After discharge, she remained in a euthyroid state and refused the recommended radioiodine I-131 therapy. Limitations include unspecified total treatment dose, duration, and adverse effects with haloperidol, as well as unclear psychiatric illness prior to this episode.</p>
         <p>Finally, chlorpromazine 75 mg 3 times daily, along with carbimazole (dose not specified), and propranolol 40 mg was effectively used in 2 female patients diagnosed with thyroid crisis and experiencing psychotic symptoms.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451934">5</xref>
            </sup> Prior to treatment, 1 patient had suspiciousness, paranoia, and was internally preoccupied, while the other patient presented with flight of ideas, agitation, and disoriented to time and place. Both patients had no prior psychiatric history. Their psychiatric symptoms improved on day 5, and the antipsychotic was tapered when the patients reached a euthyroid state.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451934">5</xref>
            </sup> Duration of treatment with chlorpromazine was not clearly specified in the study. Additionally, adverse effects were not reported.</p>
         <p>Our patient was similar to previous case reports in that she presented with symptoms of hyperthyroidism along with psychotic symptoms. According to patient history, this is the first psychiatric admission probably secondary to her untreated Graves’ disease. Furthermore, in the above cases, patients’ response to antipsychotics occurred within 3 days to 2 weeks, which is similar to our patient’s response, which occurred within 10 days of aripiprazole treatment.</p>
         <p>Despite the previous evidence regarding antipsychotics for treatment of Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis, we selected aripiprazole due to its lower propensity to induce weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Among the second-generation antipsychotics available on the hospital formulary, aripiprazole and ziprasidone are the medications least likely to cause weight gain. However, ziprasidone has the potential to cause cardiovascular adverse effects.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451934">6</xref>
            </sup> Since our patient was obese (body mass index [BMI]: 32.7) and had cardiac risk factors, the selected treatment choice for her was aripiprazole. Also, reasons for avoiding the first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) were to reduce the risk of developing movement disorders, possible cardiovascular complications, and worsening of cognitive functioning. Additionally, selecting a medication with once daily administration was also an important determining factor in order to ensure better adherence to treatment.</p>
         <p>After personal communication with the patient, 1 month after discharge, she reports to be compliant with aripiprazole with no side effects. However, one limitation of our case is the lack of the latest thyroid laboratory tests to evaluate the status of her hyperthyroidism, since she also reports having no follow-up with the endocrinologist. As seen with most of these patients, noncompliance with medication and follow-up treatment seems to be a major concern, and health professionals should emphasize even more counseling in that regard to avoid future relapse and complications.</p>

      <sec id="section4-0897190012451934">
         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>In conclusion, aripiprazole may be a potentially effective treatment option for patients presenting with hyperthyroidism or Graves’ disease with psychosis. Additionally, it may be the best option among other antipsychotics for patients who are obese and concurrently have cardiac symptoms related to Graves’ disease. We presented a successful case of Graves’ disease with psychosis treated with aripiprazole; however, further studies are needed to determine whether treatment outcomes with aripiprazole shown in our patient can be generalized to other individuals with Graves’ hyperthyroidism-induced psychosis in conjunction with thyroid medication or alone. Additionally, studies should examine the long-term effects and appropriate dose and duration of aripiprazole in this patient population.</p>
