<abstract>
<p>This study's main impetus stems from an article by Brevard S. Childs published in 1971, ‘Psalm Titles and Midrashic Exegesis’, which offered an erudite examination of Psalm titles and argued for their exegetical character. After a brief overview of some of the traditional approaches to Psalm 127's superscription (especially its ‘Solomonic’ portion) throughout its history of interpretation, this study concludes that Psalm 127's ‘Solomonic’ superscription invites a hearing of the psalm within the context of the Davidic dynasty. The concluding section also suggests some possible implications of this hearing in light of Psalm 127's inclusion among the Psalms of Ascent.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>There is much one could do with Psalm 127. A casual perusal of just the most recent history of its interpretation indicates that this relatively short text has attracted a wide range of hermeneutical inquiry, whether textual, compositional, form-critical, or historical-critical. Moreover, such studies are occasionally undertaken while concomitantly integrating Psalm 127 at various levels of literary association within the final form of the Psalter as a whole; its centrality among the Psalms of Ascent, location within book V, and overarching relationship with psalms outside of book V, for example, are matters of increasing attention.</p>
<p>What is not typically emphasized, however, beyond a few passing references out of due acknowledgment for the text's received form, is what kind of <italic>exegetical</italic> function, if any, the psalm's ‘Solomonic’ superscription (‭ﬣמלשל‬) might have.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212466465">1</xref></sup> Perhaps this is rightfully so. But the following study seeks to reevaluate the issue, particularly with regard to some of Psalm 127's recurring interpretive difficulties, by examining how its superscription may function hermeneutically in relation to its text without compromising its individual integrity or canonical location.</p>
<p>After briefly engaging various aspects of the history of interpreting Psalm 127's title, this study seeks to offer specific focus on any hermeneutical value of that rare (the only other superscripted mentioning of Solomon is in Ps. 72) heading and explore how it may facilitate a multilevel understanding of some otherwise ambiguous features of the text. Such endeavors aim toward a kind of theological cohesion at both the individual and associative levels of the text as received in its final form.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this study is structured in two main sections: a reevaluation of the nature of a superscription, and the offering of a ‘Solomonic’ interpretation of Psalm 127. Some concluding remarks will summarize the discussion and provide possible implications for future psalm exegesis. As will hopefully be demonstrated, the following study advances the thesis that <italic>the ‘Solomonic’ portion of the superscription provides a context for hearing Psalm 127 in light of the Davidic dynasty.</italic></p>

</list>
<p>Before rushing headlong into psalm superscriptions, perhaps a few introductory remarks concerning the text of Psalm 127 are in order. As regards literary structure, that a clear break or sharp transition of some kind exists between vv. 1–2 and 3–5 is fairly certain and readily acknowledged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212466465">3</xref></sup> What to make of the relationship between the two parts of this so-called Wisdom Psalm, however, remains the dominant compositional question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212466465">4</xref></sup> If, as Briggs contended, these two textual units have ‘no manner of connection in thought’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212466465">5</xref></sup> why might vv. 1–2 and vv. 3–5 have been positioned as we now have them? Did vv. 3–5 offer a kind of response to vv. 1–2, as Estes contended?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212466465">6</xref></sup> Or was there ‘a unity that transcends the apparently different subject matter’, as Miller posited?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212466465">7</xref></sup> Such questions, as will be seen later, ought to reverberate in the mind preparatorily as one examines the history of interpreting Psalm 127's superscription.</p>
<p>It would be traveling far from the truth to claim that psalm titles have been overlooked by interpreters <italic>as such.</italic> From the hand of fourth-century Cappadocian Father Gregory of Nyssa, for example, we possess an absolutely fascinating treatise dealing with such inscriptions and their many related topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212466465">8</xref></sup> Another work in the same ballpark comes from Athanasius (<italic>De titulis Psalmorum)</italic>, and belief in their inspiration can be pinpointed all the way back to Hippolytus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212466465">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the Antiochenes, such as Theodore, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Diodore in particular, however, did not follow all this positivity so favorably. Because the Psalter as a whole was, in their judgment, lost during the Babylonian captivity and rediscovered in piecemeal fashion, psalm titles were merely meager editorial efforts to provide a historical setting for each psalm. Such attempts were, as a result, deemed by some to be more obscuring than clarifying. Theodoret, for example, thought that Psalm 127 received its heading ‘because it was a work of Solomon that was being restored’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212466465">10</xref></sup> Chrysostom offered no comment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212466465">11</xref></sup> In the end, psalm titles were a multifaceted difficulty for the Antiochenes: they did not generally seem to fit the subject matter of the psalms, chronological agreement was incoherent, and an enormous amount of psalms lacked titles in the first place (to say nothing of the <sc>lxx</sc> divergences of adding references to David and names like Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, and Zechariah).</p>
<p>Even so, most interpreters throughout the history of interpretation honored an integrity of at least some kind for superscriptions as received in the final form of the Psalter. Authorship was by far the most common pre-critical understanding (Luther, Calvin, sixteenth-century Rabbi Moshe ben Chayim Alshech<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212466465">12</xref></sup>), followed by conjectured authorship,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212466465">13</xref></sup> followed by viewing the title as a dedicatory or admonitory notation (i.e. ‘to’ Solomon, written by David or otherwise, a view traceable to the Syriac Psalter). This last understanding was the thinking of Matthew Henry,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212466465">14</xref></sup> for example, as well as eleventh-century Rabbi Shlomo Itzhaki (‘Rashi’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212466465">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It seems that Hengstenberg and Alexander (mid-nineteenth century) were some of the last Psalms scholars to contend any <italic>historical</italic> value to at least the ‘Solomonic’ portion of Psalm 127's superscription,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212466465">16</xref></sup> before a much more critical view toward them engulfed a majority of late-nineteenth and early/mid-twentieth-century scholarship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212466465">17</xref></sup> The latter period, especially, generally viewed the superscription as guesswork based on the content of the psalm's text and as otherwise unimportant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212466465">18</xref></sup> Remnants of this attitude of irrelevancy can be traced to contemporary times, as many published prayerbooks and ‘pocket’ Psalters, such as that of the Gideons, omit the superscriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212466465">19</xref></sup> In this way, the Psalms tend to become ‘existentialized’, transcending a context of covenantal relationship between Y<sc>hwh</sc> and Israel. In any case, what a peppered examination of the history of interpreting Psalm 127's superscription shows is that it has been accorded little to no <italic>hermeneutical</italic> value for understanding the text of the psalm, especially in matters of composition.</p>
<p>In 1971 Brevard S. Childs brought remarkable clarity to the discussion by reexamining the form of psalm titles in light of other superscripted biblical texts throughout the Old Testament (e.g. Exod. 15.1; 2 Sam. 22.1; Josh. 10.12; and Isa. 38.9, which is strikingly similar to the form of a psalm title). These expressions, which are typically found introducing poetic texts into mainstream narrative, serve in Childs's view ‘to modify the impression of a necessary temporal sequence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212466465">20</xref></sup> In other words, one would be provided a distinct perspective from the plain narrative in which to understand the text being introduced, or a <italic>secondary setting</italic> for interpretation.</p>
<p>This would be highly significant for the study of psalm titles, Childs convincingly argued, because ‘Psalm titles do not appear to reflect independent historical tradition but are the result of an exegetical activity which derived its material from within the text itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212466465">21</xref></sup> In this way, the titles were not meant to provide concrete historical location or temporality but were more <italic>associative</italic> in nature, connecting the text of a particular psalm to an account found elsewhere in the canon and, one might speculate from this, perhaps resolving some issues which may arise while hearing a particular psalm. As opposed to a more historically oriented understanding, the superscriptions, according to Childs, belong to a general midrashic activity of making literary associations, further developed in the <sc>lxx</sc> and at Qumran. ‘History has retained its importance’, Childs concludes, ‘but in the transformed state of being canonical history’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212466465">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crucial to mention at this point, because the Psalter exhibits a kind of pristine form in its finality, is that a midrashic attachment of a psalm to David, for example, while providing a context for hearing, <italic>neither detaches the psalm from its canonical location nor exhausts the psalm's potential meaning.</italic> Not granting any hermeneutical value to a superscription does not, of course, nullify a psalm's inherent potentiality to communicate truth, nor does the integrating of Psalm 127's superscription remove the psalm from its central positioning among the Psalms of Ascent (Pss. 120–134). Indeed, a multileveled reading, also advocated and discussed by Childs in another context,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212466465">23</xref></sup> can be facilitated by both the very nature of a psalm's superscription and its canonical context. In the case of Psalm 127, perhaps Zenger's remarks are most pertinent: ‘the ascription of Psalm 127 to Solomon gives the Psalm text itself an additional sensory dimension, one which impregnates not only all of Psalm 127 but the whole collection of Psalms 120–134’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212466465">24</xref></sup> Thus, both superscription and canonical context can be hermeneutically relevant, as they each sound a distinct note across the final arrangement and presentation of a psalm's text.</p>
<p>To summarize: understood as Scripture, a psalm's superscription has been honored in various ways throughout its history of interpretation. While some contend a more historically oriented function (authorial, dedicatory, or otherwise), Brevard Childs demonstrated how a superscription may provide an associative, secondary context in which a psalm may be heard. In the case of Psalm 127, I am labeling that context ‘Solomonic’, of which an elucidation follows.</p>

<title>3. Toward a ‘Solomonic’ Interpretation</title>
<p>What remains for our purposes is determining exactly how Psalm 127's superscription (‭ﬣמלשל‬ ‭ﬨולﬠמﬣ‬ ‭ריש‬) may function hermeneutically in relation to the text of the psalm itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212466465">25</xref></sup> While several thoroughgoing studies have been done on the first half of Psalm 127's superscription (‭ﬨולﬠמﬣ‬ ‭ריש‬),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212466465">26</xref></sup> a phrase found atop every other psalm title among the Psalms of Ascent (Pss. 120–134), how might one understand the role of the ‘Solomonic’ portion?</p>
<p>As seen from a brief sweeping survey of the history of interpretation, Psalm 127 has certainly been understood at different levels and explicated for distinct historical circumstances. On a plain sense level, the text first speaks about divine sovereignty. Unless the L<sc>ord</sc> wills something to happen, no amount of ‘anxious toil’ on the part of humankind will accomplish it. Sleep is a gift for the beloved, as are children (or ‘sons’; see below), and whoever has a quiver full of the latter is described as ‘blessed’ and will not be ashamed. In the words of Crow, on one level, ‘The entire Psalm seems to be concerned only with local, individual and family prosperity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212466465">27</xref></sup> So far, so good. But when one turns to scriptural texts describing the words and actions of Solomon (chiefly 1 Kgs 2–11), the text of Psalm 127 receives new light.</p>
<p>As is well known, Davidic kingship is grounded in the fact that ‘the L<sc>ord</sc> will make [David] a house' (2 Sam. 7.11; <sc>esv</sc>), ‘and with [the L<sc>ord</sc>'s] blessing shall the house of [David] be blessed forever' (v. 29). Psalmsists address this foundational promise quite explicitly (Pss. 18.50; 132.11), even, at times, despairingly (Ps. 89.3–4, 20–37). While it is understandably natural, in light of the superscription, to associate immediately the ‘house’ of v. 1 with Solomon's earthly temple, a closer examination of the Solomon narrative texts of 1 Kings 2–11 reveals levels of correspondence with Psalm 127 that might suggest an additional understanding.</p>
<p>The reader of 1 Kings 2 is informed no fewer than three times that the accession of Solomon to kingship was the very establishment of the throne of David (1 Kgs 2.12, 24, 45). Already in 1 Kgs 2.12, the narrator concludes the death of David with the statement that ‘Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established’, which is also repeated in <italic>inclusio</italic> fashion at the conclusion of the chapter (1 Kgs 2.46). Achish, king of Gath, spoke in a similar way (‘King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the L<sc>ord</sc> forever' [1 Kgs 2.45]), and, intriguingly, Solomon himself spoke of his own enthronement in relation to the ‘house’ sworn to David <italic>before the temple was recorded as having been built.</italic> In 1 Kgs 2.24, Solomon swears to the L<sc>ord</sc>, ‘who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, <italic>and who has made me a house, as he promised’.</italic> Thus, at least canonically, the texts of 1 Kings 2 make it quite clear that the ‘house’ is established precisely at the accession of Solomon to the throne, <italic>before</italic> we learn of Solomon building an actual temple. This is further confirmed in Solomon's extremely pivotal prayer to the L<sc>ord</sc> for wisdom in 1 Kings 3: ‘You have kept for [David] this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day’ (v. 6; cf. 2 Chron. 6.16).</p>
<p>To be sure, Solomon also understood the building of the physical temple to be fulfillment of the ‘house’ promised to David (1 Kgs 5.5; 8.20), which later generations would also attribute to him (2 Chron. 35.3; cf. Acts 7.47). Even so, as much as the ‘house’ could be understood as the temple, the narrativity of 1 Kings 2–3 does not seem to separate the two. Also, after the temple was constructed, the prophet Ahijah spoke similarly to Jeroboam: ‘[The L<sc>ord</sc>] will be with you and will build you a sure house, <italic>as [he] built for David</italic>, and [he] will give Israel to you' (1 Kgs 11.38). In light of this, one may understand the ‘house’ of Ps. 127.1, in light of the superscription, as <italic>either the temple or the Davidic lineage.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212466465">28</xref></sup> And, certainly, these two understandings are not mutually exclusive either: ‘Solomon's ascent to the throne and the building of the Temple are viewed in this prayer as God's reward to David’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212466465">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the story does not end there. One must still account for the second half of Psalm 127. As Miller rightfully notes concerning the psalm's final form, ‘placing the picture one has from vv. 3–5 after vv. 1–2 leads to a hearing and understanding of the second part of the Psalm in the light of the first’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089212466465">30</xref></sup> But, in light of the superscription and their seeming disparateness, how do the messages of each half correspond?</p>
<p>Fleming sought to answer this with a linguistic study of v. 1's pairing of ‘house’ with ‘city’, concluding that ‘the meaning of the entire Psalm turns to a great degree upon the definition of these terms in this context’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089212466465">31</xref></sup> Several other studies, in order to understand any coherence in Psalm 127, leaned toward procreation as one's best source of future security (whether militaristic or judicial).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089212466465">32</xref></sup> While there are certainly elements of truthfulness in these interpretations (especially if Ps. 127 is read together with Ps. 128, as Viviers and others rightfully urge<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089212466465">33</xref></sup>), the superscription, in light of directing the reader to the associative texts from 1 Kings examined above, can serve <italic>supplementally</italic> to link together the Davidic ‘house’ with its very ‘sons’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089212466465">34</xref></sup> In other words, <italic>the ‘sons’ of v. 3 are precisely what constitute the very ‘house’ of v. 1, and both are elements of which Solomon is an immediate fulfillment.</italic> Not by the toiling of Absalom or Adonijah or anyone else would someone other than whom the L<sc>ord</sc> wills usurp the throne, but it would be Solomon who embodied the continuation of the Davidic house. In the words of David via the Chronicler, ‘of all my sons (for the L<sc>ord</sc> has given me many sons) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the L<sc>ord</sc> over Israel' (1 Chron. 28.5). The other sons, as it would turn out, would one day acknowledge this too (1 Chron. 29.24). In this sense it is feasible, in fact, with guidance from the superscription, that the ‘blessed man’ (‭רבגﬣ‬ ‭ירשא‬) in Psalm 127 who has a quiver full of sons (v. 5) would bring to mind <italic>David himself</italic>, the recipient of the divine promise of kingship in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089212466465">35</xref></sup> The Davidic dynasty would be in the hands of the God of Israel, and because of it, no Israelite should be ashamed to ‘speak with his enemies at the gate’ (127.5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0309089212466465">
<title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>In light of the preceding observations from the ‘Solomonic’ narrative texts, it seems most reasonable to conclude that <italic>the ‘Solomonic’ superscription provides a context for hearing Psalm 127 in light of the Davidic dynasty.</italic> While placing a <italic>Davidic</italic> superscription over the text of Psalm 127 may likewise connect the reader to such promised divine realities, a ‘Solomonic’ superscription serves the purpose while emphasizing the very continuation of the Davidic lineage. Far from the conclusion of Allen, that ‘The modern reader of Psalm 127 finds himself detached from its cultural setting and so perchance from its message’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089212466465">36</xref></sup> the superscription itself provides a biblical context in which to hear the psalm's text, and a very foundational and permeative one at that. A direct corollary of this effect, seen especially in a psalm supposed to consist of two contrasting halves, is that <italic>the superscription also plays a crucial role in understanding Psalm 127's cohesiveness</italic>: both portions resonate with the same royal promise.</p>
<p>So far as I can tell, only Mays has urged the likelihood of this sort of reading for Psalm 127, yet he argued for such perspective (quite rightfully so) in light of Psalm 127's wider context among the Psalms of Ascent instead of, as argued here, strictly on the basis of the superscription.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089212466465">37</xref></sup> In my judgment, Mays's conclusions coincide quite nicely with those reached here. Both superscription and canonical context are not, as noted above, mutually exclusive interpretive contexts. And while it is beyond the scope of this study to delve too deeply into the discussion of the overall structure and coherence of the Psalms of Ascent as a group,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089212466465">38</xref></sup> adding the ‘Solomonic’ portion to Psalm 127's superscription for the purpose of recalling the Davidic dynasty would be especially pertinent in a collection of psalms many scholars have understood to be formulated in a postexilic context, potentially in the midst of despair over both the temple and the apparent discontinuity within the Davidic dynasty (cf. Ps. 89).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089212466465">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the lead of Childs, the study of individual psalms with superscripted contents may benefit by the facilitating of inner-biblical, associative readings. Interestingly enough, a recent study on Psalm 72 (containing the only other ‘Solomonic’ superscription in the Psalter) sought to explain its existence on the basis of what the author labeled as ‘theological’ reasons. To quote a brief section of the study:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By placing Solomon's Psalm after a series of Psalms of David, the canonical final editor wanted to signify with this last subscript in 72,20 that the Psalms about David's conflict had reached their <italic>end</italic> objective… Solomon is the end of the drama of David as a person that began in 3,1. Absalom was the wrong son, who rebelled against his father (3,1). That represented the greatest crisis of David's Messianic kingship… Ps. 72 announces the victory in the crisis through the fact that Solomon, as the alternative son of David (and Bathsheba), sits instead of Absalom on the royal throne.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089212466465">40</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Could it be that the superscription to Psalm 127 was added in light of understanding the function of Psalm 72's ‘Solomonic’ superscription in the way suggested by Koorevaar? Following this line of thought, Solomon reemerges, dead center among the Psalms of Ascent, to redirect the group to the dynasty promised long ago. Wrestling with an apparently neglected Davidic kingship, unsurprising while sitting captive ‘alongside the waters of Babylon’, meant wrestling with much deeper issues of divine providence. Adding ‘Solomon’ to Psalm 127 would, in this sense, be <italic>a reassertion of God's own kingship</italic>, reemphasizing the very loyalty and justice once seriously called into question (so Ps. 89) by indicating that Solomon has not been forgotten precisely as representative of fulfilled royal promises. In the context of the Psalms of Ascent, finally, this would suggest that <italic>postexilic ‘ascent’ would be grounded in monarchial ‘ascent’</italic>, standing firmly on the old promises of God yet hearing the same in new and unexpected ways while pilgrimaging not to the (destroyed) temple but to fulfillments of God's steadfast love and faithfulness as recorded elsewhere in the canon. In sum, honoring the hermeneutical value of a psalm's superscription enables one to hear more voices of Scripture's wide-ranging choir.</p>

At issue is, primarily, the apparent Aramaism (and <italic>hapax legomenon)</italic> of <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> instead of the expected <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> for ‘sleep’. In addition, how one should render the <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> (‘so’/‘thus’/‘for’) has also led to wide divergence. The <italic>BHS</italic> offers textual variants for both issues: two medieval manuscripts have <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig4.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> (which the <sc>lxx</sc> followed) instead of <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>, and several medieval manuscripts ‘corrected’ the apparent Aramaism noted above with the Hebrew <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>. A thoroughgoing article of the debate was published in 1974 by J.A. Emerton, who noted several options for the first word of the phrase and insisted that the initial <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> could reasonably be <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig4.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> without significant difficulty. For the last word of the phrase, Emerton leaned on the basis of Ugaritic discoveries and posited the root <italic>šānāh</italic> meaning ‘high estate’ or ‘honour’ to conclude that the entire phrase should be translated, ‘Surely [or, if <italic>ki</italic> is read, For] he [i.e. God] gives high estate, or honour, to him whom he loves’ (’The Meaning of <italic>šēnāʾ</italic> in Psalm CXXVII 2’, <italic>VT</italic> 24 [1974], pp. 15–31 [30]). Mitchell Dahood, whose translation of this quandary in his Anchor Bible Psalms commentary (‘But the Reliable gives prosperity to his beloved’) was critiqued heavily by Emerton's proposal, quickly responded the following year with strong disagreement to Emerton's ‘overlong article’ by noting that Emerton's attraction to the Ugaritic <italic>šānāh</italic> is ‘precarious’ and faults him for offering ‘not a word to explain how the final <italic>aleph</italic> got into <italic>šēnāʾ</italic>’ (‘The <italic>aleph</italic> in Psalm CXXVII 2 <italic>šēnāʾ’, Or</italic> 44 [1975], pp. 103–105 [105]). While the intricacies of the debate cannot be assessed here, I find Thijs Booij to be the most convincing at several levels. As he sees it, Dahood's insistence on ‘prosperity’, for example, or Emerton's argumentation for ‘high estate’ miss the real crux because ‘it is not the pursuit of prosperity, high estate or honour that the text is about, but human effort in general’ (‘Psalm 127,2b: A Return to Martin Luther’, <italic>Bib</italic> 81 [2000], pp. 262–68 [264]). The key difficulty, for Booij, is really an <italic>interpretive</italic> one that has everything to do with how God gives in relation to human toiling: ‘the content of v. 2b could also be worded as follows: “The things you hope to acquire by your toiling, those same things God gives (<inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig5.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>) his beloved in sleep”’ (p. 267). At the end of the day, it seems best to conclude that <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466465-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/> is indeed an Aramaism.</p></fn>

Gregory's impetus seems primarily rooted in the pursuit of Scripture's inherent virtue, whether narrative, poetic, titular, or otherwise: ‘For [the superscriptions] too make a significant contribution to us in respect to the way of virtue’ (p. 124). When discussing any kind of function or purpose to the psalm titles, he writes that ‘[a Psalm] has been superscripted either to indicate what lies below it, so that we learn the meaning in the words more quickly because we have been taught the aim of the Psalm in advance, or, as is often the case, the inscription in and of itself points to something which is achieved in relation to virtue in the meaning in its own words, and instructs our hearing’ (p. 126). Although only a relatively small portion of this treatise directly addresses psalm titles (Part II, Chapters I-IX), Gregory engages a quiver full of such topics as the aim (‭σκoπό⸉‬), division (‭διíαίρεσι⸉‬), and order (‬τάξι⸉‭) of the Psalter as a whole which are, one may undoubtedly argue on the face of it, quite <italic>canonical</italic>-sounding endeavors.</p></fn>
