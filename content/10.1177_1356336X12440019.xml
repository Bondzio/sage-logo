<abstract>
<p>In 2010, schools in Scotland implemented a new curriculum, a Curriculum for Excellence, and for physical education (PE), this represented a move from the ‘Expressive Arts’ to ‘Health and Wellbeing’ (HWB). To understand this new position, we explored the thoughts of those who were directly involved in the construction of the policy text for PE within HWB (<italic>n</italic> = 10). All of the participants supported the position of PE within HWB, accepting that PE has an important role to play in improving pupils’ health and wellbeing, although there was some concern that teachers might misinterpret the role of PE within HWB. However, all of the participants believed that this new position for PE would encourage other professionals to value PE more highly. We conclude by suggesting that there should be a greater involvement of teachers in the reform process so that future curricular innovations are more closely aligned with the knowledge and practice of teachers. This may enable them to understand policy more clearly and implement policy more effectively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2010, Scottish schools began to implement their new curriculum, a Curriculum for Excellence (CfE; Scottish Government, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440019">2004a</xref>). Within this curriculum, Physical education (PE) is set within the area of ‘Health and Wellbeing’ (HWB), one of the core areas of the curriculum alongside literacy and numeracy. This new position for PE potentially indicates a shift in the way it is understood. PE may no longer be viewed primarily as a means of developing movement, affective and cognitive competences across a range of physical activities. This new framework for PE represents a possible change in focus, one where there is more emphasis on the development of pupils’ health and wellbeing, which incorporates mental, emotional, social and physical wellbeing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440019">Thorburn (2010</xref>) describes this as an opportunity for PE to demonstrate the ways in which it can connect to pupils’ overall learning through new and imaginative pedagogies. Moreover, teachers can use this as an opportunity to develop their skills of reflection, collaboration and inquiry in order to bring about the necessary changes to their teaching behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356336X12440019">Thorburn and Gray, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440019">Thorburn et al. (2011</xref>) describe this process as ‘a culture and cycle of experimentation and reflection’. Consequently, for teachers, and other key stakeholders, understanding this new position for PE, the nature of the changes taking place and the impact it may have on their working lives is important.</p>
<p>This paper is set within the Scottish context, where concerns about the health of the nation have played a key role in the shaping of educational policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440019">Thorburn et al., 2011</xref>). However, we refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356336X12440019">Ball’s (2007)</xref> notion of the increased ‘colonisation of education policy by economic imperatives’ (p.39); in other words, that political ideas and principles cross borders and permeate national policies. Concerns about the health of the nation, drains on healthcare and human capacity are not exclusively Scottish issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440019">Horrell et al. (2011</xref>) state that:<disp-quote>
<p>Physical and mental health in their widest terms are considered to be central to educational policy in nations competing in the global economy. (p.9)</p>
</disp-quote>Changes made to the PE curricula in Australia and New Zealand, for example, saw PE subsumed by the curricular area of Health and Physical Education (HPE), and were said to be politically motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440019">Burrows and Wright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1998</xref>). This resulted in debate concerning the identity and focus of PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1998</xref>). In New Zealand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356336X12440019">Burrows and Wright (2004</xref>) describe a major shift in the conceptualisation of PE as mental health, which was introduced as one of the key outcomes of the syllabus. They describe how the:<disp-quote>
<p>…foregrounding of ‘mental health’ marks a new emphasis in the new curriculum compared with the prior syllabus. Reminiscent of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the HPE curriculum positions self-actualisation, or the capacity to understand oneself and one’s unique potential as the major outcome of physical education schooling. (p.196)</p>
</disp-quote>The Australian context is more complex, as each of the states and territories have the freedom to implement the national texts as they see fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1998</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356336X12440019">Penney (1998</xref>) believes that the establishment of HPE as a Key Learning Area has the potential make a positive contribution to the health of all young people, although, for many, this would challenge traditional practices in PE. It appears, therefore, that political powers have the capacity to direct educational policy by controlling and legitimising discourse, in this case, health discourse. This, in turn, may impact on the very nature and purpose of the subject, and in this case, PE. Consequently, from a Scottish perspective, but also of interest to the wider PE community, it is important to understand such discourse and examine the impact this has on the design and delivery of PE within the area of HWB.</p>
<p>There is a call for the promotion of all types of educational research, regardless of its utility for policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356336X12440019">Whitty, 2006</xref>). At its best, policy development is ‘unwieldy and complex’ and at its worst, ‘unscientific and irrational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356336X12440019">Ball, 1990</xref>: 3). It is important, therefore, to dig beneath the surface of official policy statements to expose and understand the ideas that surround their intentions and justifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440019">Humes, 2003</xref>). To develop this understanding, it is useful to view the construction of new policy as a ‘policy cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440019">Bowe et al., 1992</xref>): a complex, non-linear process of conflict, debate and resolution, where policy is constructed, and re-constructed, within three arenas of action: the context of influence, the context of text production and the context of practice. Consequently, in order to understand more fully this new vision for PE in Scotland and what it means for the future of PE, this investigation aims to go beyond the policy documentation and explore the ways in which the individuals involved in the context of text production understand and articulate PE within HWB. In order to achieve this, three research questions will be addressed. How do curriculum writers articulate the aims of HWB and of PE within HWB? What are the key factors that curriculum writers identify in relation to implementing the PE curriculum within HWB? How do curriculum writers envisage the future of PE within the Scottish context? </p>

<sec id="section2-1356336X12440019">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Almost a decade ago, the Scottish Government identified five National Priorities in Education. They were achievement and attainment; framework for learning; inclusion and equity; values and citizenship; and learning for life. The National Priorities in Education aimed to empower teachers and learners, and ensure that every child in Scotland reached his or her full potential. There was also a call for a more integrated curriculum that placed the pupil at the centre of the learning process. This call was, in part, as a result of the information attained during the National Debate on Education in 2002. It was against this backdrop that the Scottish Government established a Review Group to identify the key principles to be applied in the curriculum redesign for ages 3–18. </p>
<p>The outcome of the Group’s work was a CfE (Scottish Government, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440019">2004a</xref>). It outlines a vision for schools in Scotland in the 21st century, highlighting the success of past curricular innovations and builds upon them for the future so that education in Scotland places the learner at the centre of the learning process and nurtures successful learners, responsible citizens, confident individuals and effective contributors. The curriculum describes a ‘totality of experiences’ that are planned for young people, wherever they are being educated, emphasising the role of pupil choice and interdisciplinary learning, thus extending pupil learning beyond the classroom (Scottish Government, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356336X12440019">2004a</xref>). Within a CfE, PE forms part of a collective alongside physical activity and sport. They are all subsumed by the term ‘Health and Wellbeing’, which has been given a central role within the curriculum alongside literacy and numeracy as a core area of learning. </p>
<p>It has been argued that the emphasis on HWB within the new curriculum, and the core role of PE within HWB, is primarily related to the government’s concerns about national health issues, such as obesity and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356336X12440019">Scottish Executive Health Department, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356336X12440019">Thorburn et al., 2011</xref>). Scotland’s reputation is one that is becoming readily associated with notions of ill health and features prominently at the top of several league tables for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440019">Horrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440019">Scottish Government, 2005</xref>). A number of health-related reports were already established in Scotland and served as an impetus for the notion of HWB as a core area of the curriculum. For example, the White Paper on Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356336X12440019">Scottish Office Health Department, 1999</xref>), amongst other things, drew attention to the important role PE plays in promoting healthy lifestyles. As a result of the White Paper, a National Physical Activity Task Force (Scottish Government, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356336X12440019">2003</xref>) was set up with a view to increasing and sustaining the proportion of individuals who could be deemed physically active in Scotland. The Task Force made a number of recommendations: children should take part in at least one hour of moderate physical activity every day, they should have access to a wide range of physical activities, and they should be provided with two hours of ‘quality’ PE each week. In response to these aspirations, the Review Group on PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440019">Scottish Government, 2004b</xref>) was established and charged with developing and implementing strategies that would improve levels of participation, performance and engagement with PE in Scotland. Underpinning the deliberations of this group was the belief that good ‘quality’ PE could improve the HWB of children, which in turn, could improve their achievement in schools, their confidence and in turn ‘capacity’ for learning. To ensure that children’s experiences of PE were indeed of ‘quality’, the group identified three key areas for development: teaching approaches, facilities and the PE curriculum. It was suggested that of these three factors, the actual ‘curriculum’ potentially had the greatest impact on pupil participation, performance and attitudes towards life-long participation in physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356336X12440019">Scottish Government, 2004b</xref>). Thereafter, during the development of the CfE, PE became situated within HWB and many of the recommendations made by the Review Group on PE were adopted in subsequent policy writing. </p>
<p>The responsibility for policy development in Scotland ultimately lies with the government. Scottish ministers recruited the members of the group responsible for the initial writing of a CfE, the Curriculum Review Group (CRG), and provided the remit for policy development. A HWB group was subsequently formed, including members from agencies such as Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS), Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Education (HMIE) and the Health Promoting Schools Unit (HPSU). Guided by the principles from the CRG, a rationale and a framework for HWB were created. As a result of this process, a starter paper was developed to guide the writing of the experiences and outcomes for PE. Experiences are defined as the ‘set expectations for the kinds of activities which will promote learning and development’ and outcomes ‘set out what the child or young person will be able to explain, apply or demonstrate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356336X12440019">Scottish Government, 2008</xref>: 23). A group consisting of LTS representatives, PE teachers, health specialists and primary specialists was invited to refine the experiences and outcomes for PE. During this time an open consultation process was initiated that invited responses from all interested parties through participation in workshops and conferences. The findings from these consultations informed the decisions made by LTS during the refinement of the experiences and outcomes.</p>
<p>The experiences and outcomes are extremely important for PE teachers, as these are the areas of the curriculum that they are directly responsible for. Successful delivery of the experiences and outcomes will, to some extent, be related to the ways in which PE teachers understand them. It has been argued that, in order for authentic change to take place, teachers must be convinced that the new outcomes will improve student learning. This provides them with the emotional stimulus that encourages learning and a change in values, beliefs and ideology about PE and PE teaching (Dinan-Thompsom, 2001).  </p>

<title>The policy cycle</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356336X12440019">Ball (1994</xref>) claims that any decent theory of education should not be limited to a state control perspective, one that describes a process of policy development that begins with legislation and ends with teachers delivering the policy message, where power is centralised, unitary and directly linked to national economic interests. This view of policy development is too simplistic. The development of policy is a very complex process that involves debate, conflict and struggles for power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440019">Bowe et al. (1992</xref>) describe the idea of a ‘policy cycle’ to explain a more complex and contextualised policy process. This idea is about both where and how policy is developed and re-developed within different contexts. They describe three arenas of action that involve privileged interest groups: the context of influence, the context of policy text production and the context of practice. </p>
<p>The context of influence is where interested parties struggle over the construction of policy discourse in an attempt to define the purposes of education and what it means to be educated and, in this case, physically educated. From the debates and dialogue within the context of influence emerge policy concepts, which are then developed into texts within the context of text production. This process is complex and conflict within this context can be rife, as those involved in the process bring with them different experiences, knowledge and ideas about the purposes of education. The text that is produced, therefore, is the outcome of struggle and compromise as those involved in the process compete for the control of the representation of policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356336X12440019">Bowe et al., 1992</xref>). Policy writers cannot control the meaning of their text as it enters into the context of practice, particularly when teachers have not been involved in the development of policy text. As text is interpreted and recreated, it is subject to ‘interpretation, slippage and contestation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356336X12440019">Ball and Bowe, 1992</xref>: 98). Teachers do not engage with policy text as naïve readers, rather they come with history, experiences and values of their own that enable them to contest, adopt or adapt the policy text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356336X12440019">Ball and Bowe, 1992</xref>) to suit their own unique environment and the needs of their pupils. </p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich (2007</xref>), one of the main weaknesses of the policy cycle is the overemphasis of agency over structure, not just in the context of practice, but in all three policy development arenas. This marginalises the power of state structures at each level and fails to recognise the ways in which state structures mediate policy. Consequently, a more sophisticated theory of the state incorporated into the policy cycle is called for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356336X12440019">Lingard, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich (2007</xref>) has attempted to develop the policy cycle in this way by drawing on the strengths of both conceptions of policy development, linking the global and the national policy contexts to each phase of the policy cycle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich (2007</xref>) also describes a model that is not uni-directional, where influences and discourses can move through each context in both directions. She stresses that this is a state-centred model (not state-controlled), which means that the power of the policy elite is still greater than those agents who engage at micro-levels of policy development and delivery. For example, the state has the power to select the individuals to be involved in the policy writing process. Often those individuals are selected because their experiences, knowledge and values ‘fit’ with the priorities of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440019">Humes, 2003</xref>). As a result, they develop text that sends a strong and consistent message to practitioners about the aims of the policy. Importantly, the balance between constraint and agency within each arena of action will vary depending on the policy, the political climate and the local site of policy engagement. In other words, policy development is context specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich. 2007</xref>). Policy analysis, therefore, must be situated within the specific policy context and take account of the various influences that are mediated by individuals at each level. One means by which this can be achieved is by investigating the views and experiences of the individuals who engage in discourse within each arena. Understanding discourse is critical to understanding policy, because it reflects the values, beliefs, language and practices from which meaning and reality can be established. Understanding the views of those who were involved in the development of the experiences and outcomes for PE may, therefore, help us to better understand this new conception of PE within HWB: how it was developed, what knowledge was privileged and what this means for the future of PE in Scotland.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>As this study was particularly interested in how curriculum writers articulated the new PE curriculum, a naturalistic research design was adopted. Research of this nature acknowledges that social reality does not exist in isolation from the social beings’ interpretation of their social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356336X12440019">Pring, 2000</xref>). While the perspectives of these ‘curriculum writers’ lay firmly at the heart of this study, the researchers were also integral to the unfolding narrative. They were tasked with the challenge of ‘objectively’ bringing participants’ interpretations of curriculum implementation to life and ensuring that this was not biased by their own ‘outsider view’ and biographies as ‘Physical Educators’, ‘Teacher Educators’ and ‘Researchers’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356336X12440019">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Purposive sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440019">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>) was deemed appropriate, as this ensured that participants included the range of individuals who were actively involved within the context of text production. Consequently, the 10 participants who took part in this study were selected to ensure a representative account of deliberations during the initial, interim and final stages of developing the experiences and outcomes for PE within HWB. Five of the participants (participants 1–5) were drawn from the initial stages of the text production process where key discussions took place concerning the nature and structure of HWB. A further five participants were involved in the construction of the experiences and outcomes for PE. Two (participants 6 and 7) were involved around the time that the first draft of experiences and outcomes for PE were constructed (interim) and three (participants 8–10) were involved in the refinement and finalisation of these experiences and outcomes (final). </p>
<p>All of the participants came from institutions that are governed and funded to a greater or lesser extent by the Scottish Government. The five participants involved in the initial discussions about HWB came from institutions that included Initial Teacher Education (ITE), LTS and HMIE. As a group the areas of expertise brought to their deliberations included policy writing, curriculum design, health promotion and experience of primary and secondary education. The participants who were involved in the interim and final stages of curriculum construction (developing experiences and outcomes) included both PE teachers and LTS representatives. They also included individuals aligned to the ‘Being Well Doing Well’ initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356336X12440019">Health Promoting Schools Unit, 2004</xref>), which is a strategy that aims to support schools in becoming health promoting schools, and Sport Scotland’s ‘Active Schools’ initiative, which aims to increase physical activity opportunities for school children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356336X12440019">
<title>Procedure </title>
<p>The Institute Ethical Committee granted ethical approval and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study. A focused interview schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356336X12440019">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356336X12440019">Gordon, 1999</xref>) was developed that aimed to further explore the three research questions: How do curriculum writers articulate the aims of HWB and of PE within HWB? What are the key factors that curriculum writers identify in relation to implementing the PE curriculum within HWB? How do curriculum writers envisage the future of PE within the Scottish context? </p>
<p>A semi-structured format with questions and probes was deemed appropriate for a study of this nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356336X12440019">Gillham, 2000</xref>). Individual face-to-face interviews lasting around 60 minutes were conducted at a convenient time for each participant in their place of work while free from any distractions (August–December 2009). During the interview the researcher summarised participants’ responses to check for understanding and accuracy and took detailed field notes. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim within one month of completion. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356336X12440019">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of the interview data was conducted in four phases. Firstly, the transcripts were read and re-read in order to become familiar with participants’ responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356336X12440019">Dye, 2000</xref>). The second phase involved grouping the responses according to the interview questions asked. This provided a context-specific and more focused framework for analysis (Taylor-Powell and Renner, 2003), thus enabling a preliminary process of identifying emerging thematic categories. This entailed considering the ‘text’ and developing phrases that explained key issues within the data in order to summarise their meaning and identify the emergence of categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356336X12440019">Glaser, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356336X12440019">Podlog and Eklund, 2006</xref>). Reference to the field notes taken during the interviews further supported the initial analytical process. The third phase involved identifying and further refining the categorisation of key issues discussed by individual participants. This categorisation procedure was independently carried out by all three researchers to ensure investigator triangulation. The final phase of this analysis involved testing the authenticity and robustness of these categories across the 10 interview responses. At this point, the features of all categorical instances were discussed at length until appropriate categorisations were agreed by the three researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356336X12440019">Sproule et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>I think the purpose is if you look at the four capacities you won’t be able to develop those four capacities if you don’t develop the health and wellbeing of young people.</p>
</disp-quote>Over half of the participants referred to the poor health of the nation and the concerns over rising obesity levels when talking about the aims of HWB. Topics of discussion included the development of healthy bodies, healthy lifestyles and the promotion of life-long participation. Participants 1, 2, 6 and 8 talked specifically about the development of pupils’ mental or emotional health within the curriculum area of HWB. Participant 2 believes that HWB within the curriculum recognises that:<disp-quote>
<p>…in particular mental health underpins just about every other aspect of the curriculum.</p>
</disp-quote>

<title>Current good practice in PE</title>
<p>Those participants who had experience in teaching PE all said that experiences and outcomes for PE within HWB simply reflected good practice, and that many teachers were already adopting this good practice. Participant 7 explained that they always thought that PE was much more than just teaching ‘activities’ and participant 10 has always seen themself as a ‘teacher of children’ first, rather than solely viewing themself as a subject specialist. Participant 8 claimed that PE and PE teachers have always had the potential to address broader issues within education, issues linked to the development of affective and cognitive skills, as well as psychomotor skills. They said that PE within HWB allows teachers to showcase what they can do, and encourages them to make learning more explicit. In explaining how PE can encourage children to develop their understanding of relationships, participant 8 said:<disp-quote>
<p>Because we do a lot of work in working with others, relationships. And these are skills for learning, life and work.  </p>
</disp-quote>Participant 4 viewed the experiences and outcomes as being synonymous with the learning outcomes of one of the certificated PE courses in Scotland (Standard Grade PE), again alluding to the notion that PE within HWB is not fundamentally different to other forms of PE:<disp-quote>
<p>These key elements of performance, of knowledge and understanding, and of affective development are still there, they are still three key drivers within the experiences and outcomes.</p>

<title>Change of mindset</title>
<p>All of the participants in this study believed that many teachers would have to change their mindset about teaching PE within HWB. Almost all of the participants explained that this means that PE teachers would have to think more broadly about PE and pedagogy. Participants 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 suggested PE teachers would now have to take into account some of the wider issues linked to improving pupils’ HWB when delivering the PE curriculum. Participant 5 explained this change of mindset by saying:<disp-quote>
<p>They have to be open to new ideas.  They have to link the learning… Thinking not, thinking outwith their own subject.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1356336X12440019">
<title>Interdisciplinary learning</title>
<p>In line with thinking more broadly about teaching PE, the participants explained that this meant creating more meaningful links with other PE teachers in their department, other teachers in the school and with teachers from neighbouring schools. Participants 3 and 8 discussed the idea of developing pedagogical practices by improving communication between teachers and developing what participant 8 described as ‘communities of practice’. All of the participants said that this would require increased communication between teachers across departments and schools, and viewed this in a very positive light. There was a general belief that this would be easier to do in the primary context, but that it would take a greater shift of thinking to be implemented successfully within the secondary school context.</p>
<p>Participants 4 and 7 indicated some concern that interdisciplinary learning may be poorly organised. They were concerned that it became a ‘tick-box’ exercise and stated that for learning to take place, links between subjects had to be meaningful. </p>
<p>Participant 4 said:<disp-quote>
<p>I mean I think probably informally that’s been done in the past, but I guess the thinking here is we have to be clear about, it’s not interdisciplinary learning just to say we can tick the box.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section16-1356336X12440019">
<title>Time, timetable and resources</title>
<p>Two of the key principles that underpin a CfE are to be less prescriptive and to give more autonomy to teachers. All of the participants recognised that this would be challenging for teachers in relation to the amount of time and resources this would take. Participant 4 provided some detail as to how the curriculum might be organised, stating that it would have to come from the top down and that schools should not be constrained by the timetable. They said that they should firstly work out what the needs of the learner are and then devise a curriculum that meets those needs. Participant 10 mirrored this comment stating that the curriculum would have to have strong leadership from the head teacher to be organised in a way that would meet the aims of the a CfE, based on the demographics and resources of the school as well as the needs of the individual pupils within the school. </p>
<p>Participants 2 and 5 provided suggestions about how some of the challenges relating to resources and providing two hours of quality PE could be overcome. Participant 5 suggested that specialist coaches could be invited into schools to deliver PE if the teacher did not feel that he/she possessed the experience or expertise to do so. Participant 2 suggested that more primary school teachers should be given the opportunity to gain a postgraduate qualification in PE and that they could then be the PE specialist responsible for the delivery of the PE curriculum in their school. </p>

<title>Teacher interpretation</title>
<p>The participants in this study believed that the success of the new curriculum is related to the ways in which teachers interpret the curriculum. Participant 7 understood that the experiences and outcomes could be interpreted in different ways and was concerned that some teachers may choose to create the experiences and achieve the outcomes through a very narrow range of activities, possibly those activities they are more experienced in. He said:<disp-quote>
<p>If it’s delivered in the right way we could have a fantastically rich and diverse subject.  If it’s not we could end up with everything in PE being delivered through team games, which it could… all the outcomes could be delivered through team games, and providing a very narrow experience.</p>
</disp-quote>Participant 8 was concerned that some teachers may interpret the documentation in a way that focuses too much on issues surrounding physical activity and health:<disp-quote>
<p>I guess my concerns are people’s interpretation and not looking at the wider issue, for people to have a narrow perception people think that it’s about health and fitness. </p>

<title>Status</title>
<p>Participants 1, 8 and 10 talked about the key role that PE played within the area of HWB and that this position for PE would raise its profile and status within schools. They believed that this raised profile of PE would encourage other professionals to view their subject more favourably, understanding more clearly its value, and thus raising its status within the wider educational context.</p>
<p>Participant 10 indicated that they:<disp-quote>
<p>…hoped that it will allow other staff to realise the value of physical education, and to see us as a massive contributor to the overall education of a child, and not just about teaching a child how to play hockey or swim or do dance.</p>

<title>Policy acceptance</title>
<p>In articulating their views about the role of PE within HWB, participants in this study remained very close to official policy text. They talked about PE in relation to developing the four capacities, pupils’ health, placing the child at the centre of the learning process and choice. There was very little, if any, contestation or critique of this text and all of the participants embraced terms, such as individualised learning, choice and HWB, as accepted discourses within the PE context. It is perhaps not surprising that there was no critique of these concepts. It would be difficult for anyone to argue against them as critical components of a young person’s education, particularly in a society where notions of ill health and obesity are prevalent and very public, not just from within Scotland, but from a much wider, global perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440019">Horrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356336X12440019">Scottish Government, 2005</xref>). Vidovich (2007) argues that globalisation is particularly important in relation to policy development, because it reduces the policy options available to the state. She claims that: <disp-quote>
<p>…globalization significantly compromises the ability of a nation state to set its own policy directions, it is now difficult to understand education policies and practices without reference to globalization processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356336X12440019">Crossley, 2000</xref>). (p.290)</p>
</disp-quote>Although global concerns and directives influence, and can be mediated, at each stage of the policy cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich, 2007</xref>), there also appears to be a very strong directive from Scottish Government. This is reflected in the fact that each of the participants selected to be involved in the writing of the policy text came from an institution that represented a local site of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356336X12440019">Lingard, 1993</xref>); thus, it could be argued that they represented the government. When those selected to develop policy within the context of text production hold similar ideologies about education and PE to those in power, debate is limited and, ultimately, political agendas are satisfied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1356336X12440019">
<title>The curriculum and good practice</title>
<p>Although there appears to be a shift in the way in which PE is being articulated, there was a belief by some of the participants that good teachers would not need to change their practice, that they were already delivering a curriculum that met with the expectations of PE within HWB. The idea of interpreting policy in line with current beliefs and practices is not new. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356336X12440019">Curtner-Smith (1999</xref>) found that PE teachers in England did not change their values or beliefs about PE when the new National Curriculum was introduced. Instead, their interpretations were based on already existing values and beliefs that were strongly influenced by their pre-ITE experiences and biographies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356336X12440019">Swann and Brown (1997</xref>) reported similar results during the evaluation of the 5–14 Curriculum in Scotland. Teachers were not surprised by the curriculum guidelines they were provided with, stating that it was what they were already delivering. The result of this was that they did not change their practice, rather they simply changed the language they used to make the guidelines ‘fit’ their current practice.</p>
<p>Given the new position of PE within HWB, it is reasonable to suggest that there will be some change in the way PE is defined and delivered. However, if, like the participants in this study, teachers view curriculum guidelines for PE as good practice and, at the same time, they believe their practice to be good, then what incentive is there for them to change, develop or refine their practice? In addition, if teachers view the experiences and outcomes as analogous with previous PE curricula, it is again unclear if any change will take place to the way PE is defined or delivered. In some way, this is similar to the idea presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440019">Penney (1999a</xref>) about the importance of the structure of the curriculum in relation to influencing discursive frames. The activity focus that was preserved during the changes to the National Curriculum in the 1990s reinforced dominant pedagogies in PE and reflected the satisfaction of the profession with the curriculum in its pre-review form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1999a</xref>). In the case of the present study, by viewing the structure of the curriculum as the same as what has gone before, traditional or current ideas about (good) teaching and learning may be preserved. This has the potential to demonstrate teacher agency within the policy cycle, resulting in ‘slippage’ within the context of practice as the discursive focus shifts from an articulation of what PE means within the context of HWB, to sharing ideas about current good practice. </p>

<title>Change of mindset</title>
<p>Although the assumption was that good teachers were already delivering a CfE, all of the participants said that teachers would have to change their mindset about PE in order to deliver the CfE effectively. For the participants in this study, this meant thinking about PE more broadly, beyond the notion of a PE that is primarily concerned with the development of activity specific motor skills. However, one of the key issues with assuming that many teachers will have to change their mindset about teaching PE within HWB, or change the way they deliver PE, is the absence of empirical evidence to suggest that there is a problem with the way teachers currently think about and deliver PE. Indeed, other than statistics that describe the poor health of Scottish school children and adults, there is no evidence to show that the decisions that were made about curriculum reform were informed by any school-based empirical research. Priestley and Humes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356336X12440019">2010</xref>) claim that there was no mention of the impact of research on the development of the new curriculum and stated that, ‘a reform programme which fails to take account of antecedents, or learn lessons of the past, runs the risk of promoting innovation without real change’ (p.358).</p>
<p>PE teachers have a critical role to play in the reconceptualisation of PE within HWB. There was some consultation with PE teachers in the form of conferences and workshops during the refinement of the experiences and outcomes, but this took place towards the end of the process of text production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356336X12440019">Gilles (2001</xref>) describes such involvement as ‘tokenism’, where consultation is valued more as a public relations exercise than a genuinely democratic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356336X12440019">Humes, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356336X12440019">Hargreaves and Evans (1997</xref>) state that teachers should be genuinely involved in policy reform, that the government should not assume that by involving some teachers in the process, reform is more likely to be accepted by most teachers. However, teachers must be provided with the space and authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1999b</xref>) to engage with and contribute to this discourse. Often their contributions are subject to ‘slippage’, because their views are constrained or marginalised in each context of the policy process. This allows the discourse of those who have control over the agenda and timescales for policy development to dominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356336X12440019">Penney, 1999b</xref>) and thus shape policy to respond to global and political pressures. One of the key problems with this is that the policy that is produced may not fit with the perceptions, experiences and needs of PE teachers, which will impact directly on the way policy is interpreted and enacted.</p>
<p>In supporting the need for school-based research to inform policy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356336X12440019">Munn (1995</xref>) advocates the role of action research. She believes that if policy makers wish to change what teachers do, they have to give some cognisance to current teacher practice, how they think, and the structural factors that influence their work, for example, the demands of raising attainment and quality assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440019">Priestley, 2010</xref>). Consequently, lack of school-based, empirical evidence to support the need for change may increase the likelihood that the new curriculum will not elicit any change to teachers’ mindsets or pedagogical practice. </p>

<title>Teacher interpretation</title>
<p>The participants in this study believed that the success of the new curriculum is related to the ways in which teachers interpret the curriculum documentation. There appeared to be a concern that teachers would either focus too much on activities primarily associated with being fit, or that they would focus on a narrow range of activities that they felt comfortable teaching. However, it is important to reiterate that the participants also said that good teachers would not have to change their practice because they were already delivering PE in a manner that reflected the experiences and outcomes. This lack of clarity about how PE teachers might interpret the new curriculum is somewhat reflected within the policy documentation. On the one hand, there is a drive to improve the HWB of children through the delivery of a new, broad and meaningful PE curriculum, but on the other hand, there is a description of PE in the form of experiences and outcomes that is very closely linked to more traditional views of PE. The links between HWB and PE may well be implicit within the experiences and outcomes; however, this makes the task of identifying them very difficult, one that many PE teachers may not have the time or inclination to undertake. </p>
<p>The ways in which teachers mediate policy reflects their skills, prior experiences, resources, attitudes and values, as well as their social interactions with colleagues about policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356336X12440019">Priestley, 2010</xref>). However, given the strength of the health discourse permeating Scottish society, and as alluded to by the participants in this study, teachers in Scotland may interpret the policy text in relation to improving health, fitness and increasing physical activity levels. It is not yet clear how this might be realised in practice, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356336X12440019">Thorburn (2010</xref>) warns that, with an emphasis on activities for the 21st century, breadth and choice, PE within HWB might result in a curriculum that is more about ‘activity sampling’ than learning. Supporting this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356336X12440019">Horrell et al. (2011</xref>) highlight that a PE curriculum centred on ideas about improving pupils’ health and wellbeing runs the risk of becoming managed recreation, where the teacher’s role is reduced to one of setting up and managing activity. Whilst some may call for PE that is focused more on participation, health and enjoyment, this form of PE is much narrower in terms of providing pupils with experiences that are of educational value. To endorse such a position for PE would be to ignore what it means to be physically educated and would be detrimental to the profession in relation to its ubiquitous struggle for increased status within schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356336X12440019">Reid, 1996</xref>). </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1356336X12440019">
<title>Status</title>
<p>All of the participants were generally very positive about the future of PE and believed that its new position within HWB would increase its status within the Scottish curriculum. Indeed, the issue of the status of PE was prevalent in many of the discussions that took place during this investigation. The concern over the status of PE, particularly in relation to how others view it, is not a new concern. The same issue was raised when certificated PE was introduced to the Scottish curriculum in the 1980s and 1990s. Many in the profession believed that Standard Grade PE, and then later Higher Grade PE, would encourage other professionals to view PE as a more academic subject based on the introduction of scientific and examinable knowledge to the PE curriculum. However, although many PE teachers believed that this would raise the status of PE, there were others who believed that this move towards teaching conceptual knowledge over practical knowledge was a move that had the potential to challenge the very nature of the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356336X12440019">Reid, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>With the repositioning of PE within HWB, a new debate about the very nature of the subject may well ignite and, it could be argued, should ignite in order to fully understand the changes that are being made to the subject, both conceptually and in practice. Teacher engagement in such debate is critical so that they can both understand and influence policy. In order for this to happen, there should be a mechanism whereby the resultant dialogue can be fed back to all stakeholders in the policy development process, thus providing teachers with a voice within contexts other than the context of practice. This engagement and collaboration throughout and beyond the process of curricular reform has the potential to diminish the ‘top-down/bottom up’ perspectives on policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356336X12440019">Kirk and Macdonald, 2001</xref>), and increase teacher status as they become active participants in the process rather than merely passive receivers. However, this level of involvement is difficult to achieve when teachers are made accountable for learning through ‘high-stakes’ examinations or government inspections. In these contexts, teachers demand greater prescription to ensure that they have interpreted, and are delivering, the curriculum as it was intended (Macphail, 2007). This allows the government to maintain control over the process of policy development, ensuring that a clear policy message is transmitted to the context of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356336X12440019">Lingard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356336X12440019">Vidovich, 2007</xref>). In addition, teachers’ own knowledge about the poor health of young people in Scotland may serve to strengthen the perspective that PE’s future lies with promoting ideas and practices that encourage children to adopt health-enhancing behaviours, particularly if, as highlighted by some of the participants in this study, this perspective is associated with increased status. </p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Scotland has a new curriculum, and for the PE profession, this means a new framework for PE and, potentially, a new way of thinking about and delivering PE. For teachers and other key stakeholders, understanding the nature of the changes that are taking place and the impact it may have on their working lives is very important. Consequently, in order to understand what appears to be a re-conceptualisation of PE, and how it might impact on PE in the future, this investigation explored the thoughts of those who were directly involved in the policy discourse that resulted in the construction of PE as part of HWB. </p>
<p>The participants that we interviewed all spoke about PE within HWB in a very positive light. They clearly supported the key principles underpinning the role of HWB within a CfE and hoped that this new place for PE would encourage other professionals to value PE more highly. They believed that good teachers would not have to change their approach to teaching PE because they were already creating the learning experiences and achieving the outcomes associated with PE within HWB. However, there was concern that some teachers may interpret the documentation rather narrowly and either focus too much on health issues during PE lessons, or aim to teach the experiences and outcomes through the activities they were the most comfortable teaching. </p>
<p>It is difficult for anyone in Scotland to escape the fact that there is a national health problem. We are exposed to this fact, not just through policy directives, but also through various political and media conduits. Consequently, many teachers may well have already begun the process of change, whatever form that change may take. Future research may well consider observing this process to understand just how teachers manage to grapple with a curriculum that, in many ways, reflects their current ideologies and practices, but is set within a very powerful global and political framework for improved health. The potential difficulty of managing these conditions was certainly reflected in the present study, since the participants themselves were not clear about how to articulate the goals of HWB in line with the experiences and outcomes for PE. Indeed, the documentation itself causes some confusion and does not provide teachers with information about the processes that form the basis of the experiences for learning (Priestley and Humes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356336X12440019">2010</xref>). This is perhaps the reason why, when the participants were asked to discuss the future of PE within Scotland, although they were very optimistic in relation to its position with the curriculum, they were much less clear on what it would actually look like. </p>
<p>If more teachers had played a greater role in the reform process, then issues of interpretation and modes of delivery would not be so pertinent. Policy should be built upon existing practices, based on teacher knowledge, attitudes and values (Priestley, 2005). When teachers are not able to contribute to discourse within the context of text production, or even the context of influence, the result is a form of PE that is decided not by teachers, but for teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356336X12440019">Penney and Evans, 1999</xref>). When this happens, they either become de-skilled, conforming to the practice demands of the reform, or choose not to change their practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356336X12440019">Oslon, 2002</xref>). </p>
<p>By contrast, when they form collaborations with administrators, curriculum developers, researchers and teacher educators, they can challenge existing ideologies of PE and begin the process of constructing new and relevant instructional knowledge. Teacher involvement in policy discourse throughout the policy cycle would enable them to understand policy more clearly and enable them to implement policy more effectively. Perhaps the findings from the present study will encourage those who lead curriculum development to involve teachers in this way so that the next curriculum innovation in Scotland will be more closely aligned with the knowledge and practices of teachers. In the meantime, future research might consider exploring the extent to which PE teachers in Scotland understand and interpret current policy. It would be interesting to see how their understandings and interpretations of policy are reflective of what the policy writers envisaged.</p>
