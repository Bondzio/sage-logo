<p>Dear ICAN Readers,</p>
<p>This editorial page is my opportunity to do several things: to offer a perspective on our collective work, solicit for new topics for manuscripts, to encourage manuscript submissions, and sometimes it’s just to say “thank you.” This month, I wanted to begin by making an announcement. Over the years I’ve received many inquiries about whether <italic>ICAN</italic> was indexed. I thought you’d all be interested to know that <italic>ICAN</italic> has just recently been accepted into Scopus, the largest indexer of peer-reviewed journals. Acceptance is based on the unique niche that is filled by <italic>ICAN</italic> as well as the quality of the articles. This acceptance allows an author’s published work to be easily accessed and is a significant step for the journal. Besides feeling <italic>ICAN</italic> is worthy, I am excited, gratified, and thankful to all of you who helped <italic>ICAN</italic> achieve this milestone.</p>
<p>Second, I wanted to take the time to acknowledge what I noticed is evolving. By now I feel confident that we all agree that the landscape of pediatric nutrition is multidimensional and thereby requires professionals with a variety of expertise. <italic>ICAN</italic> was designed as a venue for many with the goal of acknowledging the invaluable contributions each of the disciplines offers when working with families to nourishing infants, children, and adolescents. Its purpose is to collectively provide a single reliable journalistic source where their respective work can be shared and built on. When <italic>ICAN</italic> was conceived more than 4 years ago, the “team” included all the more commonly associated professionals: dietitians, pediatricians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and occupational and speech therapists. However, I wanted to take this opportunity to point out that over the years <italic>our team has grown</italic>. I have been contacted by many accomplished professionals regarding manuscript inquiries and have welcomed the expansion of that team to include other professionals such as lactation consultants, pediatric dentists and orthodontists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and marriage and family counselors. All these professionals serve to broaden and enrich the clinical perspective and deepen our understanding of the complexity of the feeding and nourishing process. More and more often I am noting that <italic>ICAN</italic> manuscripts are authored by wonderfully diverse teams that demonstrate this invaluable collaboration.</p>
<p>We are so much better working together than we are working alone.</p>
<p>Last, as always, I encourage you to contact me with your ideas for manuscripts, guidance as you consider your topic, or feedback regarding a recent publication. I always look forward to hearing from readers and welcome your comments!■</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,</p>
