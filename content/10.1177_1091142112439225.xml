<p>Previous studies have shown that population aging has severe consequences for public spending. However, in welfare states with a federal budget structure, population aging will affect the levels of government to differing degrees. This article focuses on the impact of population aging on the fiscal system of the Federal Republic of Germany. The analysis draws upon profiles for public transfer flows by single years of age to illustrate the impact of age structure changes on the cost and revenue structures at the different levels of government. The results show that <italic>Länder</italic> and local governments are likely to achieve cost reductions while the federal budget and social security will face higher expenditures because of the increasing number of elderly people. This study provides valuable information on the age utilization of public flows and on the need for restructuring the allocation rules for government revenues and expenditures across levels of government.</p>

<body>
<p>Population aging is a severe problem for the German welfare state. In contrast to other Northern or Western European countries or to the United States, fertility levels in Germany are low, and immigration is insufficient to prevent a rapid aging of the population. In addition, the country has a huge public sector, which reallocates resources from a shrinking workforce to an increasing number of public pension recipients and health care users. This raises questions about the financial sustainability of the German welfare state on an aggregate level, a problem which has been well documented. Looking at overall government revenues and expenditures does not take into account the fact that Germany is designed as a federal republic. Germany has sixteen federal states and over four hundred administrative districts. The different levels of government have age-varying expenditures and revenues and are therefore not expected to be equally affected by the aging of the population. I assume that not all levels of government will be hit equally hard, as the social security system bears the main costs of aging. To test this hypothesis, I use data from National Transfer Accounts (NTA), which are available for over thirty countries. Population aging can lead to changes in the political power structure in all of the federally organized countries or federations. Thus, this line of research is relevant against the background of frictions and the political economy.</p>
<p>The levels of government as designed today will experience the changes in the age structure differently, and some of the levels will even see a decline in their expenditures in the future. But this does not mean they will be prepared to pass on these savings to other government authorities; instead, they will negotiate their future shares of revenues. This research can provide insights into the extent to which it is necessary to adjust revenues and expenditures at a subnational level. The results reveal that <italic>Länder </italic>and local governments can anticipate reduced expenditures, while the federal government and social security will bear the costs of the demographically induced increase in expenditures. At the same time, their revenues will decrease considerably. This article shows the age dependency of public transfers by single years of age, the expected budget gap by level and given different population forecasts, and provides an estimate of the extent to which a reallocation of resources is needed.</p>
<p>With 82 million inhabitants (38.1 million households), Germany is the most populous country and the largest economy in the European Union (EU). After the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s, the total fertility rate (TFR) in Germany declined significantly, falling below replacement level in the early 1970s. The TFR has remained low in recent decades and is, at around 1.3 births per woman, currently among the lowest in the EU. During the period immediately following reunification, the TFR in the eastern part of the country fell from 1.56 in 1989 to 0.84 in 1995 (it has recently reached western values), while nuptiality showed an even larger drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091142112439225">Grünheid and Mammey 1997</xref>). The low fertility rates are coupled with a rising life expectancy at birth that is above the European average: 77.45 years for men and 82.53 years for women in 2003.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1091142112439225">1</xref>
</sup> Rising life expectancy and low fertility levels have resulted in an old-age dependency ratio of 31.26 per 100 inhabitants aged fifteen / sixty-four. This ratio is currently the highest in Europe, and it is expected to increase to almost 60 by 2060, well above the EU average. Population aging is more pronounced in the eastern part of the country. This is due to the low TFR, as well as to the high migration rates of younger skilled workers from the east to more prosperous regions of former West Germany following reunification in 1990. Since the 1970s, the number of deaths has been greater than the number of births, and since 2004 these losses have not been compensated for by immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091142112439225">Grünheid 2006</xref>). The shrinkage of the German population to about 70 million inhabitants is expected to be accompanied by a contraction of the work force (ages 20–64) from about 50.1 million in 2003 to about 39.1 million in 2050. This projection corresponds to a 22 percent decrease in the working-age population (assuming the high migration scenario). The number of oldest old inhabitants (ages 80+) will quadruple in the coming decades.</p>
<p>These demographic developments have placed the generous German welfare system under pressure and have led to doubts being expressed about its sustainability. The main challenges to the system are the high degree of reallocation of resources to the elderly via public pensions and the large public health care expenditures. However, not all levels of government have to shoulder these fiscal burdens to the same extent. Because of their differing revenue and cost structures, a separate examination of each of these levels becomes necessary.</p>
<p>So far, there have been relatively few studies on federalism and population aging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091142112439225">Lee and Edwards (2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091142112439225">Lee and Tuljapurkar (1998</xref>), and Edwards estimated the fiscal impact of population aging for the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091142112439225">Lee and Tuljapurkar (1998</xref>) used stochastic population forecasts, with a focus on predicting Social Security expenditures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091142112439225">Lee and Edwards (2002</xref>) analyzed the cost of education programs for the young and of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for the elderly and projected the expenditures separately for the different levels of government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091142112439225">Edwards (2010</xref>) used the age-specific utilization information obtained from the National Transfer Accounts project for the United States.</p>
<p>For Germany, comparable studies were carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091142112439225">Seitz, Freigang, and Kempkes (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091142112439225">Seitz and Kempkes (2007)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091142112439225">Seitz (2008)</xref>. Their research focused on sustainability estimations for sub-budgets of the government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1091142112439225">Werding and Blau (2002)</xref> elaborated on the pension system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091142112439225">Werding (2008)</xref> extended the research to expenditures for health care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091142112439225">Baum and Seitz (2003)</xref> analyzed how demographic change affects education expenditures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091142112439225">Bach et al. (2002)</xref> examined in detail the issue of how tax revenues are changing due to shifts in the age structure of the German population. However, research that has mainly concentrated on expenditures for the elderly disregards the fact that municipalities will face different financial realities than the federal or state governments due to differing financial obligations. As population age structure and utilization patterns are the key determinants for fiscal flows, it is crucial to study this topic using the most detailed data set available on per capita utilization of public transfer flows. The research carried out by Seitz et al. (2005) provided estimates of all public expenditures and to a lesser extent revenues by level of government, as is therefore similar to the aim in this article. They used a very broad and simple age indicator matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091142112439225">Hofmann, Kempkes, and Seitz 2008</xref>). The age indicator matrix provided values for seven age groups (pooling ages 0–6, 6–18, 18–30, 30–50, 50–65, 65–80, and 80+), with some of them, such as social assistance, being more refined; and some of them, such as education, having reasonable values of between 0 and 1. These broad age groups do not account for policy changes that affect more narrow age spans, such as changes in the retirement age or the length of schooling, or the ending of compulsory military service. This article seeks to amend this work using the most detailed and empirically validated data set available for Germany. We will see that this greater detail leads us to reach somewhat different conclusions about the effects of population aging.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the approach taken in this article is that all age profiles are empirically validated for all kinds of variables and are available by single years of age for Germany. This is possible because the estimates draw upon the rich NTA data set, which provides the most detailed set of information on transfers and consumption by age for Germany. This approach is especially useful for studying the sub-budgets of the government, such as education or long-term care, where we observe very volatile age profiles changing dramatically from age to age. Here, the university profile of other studies pools ages twenty / twenty-eight and values the ages equally, assigning them each a one. This fails to take into account that, according to the single-year profile, the main expenditures are from ages twenty / twenty-five, and that relatively little is spent per capita in this category after these ages. Thus, in the single-year approach, the relative cost incurred by each age group is less biased. This means that, even if the overall change in results is not large, the proposed procedure works better for detailed sub-budgets of the government. Another example is birth-related costs: here, the broad age groups mask high costs in the first year by equally distributing them to zero- to six-year-olds. In addition, all of the information on public transfer flows in the vast data set of the NTAs has been empirically validated and macro-adjusted, consistent with the National Income and Product Accounts. The data set therefore allows for the analysis of smaller changes in the individual lifecycle and their consequences, such as a shortening of the education period by one year or a postponement of the utilization of long-term care by the same time horizon. With this method, it is also very easy to show changes over time and to demonstrate how the profiles change for each year of micro data that are available.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. Methods and Data section presents the data and methods used to calculate the effect of changes in the age structure on the different levels of government. Results section provides the detailed age utilization patterns by level of government and single years of age. The estimated profiles are used to predict future imbalances by level of government due to demographic changes in The Future section, which is followed by the Discussion and Conclusion section.</p>

<title>Methods and Data</title>
<p>To illustrate the impact of changes in the age structure on the public transfer flows by level of government, a decomposition of government revenues and expenditures by age and level of government is necessary. The Federal Republic of Germany is composed of sixteen Länder and over 400 local municipalities with varying financial obligations and revenue sources. In addition, social security has a separate budget financed through contributions paid by employers and employees for public pensions, health and long-term care, and unemployment insurance. Whenever the contributions are insufficient, the social security system receives federal supplementary grants. The three levels of government are tightly interwoven in a complex equalization scheme that reallocates resources in case of budget shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091142112439225">Seitz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091142112439225">Ragnitz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1091142112439225">Werner and Shah 2005</xref>).</p>

Cash transfers include public pensions, transfers for sickness and disability, child and family-related benefits, housing allowances, and other social protection expenditures. Profiles by single years of age for all monetary transfer items are based on the benefits reported in the survey as public transfer inflows to the individual.</p>
<p>The data I draw upon to illustrate the age dependency of public transfers are provided by the NTA project database. Detailed information about the age utilization of public expenditures and revenues by single years of age is provided in the database for Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1091142112439225">Kluge 2009</xref>). The public transfer flows are decomposed by age and type of spending in a detailed manner. The NTA database quantifies public and private interage reallocations in a cross-sectional, one-year flow account. The theoretical roots have been provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091142112439225">Samuelson (1958</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091142112439225">Diamond (1965</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091142112439225">Lee (1994</xref>). Three pieces of data are needed to construct NTAs: a micro survey providing the age utilization profiles, population estimates, and macro controls to adjust the micro profiles to fit the UN System of National Accounts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1091142112439225">2</xref>
</sup> The macro controls are obtained from the national accounts of the corresponding year. The sixteen Länder detailed accounts are available on the Länder level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1091142112439225">Statistische Ämter der Länder 2008</xref>). The population estimates are available in one-year age groups provided by the German Federal Statistical Office (FSO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091142112439225">Statistisches Bundesamt 2009</xref>). The micro-level survey data are obtained from the German Income and Expenditure Survey (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe or EVS). The EVS is conducted every five years by the FSO and is based on a representative quota sample of Germany’s private households. The EVS includes a detailed account of income, consumption, transfers, savings, and assets. The EVS of 2003 includes around 50,000 households made up of some 127,000 individuals. The survey is representative of households with a monthly net income of less than 18,000 euros. The EVS does not include very wealthy households (70,000 of 38.1 million households), persons with no permanent residence, or the institutionalized population. (For a methodological overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1091142112439225">Statistisches Bundesamt [2005]</xref>). For three months, participating households keep a detailed book of household accounts that covers every kind of potential income and expenditure.</p>
<p>All of the income variables and monetary public transfer inflows and outflows are available in the EVS data set by single individuals. Inflows are reported from the point of the individual and include all transfers from the government to the individuals or households, while the opposite is done for outflows. The age-specific variables are adjusted to the corresponding macro control of each level to ensure the national representativeness of the per capita profiles according to the National Accounts. Depending on how many levels share the expenditures for an expense item, we use one to four macro controls (federal, state, local government, and social security).</p>

<p>Age-specific estimates for in-kind transfers are obtained from official records about health, education, and other. Age-specific expenditures for education are estimated by summing up unit costs per student per level of school<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1091142112439225">3</xref>
</sup> weighted by the number of students in each level. The utilization profile that helps to distribute health care costs by age is given by the costs of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1091142112439225">Statistisches Bundesamt 2007</xref>). Other social security in-kind transfers include all items except education and health care, which vary by age; for example, the costs of vocational training or benefits from accident insurance that are granted in-kind. The category “other” contains the remaining nonage-specific costs that have a flat distribution over the synthetic lifecycle.</p>
<p>The macro controls for public transfers are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142112439225">table 1</xref>. Total in-kind transfers amount to 416 billion euros. The main share is borne by social security and is related to health benefits. The second highest expenditure is shouldered by the Länder. They pay predominantly for the young and middle-aged; with education being the most prominent item. The same holds true for the municipalities, but here other in-kind social protections play important roles. About one-third of the expenditures are nonage-specific and are thus equally distributed to all German citizens. The non-age-specific expenditures are concentrated in the federal budget, which finances national defense and public infrastructure.</p>

<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142112439225">table 1</xref> presents the monetary public transfers distributed to household members. All of the costs are age-specific and are calculated using their corresponding micro-profile obtained from the Income and Expenditure Survey. The main expenditures are for social security, followed by payments to the federal, Länder, and local governments. The expenditures on family and children include student support and child-rearing allowances. Social protection consists of basic social welfare and housing benefits. The category “other” includes costs for prisons, detainees, and coal-mining subsidies, which are paid for by the Länder, and for war victim compensation, which is the responsibility of the federal government. The pensions category includes not only public pensions from the contributory pension scheme but also civil servants’ pensions in the budgets of the levels of government. The federal special fund includes benefits for railway workers and post office employees.</p>
<p>Public revenues are age-varying as well, although the shape of the age profiles is not as diverse as for public benefits. The lion’s share of public revenues is collected from the working-age population through labor taxes and social security contributions from gainful employment. The decreasing number of persons of working age will diminish public revenues considerably. The public revenues for each level are given by<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1091142112439225">

<p>Additionally, each level is entitled to collect certain taxes exclusively. The federal government receives revenues from taxes on insurance, alcohol, coffee, tobacco, and energy and electricity. Another important tax on the federal level is the solidarity surcharge, which is intended to finance infrastructure improvements in the east. From 2009 onward, the federal government has also collected all revenues from the motor vehicle tax. The German Länder receive the revenues from inheritance, capital transfer, and real estate transfer taxes, as well as taxes from lotteries and beer consumption. Municipalities’ revenues are generated by land and excise taxes and by taxes for owning a second home or for owning a dog.</p>
<p>The section concludes by presenting information about the micro-profiles used for the respective form of tax revenue by level of government (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1091142112439225">table 3</xref>). Most of the revenues, such as those from taxes on the main consumption items or tobacco, can clearly be attributed to the corresponding consumption, while others, such as market selling or current transfers, had to be assumed to follow the general tax profile, as more detailed information on utilization by age is unavailable. Another drawback of this method is that it is not possible to use the consolidated profile for the total government, because it is not possible to identify which budgets the intragovernmental flows belong to. The income tax is shared among the three levels and follows the individual income tax profile as reported in the survey. This also holds true for the solidarity surcharge, which is a share of income taxes. The profile of income from self-employment serves as a foundation for excise taxes at the local level only. The profile of interest, dividends, and rents combined is used to allocate taxes on property and profits, corporate income, capital transfers, and land. The general consumption profile is employed to allocate value-added, insurance, energy and electricity, and motor vehicle taxes. Indeed, even children pay taxes according to their share of consumption of these items. The consumption levels of tobacco, coffee, and alcohol are taken separately from the survey; and the respective consumption amounts are allocated to various taxes on alcohol, spirits, beer, coffee, and tobacco.</p>

<p>The current section presents the per capita age profiles for the different levels of government in detail. To construct them, the same differentiation that was used for the NTA estimations was used here as well. Hence, public in-kind consumption and public transfer cash in- and outflows are displayed separately. First, public consumption that is given in the form of in-kind transfers to German citizens is illustrated. It amounted to 416 billion euros in 2003, with social security contributing the lion’s share, or 40.4 percent; followed by the German Länder, which was responsible for 28.4 percent. Local and federal governments mainly covered “other” expenditures which are equally distributed by age, as they primarily include national defense and expenditures for the police.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1091142112439225">Figure 1</xref> shows the total public consumption by level of government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1091142112439225">5</xref>
</sup> The profiles of both the Länder and the local governments show that the main public consumption expenditures concentrated on the young are for education, with everything else being negligible or nonage dependent. The local profile starts to rise a little earlier because of the slightly higher expenditures on kindergarten. From age twenty, the costs at the Länder level remain on a little plateau due to tertiary education. The small rise at older ages for the synthetic cohort is attributable to long-term care costs. The federal government’s consumption is unaffected by population aging, as the government only provides in-kind services that are assumed to be nonage dependent. Social security is mainly affected by an aging population in the public consumption budget due to health and long-term care expenditures. The profile rises substantially, from around 4,000 euros per capita at age seventy-five to 10,000 euros per capita for a ninety-year-old. A third of these expenditures can be attributed to long-term care provision.</p>

<p>Public consumption only includes in-kind benefits granted to German citizens. In addition, public monetary transfers from social security can be decomposed into pension benefits for old age, health and long-term care, accident insurance, and unemployment benefits; which together amounted to 301 billion euros in monetary transfers in 2003. Of this sum, 222 billion euros were provided by social contributions paid by employers and employees, and 79 billion euros came from subsidies from the federal government to the social security system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1091142112439225">Figure 2</xref> shows the monetary benefits provided by social security. The main expenditure is for the elderly; children do not receive cash transfers from social security. Expenditures for accident and health cash transfers are negligible. Monetary long-term care expenditures are most prevalent after age eighty-five. Public pensions dominate in the age range sixty-five to eighty-five. At the end of the age range, the public pension profile decreases, as mainly women are still alive, many of whom receive widows’ pensions or smaller public pensions. Unemployment benefits are highest at ages forty-five to sixty, and decrease at later ages because many people choose to retire early. The overall profile is greatly dominated by expenditures for the elderly. More than 80 percent of the social security budget is spent on individuals of retirement age. Because of the aging of the population, this raises pressing questions about the sustainability of the German welfare state.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1091142112439225">Figure 3</xref> depicts total monetary transfers by level of government and social security. The total cash transfers of the federal government are dominated by expenditures for the elderly, due to federal supplementary payments to social security. As early as in 2003, the social security budget had a shortfall of 79 billion euros, and needed funding to supplement the contributions by employers and employees. The main expenditures are on pensions: more than 90 percent of the subsidies are used to finance public old-age benefits. The federal age profile shows a rise at younger ages due to expenditures for child allowances and is flat in the other categories. The payment of unemployment benefits leads to an increase in payments for people ages forty-five and above. High values are then seen as civil servants start to collect pensions from around age sixty-three, in addition to the federal supplementary grants. The remaining benefits, such as child-raising allowances (<italic>Erziehungsgeld</italic>), play only a negligible role on a per capita basis. The Länder governments’ high expenditures are concentrated on the young, as the Länder finance a share of child allowances, and on the elderly, due to civil servants’ pensions. The small peak for ages twenty to thirty includes student loans. Social security and housing subsidies are distributed relatively equally and amount to small values per capita. In total, the cash profile of the Länder is most affected by demographic change, as their expenditures are solely concentrated on children and the elderly. In contrast to the federal authorities, the Länder might be able to realize savings in the future as the number of children of school age is expected to decline, and social security payments for the middle-aged are likely to decrease due to the contraction of the labor force and better employment prospects for the young elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091142112439225">Garloff, Pohl, and Schanne 2011</xref>). The municipalities’ overall profile is almost flat by age. Higher expenditures for the young are displaced by basic social welfare payments concentrated on ages twenty to fifty. The profile increases slightly at later ages due to civil servants’ pensions. For the local governments, which pay a portion of social security and housing subsidies, expenditure increases might be especially high in the east. Due to high unemployment rates and disruptions in their working lives, individuals in the east face a higher risk than do their counterparts in the west of needing these services. As is shown in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1091142112439225">figure 2</xref>, the main expenditures for the elderly are shouldered by the social security system.</p>

I included them to ensure consistency, even though the magnitudes are rather small and the future pathway of these inflows is unclear. Undoubtedly, the main expenditures are on people ages 60 and older. Expenditures on a child in secondary school are about one-quarter of the amount transferred to a 60- to 80-year-old. The middle-aged receive only relatively minor transfers, mainly through child-related benefits or unemployment payments. Overall, the German welfare state is reallocating a substantial share of resources to the elderly. Nevertheless, the main expenditures of Länder and local governments are concentrated on the young. These levels will, due to low fertility, see a decrease in their expenditures. Whether they will be able to balance their budgets depends on the development of their revenues, as these vary by age as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1091142112439225">figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>For all levels, distinctions were made between taxes on employment income, self-employment income, assets, general consumption, tobacco, and alcohol. A general tax profile for miscellaneous inflows is presented separately. Because the general consumption profile includes all private consumption, children are also counted as paying taxes on consumption.</p>
<p>The tax revenues of the federal government are concentrated on the middle age groups, as income taxes and revenues from self-employed individuals are highest in this age group, as is tobacco consumption. The young and elderly almost exclusively pay taxes on consumption. An almost analogue picture is presented for Länder revenues. The share from joint taxes is comparable to that of federal revenues. The share of value-added tax (VAT) is almost equal for the federal and Länder governments. The main difference in inflows from consumption is due to high federal revenues from insurance and energy taxes, which are based on consumption, and can add up to a significant difference depending on age. Of similar importance are taxes on assets for the Länder, which are mainly borne by the young elderly. Local governments predominantly generate inflows through income taxes and revenues from excise taxes. Another important source of revenue is market selling and current transfers from other levels. Current transfers from other levels of government are allocated according to the general tax profile. Among the other taxes are taxes on second homes and dog ownership, which account for a negligible share of revenues. Social security inflows are dominated by social contributions paid by people of working age, and to some extent by the elderly via contributions for public health care. Another important source, which is expected to increase further, is the general tax profile (federal supplement). For all levels, the major revenues are generated by persons aged thirty to forty-nine. This dependency on paid labor will, due to the projected shrinking of the population of working age, lead to a substantial decrease in government revenues in the future. Still, the net transfers to the elderly have in the past decreased rather than increased. This can be seen by comparing the NTA estimates for 1978, 1993, and 2003. Even the introduction of long-term care insurance in 1995 could not offset the reduced net transfers due to changes in the health care contribution for the elderly.</p>
<p>From a per-capita perspective, net flows to the government only occur from ages twenty-three to sixty-one. All other age groups are, on average, receiving more than they are giving. Overall, the public transfer system reallocates resources to the elderly. The mean age at which transfers are received is, at fifty-two, five years older than the mean age at which transfers are paid for. The main reason for this discrepancy is the upward reallocation of public transfers in the form of public pensions, for which the mean age of receipt is seventy-one. A smaller amount of resources are transferred to the young; the mean age at which education is received is sixteen. All other transfers and remaining social protections are mainly redistributed intragenerationally, with the mean ages of in- and outflows being almost identical.</p>
<p>The age profiles by single age and level of government for public transfer in- and outflows are provided at a consolidated level. All expenditures are available with a greater degree of decomposition, which shows various kinds of social welfare payments and family benefits. These can be valuable for predicting the size of the sub-budgets of the government. Such estimates can be especially important, as the presented method can provide information for individual Länder separately if the demographic and macro numbers are available. Thus, the method could also be used to predict future interstate flows, and could also be applied to other unions, such as the European Union. The following section makes use of the overall profiles and shows how these can be used to forecast future government revenues and expenditures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1091142112439225">
<title>The Future</title>
<p>Future expenditures and revenues are projected showing the pure demographic impact on the public finances via two channels: the different age profiles of revenues and the expenditures by level of government and declining population. The aim is to isolate the demographic impact on government in- and outflows. The experiment assumes that the age-specific profiles stay constant over time and that all variables such as wages, expenditures, and so on, grow at the same rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1091142112439225">6</xref>
</sup> This is a bold assumption, but it will help us understand the magnitude of the gap between revenues and expenditures, assuming the current general political conditions prevail in the future. The results will point to potential reform options and will also show for which elements of benefit expenditures the inflows will not be sufficient without adjustments to the system. The age profiles in the future are contrasted with the in- and outflow profiles for the year 2003. In the base year, all expenditures meet the macro controls from the National Accounts. For the future, I allow for discrepancies between them to show potential borrowing requirements. The results show the separate budget gaps and the potential need for the reallocation of tax revenue.</p>
<p>In this pure demographic scenario, public consumption is predicted to decrease for all three levels of government. The federal level only realizes marginal cost reductions (from 46 billion euros in 2003 to 44 billion euros in 2050), as national defense and infrastructure are assumed to be pure public goods which would not decrease if the population were to shrink. At the same time, the consumption by state (118 billion euros in 2003 to 92 billion euros in 2050) and local governments (83 billion euros in 2003 to 74 billion euros in 2050) will decrease considerably due to the lower number of children in all age groups, as education is their main expenditure. Only social security faces a 12 percent increase in expenditures, as a higher number of elderly will utilize health and long-term care services.</p>
<p>Public monetary transfers increase slightly until around 2040 for federal and state governments, and decrease thereafter. The first increase at the federal level results mainly from civil servants’ pensions and the special fund for postal and railway workers. Furthermore, it includes child and family benefits but not the federal supplementary grant to social security. In 2050, when the baby boomers are gone, federal expenditures will be 3 billion euros lower than today’s values. A similar decline will be experienced by the German Länder, with the main drivers again being pensions for civil servants and, to a lesser extent, social assistance in old age. Local governments could decrease expenditures by 3 billion euros due to age structure changes. They provide monetary transfers mainly to the young and middle-aged. Only the expenditures for social security cash transfers will increase significantly, from 301 billion euros to 389 billion euros (including a fixed federal supplementary payment of 82 billion euros). Most of the expenditures will be for public pensions, but public health expenditures are also becoming increasingly important. While the demographic factor in the German pension formula will scale future pensions downward (the result here is the demographic worst-case scenario under current conditions) and not allow them to increase considerably, this pressure does not apply to public health and long-term care. In 2050, these expenditures will be of a similar or greater magnitude.</p>
<p>The projection of revenues by level of government is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1091142112439225">table 4</xref>. No level of government can rely on increasing or stable tax revenues in the future. In the static scenario, federal, state, and local governments will have to cope with decreases in revenues of around 20 percent. Between 2003 and 2050, the federal government’s revenues are projected to decrease from 277 to 221 billion euros, and the state government’s revenues are expected to decline from 261 to 207 billion euros. The projections take into account the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge through 2019 by gradually melting off the per capita profile. Local revenues will fall from 150 billion euros to 117 billion euros. Social contributions will decrease even further, and the inflows in 2050 will only reach 76 percent of today’s values. This dramatic decrease in revenues will put severe financial pressure on the welfare system as it is designed now, and in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Total expenditures, revenues, and expected budget gap were further estimated for lower- and upper-bound population projections. The budget gap documents the real observed budget gap for the year 2003, excluding interest on the public debt. In the future, the gap is expected to increase, especially for the federal government and most acutely for social security. Relative to their revenues, the expected budget gap will also pose a severe challenge for Länder and local governments. In the medium population forecast, the gap is growing, especially at the federal level, with social security adding up to a substantial percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The lower population projection, which does not assume a large increase in life expectancy, results in slightly lower levels of expenditures, while the revenues remain almost unaffected. Here, the overall gap decreases by 1.5 percentage points relative to GDP. The upper population projection, which assumes an increase in fertility to 1.6, does not relieve pressure on the budget, even though public revenues will be slightly higher. The savings are eaten up by a large increase in life expectancy. An even bigger budget gap is anticipated with the scenario of a higher TFR, due to large health expenditures for newborns and education expenditures for the young. The latter scenario puts greater pressure on state and local budgets than on the federal budget.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1091142112439225">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the relative expenditure shares for the different levels. The federal supplementary grant to social security is frozen at today’s values, thus increasing expenditures for the public pensions, health care, and long-term care that are financed by employer and employee contributions. The relative shares of expenditures show the relative expansion of the social security budget. Whereas in 2010, 62 percent of the expenditures were borne by the three levels of government and 38 percent by social security, the share borne by the levels will decrease to around 50 percent in 2050. The main drivers of this decline are rising expenditures on public pensions and health and long-term care, while substantial savings are realized for unemployment and accident insurance. Within the three levels, the balance of expenditures is subject to change as well. In 2010, the federal budget reported the highest expenditures (41 percent), while the Länder (38 percent) and local (20 percent) governments were responsible for smaller shares. Gradually, the share of expenditures allocated to the federal government will increase by four percentage points, while the shares allocated to the Länder and local governments will decrease slightly, by three and one percentage points, respectively (assuming the middle population projection, W2-1). The decrease will be due to lower expenditures on the young and middle-aged for education and social assistance, as the number of inhabitants of those ages declines. Because it is responsible for the federal supplementary grant and fixed costs for public consumption on defense and infrastructure, the federal level will experience a moderate increase in expenditures.</p>

<p>The changing shares indicate the need for restructuring over the coming decades. The overall share of expenditures borne by the federal, Länder, and local governments is expected to decrease from 62 percent to 53 percent. Among the three governmental units, the expenditure shares are expected to change. The relative expenditures of local governments will remain stable and even fall, with the budget being balanced at around 2 percent VAT today and 1.7 percent in the future. Meanwhile, the relationship between the federal and Länder governments will change considerably. Today, the two levels have comparable shares of VAT revenue (49.48 percent for federal and 48.45 percent for Länder in 2003). The expansion of federal expenditures relative to the remaining expenditures would mean that the federal government would have a 53 percent share of the VAT taxes, and the Länder would see their share of VAT tax revenues decline to 45 percent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1091142112439225">7</xref>
</sup> These shares may change if the federal supplementary grant to social security continues to grow. This would mean higher costs at the federal level, and an even greater need for reallocation toward this program. Given the expenditure profiles of social security, the question arises of how expenditures, as well as social security contribution rates, will develop under the balanced budget assumption. The results do not show any surprises, and the contribution rates lie within the ranges of other studies.</p>
<p>The public sector will experience an increase in expenditures, while government revenues will decrease significantly due to the lower number of individuals of prime working and taxpaying age. I refrain from going into further detail about how the age profiles that were fixed in the static simulation could change. The profiles can be subject to participation effects: for example, changes could occur in the number of students enrolled in tertiary education, or in the share of civil servants reaching retirement age, which would be tax financed (Seitz 2008). Furthermore, the possibilities of revenue growth or changes in policy change have so far been disregarded. Instead, I have focused on the pure demographic effect on government revenues and expenditures using the empirically validated and very detailed age-specific utilization information from the NTA project. Nevertheless, the future direction of government finances is predetermined. The main challenge will be to successfully generate public revenues without only soaking the working population. Still, the method works very well as a baseline scenario and can be refined in the future.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The research presented here is embedded in the literature on fiscal federalism and demography, and addresses the question of how revenues and expenditures at the different levels of government and social security will be separately affected by the aging of the population. In conducting my analysis, I used the detailed age utilization information obtained from the NTA project and decomposed them by entity in charge of financing. My findings suggested that the public sector will experience an increase in expenditures, and government revenues decrease due to the smaller number of individuals of prime working and taxpaying age. While expenditures will increase overall, the separate levels of government and social security will have different financial obligations due to their differing cost and revenue structures. The federal government is hardly affected by population aging, as it mainly provides services that are allocated equally over the life span, such as national defense or public administration. The increasing costs at the federal level are attributable to increases in supplementary grants to social security. The social security system will face a substantial increase in expenditures in the two main areas of public pensions and health care. Today’s contribution rates are insufficient to balance the budget, and general taxes will therefore have to be reallocated to social security. By contrast, state and local governments will have decreasing costs, as their main expenditures are on educating the young. Social support for middle-aged individuals is likely to decrease due to the lower number of persons of benefit-receiving ages. The savings realized by the favorable age structure changes are not expected to be offset by increased liabilities for civil servants’ pensions or higher expenditures on costs related to long-term care.</p>
<p>The predicted direction of change in the overall budget is consistent with the projections of Seitz (2008), but there are substantial differences in magnitude between our findings, probably because the NTA age profiles use single years of age, while the other studies use six broader age groups. My results indicated that the federal government will face an 8 percent increase in expenditures through 2030, or 60 percent more than the 5 percent increase predicted by Seitz et al. According to my analysis, the Länder savings through 2030 will amount to −7 percent, in line with the projections of Seitz et al., while local savings will only amount to 6 percent through 2030, or 40 percent less than the 10 percent predicted by Seitz et al. (Seitz 2008). If the time horizon of the simulation is extended to 2050, the federal budget reaches the benchmark of 2003, while state (−13) and local governments expenditures (−15) decrease considerably. Overall, the aging of the population will have a more negative effect on the Länder and local authorities than was reported in earlier studies. In addition to the finances of the levels of government, future social security expenditures were projected. These will increase by 22 percent and will put the social security system but also federal government providing supplementary grants under pressure.</p>
<p>The static simulation in this analysis shows that the change in the age structure will reduce government revenues by about 20 percent by 2050; a decrease that was not predicted by Seitz et al. This study is the first to calculate the budget gaps by level of government in a single coherent set of estimates. The baseline scenario is close to the values found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091142112439225">Bach et al. (2002</xref>), who showed that direct taxes will decrease by 18 percent and that total tax revenue will fall by 16.4 percent. Here, I predict a 20 percent decrease for federal and state governments, an even greater reduction of around two percentage points for local governments. Social security contributions will only reach 75 percent of today’s values, according to this analysis. The static experiment is an approximate estimation for future revenues. Nevertheless, it disregards a number of facts. The estimates for 2003 in my basic scenario illustrate the age revenue profile under the current conditions of 2003. As an important subsequent policy change has implemented deferred taxation for retirees, income taxes will rise substantially for older individuals in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to stress that this basic model is a first attempt to assess the impact of population aging on the levels of government and social security separately using the rich NTA data. With this decomposition method, it would also be possible to construct profiles for the individual states within Germany, though only the aggregate profile for all states was shown here. Knowing the macro controls for each state will enable researchers to take a closer look at the future of each state, as demographic and economic parameters differ significantly across them. This baseline version also neglects policy changes, changes in the economy, and behavioral changes that would be visible in changes in the age profiles. It could therefore be fruitful for future researchers to think about possible pathways of changes in the profiles and probable policy reforms, and to contrast them with the baseline scenario, assuming the institutional framework of 2003 prevails in the future. The future gap in government finances in this static experiment seems to be substantial and raises concerns about the sustainability of government finances in the future. It assumes, however, that no policy adjustments will be made, and the scenario described here represents the worst case that could occur as a result of the dramatic changes in age structure projected over the coming four decades in Germany.</p>

<p>Some adjustments had to be made contrary to the conventional NTA methodology to account for the utilization by age in a more suitable manner. Thus, the expenditures on education include not only schools and universities but also kindergartens and after-school care. Child allowances are attributed to the children. Health expenditures include long-term care granted as in-kind in the estimates. Further information is unavailable on other social protection expenditures in public in-kind transfers. These include long-term care costs, which are deducted in the social protection profile and added to health care costs. The remaining share of slightly less than 60 billion was divided into two parts. The one part that is age dependent follows the health care profile, as a significant share are benefits from public health insurance. The other half is assumed to be equally distributed per capita, as it includes expenditures for dental treatments, and is added to other public expenditures that are nonage dependent.</p>
