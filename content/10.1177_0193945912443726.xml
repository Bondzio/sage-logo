<p><bold>Sally Lusk, PhD, RN, FAAN, FAAOHN,</bold> President and Founder, MNRS Foundation; Professor Emerita, School of Nursing, University of Michigan</p>
<p>Dr. Lusk’s research addresses a major national health problem, noise-induced hearing loss in occupational settings. Health care costs associated with occupational hearing loss exceed US$150 million annually. Hearing loss diminishes quality of life by interfering with social relationships, results in social isolation, leads to accidents due to lack of sensitivity to approaching dangers, and contributes to depression from failure to participate in important life activities. Dr. Lusk was a visionary in developing and testing a hearing protection program that is tailored to each individual worker and is accessible by computer in any work setting or shift. Before her retirement in 2003, Dr. Lusk had received over US$6.5 million in research funding from the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH), and United Auto Workers/General Motors (UAW/GM) to explore, test, and refine this innovative hearing protection intervention program. Dr. Lusk found that acute noise exposure was positively associated with higher blood pressure and heat rates. Results of her research have been published in over 80 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals such as <italic>Nursing Research, AAOHN Journal, Research in Nursing and Health</italic>, the <italic>American Journal of Health Promotion, Psychological Reports</italic>, and <italic>Human Factors</italic>. An internationally recognized expert in occupational health, Dr. Lusk received the Distinguished Research Award from MNRS, the Mary Louise Brown Research Recognition Award from the American Association of Occupational Health, and the Distinguished Alumni Award from Indiana University School of Nursing for excellence in research. Dr. Lusk, as a Fellow in the American Academy of Nursing (AAN), was selected as the AAN Senior Scholar to work in Washington DC to impact nursing research policy and occupational health policy. Through her work at the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ), Dr. Lusk influenced the promulgation of community health and preventive services guidelines. Dr. Lusk’s research on worker behaviors and perceptions resulted in changes to NIOSH policies and activities. She served as President of MNRS and, after completing her term, led the development of the MNRS Foundation. Working with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Lusk established innovative programs to support research in the Midwest such as the Founders Circle, Anniversary Circle, and Pillars of Excellence. The Foundation is moving toward a goal of a US$1 million endowment to provide a solid base of support for dissertation grants for students and seed grants to support young nurse investigators in the Midwest.</p>

<p><bold>Rosemary White-Traut, PhD, RN, FAAN</bold>, Professor and Department Head, College of Nursing, University of Illinois (UIC) at Chicago</p>
<p>Since 1983, Dr. White-Traut’s research has focused on the behavioral, developmental, and neurohormonal responses of at-risk infants to a multisensory intervention named ATVV (Auditory, Tactile, Visual, and Vestibular Intervention). This 15-min intervention incorporates auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular stimuli and is administered based on each infant’s behavioral and physiologic cues. At-risk premature infants are likely to benefit from ATW as they face the challenge of lower capacity for behavioral alertness and prefeeding behavioral cues, difficulty with oral feeding, immature autonomic function, alterations in patterns of social interaction, and delayed development. Infants who received ATW have consistently shown improved behavioral outcomes and up shorter hospital stays, significantly reducing costs. Dr. White-Traut’s publications have advanced the field conceptually and contributed to the evidence to support clinical practice for at-risk premature infants and full-term neonates. Her work has been funded by the NINR, the Hewlett Packard Company, Alcoa Foundation, Harris Foundation, and Gould Corporation. Studies funded by the National Association of Neonatal Nurses, Sigma Tau International, the Alpha Lambda Chapter, and the UIC Campus Research Board allowed Dr. White-Traut to confirm that ATW facilitates prefeeding behavior, prefeeding behavioral cues, and feeding efficiency. She received the Outstanding Clinical Research Award from the Nurses Association of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 1992, the Nurse Scientist Recognition Award from NINR in 1999, and the Jonas Salk Award for Leadership in Research from the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation in 2009. Dr. White-Traut has mentored over 50 master’s students, chaired 15 dissertation committees, and served as a member on 20 committees. With support of the Harris Foundation, she funded five postdoctoral fellows, three of whom she has mentored.</p>

<p><bold>Jody Lori, PhD, CNM, FACNM,</bold> Clinical Assistant Professor, Division of Health Promotion and Risk Reduction Programs; Director, Office of Global Outreach and Deputy Director, World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center; School of Nursing, University of Michigan</p>
<p>Dr. Lori’s fieldwork in sub-Saharan Africa provides a strong base for her program of research. She has worked independently and within interprofessional groups bringing the unique perspectives of nursing and midwifery to policy development. The key policy issues driving her research are the half million maternal deaths, over 3 million stillbirths, and 3 million early neonatal deaths that occur each year worldwide—with 99% occurring in low-resource countries. The purpose of her program of research is to develop models of care for improved maternal and newborn health through a program of participatory action research in low-resource countries. Dr. Lori’s ability to conduct robust studies has contributed to the development of the science of sustainable, community-driven, community-based models of care and influenced both policy and practice. She has current funding for six projects including National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Fogarty and the <italic>United States Agency for International Development</italic> (USAID). Her research findings have been translated into practice and policy in Liberia and Ghana, West Africa. Her study of maternal morbidity and mortality in Liberia resulted in the development of a maternal mortality review tool and process now used by the Ministry of Health, providing the ministry with data for targeted programs to reduce maternal mortality. Her current work addresses increasing skilled attendants at delivery.</p>

<p><bold>Norma Metheny, PhD, RN, FAAN,</bold> Dorothy Votsmier Endowed Chair, Professor and Associate Dean for Research, St. Louis University</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, Dr. Metheny’s research has been devoted to identifying methods to minimize risks associated with tube feedings. Most of her work has focused on critically ill patients who primarily rely on this method for their nutrient intake. Over the course of her research career, she has evaluated methods to determine when feedings are correctly positioned as well as methods to detect and prevent aspiration. Results from her studies, funded since 1987 by the NINR, have been published in a wide variety of nursing and medical journals and textbooks. In addition, Dr. Metheny’s research has informed, and is cited in, national and international guidelines developed by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing, and the National Patient Safety Agency in the United Kingdom. Findings from her work have brought about significant improvements in the care of tube-fed patients. She served as a permanent member of the nursing research study section at the NIH for 7 years (1997-2001, 2009-2012) and as an ad hoc reviewer. Dr. Metheny is a reviewer for multiple nursing and medical journals and served as an Associate Editor for the <italic>Journal of Parenteral</italic> &amp; <italic>Enteral Nutrition</italic> and for <italic>Clinical Nursing Research.</italic></p>

<title>MNRS Foundation News</title>
<p>The Board of Trustees wishes to thank all who participated in and contributed to the fundraising activities of the Foundation at the annual conference. When the records are complete, we will publish the results from the Silent Auction, the FUNdraiser, and the Geocache. In order to raise the funds needed to maintain the Grants program, the Foundation also needs donations from members. As you renew your membership this summer, please be generous in your support of our Dissertation and Seed Grants.</p>
<p>MNRS was the leader among the regional research societies in funding research grants. We have a long record of providing competitive, peer-reviewed research grants to support dissertation and pilot work that is so important to continue. However, we can only do so through the contributions of our members or other donations. In addition to monies provided by our members, we want to reach out to external groups. Please send us the names of representatives of vendors from whom you purchase research supplies so that we may contact them to explore possibilities for support from those companies. Examples of nurse scientist customers should help us interest them in our grants program, so we need your assistance.</p>
<p>Look for updates from all the conference activities in the next issue.</p>
