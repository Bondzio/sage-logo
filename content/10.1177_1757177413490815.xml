<body>
<p>Back in the early 1990s the number of new infection control nurses (ICNs) in the NHS was steadily increasing, although more experienced ICNs were still relatively thin on the ground. At that time it was not uncommon at small gatherings for ICNs to share their experiences, with the topic of conversation turning to the most currently challenging infection control issues of the day. When this line of conversation was exhausted, the discussions more often turned to the silliest questions they had been asked, or the maddest situations that they had encountered. Something between a competition and a stand-up-comedy routine then ensued. For example, the ICNs would share the most unconventional locations in which they found the open disinfectant trays – mine was next to the tea tray by the biscuits. Some of the questions they had been asked included:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>‘How do you decontaminate a carpet in the labour suite?’</italic></p>
<p><italic>‘What is the little bottle on the top of the glutaraldehyde container for?’</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I also recall one ICN tell of overhearing a conversation between a ward sister and a student nurse on the correct way to decontamination a bath:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Student nurse:</speaker>
<p>‘<italic>Sister, how much disinfectant should I put in the bath</italic>?’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sister:</speaker>
<p><italic>Glug, glug, glug</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<p>Memory lane aside, difficult to decontaminate equipment continues to be a significant infection control issue for infection prevention and control teams (IPCTs). Although more types of equipment are now able to withstand autoclaving, significant challenges remain. Endoscopes are perhaps the most difficult of all medical devices to decontaminate, and to keep in a ready-for-next-patient state, before the next use. It is no surprise therefore that owing to: complexities in design, the numerous necessary steps in the decontamination procedure, the materials used in the endoscope composition and limitations in reprocessing options there have been so many endoscopy-related outbreaks reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757177413490815">Spach et al, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177413490815">Weber and Rutala, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757177413490815">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757177413490815">Seoane-Vazquez and Rodriguez-Monguio, 2008</xref>). The topic for Outbreak Column 9 is both <italic>infection</italic> and <italic>no-infection endoscopy-related outbreaks</italic>. See Outbreak Columns 7 and 8 for discussion on these categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177413490815">Curran, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177413490815">2013b</xref>).</p>
<p>Endoscopes are complicated multi-channelled instruments which are inserted deep into sometimes sterile areas of the body enabling any micro-organisms transferred on lumens, external surfaces, biopsy forceps or via contaminated fluids to be deposited therein. (Endogenous organisms can also be transferred into sterile body areas.) Even when not in sterile areas of the body, biopsies are taken which can cause some bleeding and provide an entry point for bacteria or viruses. There are many guidance documents from professional organisations and national bodies designed to set decontamination standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177413490815">MHRA Microbiology Advisory Committee (The MAC Manual), 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757177413490815">Rutala and Weber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177413490815">GRS Endoscope Decontamination Working Party, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177413490815">Petersen et al, 2011</xref>). There are frequent technical advances to both endoscopes and their sundry equipment, designed to either reduce the risk of cross-infection or to advance the investigation/therapeutic procedures that can be introduced in advance of professional guidance updates.</p>
<p>Reports in the literature attempt to reassure by stating that the incidence of infection after an endoscopy is ‘low’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413490815">Cetre et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757177413490815">Vergis et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757177413490815">Seoane-Vazquez and Rodriguez-Monguio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177413490815">GRS Endoscope Decontamination Working Party, 2009</xref>). This is true. However, what should also be acknowledged is that cross-transmission is probably much higher than reported and the ‘low risk’ assessment begs the question: what level of low is acceptable? The published outbreak reports indicate that endoscopy-related outbreaks are still occurring and merit significant IPCT investment in both prevention strategies and preparedness for investigations. More significantly, and discussed later in the column, there are reports of multi-resistant Gram negative organisms including NDM-1 Klebsiella spp and carbapenamase-producing <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, causing outbreaks via endoscopic equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413490815">Aumeran et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413490815">Alrabaa et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413490815">Koo et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There are excellent reviews of endoscopy-related outbreaks which I will not attempt to rewrite. Rather, from the findings of these reviews, I will categorise the different types of endoscopy-related outbreaks and provide examples illustrating how outbreaks in each category have arisen. In addition, from the published endoscopy-related outbreak reports, I will provide a checklist for where to look for the unsafe acts and most likely reservoirs. (Unsafe acts being eloquently described as ‘individual windows of opportunity’ which enable failures, in this case cross-transmission, to arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177413490815">Reason, 2008</xref>)). The checklist is not a comprehensive tool with which to audit an endoscopy system – rather, it is designed to be a <italic>first step investigation tool</italic> for use when an endoscopy-related outbreak is suspected locally. As always in outbreak management, while following a systematic process, IPCTs should take the fewest steps to get to the right answer and in doing so minimise the risk of any further cases, aid outbreak management and ensure swift resumption of normal services. Full endoscopy system audit tools, such as those produced by the Infection Prevention Society, are available; they can and should be used to prevent outbreaks by proactively testing the robustness of any endoscopy system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177413490815">GRS Endoscope Decontamination Working Party, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177413490815">Infection Prevention Society, 2012</xref>). A system in this instance comprises: people, environment, equipment, methods and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177413490815">Grant and Leavenworth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177413490815">Hinckley, 2001</xref>)).</p>
<sec id="section1-1757177413490815">
<title>Categorising endoscopy-related outbreaks</title>
<p>In their review of 25 (bronchoscopy) endoscopy-related outbreaks from 2000–2012, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757177413490815">Weber and Rutula (2012)</xref> list the steps in the endoscopy disinfection process and the mechanisms of failure therein as: a) cleaning, b) appropriate disinfectant, c) contact between disinfectant and contaminating microbes, d) rinse and prevention of recontamination. For outbreak investigations, however, it is perhaps easier to consider and investigate for possible errors by separating the procedure into the five key areas where <italic>failures of process</italic>, or <italic>failures to follow process</italic>, could have resulted in cross-contamination, cross-infection and outbreaks. These are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1757177413490815" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In-use scope contamination from sundry equipment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Defective scope inhibiting decontamination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Post-use, pre-disinfection process failure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Disinfection and/or rinse cycle failure (usually in an automated endoscopic reprocesser (AER))</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Post-decontamination and pre-scope reuse contamination</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The definitions along with examples of endoscopy-related outbreaks for each of these categories are given below:</p>
<sec id="section2-1757177413490815">
<title>1. In-use scope contamination from sundry equipment</title>
<p><bold>Definition:</bold> An effectively decontaminated scope is used. However, one or more of the sundries used in the endoscopy process, such as: biopsy forceps, local anaesthetic spray, syringe bungs, any fluids or ice, are contaminated. The contamination will, via subsequent scope contamination, either expose patients or patients’ specimens to contamination resulting in an endoscopy related-outbreak (one or more patients infected), no-infection outbreak (patients colonised) or pseudo-outbreak (patients’ specimens contaminated but patients not exposed to any outbreak organisms).</p>
<p><italic>Example 1</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177413490815">Schuetz et al (2009)</xref> describe an endoscopy-related outbreak caused by <italic>Legionella pneumophilia</italic>. The source of the organism was as you would suspect water. But it was not the rinse water supplied to the AER but the ice in an ice-machine used to cool uncapped syringes of sterile saline used in the procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177413490815">Schuetz et al, 2009</xref>). Extensive investigations of all equipment and water supplies in the endoscopy suite were required to find the source. This paper is reported as a ‘pseudo-outbreak’; however, within the text it states that ‘at least 1 patient was ill as a result of [the] contamination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177413490815">Schuetz et al, 2009</xref>). Consequently, the use of the term <italic>pseudo-outbreak</italic> is somewhat bewildering.</p>
<p><italic>Example 2</italic>: An investigation into a no-infection outbreak of <italic>Aureobasidium</italic> spp in nine patients identified the source as stopcocks, designated single-use but being routinely reused to cover sterile water used during the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757177413490815">Wilson et al, 2000</xref>). Cultures of stopcocks ‘post-disinfection’ [sic] identified a heavy growth of <italic>Aureobasidium</italic> spp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757177413490815">Wilson et al, 2000</xref>). This systematic error was identified by a close observation of practices as recommended in the Hospital Outbreak Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177413490815">Health Protection Scotland, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Example 3</italic>: A multidrug-resistant NDM-1 Klebsiella outbreak was identified in 12 patients and eventually sourced to a camera (housed on a rigid scope and of a type that could be fitted to flexible scopes). The camera was not routinely covered with a sheath and was decontaminated only by the use of detergent wipes. Three patients required treatment for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413490815">Koo et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177413490815">
<title>2. Defective endoscope inhibiting decontamination</title>
<p><bold>Definition</bold>: The scope itself is damaged; therefore even if a validated decontamination process is followed, effective decontamination will not be achieved.</p>
<p><italic>Example 1</italic>: In 2001, an alert signal was noted when a higher than expected number of BAL samples were found to be growing Enterobacteraceae. Most unusually the contamination was found with specific pairs of organisms: <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae/Proteus vulgaris</italic> (scope 11) and <italic>Morganella morganii/Proteus mirabili</italic>s (scope 12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413490815">Cetre et al, 2005</xref>). In total, in a 14-week period of 2001, 89/342 (26%) of BALs were found to be contaminated – all linked with scopes 11 and 12. The outbreak ceased when two implicated scopes were removed from use. Scope 11 was cultured and found to have the relevant paired organisms on two separate occasions after going through an effective decontamination process between sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413490815">Cetre et al, 2005</xref>). Samples from two patients taken post-procedure were still positive, which confirms patient exposure – the remaining 152 patients were not sampled post-scope – many were not cared for in the same institution post-scope. Eventually, successful decontamination enabled the scopes to go back in use, but two subsequent outbreaks followed shortly thereafter. Finally, the problem was attributed to a ‘potential looseness in the biopsy port housing’. Alert emails were issued through manufacturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413490815">Cetre et al, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Example 2</italic>: A similar outbreak caused by a defective scope involved a third-party vendor whose practices involved ‘irregularities in repairs and non-standard part replacements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177413490815">Cosgrove et al, 2012</xref>). As a result the defective scope resulted in a no-infection outbreak involving at least 16 cases whose BALs grew <italic>Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> spp. These organisms were also cultured from the implicated scopes repaired by the third-party vendor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177413490815">Cosgrove et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177413490815">
<title>3. Post-use, pre-disinfection process failure</title>
<p><bold>Definition:</bold> There is a failure in the process of scope disassembly, cleaning or set up in the AER.</p>
<p><italic>Example 1</italic>: There are fewer examples of this type, but one report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757177413490815">Silva et al (2003)</xref> is noteworthy. Amongst a plethora of failings identified they reported that before control measures were introduced the same sink and brush was used for washing and rinsing of bronchoscopes and colonoscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757177413490815">Silva et al, 2003</xref>). An event that would surely challenge any chemical decontamination process.</p>
<p><italic>Example 2</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413490815">Alrabaa et al (2013)</xref>, as stated earlier, report an endoscope-related outbreak with a carbapenamase-producing <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, in seven patients, five of whom developed a bloodstream infection. The patients had all had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The outbreak took place between June 2008 and January 2009. The ERCP scope contains an elevator that was not always being cleaned. Biodebris underneath the elevator was the reservoir – confirmed by samples being taken. (When active screening was undertaken, three colonised patients were found in addition to the seven original case patients.) This report is worrying because cross-transmission with a sensitive Gram negative organism to the gastrointestinal tract is only remotely likely to cause infection. However, cross-transmission with an organism, combined with antibiotic selection pressure, could result in infections for which there are extremely limited treatment options.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177413490815">
<title>4. Disinfection and or rinse cycle failure (usually in an AER)</title>
<p><bold>Definition:</bold> Disinfection cycle failure within, or outwith, the AER can be caused by contaminated rinse water, biofilm on lumens, inadequate disinfectant strength, inadequate disinfectant contact time or a failure to allow the AER to complete its cycle.</p>
<p><italic>Example 1</italic>: An investigation was initiated when an alert signal of <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> in the BAL specimens of three patients was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177413490815">Rosengarten et al, 2010</xref>). Initially the findings pointed the investigators to a single scope that had been used on all three patients. However, when eight of 10 scopes tested positive for <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>, the investigators turned their attention to the AER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177413490815">Rosengarten et al, 2010</xref>). The investigators traced the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> to the rinse water supplied to the AER. In this instance the AER had been installed without an antibacterial filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177413490815">Rosengarten et al, 2010</xref>). This error could not have been identified by those who work in the endoscopy suite as there was no information indicating that the machine had been set up incorrectly</p>
<p><italic>Example 2</italic>: Researchers in Germany undertook a study to quantify microbial contamination of AERs; they sampled 24 AERs in 18 hospitals by using sterile saline solution pumped through the machines before microbiological testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177413490815">Hubner et al, 2011</xref>). Of the 24 AERs tested, 19 (79.1%) were positive. Of the 44 positive samples, 27 (61.4%) were contaminated with pathogens of &gt;20,000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml. Organisms cultured included, as would be expected, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> spp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177413490815">Hubner et al, 2011</xref>). This study hints at a chicken/egg first contamination question. For investigators it is important to remember that although contamination may have arisen initially from one source, the process of decontamination can, if not performed correctly, merely serve as a means to contaminate other system parts.</p>
<p><italic>Example 3</italic>: One final example did not involve an AER and occurred in an ITU due to aberrant decontamination procedures that were in use at weekends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413490815">Bou et al (2006)</xref> describe an outbreak of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> involving 17 patients in a 27-bedded ITU in Spain. The weekend ITU procedure involved rinsing the bronchoscope with povidone iodine immediately after the procedure and placing the scope in a drawer without drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413490815">Bou et al, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177413490815">
<title>5. Post-decontamination and pre-use scope contamination</title>
<p><bold>Definition:</bold> The scope has been through an effective decontamination procedure, but due to residual contamination and/or re-contamination, and post-decontamination conditions, is reused in a contaminated condition. (There may be no information to identify that the scope is contaminated).</p>
<p><italic>Examples</italic>: The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413490815">Bou et al (2006)</xref> report described above found that the scopes were left wet in a condition akin to a microbiology lab incubator. Other wet condition outbreaks are described in a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177413490815">Kovaleva et al, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Residual contamination</title>
<p>There is some evidence that the decontamination procedures themselves are not always sufficient to eradicate organisms; and as we know hardy environmental organisms left in contact with any moisture will happily proliferate. A post-reprocessing report on 1,376 gastroscopes and 987 colonoscopes found a contamination rate of 1.8–1.9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413490815">Bisset et al, 2006</xref>). Extrapolating from this the authors suggest that it would take 1.8 years to detect one positive wash sample if the current recommended sampling regimen advocated in Australian guidance was followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413490815">Bisset et al, 2006</xref>). Conversely, others have advocated that safe storage of endoscopes can be achieved for at least seven days and possibly longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757177413490815">Vergis et al, 2007</xref>). However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757177413490815">Vergis et al (2007)</xref> study merits further scrutiny. Only seven scopes were involved, which were sampled every day but had only been used clinically once – on the first day of the study. Ergo they were testing for contamination over time after a single exposure and decontamination procedure. The repeated sampling of the same scopes after a single usage resulted in 70 assays of which six were positive (8.6%). In a second phase of the study they repeated the same process with no positive cultures. Assuming that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413490815">Bisset et al (2006)</xref> study was ball-park for contamination of processed scopes, 1.8–1.9%, then testing 50 scopes would likely only result in one contamination. The chance of one of the seven scopes being contaminated and thus able to provide a true test of the cabinet’s performance was 14%. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757177413490815">Vergis et al (2007)</xref> study does not of itself prove safety in respect of this issue. What it shows is that placement of endoscopes in the drying cabinet did not result in contamination of the scopes. (Please note: the above comment is not a criticism of endoscopy drying cabinets – merely a comment on one study’s sample size. Keeping scopes in a dry state will reduce microbial growth. However, more data are required before the question of how long a dry decontaminated scope can be left before reprocessing before reuse can be answered definitely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177413490815">Muscarella, 2006</xref>)).</p>

<sec id="section8-1757177413490815">
<title>Frequency of reports of different types of endoscopy-related outbreaks</title>
<p>Looking at the bronchoscopy review of endoscopy-related outbreaks from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757177413490815">Weber and Rutala (2012)</xref>, and other recent outbreak reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177413490815">Kovaleva et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413490815">Alrabaa et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413490815">Koo et al, 2012</xref>), it is clear that endoscopy-related outbreaks can be found in all of the categories described above, and as a consequence for outbreak investigators all steps in the endoscopy process need to be reviewed when looking for the source of an outbreak. Bloodborne virus cross-transmission via an endoscope has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177413490815">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>). However, outbreak investigators must remain open minded when the outbreak pathogen is a bloodborne virus. This is because there are reports of outbreaks of hepatitis B in endoscopy suites caused by multi-dose vials, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177413490815">Gutelius et al, 2010</xref>). Just because the outbreak can be traced to the endoscopy suite, it does not mean it’s the endoscope or any endoscope-related equipment <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>What there is no sense of, at present, is the scale of either the problem or the potential problem. There is no recommended local outcome surveillance in the UK. In the US, an automated system which checked all patients with positive blood cultures for recent ERCP procedures was developed and a baseline rate produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413490815">Anderson et al, 2008</xref>). But such endeavours seem to have gained limited interest and limited implementation.</p>

<title>A failure of process or failure to follow process?</title>
<p>Endoscopy-related outbreaks can be caused by a failure of process – owing for example, to defective equipment, or a failure to follow process – owing for example, to reuse of single use equipment. In researching for this column, reviewing regulatory guidance, and looking at very useful YouTube videos of the process (particularly from the manufacturers of endoscopes), the overriding impression is that this complicated process is so complex that periodically errors are almost inevitable. Although the disinfection process is performed in an AER, the important cleaning procedure – which determines whether chemical disinfection will be successful – is performed by humans and therefore more prone to error. In addition, the human vulnerability in performing the procedure correctly may be increased when endoscopes are performed by out-of-hours staff or in non-endoscopy suites. The information provided to those who are tasked with decontaminating endoscopes is also sparse; for example, there are no confirmatory signs that potentially pathogenic organisms remain in a cleaned scope. Fluids running clear are not an indication of absence of micro-organisms. A recent montage of photographic evidence of the limitations of cleaning luminal endoscopes is recommended reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177413490815">Herve and Keevil, 2013</xref>), alongside a comprehensive review of the infections thus far caused by endoscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177413490815">Kovaleva et al, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>So where should the IPCT team look first when they suspect an endoscopy-related outbreak? When the evidence points to an endoscope procedure there is no real short cut, the IPCT needs evidence that all parts of the system are safe and where any failures of process or failures to follow process are arising. Even if the preliminary epidemiology data appear to indicate that it is more likely to be an individual scope, there must still be microbiological evidence that all parts of the process are satisfactory. I offer the checklist as a suggestion to provide the fewest moves to all the possible contaminated sources. The checklist is actually one to eliminate the parts of the system that are not involved and implicate the ones that are. As Sherlock Holmes says in the <italic>Sign of Four</italic>, ch. 6: ‘<italic>When you have eliminated the impossible, that which remains however improbable, must be the truth’</italic>. A very wise microbiologist amended this famous quote to ‘… <italic>must include the truth</italic>.’ This is very useful as several of the outbreak reports describe more than one reservoir or unsafe act.</p>
<p>As stated previously, in outbreak management IPCTs are trying to find the answers with the fewest moves. The checklist should help find the outbreak reservoirs – it may also identify unsafe acts that caused the outbreak – this is the <italic>what happened</italic>. But such data will not explain <italic>why it happened</italic>. What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177413490815">Reason (2008)</xref> calls the error-provoking and/or violating-producing conditions must also be identified and resolved if future incidents are to be prevented. These latent conditions are the: organisation and culture, current conditions of work and lack of defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177413490815">Reason, 2008</xref>). Given the complexity of the process, any additional pressures, e.g. shortages of staff, shortages of competent staff, time pressures or emergency procedures could result in errors and outbreaks. Changes often provoke an outbreak. Outbreak management can be summarised as looking for actions or changes that provoked the outbreak and looking for changes to halt the outbreak and prevent it happening again. Changes can arise in any part of the system:</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Cross-infection and consequently outbreaks, can and do arise as a consequence of endoscope procedures. The complexity of procedures, complexities of design (of scopes and sundry equipment), limitations of reprocessing options and limitations of information available to operators mean that the risks of future incidents remain real. (Albeit that these risks can be reduced by quality assured procedures and periodic audits). Unless and until the complexities can be eliminated from endoscopes or endoscopy-related equipment, it can be expected that outbreaks will continue to periodically arise at a low rate. IPCTs should therefore be prepared for an endoscope-outbreak in their facilities. It would seem essential to explore options for local surveillance for early detection of problems. Such surveillance should be well and suited to a laboratory-based IT system that can talk to the theatre suite’s system. This should result in an automated production of a data output from which inferences can be made easily.</p>
<p>The patient risks are low but they are real. They are real, because processed scopes have been shown to have a 1.8–1.9% contamination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413490815">Bisset et al, 2006</xref>). They are low because in the main the organisms transferred will be Gram negative organisms relocated to a gastrointestinal tract in which there are already many millions of similar organisms. However, in the context of NDM-1 cross-transmission this risk assessment needs to be reconsidered. Perhaps the risk of cross-transmission of Gram negatives via endoscopes is about to become a clear and present danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413490815">Aumeran et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413490815">Alrabaa et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413490815">Koo et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is very important that we learn from all endoscopy-related outbreaks. Unlike other sciences, it has been argued that outbreaks should be published not only if there is something new to report, but also because they occur or are still occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177413490815">Curran and Coia, 2010</xref>). In a similar vein it has been suggested that publishing outbreak reports, should be considered as part of the infection control practitioners’ wider <italic>duty of care</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177413490815">Curran and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Once again I encourage all professionals to do so.</p>
<p>I, as always, invite your comment on this column – or on the checklist.</p>
