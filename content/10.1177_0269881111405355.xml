<abstract>
<p>We investigated (1) the effects of alcohol on cognitive biases for alcohol-related cues, (2) the effects of drinking status on alcohol-related cognitive biases and (3) the similarity of any effects of alcohol across two measures of alcohol cognitive bias. Healthy, heavy and light social alcohol users (<italic>n</italic> = 72) were examined in a single-blind placebo-controlled design. Participants received 0.00 g/kg, 0.13 g/kg or 0.40 g/kg of alcohol in a between-subjects design and then completed both a modified Stroop task and a visual probe task. Modified Stroop data indicated a main effect of cue type, which was qualified by drinking status, with heavier drinkers slower to respond to alcohol-related cues. Visual probe data, in contrast, indicated a significant interaction effect between validity (valid: <italic>alcohol-related</italic>, invalid: <italic>neutral</italic>) and drink condition. Participants receiving a moderate dose of alcohol (0.40 g/kg) were faster to respond to alcohol-related stimuli compared with participants receiving a low dose of alcohol or placebo. These data indicate that the cognitive processes assayed by the visual probe and Stroop tasks may not be mediated by a common underlying mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following prolonged drug intake, drug-related cues gain strong motivational properties and become capable of eliciting physiological and cognitive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111405355">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111405355">Stewart et al., 1984</xref>). For example, cognitive biases for alcohol-related cues have been shown in alcohol-dependent drinkers relative to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111405355">Johnsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111405355">Noel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111405355">Stetter et al., 1995</xref>). However, findings from social drinkers have been inconsistent. Whilst several studies have reported similar biases in heavier social drinkers compared with lighter drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111405355">Bruce and Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111405355">Field et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111405355">Townshend and Duka, 2001</xref>), others have reported mixed findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111405355">Cox et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111405355">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111405355">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>). One explanation for these discrepant findings is the use of different assessment paradigms of cognitive bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111405355">Field and Cox, 2008</xref>). In most studies, biases have been measured using the modified Stroop task or the visual probe task. However, evidence from the anxiety literature indicates that cognitive biases assessed in the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks do not correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111405355">Dalgleish et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111405355">Gotlib et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting these tasks may in fact capture very different cognitive processes, and be subserved by distinct underlying mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111405355">Cisler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111405355">Mogg and Bradley, 2002</xref>). For example the modified Stroop task assesses competition for processing resources between different components of a stimulus within the task (colour versus semantic content of a word) within the central focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111405355">Mogg and Bradley, 2002</xref>). The visual probe task in contrast measures biases in the allocation of spatial attention towards neutral and alcohol-related cues in the visual field, including mechanisms of initial orienting, attentional shifting and disengagement of attention. Using an analogy of a ‘spotlight of attention’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al. (2000)</xref> suggest that the visual probe task may capture biases in a spotlight scanning different aspects of the visual field, whilst biases on the modified Stroop may reflect the disentanglement of information in an isolated spotlight of attention. Given this distinction, it seems intuitive that studies of alcohol-related biases include more than one measure of cognitive bias, since different tasks may reflect different discrete processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, only a few studies have examined the effects of acute alcohol consumption on cognitive biases in social drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405355">Duka and Townshend, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111405355">Jones and Schulze, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111405355">Rose and Duka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers and Wiers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers et al., 2008</xref>). Of these studies, two have investigated alcohol’s acute effects on two tasks of cognitive bias. In one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405355">Duka and Townshend, 2004</xref>), social drinkers who received 0.60 g/kg alcohol showed increased colour-naming errors for alcohol-related words on the modified Stroop task compared with those who received a lower dose (0.30 g/kg) or placebo. However, on a visual probe task, cognitive bias towards alcohol cues was only observed in the low dose condition. Similarly, another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers et al., 2008</xref>) found that a low dose (0.30 g/kg) of alcohol enhanced alcohol-related cognitive bias on a visual probe task, but not on a stimulus response compatibility task of cognitive bias. These data strengthen the notion that the use of different tasks of cognitive biases may explain discrepant findings on alcohol’s effects on alcohol-related cognitive bias. Additionally, whilst these results suggest that cognitive biases may be enhanced following alcohol consumption, these studies have been conducted only in moderate to heavy social drinkers. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have examined the effects of a priming dose of alcohol on cognitive bias towards alcohol-related stimuli in light and heavy drinkers.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the present study we examined the effects of low and moderate doses of alcohol on two measures of cognitive bias in both light and heavy social drinkers. The addition of a low dose of alcohol (0.13 g/kg) in the present study was novel and intended to capture alcohol-seeking that may be facilitated following a single drink. Cognitive bias towards alcohol-related stimuli was measured using both modified Stroop and visual probe tasks, to directly compare the sensitivity of these tasks to drinking status and alcohol challenge, and assess the extent to which these tasks are mediated by a common underlying mechanism. We also examined the effects of a priming dose of alcohol on craving, and the association between cognitive bias and subjective craving, since evidence of association between these constructs has been inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111405355">Field et al., 2009</xref>). We hypothesized: first, that participants primed with an acute dose of alcohol would demonstrate enhanced cognitive bias towards alcohol-related cues; second, that heavier social drinkers compared with lighter drinkers would exhibit greater alcohol-related cognitive bias; and third, that effects of acute alcohol administration and social drinking status on cognitive bias would differ according to task employed.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>The study employed a single-blind, between-subjects, placebo-controlled design. The study design comprised two between-subjects factors of challenge condition (0.00 g/kg alcohol, 0.13 g/kg alcohol, 0.40 g/kg alcohol) and drinking status (light drinkers, heavy drinkers).</p>

<sec id="section4-0269881111405355">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Social alcohol consumers were recruited from students and staff at the University of Bristol (<italic>n</italic> = 72; 36 male). Participants were assigned to drinking status groups based upon number of alcohol units consumed per week, according to UK government limits for safe alcohol use. Light drinkers (<italic>n</italic> = 36; 18 male) were defined as individuals who consume ≥ l0 and ≤ 20 units of alcohol per week for males and ≥ 5 and ≤ 14 units of alcohol per week for females. Heavy drinkers (<italic>n</italic> = 36; 18 male) were defined as individuals who consume ≥ 21 and ≤ 50 units per week for males and ≥ 15 and ≤ 35 units per week for females. A unit is equivalent to 8 g of ethanol. Participants received £5 each for participation. The study was approved by the Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881111405355">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Visual probe task stimuli consisted of 12 front-facing and 12 side-facing picture pairs. Picture pairs consisted of two photographs of bottled beverages, one alcohol-related image and one neutral (soft drink) image, matched for colour, complexity, and content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111405355">Figure 1</xref>). Each photograph was digitized and converted to a 60 mm × 60 mm image using Adobe Photoshop (version CS4) on a MacBook, 2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.</p>

<p>Modified Stroop task stimuli: stimulus words from the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111405355">Cox et al. (1999)</xref> were employed in the modified Stroop task. Twenty neutral and 20 alcohol-related word stimuli were all 1.5 cm high, presented in Arial font, 12 pt.</p>
<p>Questionnaire measures used included self-report measures of personality (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised EPQ-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111405355">Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991</xref>)), mood (Profile of Mood States, POMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111405355">McNair et al., 1992</xref>)) and craving (Visual Analogue Scales, VAS). The VAS comprised five items: 1. I would like to consume an alcoholic beverage; 2. A drink would be very satisfying; 3. The thought of consuming an alcoholic beverage is appealing; 4. I need to have a drink; 5. I do not want to consume an alcoholic beverage.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All participants were tested between 12:00 and 18:00 in a laboratory in the School of Experimental Psychology. On the test day, after providing informed consent, all participants completed a screening process. Exclusion criteria included: current use of medication and illicit substances, family history of alcoholism, and alcohol consumed 12 hours prior to the study. Recent alcohol consumption was assessed using a breath alcohol test. Alcohol consumption (units per week) was recorded to establish allocation to drinking status group (light drinkers, heavy drinkers) and weight was recorded for drink preparation.</p>
<p>Following the completion of baseline measures (POMS, EPQ-R and VAS) participants were given five minutes to consume the drink. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either an alcoholic or a placebo drink. Participants received vodka at 37.5% alcohol by volume, at a dose of 0.13 g/kg or 0.40 g/kg alcohol with tonic water (up to a maximum of 125 ml vodka), or a placebo consisting of only tonic water. All drinks were flavoured with lime and chilled. At the end of this period participants completed the first awareness check to determine whether they were aware if they had received alcohol or placebo. Next, participants were given 15 minutes to complete post-challenge measures (POMS and VAS), ensuring all participants had an equivalent time period between challenge administration and the cognitive tasks. All participants then completed both the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks, with task order counterbalanced across participants.</p>
<p>In the visual probe task, each trial began with a central fixation cross, presented for 500 ms, replaced with a stimuli picture pair, displayed side by side for 500 ms. Following the picture pair, a probe was presented in the location of one of the pictures, until a response was made. Probes replacing alcohol-related cues constituted valid trials, where probes replacing neutral cues were invalid trials. Each trial was presented with an inter-trial interval of 500 ms. Participants were instructed to focus on the fixation cross in each trial, and then respond to a probe, which could either be a circle or a square, by pressing the up or down arrows on the keyboard respectively. Practice stimuli were presented in a single block of six trials, each consisting of a single picture pair of soft drink bottle images. Experimental stimuli were presented in random sequence in four blocks of 48 trials, with two blocks of front-facing picture pairs and two blocks of side-facing picture pairs, presented in a sequential order. Each picture type and each probe type was presented with equal frequency on both the left and right side of the screen in each of the eight possible presentations.</p>
<p>In the modified Stroop task participants were instructed to respond by selecting the colour of the word presented on the screen, using four colour coded buttons on the keyboard (yellow, red, green and blue). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Each trial started with a fixation cross presented for 500 ms, followed by the stimulus word presented until a response was made or 2500 ms had elapsed. Practice stimuli consisted of one block of 16 trials, comprising four music-related words (‘guitar’, ‘violin’, ‘cello’, ‘bassoon’), each presented four times in each of the four colours, red, green, blue and yellow. Experimental stimuli consisted of one block of alcohol-related words (40 trials), one block of neutral words (40 trials), two mixed blocks of 40 trials, containing both alcohol-related and neutral words. Both block types (blocked versus mixed) were employed to explore the impact of task design on cognitive bias. Alcohol-related and neutral words were presented with equal frequency. The duration of each task was approximately 12 minutes. All tasks were programmed using E-Prime version 1.2 (Psychology Software Tools Inc.) and all stimuli were presented on an IBM ThinkPad Notebook, Pentium IV, with a 12-inch monitor. On completion of the tasks, all participants completed a second awareness check and questionnaire measures (POMS and VAS). A final breath alcohol test was performed and participants were informed of their drink condition. At the end of the test day participants were paid and received a full debrief. The duration of the test session was approximately one hour.</p>

<sec id="section7-0269881111405355">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All analyses included two between-subject factors of challenge condition (0.00 g/kg, 0.13 g/kg, 0.40 g/kg) and drinking status (light drinkers, heavy drinkers). For modified Stroop data, a mixed-model ANOVA of median reaction times was conducted including two within-subjects factors of word-type (alcohol-related, neutral) and design (blocked, mixed). For visual probe data a mixed-model ANOVA of median reaction times was conducted including two within-subjects factors of validity (valid: alcohol-related, invalid: neutral) and orientation (front-facing, side-facing). For craving and mood data a mixed-model ANOVA was conducted including one within-subjects factor of time (baseline, five minutes post-challenge, and 25 minutes post-challenge).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data indicate that acute alcohol consumption influences cognitive bias towards alcohol-related cues on the visual probe task only, irrespective of drinking status, in partial support of our first hypothesis. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405355">Duka and Townshend, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111405355">Rose and Duka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers et al., 2008</xref>) participants receiving a moderate dose of alcohol demonstrated greater bias compared with those receiving either placebo or a low dose. These data suggest that alcohol primes the motivational characteristics of alcohol-related cues, but that this effect specifically influences attentional bias as measured by the visual probe task. Our data also provide limited support for our second hypothesis, and indicate that heavier drinkers exhibit greater cognitive bias compared with lighter drinkers on the modified Stroop task only. This is broadly consistent with evidence that level of use influences social drinkers’ subjective and cognitive responses towards alcohol-related cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111405355">Bruce and Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111405355">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111405355">Greeley et al., 1993</xref>). There is growing evidence that the modified Stroop and visual probe tasks capture different underlying attentional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111405355">Dalgleish et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111405355">Gotlib et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al., 2000</xref>). Our data appear to support this possibility, and suggest the effects of acute alcohol consumption and drinking status on cognitive bias differ according to task employed.</p>
<p>Effects of acute alcohol consumption on cognitive bias were indicated by the visual probe task, but not by the modified Stroop task. This finding is consistent with evidence of task-specific effects of acute alcohol consumption on cognitive biases, at similar doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405355">Duka and Townshend, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers et al., 2008</xref>). Since the visual probe task may reflect biases in the allocation of attention, our data suggest that alcohol’s acute effects on cognitive bias may involve attentional processes in visual orienting. Using the spotlight analogy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al. (2000)</xref>, these data may further suggest alcohol’s acute effects on specific scanning processes involved in the maintenance of attention, where stimuli were presented for 500 ms (allowing sufficient time for more than one shift in covert attention) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111405355">Cooper and Langton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111405355">Posner and Petersen, 1990</xref>). In contrast, effects of social drinking status on cognitive bias indicated by the modified Stroop task were not seen with the visual probe task. This finding adds to an inconsistent body of research, with mixed evidence for the influence of previous alcohol use on specific cognitive biases captured by the modified Stroop task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111405355">Bruce and Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111405355">Cox et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111405355">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>). Interference from emotionally relevant cues on the Stroop task may occur at early stages of input such as information processing and at later stages involving response selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111405355">Macleod, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, our data may indicate effects of social drinking status on biases associated with the competition of processing resources in information processing and/or response selection. Referring to the spotlight model, our data suggest that biases occurring in the central focus or ‘spotlight’ of attention may be most sensitive to the effects of previous alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The distinction between these two tasks is further supported by no clear evidence for any relationships between cognitive bias on the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks, consistent with anxiety based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111405355">Dalgleish et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111405355">Gotlib et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405355">Mogg et al., 2000</xref>). The task-specific effects observed in our data have implications for the selection of cognitive bias measures to assess different drinking behaviours. Our data indicate that the visual probe task may be more sensitive to the effects of acute alcohol consumption on cognitive bias, where under acute intoxication attention is disproportionately allocated towards alcohol-related stimuli. On the other hand, the modified Stroop task appears more sensitive to the effects of history of alcohol use on cognitive bias, where our data may reflect enhanced and more detailed processing of salient alcohol-related cues in heavier drinkers relative to lighter social drinkers.</p>
<p>A number of other findings were also noteworthy. We did not show evidence of an effect of a low dose of alcohol (0.13 g/kg) on attentional bias. At a low dose, central effects of alcohol may not reach a sufficient threshold of activation for engagement in alcohol-seeking cognitions, although the trend towards an effect at this low dose may reflect a lack of statistical power to detect a weaker effect. In contrast to expectations and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111405355">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>) we also did not observe any influence of blocked versus unblocked task design on modified Stroop interference. There were no clear relationships observed between bias scores and subjective craving, consistent with a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111405355">Field et al., 2009</xref>). In the 0.13 g/kg and 0.40 g/kg dose conditions we did observe a decrease in craving at five minutes post-challenge, with a subsequent increase in craving at 25 minutes post-challenge for the 0.13 g/kg dose only. These data are in contrast to evidence of both dose-dependent craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405355">Schoenmakers et al., 2008</xref>) and no change in craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405355">Duka and Townshend, 2004</xref>) observed following similar doses of alcohol. This discrepancy may reflect the use of different subjective measure of craving in these studies. Alternatively, our results may reflect the biphasic nature of alcohol. However, we are unable to directly distinguish between ascending/descending BrAL curve pathways for our data.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to our study which should be considered when interpreting these results. First, data were collected using a single-blind design. However, in order to limit experimenter bias, the researcher was not present during the consumption of the drink challenge or the cognitive bias task battery. Second, in contrast to previous studies, we employed a between-subjects design, which will have resulted in increased error variance associated with individual differences. However, both the modified Stroop and visual probe tasks are subject to practice effects, and our design limited the impact of these. Third, the use of different stimulus types for the two cognitive bias tasks may limit the interpretability of the different findings shown across the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks. Pictorial stimuli may serve as more ecologically valid cues for laboratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111405355">Bruce and Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111405355">Townshend and Duka, 2001</xref>), where single-word cues may not represent everyday environmental cues that underlie cognitive biases towards alcohol-related stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111405355">Jones et al., 2003</xref>). However, despite this discrepancy, cognitive biases have been observed in pictorial and lexical versions of both visual probe and modified Stroop tasks, under a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>Our study explores cognitive bias towards alcohol-related cues on two task paradigms in both light and heavy social drinkers following an alcohol challenge, and indicates that the visual probe and modified Stroop tasks may probe different mechanisms of alcohol-related cognitive bias. This has important methodological implications, and suggests that these tasks may be differentially sensitive to the effects of acute alcohol consumption, and to differences associated with heaviness of drinking. We recommend that future studies use more than one measure of cognitive bias, to determine the specific mechanisms of bias that may be differentially influenced by individual drinking behaviours.</p>
