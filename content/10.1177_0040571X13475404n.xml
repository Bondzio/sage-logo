<p>Amid fervid and largely ill-informed discussions about the relationship between church and state in the United States, any book that lends both legal common sense and scholarly integrity to the conversation is sorely needed. <italic>The Bible, the School, and the Constitution</italic>, by Steven K. Green, Professor of Law and History at Willamette University, is a superb contribution.</p>
<p>Green argues that the nineteenth-century debate over what he calls the ‘School Question’ (rendered throughout in upper-case) was in fact the real crucible for determining the configuration of church and state. ‘The debate over the School Question’, Green writes, ‘was the closest that Americans have ever to come to having a national conversation about the religion clauses of the Constitution’ (p. 225).</p>
<p>The book opens with an account of the common school movement in the early republic. The arrival of Catholic immigrants placed pressures on public education because of the widespread (and not erroneous) impression that the public school societies favoured Protestantism because of their insistence on non-mediated Bible reading. Catholics, led by John Hughes of New York, fought back, seeking funding for parochial schools, and leading to a widespread, albeit localized, no-funding principle for religious schools.</p>
<p>As these dramas were playing out, sometimes with violence, two groups pushed for constitutional amendments that, they believed, would clarify the First Amendment. Responding to criticism from the Confederacy that the Constitution contained no mention of the United States as a Christian nation, the National Reform Association sought an amendment that would rectify what they regarded as an omission, while the Liberal League proposed a Religious Freedom Amendment and sought to eliminate Bible reading from the public schools as inherently sectarian. The Cincinnati ‘Bible War’ of 1869–73 culminated in a court decision ‘to exclude the Bible and other religious exercises’ (p. 132).</p>
<p>Green expertly and exhaustively recounts the social and political forces at play in these lively discussions, which culminated in the proposed Blaine Amendment, which would have prohibited public support for religious education. Although Philip Hamburger interprets this measure as evidence for anti-Catholic sentiment behind calls for the separation of church and state in the nineteenth century, Green takes a more nuanced view. He produces evidence that James G. Blaine himself was not anti-Catholic, and he points out that the measure had become so contorted in the legislative process that Blaine did not bother to show up to cast his vote.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the Blaine Amendment’s failure to pass Congress, its importance is not diminished. According to Green, the Blaine Amendment served as a model for state constitutional measures and would merely have ‘nationalized the legal status quo’ by codifying the already accepted practice of no funding for religious schools (p. 230). The transition to secular public schooling, having begun in the nineteenth century, continued ‘incrementally, as educators, clergy, and jurists struggled to reconcile the evolving goals of public schooling with a growing religious pluralism and emergent constitutional principles’ (p. 257).</p>
