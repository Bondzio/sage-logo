<abstract>
<p>This article explores the adaptive functions of storytelling in the workplace from an evolutionary perspective. Based on the analysis of ethnographic studies on hunter-gatherer and modern work organizations, this article claims that storytelling, as an adapted cognitive device, was selectively retained by natural and sexual selection, because of its survival and reproductive payoff. The narrative production through storytelling is a natural coping mechanism and has been functional in both old and new ways of working life under different ecological conditions. This article also highlights underlying adapted psychological mechanisms of storytelling and discusses some evolutionarily informed practical implications and pedagogical applications.</p>

<p>Storytelling and business management do not mesh well in our minds. Storytelling conjures up words such as myth, fiction, and gossip. The word <italic>management</italic> is associated with images of deliberate decision making, rational planning, and control. Telling stories seems neither professional nor technical; rather, it is personal, subjective, and ephemeral. This lack of appreciation for storytelling in the workplace can be partly attributed to the dominant view on the nature of useful knowledge in business management. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1080569913480023">Weick (2007)</xref>, traditionally, management education has put much emphasis on the tools of rationality, while underestimating the role that intuition, improvisation, and stories play. Management scholars, as well as practitioners, apparently cherish the belief that useful knowledge in business has to be objective, solid, and logical. From this stance, stories are too nebulous, subjective, and unscientific.</p>
<p>Up to now, storytelling has attracted limited attention in the field of management and organization studies, with the exception of a small group of researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje, 1991b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1080569913480023">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1080569913480023">Boyce, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1080569913480023">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1080569913480023">Czarniawska, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1080569913480023">Gabriel, 2000</xref>). However, the recognition that narratives or storytelling have substantial practical value in business management has begun to surge among management consultants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913480023">Brown, Denning, Groh, &amp; Prusak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569913480023">Groysberg &amp; Slind, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1080569913480023">Sachs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1080569913480023">Smith, 2012</xref>). Increasing interest in knowledge-creating organizations and knowledge management has further intensified enthusiasm for storytelling in organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1080569913480023">Lukosch, Klebl, &amp; Buttler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1080569913480023">Whyte &amp; Classen, 2012</xref>). In tandem with the increasing enthusiasm shared among practitioners, economists and management scholars have begun to acknowledge the persuasive power of storytelling in managing change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569913480023">Akerlof &amp; Shiller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569913480023">Forman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1080569913480023">Kotter, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that business management involves people and is about people, the basics of management still hinge on our deep appreciation of human nature. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1080569913480023">Mintzberg (2005)</xref> pointed out, “Managing is mostly about nuances, while the popular works mostly provide formulas—painting by numbers, so to speak” (p. 398). In fact, one fundamental distinction of our species from other primates lies in our capability to invent a rule-based language and fiction. Accordingly, human beings are called “homo narrans” mainly because all forms of human communication are fundamentally stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1080569913480023">Fisher, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1080569913480023">1987</xref>). It is almost impossible to talk about the origin of storytelling without talking about the evolution of the human mind. Our cognitive capacity to make sense of events by constructing narratives is deeply rooted in the biological evolution of the human brain and is supported by multiple psychological mechanisms, including the language instinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1080569913480023">Dow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1080569913480023">Pinker, 1995</xref>). The basic premise of this study is that a Darwinian evolutionary understanding of the human mind will deepen our appreciation of the psychological foundation of storytelling and its practical implications for organizational behavior.</p>
<p>This article thus begins with a brief introduction of evolutionary understanding of the human mind and explores how storytelling was selectively retained in our behavioral repertoire. To explore adaptive functions of storytelling from an evolutionary perspective, this study focuses on the storytelling performance in the context of two different ecological conditions: those of the <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari desert in South Africa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569913480023">Biesele, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569913480023">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569913480023">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1080569913480023">Biesele &amp; Barclay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas, 2006</xref>) and those of modern industrial workers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje, 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr, 1996</xref>). By critically analyzing the ethnographic descriptions of storytelling among <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> foraging people and Xerox field service technicians, this study highlights a couple of shared multiple functions of storytelling in both ancient and modern working life. This article then presents some evolutionarily informed practical implications and pedagogical applications of storytelling.</p>

<title>Storytelling in Organizations: An Evolutionary Psychological Approach</title>
<sec id="section2-1080569913480023">
<title>The Human Mind: An Evolved Tool Box</title>
<p>It is difficult to talk about the emergence of our narrative mind without talking about evolution simply because storytelling is firmly rooted in the evolution of our brain and several neurological apparatus for language development. According to evolutionary psychologists, our brain is a neural information processor, and our mind is equipped with massive adapted psychological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569913480023">Barkow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569913480023">Buss, 2012</xref>). Evolutionary psychology (EP), as a metatheoretical research approach to the human mind and human behavior, is based on a modern synthesis of evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology. EP conceives that the human mind is adapted cognitive machinery, which assisted our distant ancestors to survive and reproduce successfully in the distant past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569913480023">Barkow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569913480023">Buss, 2012</xref>). The fundamental assumption of EP is that the human mind is a product of evolution by natural selection like any other physical organ. As the neural networks of our brain have been selectively retained by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569913480023">Edelman, 1987</xref>), the proponents of EP argue that the human mind consists of massive evolved psychological algorithms (programs) that helped our ancestors survive and reproduce under ancient environmental pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569913480023">Barkow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569913480023">Buss, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>That our evolutionary history is reflected in our minds as well as in our bodies is one of the foundational insights of EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom, 2010</xref>). It claims that the complexity of human behavior requires attention to biological evolution because (a) the brain directs behavior and (b) the brain’s design, function, and output are all products of gene-environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1080569913480023">Rappaport, 2008</xref>). It is also important to remember that our mind was sculpted under ancient environmental pressures, so our minds “are not rationally calibrated to modern times” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom, 2010</xref>, p. 79). In other words, some instinctive behavioral tendencies that we inherited from our distant ancestors will prove to be maladaptive in a modern work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1080569913480023">Crawford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1080569913480023">Nicholson, 1998</xref>). For example, automatic categorization of strangers into in-group versus out-group based on a few phenotypic cues (e.g., skin color, accents, etc.) would be considered maladaptive in modern organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1080569913480023">
<title>Storytelling as an Evolved Cognitive Device</title>
<p>Given that our built-in desire to communicate through gestures, pointing, and sharing glances preceded the actual emergence of language in the evolutionary history of our species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1080569913480023">Tomasello, 2008</xref>), it is probable that our inborn predisposition to seek the intelligibility of the human environment through narratives accelerated the emergence of a rule-based language. Before the evolution of human language, nonverbal signals might have contributed to the sharing of information with in-group members about environmental threats, such as hostile out-group members and nonhuman predators. Thus, the emergence of language must have assisted our distant ancestors to solve the adaptive problem of transferring social information much more reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p>Compared with simple gestures or sounds, storytelling is emotionally richer and more effective in terms of fidelity, memorability, and the amount of information that can be delivered. A plot enables both the sender and receiver of a story to make sense of otherwise random events by reconstructing a shared version of experience embedded in an information-rich context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1080569913480023">Rappaport, 2008</xref>). This is one of the main reasons why the human mind is designed to find stories appealing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1080569913480023">Dutton (2009)</xref> rightly pointed out, there exists “the brute fact of the pleasure and universality of storytelling” (p. 105). For instance, we often engage in gossip, because it gives us pleasure as well as valuable social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1080569913480023">Dunbar, 2004</xref>); gossip helps us explain interpersonal politics and experience pleasure simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our hominid ancestors spent almost 99% of their evolutionary history leading a foraging way of life in small bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1080569913480023">Lenski, 2005</xref>). It is thus very natural for us to utilize this unique capacity for reading minds of people in small group settings. In fact, the emergence of storytelling cannot be thought of without considering the ultrasociality of our species and the social embeddedness of telling tales. In other words, our narrative mind evolved out of the small-scale hunter-gatherer social contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1080569913480023">Dow (2006)</xref> claimed that “narrative knowledge has a perfect fit to the cultures of the Paleolithic, a long period during which the current structure of the human brain evolved” (p. 4). Therefore, elaborate storytelling must have emerged as an adapted cognitive device for collecting and sharing important social and geographical information, which was critical for our foraging ancestors in terms of the successful exploitation of scattered resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1080569913480023">Dow, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Telling a good story requires more than just describing a series of facts. To weave a good story, the storyteller needs to develop the capability to construct fairly complicated inner representations of goals, intentions, and emotional states of real or fictional characters. Evolutionarily speaking, changing environmental pressures (e.g., increased social group size) must have facilitated the sophistication of the narrative mind, which enabled our ancestors to manipulate the inner representations of increasingly complicated interpersonal transactions and environmental perturbations in a safer mental space. Our ancestors with narrative prowess must have had a competitive edge over those with few rhetorical skills and appeared more attractive to the opposite sex, winning the competition for mates and having more opportunities for spreading their genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1080569913480023">Miller, 2000</xref>). Given that individuals with the best command of language and rhetorical skills were afforded special privileges, including more and higher quality of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1080569913480023">Pinker, 1995</xref>), storytelling must have been selectively retained by natural selection <italic>and</italic> further intensified by sexual selection for its strategic utility for reproductive success. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1080569913480023">Miller (2000)</xref> stated, “Evolution found a way to act directly on the mental sophistication of this primate species, not through some unique combination of survival challenges, but through the species setting itself a strange new game of reproduction” (p. 21).</p>

<title>Underlying Psychological Mechanisms of Telling Tales</title>
<p>Unfortunately, little is known concretely about a specific locus or a structure of our brain that is in charge of storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom, 2010</xref>). Our narrative mind, however, is well coordinated with other adapted cognitive mechanisms that facilitated the working of a special cognitive design for storytelling, which ultimately contributed to our ancestors’ reproductive fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1080569913480023">Sugiyama, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569913480023">Gazzaniga (2005)</xref>, for instance, proposed that we evolved a “left-hemisphere interpreter,” which “includes a special region that interprets the inputs we receive every moment and weaves them into stories to form the ongoing narrative of our self-image and our beliefs” (p. 148). As an adapted trait, storytelling must have emerged out of our species’ evolved psychological machinery in a nonarbitrary way; there must have been some problems that required the emergence of storytelling as an evolved cognitive device that has enhanced the intelligibility of human social and physical environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1080569913480023">Carroll, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The capability of inferring the emotional states or intentions of other people is indispensable for telling tales. This implies that neuropsychological infrastructures for language and empathy—such as mirror neurons—should have been the prerequisites for the emergence of storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1080569913480023">Ramachandran, 2011</xref>). Simply stated, empathy and the ability to understand “other points of view” are necessary for the working of our narrative mind. Related to the notion of perspective taking, the theory of mind (ToM) refers to our assumption that other peoples have their own minds. Reading other peoples’ minds is possible only when we ascribe motives, intentions, and feelings to someone else’s mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569913480023">Baron-Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1080569913480023">Leslie, 1987</xref>). This enables us to shift our perspective momentarily and to put ourselves into the perspective of someone else. It is the recognition of the existence of the mind that is independent from the cognizing self.</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that 3-year-old children have often failed to differentiate their own perspectives from those of other individuals. However, the majority of 5-year-old children are capable of taking someone else’s point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569913480023">Astington, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1080569913480023">Dutton (2009)</xref>, ToM is “a distinct, evolved adaptation and not simply a generalized application of intelligence” as “shown by the effortless reliability with which it develops” (p. 119). Without one’s well-functioning ToM, it is almost impossible to be socially competent, as clearly exemplified by autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569913480023">Baron-Cohen, 1995</xref>). Imitation of other people is possible only when our mind is equipped with some reliable neural pathways that enable us to construct metarepresentations of external objects—as well as people—within our minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the construction of metarepresentations is firmly rooted in our unique capability to hold something in our minds, to reason about it and respond emotionally to it while knowing that it is not real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom, 2010</xref>). Tinkering with these mental representations is actually a kind of safe mental simulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569913480023">Bloom (2010)</xref> argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>In general, play is safe practice. . . . And stories and daydreams are social play, in which we vicariously and safely explore new situations. . . . We make up imaginary horrors to help us deal with real ones; this is tough mind’s way of coping with terrible problems. (p. 193)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Storytelling thus provides a mechanism for safe practice or verbal play by representing internal and external environments with relative credibility and stability. Evolutionarily speaking, our distant ancestors who were capable of mentally preparing for certain dangerous and unpleasant situations must have survived better than those who were not.</p>

<title>Adaptive Functions of Storytelling in Hunter-Gatherer and Modern Work Environments</title>
<p>From an evolutionary psychological perspective, storytelling is a hardwired instinct of our species, which was selectively retained by natural selection and intensified by sexual selection because of its ultimate reproductive payoff. To explore adaptive functions of storytelling in the context of two starkly different ecological conditions, this article reviews ethnographic literature on a Kalahari hunter-gatherer society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569913480023">Biesele, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569913480023">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569913480023">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1080569913480023">Biesele &amp; Barclay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas, 2006</xref>) and modern work organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje, 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr, 1996</xref>). If one could extract some functions of storytelling common to both foraging and modern industrial work settings, it would provide some evidence—although indirect—that storytelling has been an adapted cognitive device in terms of information acquisition, retention, and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1080569913480023">Schank &amp; Abelson, 1995</xref>). Following are the functions in common of storytelling, extracted from the ethnographic studies on the <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari desert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas, 2006</xref>) and the field service technicians at Xerox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Storytelling as a Cognitive Device for Organizing Memory and Knowledge</title>
<p>Storytelling has often facilitated an adaptive perceptual categorization in an unlabeled world where order and arrangement of objects and events cannot be prefigured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569913480023">Edelman, 1987</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1080569913480023">Sugiyama (2001)</xref>, foraging people, for instance, transmitted information about specific locations of edible plants and fruits using various narrative devices, including mimicry and anthropomorphism.</p>
<p>By translating geographical landscape information into anthropomorphized social information, our foraging ancestors helped themselves by sharing subsistence information with one another, which was conducive to the pursuit of reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in an oral culture, it is often elderly people who play the key role of a depository of public knowledge. In a study of the <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> hunter-gathers in the Kalahari desert, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas (2006)</xref> claimed that the elderly held the largest amount of important information:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thus, with the help of the old people, the collective memory of a group can go back sixty, seventy, or eighty years, or long enough to contain the kinds of events that happen only rarely. . . . The older people were well known to be the repository of important information and were greatly respected for it. (pp. 206-207)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1080569913480023">Sugiyama (2008)</xref> argued, stories increase our knowledge of human behavior and enhance our ability to predict and even control it. Useful knowledge is often tacit and shared in social networks, and it is often transported by exchanging stories. Among the <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> hunter-gathers, “in addition to valuable factual information, cultural concepts were also passed to new generations by the elders, who accomplished this with stories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas, 2006</xref>, p. 132).</p>
<p>Contrary to expectation, even technicians in modern societies tend to share knowledge through telling stories. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr (1996)</xref> described how knowledge shared among Xerox field service technicians was best understood as “a socially distributed resource that is diffused and stored primarily through an oral culture” (p. xiii). The circulation of stories among the community of technicians was the principal mechanism by which the technicians stayed informed of the current states of knowledge in the field. The bits and pieces of war stories—stories of fixing copier machines—were recounted frequently among the technicians and incorporated into the institutional memory of the community of practitioners. In his study of an office supply firm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje (1991b)</xref> also observed that even a short and cryptic story turned out to be an effective way of transmitting tacit knowledge and institutional memory, which all contributed to the continuation and solidarity of the community of practitioners. Indeed, storytelling seems to be the universal mechanism by which social knowledge is conveyed and shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1080569913480023">Linde, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Storytelling as a Sensemaking Tool</title>
<p>Sensemaking is the cognitive process of building internal representations of external worlds and construing the causal relations among objects and people to construct a functional map of social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569913480023">McAdams, 1993</xref>). Sensemaking often starts with chaos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1080569913480023">Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 2005</xref>). By constantly telling and sharing stories about what is happening around us, we often engage in a sensemaking process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1080569913480023">Weick et al. (2005)</xref> described, “To focus on sensemaking is to portray organizing as the experience of being thrown into an ongoing, unknowable, unpredictable streaming of experience in search of answers to the question, ‘what’s the story?’” (p. 410).</p>
<p>The primary goal of the sensemaking process is thus to knit together several themes and patterns of social phenomena into meaningful accounts that have coherence and sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1080569913480023">Riessman, 1993</xref>). This sensemaking process through storytelling is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1080569913480023">Bruner (1986)</xref> refers to as a narrative mode of thinking. In comparison with a scientific way of thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569913480023">Hummel (1991)</xref> explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>Further, as we hear the story, the events are not meaningful for us <italic>until we have read ourselves into the story</italic>. This is how a story, and the telling of it, functions in a fundamentally different way for us than does analytic science. Analytic science gives us events that are objective fragments of reality and leaves us detached from them; the story always gives us events that are intended to be coherent and meaningful <italic>to</italic> us, something that cannot happen unless we become involved with them. (p. 36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Telling autobiographical stories, for instance, allows us to make difficult and unrepeatable events in our organizational lives more meaningful by putting them in an interpretive sequence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje (1991b)</xref> argued that people “tell stories about the past, present, and future to make sense of and manage their struggle with their environment” (p. 124).

<title>Storytelling as a Communication Tool</title>
<p>One can hardly think of telling tales in a social vacuum. After nonverbal and preverbal stages of communication, our distant ancestors must have faced strong selection pressure for verbal communication out of an inborn need for social grooming and social affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1080569913480023">Dunbar, 1998</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1080569913480023">Tomasello (2008)</xref>, in our evolutionary history, human cooperative communication emerged first in the natural spontaneous gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Human cooperative communication, therefore, rests crucially on shared intentionality, comprising important prosocial motivations and social cognitive skills for joint attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1080569913480023">Tomasello, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas (2006)</xref>, for instance, described how <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> hunters engaged in cooperative communication via storytelling to share tacit knowledge on hunting:

<title>Sharing Stories as a Bonding Mechanism of the Community of Practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr (1996)</xref> further described how telling a war story—fixing problematic copier machines—among practitioners met not only the need for technical knowledge but also the need for group identity and social status. Storytelling was not only a communicative tool for sharing tacit knowledge among practitioners, but it also reinforced their social identity in the community of practitioners, thereby helping them gain social power as the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1080569913480023">Mumby, 1987</xref>). The community of practice is defined as “groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1080569913480023">Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Communities of practice evolve their own vocabularies and their own specialized ways of going about things. . . . You get this very fluid continuing improvisation, against a background of being able to read the other members of your community. In true communities, you start to see special ways of talking and communicating. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913480023">Brown et al., 2005</xref>, p. 62)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The field service technicians at Xerox belonged to a community of practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr (1996)</xref> described it as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Technicians clearly tell tales to establish their membership in the community, and the tales which preserve their solutions to problems also contribute to their reputation. . . . Their own presentations of their skilled work allow them to claim their identities as practitioner of the literally black art of restoring harmony to the relationship of customer and machine. (pp. 142-143)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the community of practitioners, stories are the currency that members of the same community exchange with other members. Individual stories are embedded in the communal narratives, as individual life stories can hardly be separated from social relations of the collective. This tendency seems to be what we have inherited from our distant ancestors who led the small hunter-gatherer way of life.</p>

<title>Storytelling as a Vehicle for Cultural Transmission</title>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, collaborative communication of the collective would have been possible only when our distant ancestors had developed a system of shared meaning and values for the community. Narratives with other symbolic mechanisms such as rituals must have played the crucial role of cultural vehicles for sharing and transmitting values, ideas, and practices that enhanced the chance of survival at the group level. The endurance and continuity of cultural values and norms have a great deal to do with our storytelling performance in collective settings. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1080569913480023">Geary (2008)</xref> pointed out, the use of stories to convey norms and morals of the community is a human universal: “Ideologies and mores enable the formation of large-scale cooperative communities, provide stability across generations, and support the cross-generational accumulation of cultural knowledge” (p. 181). We can find relevant examples in both the old and new ways of working life:
<disp-quote>
<p>Among the <italic>Ju/wasi</italic> at their fires at night, men told stories of hunting. All other stories were expressions of the culture, sometimes cautionary tales and often funny, usually familiar to everyone. . . . The stories that were told were myth-like accounts of actual hunts, and these were told over and over. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1080569913480023">Thomas, 2006</xref>, pp. 104-105)</p>
<p>Once war stories have been told, the stories are artifacts to circulate and preserve. Through them, experience becomes reproducible and reusable. At the same time, each retelling is, in a sense, a re-representation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569913480023">Orr, 1996</xref>, p. 126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From a cultural evolutionary perspective, stories that proved to be useful in the social milieu in which the collective was situated must have been selectively retained and transferred across generations. This cultural evolutionary process is still going on, as poignantly described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1080569913480023">Boje (1991b)</xref>, “Story performance is a process in which people interact to incorporate new tales continuously into the corporate culture while rewriting oral history by revising (or editing) the old stories that anchor the present to the past” (p. 110). Quite often retelling of a story in a large group tends to generate numerous variations from the original version of the story. If any of these variants is more vivid, unexpected, credible, and emotionally gripping, it will be retold more often than the original or other variants, and eventually out-propagates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1080569913480023">Heath &amp; Heath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1080569913480023">Lynch, 1996</xref>). In this way, thought contagion through the spread of stories follows the general pattern of a Darwinian blind variation and selective retention mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1080569913480023">Campbell, 1960</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1080569913480023">1981</xref>). It provides us an elegant explanation for why a certain version of the original story survives, whereas others die out in the population of the stories.</p>

<title>Evolutionarily Informed Practical Implications and Pedagogical Applications of Storytelling</title>
<p>One of the key theoretical contributions of EP to the business sciences is that we have inherited certain motivational biases—evolved psychological preferences and behavioral tendencies—which helped our ancestors to survive and reproduce in the ancient environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1080569913480023">Saad, 2011</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1080569913480023">Nicholson (1998)</xref> aptly described, one can take a person from the Stone Age, but cannot take the Stone Age out of the person. Given that our inherited motivational biases are very difficult to modify, it would be unwise or even detrimental to deny or go against our hardwired instincts. Furthermore, the practical wisdom of EP rests on the fact that the human mind was shaped under ancient environmental pressures, meaning that some of our inherited instincts are maladaptive in the modern workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1080569913480023">Colarelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1080569913480023">Crawford, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Telling tales is one of the hardwired instincts of our species; it is a natural way of communication. Evolutionarily speaking, the hardwired instinct for storytelling seems to start very early, even before the beginning of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1080569913480023">Klein, 1998</xref>). The actual process of narrative production has been the key cognitive coping mechanism in both ancient and modern worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1080569913480023">Hevern, 2008</xref>). In fact, most of us tend to prefer narrative information (or anecdotes) to scientific evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569913480023">Hummel, 1991</xref>). It is not surprising that “storytelling is a far more effective method of persuasion than statistical evidence for an audience who is unsympathetic to the message” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1080569913480023">Rappaport, 2008</xref>, p. 290). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1080569913480023">Kotter (2006)</xref> described his changing perception of the power of storytelling in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Over the years I have become convinced that we learn best—and change—from hearing stories that strike a chord within us. The dry academic tomes I wrote very early in my career were earnest reflections of the research I conducted, the analysis I applied and the conclusions I drew. And they had few readers, mostly other academics. I learned along the way and started including more and more stories in my work. My later books were read by many more people than my earliest work. (para. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569913480023">Akerlof and Shiller (2009)</xref>, two renowned economists, admitted that economists are taught to stick to quantitative facts and theory. It is generally considered unprofessional if economists base their analyses on stories:
<disp-quote>
<p>But what if the stories themselves move markets? What if these stories of overexplanation have real effects? What if they themselves are a real part of how the economy functions? Then economists have gone overboard. The stories no longer merely <italic>explain</italic> the facts; they <italic>are</italic> the facts. (p. 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the field of knowledge management, researchers have started noticing various practical implications of storytelling in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1080569913480023">Denning, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1080569913480023">Taylor, Fisher, &amp; Dufresne, 2002</xref>). Regarding the aforementioned study on the Xerox field servicemen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913480023">Brown et al. (2005)</xref> contended that “troubleshooting wasn’t driven solely by logic. . . . Afterward, the tech reps get together in a bar or a coffee shop and they start telling stories and listening to each other’s stories” (pp. 70-71). The conversational style of their storytelling was short and succinct enough to be well remembered.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, the key to building an innovative community of practice is to cultivate organizational culture that encourages accidental and deliberate interbreeding of ideas through conversations, dialogue, and storytelling. Novartis, a well-known drug company based in Switzerland, provides us a good example:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is spending a huge amount of money ripping down their 19th century industrial plant, which covers a great deal of Basel—20 odd buildings—and putting up a “knowledge campus” which is very, very different. This isn’t just replacing one building with another, new building; this is developing a <italic>knowledge campus</italic> to encourage knowledge transfer—watching how people work and developing spaces in such a way that they’re more likely to meet and to talk. There’s much more open space. This is a Swiss firm, and everyone was enclosed in separate offices, and labs were closed off. At Novartis, they’re putting in very strategic places Italian coffee houses, open spaces with marble tops and little bars, serving expresso and biscotti. Very, very encouraging to come and sit down, have a cup of coffee and talk to someone. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913480023">Brown et al., 2005</xref>, p. 47)</p>

<p>Pixar, the animation film company, is an excellent North American case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1080569913480023">Catmull, 2008</xref>). The company deliberately created a physical arrangement that increases the chance of beneficial mutations and recombination of innovative ideas:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our building, which is Steve Job’s brainchild, is another way we try to get people from different departments to interact. Most buildings are designed for some functional purpose, but ours is structured to maximize <italic>inadvertent encounters</italic> [italics added]. At its center is a large atrium, which contains the cafeteria, meeting rooms, bathrooms, and mail boxes. As a result, everyone has strong reasons to go there repeatedly during the course of the workday. It’s hard to describe just how valuable the resulting chance encounters are. (p. 71)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, to meet the need of developing and training in learning organizations, storytelling is particularly effective when contexts or contextual information is critically important. Tacit knowledge shared in the community of practice is hard to manualize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569913480023">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). The nuance and very subtle nature of every case or problematic situation requires a shared contextual understanding, which enables the members to communicate more effectively. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1080569913480023">Linde (2001)</xref> succinctly described, storytelling has solved the dilemma as “narrative provides a bridge between the tacit and the explicit, allowing tacit social knowledge to be demonstrated and learned, without the need to propositionalize it” (p. 160).</p>
<p>In addition, because of their emotional richness, stories with contextual cues facilitate the retrieval from one’s long-term memory. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1080569913480023">Kulkofsky, Wang, and Ceci (2008)</xref>, narrative skills enabled preschool children to report more information, with an accompanying decrease in the proportion of information that was accurate. In other words, volume was related with a decrease in accuracy, whereas narrative cohesion was associated with an increase in accuracy. Yet storytelling has been widely used in classrooms to enhance students’ memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1080569913480023">Sandoz, 2006</xref>) and their learning of management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1080569913480023">Boje, 1991a</xref>). In work organizations, it has been reported that storytelling is more persuasive than statements or quantitative information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1080569913480023">Martin &amp; Powers, 1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1080569913480023">1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1080569913480023">Swap, Leonard, Shields, &amp; Abrams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, from an evolutionary perspective, it would be better to loosen up the screws a little bit for the sake of flexibility and adaptability of an organization. It is about transforming a rigid hierarchy into a more egalitarian community of trust and collaboration, which would help people feel more comfortable and encouraged to engage in authentic communication more naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1080569913480023">Mintzberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1080569913480023">Schein, 1993</xref>). In fact, being in a good mood seems to help people process information more effectively and creatively. For instance, it is reported that top-performing leaders elicited laughter from their subordinates three times more often, on average, than did average performing leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1080569913480023">Goleman &amp; Boyatzis, 2008</xref>). In other words, outstanding executives used more humor that released tension and expressed positive regard than average executives did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1080569913480023">Sala, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the role of leaders in shaping organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1080569913480023">Schein, 2010</xref>), strategic leadership is critical for moving an organization as a complex adaptive system to the edge of chaos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569913480023">Boal &amp; Schultz, 2007</xref>). In this regard, informally told and shared stories can help create strong organizational culture that can support a corporate strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1080569913480023">Wilkins, 1984</xref>). Storytelling also includes some practical implications for developing innovative training and educational programs in organizations. For instance, great literature can be utilized in various leadership development programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1080569913480023">Podolny, 2011</xref>), as fiction provides emotional stimulation and enhances one’s capacity for empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1080569913480023">Oatley, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569913480023">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that fiction seems to be more effective for changing beliefs than writing that is created to persuade through argument and evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1080569913480023">Gottschall, 2012</xref>), storytelling can be applied to professional business education to enhance students’ leadership and communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569913480023">Forman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1080569913480023">Gardner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1080569913480023">Kotter, 2010</xref>). Storytelling can be further used in a business communication curriculum to develop students’ sensemaking skills and their capacities for empathy. For example, full-time working MBA students enrolled in the present author’s organizational behavior class are assigned homework to collect stories from their workplaces and to write a reflection paper on their collected stories. They are expected to pay close attention to such stories, which may include narratives, rumors, and even gossip that their supervisors and colleagues talk about. They should observe the impact of their collected stories on group dynamics and organizational culture. In some sense, each student is encouraged to emulate an organizational anthropologist doing an ethnographic study in the field. These collected stories are the raw materials that students are going to dissect in order to make sense of their work experiences and consolidate their identities through narrating and reconstructing new meanings and values of their work lives.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, a majority of the students tend to have a low opinion of storytelling in business. This perception can be attributed to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569913480023">Forman (2013)</xref> called the “antistory bias,” which refers to business students’ overreliance on “charts, graphs, tables, and PowerPoint presentations crammed with bullet points, which list ideas or information but neglect to find and express the connections among them in story form” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569913480023">Forman, 2013</xref>, p. 14). The unfortunate consequence is that students are rarely aware of how story shapes their work lives in spite of its omnipresence in their workplaces. For instance, Anna, a female student from England, wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>For the average person the term storytelling conjures up images of a child cuddled up in bed attentively listening to the story that a parent is reading from a children’s book or the image of an adult sharing a story about his or her past. Certainly this is the image that is conjured up in my mind at least when I ponder about the word “storytelling.” Hence, at first I was rather surprised to pick up a book titled Organizational Storytelling. I rather naively asked myself: What does storytelling have to do with organizations? Aren’t stories meant for children and organizations meant for adults? Unsurprisingly, upon further digging I found out that I was rather wrong in my primitive and truncated view of storytelling.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By collecting and reflecting on their stories, the students often come to realize that they have underrated important functions of storytelling in their workplaces. For example, Diksha, a female Indian American student, described,
<disp-quote>
<p>I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t surprised by the stories that I gathered for this reaction paper. Before reading any literature on storytelling and its powers to intervene and define the culture of any organization, I believed them to be harmless and naive exchanges of opinions between individuals. However, after being exposed to their intricate and overwhelming nature, I realized that they are more than a simplistic narrative aimed at a “light hearted banter.” It’s not just me who has remained unaware of how these anecdotes and stories are molding our thinking and actions, but there are several others in my department who are unknowingly caught in their maze.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diksha made further comments after she realized how she had underappreciated the power of storytelling in her workplace:
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that strikes me the most is the fact that all the stories are in negative connotation. This can mean that we are among very bad people but a more likely explanation would be that it is easier to publicize negativity. Also surprising is the constant negligence on the management’s side to take any concerted action against the wrongdoers in some of these negative stories, which to me, is synonymous to their silent approval. It seems fair to say that our organization has developed some sort of bureaucratic attitude in which some people become powerful and get a free rein to run things their way. This sometimes becomes too overwhelming and disheartening for the most of us and builds a culture of mistrust and fear. Another key highlight is how a culture lacking in empathy and cooperation among employees has been growing over years.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By collecting and narrating organizational stories, it seems that the students have learned to be more mindful of the interconnectedness of discrete stories on disparate events, and thus to maintain a more reliable cognitive framework of their organizational realities. Furthermore, considering the increasing challenges of managing a global workforce and organizational diversity with respect to gender, race, ethnicity, age, and religion, storytelling might be one of the best pedagogical tools for training students in cross-cultural communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569913480023">Barker &amp; Gower, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, the modern workplace is a novel environment. Like modern educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1080569913480023">Geary, 2008</xref>), the workplace is one of the core interfaces between evolved psychological adaptations and the culture of modern society. Contemporary workers are put under the evolutionarily recent work environments dealing with evolutionarily novel information and knowledge. Yet the key mechanism for acquiring new information remains an ancient method—the telling and sharing of tales.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary psychological view of the human mind, this article has emphasized that storytelling is an evolved trait, shaped through competitive pressure for survival and securing mates. Our narrative mind has assisted our ancestors to formulate coherent internal representations of self and others in an uncertain—and even disrupted—social terrain. Given our inherent social need for membership and belonging, our individual life story is often embedded in the story of the community from which we derive our identity. Even exchanging short and cryptic stories with in-group members is an effective way of transmitting tacit knowledge and institutional memory, which all contributes to the continuation and solidarity of the collective. Telling stories is thus an adaptive mechanism of remembering the past and reinforcing social identity in a communal context.</p>
<p>If storytelling is a built-in predisposition of our species, it is highly probable that both hunter-gatherers and contemporary workers would utilize storytelling as a cognitive device to maintain power and a coherent and integrative identity. Through shared stories about the past, present, and future, this narrative reasoning allows them to make sense of and manage struggles with their environment. Ethnographic studies have shown that communication among contemporary office supply technicians often evolved around machines and shared “war” stories—narratives about diagnosing and fixing machine problems—much like the Kalahari hunters who frequently shared the trials and tribulations of animal hunting. War stories exchanged among ancient and modern-day workers have apparently had a profound effect on a multitude of common functions (i.e., informational, social, and aesthetic pleasure/recreational). Contrary to expectation, knowledge was diffused and stored primarily through an oral culture, even among contemporary technical workers. It also appears that telling a war story is fundamentally multifunctional on multiple levels: It is a demonstration of not only one’s identity and competence as a hunter or a technician but also one’s membership and status in the community.</p>
<p>This study has also discussed some evolutionarily informed practical and pedagogical implications of storytelling in modern environments. The bottom line is to transform companies into communities where vicarious adaptive learning from sharing stories occurs more frequently among practitioners in mutually respectful ways. It is about nurturing an organizational culture that facilitates the free exchange of stories, allowing the mutations and the recombination of ideas to enhance the collective wisdom and adaptive intelligence of the organization. Pedagogically speaking, storytelling is one of the hardwired instincts of our species and probably the most natural—meaning that it is evolutionarily designed—way of human communication and learning. The apparent “antistory bias” entrenched in business education is detrimental to the learning process, as it ignores the built-in narrative desire of the human mind. This is the evolutionary rationale for more emphasis on the presence of storytelling in the business curriculum.</p>
