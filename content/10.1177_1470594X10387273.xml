<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two types of moral reasons are commonly invoked in support of the view that we (that is, affluent individuals in the developed world) are required to address poverty in developing countries. The first of these are assistance-based moral reasons (invoked famously by Peter Singer), which depend on the idea that because poor people are in severe need and we are in a position to alleviate such need at some cost, we are required to do so. Second are contribution-based moral reasons (explored in Thomas Pogge’s influential recent work), which are based on the idea that we are required to alleviate severe harm suffered by the poor in developing countries because we have contributed or are contributing to it. Pogge does not deny that we have assistance-based moral reasons to rescue people from life-threatening poverty. Rather, he insists that it is misleading to focus on these reasons (thought by many to be of relatively little importance) when contribution-based moral reasons not to bring about life-threatening poverty are in play. We must, he writes, ‘stop thinking about world poverty in terms of helping the poor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2008</xref>: 23; compare also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems to matter a great deal, morally speaking, whether the affluent are contributing to global poverty. All other things being equal, reasons associated with contributing to severe deprivations such as extreme poverty are commonly thought to be important because they are <italic>stringent</italic>. They are stringent in the sense that they <italic>constrain</italic> agents: prospective contributors to severe deprivation cannot easily justify their conduct by appealing to the costs to themselves of refraining from so contributing or by appealing to the overall good that their conduct will bring about. They are also stringent in the sense that they <italic>demand</italic> much of agents who have ignored constraints against contributing to severe deprivation, but are now in a position to mitigate or alleviate the deprivations to which they have contributed.</p>
<p>Indeed, contribution-based moral reasons play a very substantial role in many people’s moral thinking. This is true for <italic>retrospective</italic> assessment, in that the significance of one’s reasons to bring remedy to or to compensate for severe deprivations that occurred in the past is generally taken to depend in part upon whether one has contributed to them. It is also true for <italic>prospective</italic> assessment, in that the significance of our reasons to address presently occurring severe deprivations and to prevent future deprivations from occurring is generally taken to depend in part upon whether our past or present conduct is contributing or <italic>will have</italic> contributed to their occurrence.</p>
<p>Many assert that affluent countries have contributed in the past to poverty in developing countries through wars of aggression and conquest, colonialism and its legacies, the imposition of puppet leaders, and support for brutal dictators and venal elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X10387273">

</xref></sup> Perhaps Pogge’s most important innovation is his argument that there is an <italic>additional</italic> and, arguably, even more consequential way in which the affluent continue to contribute to poverty in the developing world. He argues that when people cooperate in instituting and upholding institutional arrangements that foreseeably result in more severe or more widespread poverty or human rights deficits than would foreseeably result under feasible alternative arrangements, they are contributors to these harms. Because of this, he argues, they have stringent, contribution-based (or negative) duties to address this poverty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X10387273">

</xref></sup> We will call this the ‘Feasible Alternatives Thesis' (FAT). Our aims in this article are to assess whether FAT is plausible and whether Pogge is correct that agents who contribute to poverty via FAT have stringent duties to address it.</p>
<p>We note in passing that whether or not FAT is justified, Pogge has presented other reasons why we should stop thinking about world poverty only in terms of helping the poor. Affluent countries share with developing countries, he has often pointed out, a long and bloody history (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2001</xref>). This history is relevant not just to specific harms, but also to the kinds of institutional arrangements, including the sovereign state system itself, that have come into being. These are important considerations that have serious implications for action, but since they are distinct from FAT, we will not explore them here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X10387273">

<title>The Feasible Alternatives Thesis</title>
<p>Pogge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470594X10387273">2005a</xref>: 60) explains the Feasible Alternatives Thesis in the following manner:<disp-quote>
<p>we are <italic>harming</italic> the global poor if and insofar as we collaborate in imposing an <italic>unjust</italic> global institutional order upon them. And this institutional order is definitely unjust if and insofar as it foreseeably perpetuates large-scale human rights deficits that would be reasonably avoidable through feasible institutional modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X10387273">

</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some of Pogge’s critics have argued that his work (and FAT in particular) trades on an unduly stretched understanding of what it means to contribute to severe deprivation involving human rights deficits or other harms. It has even been suggested that, appropriately construed, his conception of contributing to harm would entail that failing to save some child may count as harming that child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470594X10387273">Reitberger, 2008</xref>: 387–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470594X10387273">Satz, 2005</xref>: 54). These critics come to this conclusion by observing that a system of global institutional arrangements that would suffice to eliminate large-scale human rights deficits in developing countries might require international transfers to provide the basic necessities for poor people and the adopting of trade regimes that offer them much better terms. Such measures may even involve asymmetries that permit certain kinds of discrimination against wealthy countries. They then dismiss FAT by asserting that this amounts to the claim that you harm another person by failing to provide assistance or by not granting them asymmetric terms that benefit them. Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470594X10387273">Patten (2005</xref>: 26), for example, argues that Pogge’s view entails that<disp-quote>
<p>in almost any situation in which an affluent person is connected with a badly off person, the affluent person will count as ‘harming’ the badly off person, so long as there is <italic>some</italic> institutional scheme the affluent person could bring to bear that alleviates the suffering of the badly off. And this is tantamount to saying that by failing to help (through institutions) the affluent person would be harming them.</p>
</disp-quote>Pogge is, according to this criticism, trying to increase the moral significance of the failure of the affluent to prevent global poverty by camouflaging a controversial positive duty of assistance as a stringent negative duty not to contribute to harm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X10387273">
5
</xref></sup> Justice may well demand the institutional reforms advocated by Pogge, they say, but not on the ground that failing to bring such reforms makes the affluent <italic>contributors</italic> to poverty. Pogge has replied that his view does not depend on an unduly stretched meaning of harm, pointing to the restrictions that he places on the use of this concept. He writes:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The affluent persons must <italic>cooperate</italic> in imposing an institutional order on those whose human rights are unfulfilled. This institutional order must be designed so that it <italic>foreseeably</italic> gives rise to substantial human rights deficits. These human rights deficits must be <italic>reasonably avoidable</italic> in the sense that an alternative design of the relevant institutional order would not produce comparable human rights deficits or other ills of comparable magnitude. And the availability of such an alternative design must also be <italic>foreseeable</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2005a</xref>: 60)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While Pogge is correct that these restrictions (cooperation, foreseeability, reasonable avoidability, and so on) limit the application of his concept of contributing to harm more than critics such as Patten allege, we do not think that this response is adequate. Consider a modified formulation of Patten’s critique:<disp-quote>
<p>In almost any situation in which an affluent person cooperates in imposing an institutional order that foreseeably gives rise to substantial human rights deficits, which is reasonably avoidable in the sense that an alternative design of the relevant institutional order would not produce comparable human rights deficits or other ills of comparable magnitude (and the availability of such an alternative design must also be foreseeable), then the affluent person will count as ‘harming’ the badly off person. This is tantamount to saying that by failing to help (through institutions) the poor, the affluent person would be harming them.</p>
</disp-quote>Without a plausible account of the distinction between contributing to global poverty and merely failing to prevent it, however, we cannot rationally evaluate whether this type of critique of Pogge’s position is correct. That is, we need a plausible account of what is often known in the philosophical literature as the distinction between doing or contributing to harm, on the one hand, and allowing or merely failing to prevent harm, on the other. Furthermore, we need to determine whether, according to this distinction, agents that are related to poverty via FAT count as contributors to it.</p>

<title>Contributing to harm and failing to prevent it</title>
<p>While most analyses attempt to reduce the distinction between contributing to and failing to prevent harm to one sharp empirical or action-theoretic relation, we believe that there are instead a number of relations that underlie its use. To keep things simple, we invoke cases involving poverty in a developing country (Developing) and explore various ways in which the conduct of an affluent country (Affluent) may be deemed relevant to this poverty.</p>
<p>We use the term ‘harm’ in this article to refer to severe deprivations: shortfalls that persons are likely suffer in their health, civic status, or standard of living relative to the essential needs and requirements (for example, food, drink, shelter, and minimal health protection) of human beings. Being in a state of extreme poverty, for example, is to suffer harm in our sense. The question of contribution is then a question of the relation between an agent and a victim’s severe deprivation. The tasks are therefore to make clear the different ways in which an agent may be related to some severe deprivation and what should count as being a contributor.</p>
<sec id="section4-1470594X10387273">
<title>Clear-cut cases of contributing to harm: Doing harm</title>
<p>Let us start by considering the following two cases in which Affluent’s contribution to the poverty of Developing seems quite clear-cut.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Colonial Imposition</italic>. Affluent launches a sustained military assault on Developing, destroying much of its infrastructure and disrupting its economy in ways that cause deterioration in the living standards of its people. It then keeps the people under its yoke by ruling it from afar, and later through a titular head or puppet regime.</p>
<p>
<italic>Toxic Pollution</italic>. Affluent pollutes the ocean. Health problems in Developing are caused by the consumption of fish, which have high levels of toxins in them as a result of Affluent’s activities. These health problems help cause further deterioration in the living standards of Developing’s people.</p>
</disp-quote>These are clear-cut cases of contributing to severe deprivation. We know of no one who would deny that Affluent is a contributor to poverty in Developing in these cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X10387273">
6
</xref></sup> The judgement that Affluent contributes to these severe deprivations does not appear to be sensitive to other factors which are relevant to the overall moral assessment of Affluent’s conduct, such as whether its citizens intend, foresee, or should foresee that these harms will result from its conduct or the extent to which acting to prevent them would be costly to Affluent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470594X10387273">
7
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>What makes these cases so clear-cut? What are the significant relations between Affluent and Developing in these cases? After all, they differ in a great many respects. We think that they are clear-cut because of the presence of two factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470594X10387273">
8
</xref></sup> The first factor that is present in these cases is what might be called <italic>relevant action</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470594X10387273">
9
</xref></sup> If Affluent is linked to poverty suffered in Developing by relevant action, then there is an answer to the question of <italic>how</italic> she contributed to these harms that refers to something she <italic>did</italic>.</p>
<p>In both Colonial Imposition and Toxic Pollution there are clear answers to the question of <italic>how</italic> Affluent becomes relevant to poverty suffered in Developing, and these answers refer to things that Affluent did: <italic>Affluent dropped bombs on</italic> and colonized Developing in Colonial Imposition and <italic>emitted toxic pollutants</italic> that poisoned fish consumed by people in Developing in Toxic Pollution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470594X10387273">
10
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The second factor that is present in these cases is that Affluent’s relevant action takes the form of <italic>initiating a complete causal process</italic> that links it to the harms in Developing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470594X10387273">
11
</xref></sup> That is, there is a spatio-temporally continuous causal chain linking the relevant action of Affluent and the harms in Developing. In the case of Colonial Imposition, this causal chain takes the form of the transfer of energy or momentum (or both) from Affluent to Developing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470594X10387273">
12
</xref></sup> Because they involve complete causal processes, Colonial Imposition and Toxic Pollution are comparable to a simple case (that is, Push) that has been used in the literature on the distinction between doing and allowing harm.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Push</italic>. A cart stands at the top of a hill. Agent pushes it. The cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting at the bottom of the hill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470594X10387273">
13
</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In developing and explaining his arguments regarding contribution-based responsibilities, Pogge often invokes simple cases that, like Push, involve the transfer of energy and momentum from some agent to a victim that suffers harm as a result. He does this, for example, when supporting his claim that by contributing to harm you have particularly stringent responsibilities to address the harm to which you have contributed. Pogge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X10387273">2004</xref>: 278) writes:<disp-quote>
<p>an injured child must be rushed to the hospital if her leg is to be saved. As a competent bystander who ignores her plight, you are subject to moral criticism for failing to assist. But if you are the driver who injured the child in the first place, then more is morally at stake: by leaving the child’s needs unattended, you would greatly increase the harm you will have done her.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470594X10387273">
14
</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>It is easy to see why Pogge invokes such examples – the moral reasons of those who have contributed to harm in this fashion to address these harms are thought to be quite important. Duties to avoid such harming are quite constraining: agents are typically obliged to take on a great deal of personal cost to avoid harming others in this fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470594X10387273">
15
</xref></sup> In so far as the affluent are contributing to poverty or other human rights deficits in developing countries in this fashion (as in Colonial Imposition and Toxic Pollution), it would be hard to resist his overall conclusion that they have very stringent moral reasons to address these harms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X10387273">
<title>Clear-cut cases of allowing harm</title>
<p>Consider, by contrast, cases in which neither relevant action nor a complete causal process connects one agent with the harms suffered by another. Pogge presents one such case, which he calls ‘Venus'.<disp-quote>
<p>Suppose we discovered people on Venus who are very badly off, and suppose that we could help them at little cost to ourselves. If we did nothing, we would surely violate a positive duty of beneficence. But we would not be violating a negative duty of justice, because we would not be contributing to the perpetuation of their misery. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2008</xref>: 198)</p>
</disp-quote>The Earthlings are not contributors to severe deprivation on Venus. Some people might hold the Earthlings to be <italic>a</italic> cause of the future deprivations of the Venusians, since their <italic>failure</italic> to assist them may be seen as a causally relevant condition of the harms that ensue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470594X10387273">
16
</xref></sup> But when an agent is a causally relevant condition of the perpetuation of some deprivation in <italic>this</italic> way, it does not follow that that agent does harm to the deprived party.</p>
<p>In Venus there is no complete causal process from the Earthlings to the poverty on Venus. No poverty on Venus traces back to the Earthlings via a spatio-temporally continuous causal chain. Nor, in this case, is there relevant action. Suppose that in 10 years one were to ask <italic>how</italic> the Earthlings were relevant to Venusian poverty over the preceding 10-year period. The question itself may seem odd, since it may seem inappropriate to say that the Earthlings were relevant in any way whatsoever to it. A sensible answer, however, would be that the Earthlings were relevant because they failed to do things that would have prevented this poverty from occurring. This answer will not refer to anything the Earthlings did, but to what they <italic>did not do</italic>. Some will consider the conduct of the Earthlings to be a causally relevant condition of the maintenance of poverty on Venus, since they could have alleviated, but chose not to alleviate this poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X10387273">Bennett, 1995</xref>: 186–7). However, there is no relevant action on their part. Venus is comparable in these respects to another simple case: Stayback.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Stayback</italic>. The cart is already rolling. Agent could, but does not interpose a rock, which would stop it. The cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting at the bottom of the hill.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470594X10387273">
<title>Intermediate cases: Enabling harm</title>
<p>The examples examined above suggest that when the relevant action of Affluent to the harm suffered by Developing links Affluent with the harm via a complete causal process, then Affluent <italic>does</italic> harm to Developing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470594X10387273">
17
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>However, according to FAT, the affluent can contribute to poverty in the developing world even though there may be no complete causal process that links their behaviour to this poverty. Pogge has repeatedly alleged, for example, that the affluent contribute to the poverty suffered by many people in developing countries because their governments charge tariffs on developing countries' cheap textile and agricultural goods and provide subsidies to their own producers of agricultural goods and textiles while at the same time pressuring developing countries to open their markets to products exported from affluent countries (assuming here that this is in fact bad for the poor).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470594X10387273">
18
</xref></sup> The affluent also contribute to poverty, according to him, when their governments seek more stringent intellectual property protection as a condition for granting increased market access to developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2008</xref>: 263–4).</p>
<p>We introduce two cases, Subsidy and Tariff, to model some of the ways that Pogge claims that the affluent become relevant to poverty via FAT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470594X10387273">
19
</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Subsidy</italic>. Trade in foodstuffs between Affluent and Developing would improve the conditions of the severely deprived in Developing. Affluent subsidizes its own producers of foodstuffs, thereby making it difficult for producers in Developing to compete. Exports from Developing to Affluent decrease, and a substantial number of people in Developing end up in severe poverty.</p>
<p>
<italic>Tariff</italic>. Trade in foodstuffs between Affluent and Developing would improve the conditions of the severely deprived in Developing. Affluent puts tariffs on foodstuffs from Developing, thereby making it difficult for producers in Developing to sell their goods to Affluent. Trade in foodstuffs between Affluent and Developing is diminished, and a substantial number of people in Developing end up in severe poverty.</p>
</disp-quote>We are here assuming that in both of these cases no other causes result in the same people ending up in severe poverty. We are therefore assuming that the poverty of these people is not over-determined, and that the subsidies and tariffs that Affluent employs make the poor worse off.</p>
<p>Subsidy and Tariff are unlike Toxic Pollution or Colonial Imposition, since in neither of these cases is there a complete causal process linking the behaviour of Affluent and poverty in Developing. Yet, they are also unlike Stayback and Venus, since in both cases Affluent <italic>enables</italic> the occurrence of poverty in Developing through Affluent’s relevant action.</p>
<p>With respect to Tariff, the conduct of Affluent <italic>prevents</italic> a process (that is, an increased volume of trade in agricultural exports from Developing) that would (by hypothesis) prevent poverty in Developing. It does so in a manner that is perhaps best described as <italic>creating</italic> an obstacle. In Subsidy, a benefit that Affluent offers to its domestic producers could be seen as <italic>removing</italic> an obstacle to their engagement in production. This productive activity results in goods and services that come to market at prices that <italic>prevent</italic> international trading activity. These patterns of trade would (by hypothesis) leave the poor in exporting countries worse off than they would be without the subsidy. From the point of view of exporters in Developing, such subsidies will likely be viewed as <italic>creating an obstacle</italic> that prevents them from reaping certain gains from trade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1470594X10387273">
20
</xref></sup> Subsidy and Tariff appear to be cases of what Mathew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X10387273">Hanser (1999)</xref> has called ‘preventing a preventer’. They are cases that are most naturally described as instances of <italic>enabling harm</italic> to occur. Subsidy and Tariff are comparable in this respect to two simple cases: Remove and Interpose.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent kicks away the rock; the cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting there.</p>
<p>
<italic>Interpose</italic>. A cart filled with water is rolling downhill. Victim, who is sitting at the bottom of the hill, will survive if the cart reaches her. Agent interposes a rock; the cart stops and Victim dies of thirst.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Remove no complete causal process links Agent with Victim’s injuries. There is such a process between Agent and the rock and ultimately whatever <italic>it</italic> hits, but there is no process from Agent through the cart and down to Victim. There is relevant action, however, because the answer to how Agent is relevant to Victim’s injuries refers to something he does: <italic>he kicked away the rock</italic> that would have prevented them.</p>
<p>In Interpose, there is no complete causal process that links Agent to Victim’s injuries. There <italic>is</italic> such a process between Agent and the rock he interposes, and thus also with the cart, which it stops, but not from Agent to Victim. There is relevant action in this case, however, because the answer to how Agent is relevant to Victim’s injuries refers to something he does: <italic>he interposed the rock</italic> that stopped the cart, thereby preventing water from reaching Victim. In this case, Agent’s relevant action consists in the interposition of an obstacle. In Remove, Agent enables the cart to hit Victim by removing a rock, while in Interpose Agent enables Victim to die of thirst by obstructing the cart carrying water.</p>
<p>In Remove and Interpose, we naturally compare the actual outcome with the upshot that would have happened had the rock not been removed or interposed. Note that this does not mean that enabling harm involves counterfactual dependence, since Agent would still enable harm by removing a rock in Remove or interposing a rock in Interpose even if another agent stood ready to remove or interpose the relevant obstacles. As long as Agent actually removed or interposed a rock, he would enable the harm <italic>as it happened</italic>. His action would be linked to this outcome through relevant action.</p>
<p>Philosophers disagree about how to classify cases like these in terms of a binary doing/allowing distinction. Philosophers who in some way or another emphasize an agent’s movements (such as Jonathan Bennett) or actions (such as Warren Quinn, Kadre Vivhelin, and Terrance Tomkow) would all say that Agent does harm to Victim in Remove and Interpose. Philippa Foot, by contrast, would reduce the doing and allowing distinction to that between <italic>initiating or sustaining</italic> a harmful causal sequence and <italic>allowing</italic> a harmful causal sequence to run its course. Consequently, Foot would therefore claim that Agent merely allows Victim’s injuries to occur in cases such as Remove (1994: 281).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1470594X10387273">

<p>Ordinary people’s judgements about whether Agent does harm or merely allows harm to occur in Remove and Interpose also diverge. Interestingly, their judgements about cases of these kinds appear to be sensitive to further facts about Agent. Consider, first, facts concerning Agent’s knowledge of the situation by looking at some variations of Remove.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove (Knowledge)</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent knows that if he kicks the rock away Victim will be injured; refraining from kicking the rock away is not costly to him; and the potential injury to Victim is quite severe. Nevertheless, he kicks the rock away; the cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting there.</p>
</disp-quote>When asked to classify the Agent’s conduct in terms of the binary distinction between doing and allowing harm, many people judge Agent to have done harm in this case, and not merely to have allowed it to occur. This contrasts markedly with the rather more divergent reactions people tend to have in response to the following Kick variation.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove (Non-culpable Ignorance)</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent is unaware of the cart rolling down the hill, and cannot plausibly be expected to be aware of it. He kicks the rock away; the cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting there.</p>
</disp-quote>Some people seem to hold that Agent allows Victim’s injuries to occur in this case, and quite a few deny that Agent does harm to Victim. That agent <italic>knows</italic> about the outcome of his kicking away the rock seems to influence judgements about this type of case.</p>
<p>Cases such as Remove and Interpose differ in these respects from cases such as Push and Stayback. No matter how morally wrong it is for a person to stand by and knowingly watch a child drown when he can save him at little or no cost, he will not be judged to have done harm to the child if he fails to intervene. He is a very culpable bystander that has allowed a terrible thing to happen. And even if Agent were ignorant in Push of the fact that Victim is at the bottom of the hill and will be injured by the cart, he will still be judged to have done harm to Victim – a morally innocent contributor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1470594X10387273">

</p>
<p>Assuming a binary distinction, we do not think there is any real fact of the matter regarding whether the Agents involved in Remove or Interpose <italic>really</italic> do harm to victims or merely allow them to be harmed. However, we think that it is misleading to try to subsume these intermediate cases into either the categories of doing harm or allowing harm. As we have shown, these cases are distinct in their causal structure from clear-cut cases of doing harm and of allowing harm. Enablers of harm contribute to harm, but they do so in a quite different manner than those who do harm in ways involving a spatio-temporally continuous causal process. We suggest, tentatively, that <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470594X10387273">Table 1</xref>

<title>Enabling harm and FAT</title>
<p>According to FAT, someone becomes a contributor to poverty as a result of cooperating in creating and upholding institutional schemes that are foreseeably suboptimal with respect to poverty avoidance. Is this plausible?</p>
<sec id="section8-1470594X10387273">
<title>Venus*</title>
<p>Suppose there are 100 million Venusians who for the most part live in severe poverty. Some 3 million Venusians die each year from poverty-related causes. Venusians are basically like us: they look for love and meaning, they often breed, and they die. When they experience poverty, they suffer as Earthlings do. We could, as in Venus, just leave them to their fate and refrain from cooperating in bringing about any institutional scheme. We would then, on Pogge’s account, <italic>allow</italic> them to remain poor, and could accordingly not be said to contribute to their poverty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1470594X10387273">
23
</xref></sup> Moreover, we could not plausibly be claimed to <italic>contribute</italic> (by doing <italic>or</italic> enabling) to their poverty by sending one shipload of valuable resources to them simply because we could have sent two.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that the Earthlings are interested in setting up stable institutional arrangements with them, including, in particular, arrangements to ensure mutual market access. The Venusians possess materials that Earthlings want and we have things that they want, so both sides envision possible gains from trade. Each of the parties recognizes that these gains will be more likely if they can arrive at an agreement that will then bind all participants and whose rules will be coercively imposed. The Earthlings and Venusians are faced with four options with respect to organizing their interactions with each other. They could adopt three trading schemes with standing rules: Trade, Free-Trade, or Good-Trade. Each of these schemes would be transparent, rule-based systems that would provide mutual market access. All of Trade, Free-Trade, and Good-Trade would incorporate dispute-settlement procedures and a system of incentives for compliance with their rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1470594X10387273">
24
</xref></sup> Should they, rather, opt for No-Trade, they could if they wish continue to engage in market interactions, but without any rule-based system underlying it.</p>
<p>The three rule-based systems would have the following characteristics. <italic>Trade</italic> would resemble in most relevant respects the current rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). <italic>Free-Trade</italic>, on the other hand, would differ from Trade by incorporating rules that would be more successful in preventing actions that are frequently cited as examples of unfairness or double standards in the present world trading system, for example, the imposition of tariffs by developed countries on imported textiles and agricultural goods from developing countries or the provision by developed countries of subsidies to their own producers of such goods, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2004</xref>: 277, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470594X10387273">2005a</xref>: 62). <italic>Good-Trade</italic>, by contrast, would go further. It would permit, for example, poor countries to do things that rich countries would be forbidden from doing under the terms of the scheme, such as the imposition of tariffs and instituting currency controls against speculative inflows, and it would place a small tax on trade between the two parties, the revenues of which would be used to promote poverty alleviation on Venus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1470594X10387273">
25
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Let us imagine that the Earthlings' preferences are, in decreasing order, Trade, No-Trade, Free-Trade, and Good-Trade, while the Venusians' preferences are Good-Trade, Free-Trade, Trade, and No-Trade. With this background, consider the following.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Venus* 1</italic>. The Earth delegates' superior bargaining power has enabled them to get the Venusians to agree to adopt Trade. Economic activity ordered by Trade will benefit the Earthlings a great deal, and will reduce by 1 million per year the number of poverty-related deaths suffered on Venus relative to what had occurred under No-Trade.</p>
</disp-quote>Although Trade is better than No-Trade for the Venusians, Free-Trade would improve conditions on Venus much more than Trade, reducing the number of poverty-related deaths by 2 million per year. According to FAT, once Trade is implemented, the Earthlings become contributors to harm suffered by the Venusians. The former would be instituting and upholding institutional arrangements that are then coercively imposed, and these arrangements would foreseeably engender a million more deaths per year than a feasible alternative trading regime (that is, Free-Trade).</p>
<p>Consider next:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Venus* 2</italic>. Venus* 2 is just like Venus* 1, except that in this case the Earthlings and Venusians agree on Free-Trade, rather than Trade – perhaps as a result of moral suasion. By adopting Free-Trade the number of poverty-related deaths is reduced by 2 million per year.</p>
</disp-quote>Although Free-Trade is better than Trade for the Venusians, Good-Trade would improve conditions on Venus even more than Free-Trade, reducing the number of poverty related deaths by 2.5 million per year (leaving 0.5 million to suffer poverty-related deaths). According to FAT, once Free-Trade is implemented, and there is a feasible alternative such as Good-Trade, the Earthlings would become contributors to the excess harms suffered by the Venusians. The former would be instituting and upholding institutional arrangements that are then coercively imposed, and which would foreseeably engender 0.5 million more deaths per year than some feasible alternative trading regime (that is, Good-Trade).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1470594X10387273">
26
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Feasible Alternatives Thesis maintains that the Earthlings contribute to Venusian poverty in <italic>both</italic> Venus* 1 and Venus* 2. Is this plausible? Let us consider this with reference to the distinctions developed in the previous section. The Earthlings' favourable bargaining position makes it possible for them to achieve agreement on a trading scheme whose rules are then coercively imposed on those interacting under it. By so selecting Trade in Venus* 1 and Free-Trade in Venus* 2, the Earthlings <italic>do</italic> something that is relevant to the poverty-related deaths of many people (as, of course, do the Venusians). In addition, they continue to do things that are relevant to these deaths: they cooperate in upholding and enforcing the terms of the scheme. That is, they are related to the resulting deaths by relevant action. This means that there is an answer to the question regarding how the Earthlings were relevant to the remaining Venusian poverty. They were relevant to it <italic>by cooperating in the selection of a particular trading scheme and through the ongoing enforcement of its rules</italic>.</p>
<p>There are, however, quite significant differences between these two cases. It is only in Venus* 1, in which the Earthlings select Trade, that they can plausibly be said to enable harm on Venus. By erecting tariffs, for example, the Earthlings create obstacles to trade, and some of the poverty that remains on Venus can be traced to these obstacles. In Venus* 2, by contrast, when the Earthlings select Free-Trade the only way they can be said to be relevant to the remaining Venusian poverty is by failing to select a feasible alternative that would reduce it further, namely, Good-Trade. In so far as the Earthlings contribute each year to the poverty-related deaths of millions of Venusians in Venus* 2 by selecting Free-Trade, they are so related by the simple fact that they could instead have selected Good-Trade. There is no creation or removal of obstacles at the expense of the Venusians in Free-Trade, while Good-Trade may involve such creation or removal of obstacles and other measures that benefit the Venusians at the expense of the Earthlings. By treating Venus* 2 as involving a contribution to poverty, FAT does indeed seem to be employing a notion of contribution to harm that is unduly broad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1470594X10387273">
27
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It might be argued that the source of any reluctance to claim that the implementation of Free-Trade instead of Good-Trade in Venus* 2 constitutes a contribution to harm is that most people falsely conceive of the free market as somehow natural or neutral – just like the physical slope in the cart cases. That is, imposing a tariff or providing a subsidy <italic>just is not like</italic> removing or interposing a rock on a physical slope.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1470594X10387273">
28
</xref></sup> Perhaps, but we are not sure what to make of this. We note that people <italic>do</italic> tend to treat subsidies and tariffs, as a matter of fact, quite differently than many other relevant actions involving market interventions that governments can undertake. Indeed, such measures are usually referred to as tariff <italic>barriers</italic>, and such trade policies generally are claimed to be <italic>obstacles</italic> to development, whereas other policies are not described in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470594X10387273">Watkins and Fowler, 2002</xref>). When a government makes increased investment in education or in infrastructure, these measures can advance significantly the productive capacities of their exporters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1470594X10387273">
29
</xref></sup> Although they are market interventions, people often view them differently, morally, than interventions such as subsidies and tariffs (and indeed they are treated quite differently by international trade law) (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470594X10387273">Kurjanska and Risse, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it is because they assess subsidies and tariffs differently (namely, as instances of the interposition of obstacles), we think, that Pogge and others often invoke trade policies, and the institutional rules that permit their adoption, when providing examples of how the affluent countries contribute to poverty in developing countries in their ordinary activities (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X10387273">Pogge, 2008</xref>: 19–22, Ch. 9; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470594X10387273">Watkins and Fowler, 2002</xref>: Ch. 8 especially).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470594X10387273">
<title>Imposing institutions?</title>
<p>It might also be suggested that FAT would not in fact entail that the Earthlings are contributors to the harms suffered by the Venusians in <italic>either</italic> Venus* 1 or Venus* 2. They do not, strictly speaking, seem to <italic>impose</italic> institutions on them at all, since the Venusians <italic>voluntarily</italic> accede to the trading scheme. But if one adopts this position, it would limit significantly the reach of FAT in the real world in ways that Pogge does not seem to accept. After all, countries voluntarily accede to the WTO treaty and voluntarily adopt and comply with many other rules that, Pogge alleges, contribute to their poverty.</p>
<p>It is, of course, true that the governments of some poor countries are not fully or even partially responsive to the interests of the people they rule, nor accountable to them. In such cases, such treaties are indeed coercively imposed upon poor <italic>people</italic>, even if the <italic>governments</italic> of these countries adopt them voluntarily. But not all poor countries can be viewed as dominated by governments that so thoroughly neglect the interests of their poor. Even with respect to countries that are ruled by governments that neglect the interests of the poor, it might well be that the poor people themselves would nevertheless voluntarily adopt and comply with these rules if given the choice.</p>
<p>This would seem to be very likely in the two Venus* cases, since poor Venusians would do far better under Trade and Free-Trade than they would under No-Trade. In any case, when Pogge speaks of coercively imposed institutions, he does not appear to have in mind only those instances in which arrangements are instituted at gunpoint or imposed by venal elites on the unwilling masses. If he did, his claims would be much less controversial. FAT extends to cases in which two parties select an institutional arrangement that then is agreed to by both parties to be coercively imposed, as imagined in our Venus* examples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1470594X10387273">

<title>Moral reasons based on enabling harm</title>
<p>The Venus* examples have the upshot that by leaving Venusians to their own devices we would do them no harm, even though 3 million of them would die from poverty-related causes each year, whereas we <italic>would</italic> harm them by implementing Trade, even though this would reduce the death toll by 1 million per year relative to No-Trade. According to FAT, we would not be permitted to adopt Free-Trade instead of No-Trade. This is because FAT entails that Free-Trade contributes to harm so long as Good-Trade is available. This seems puzzling, and raises important questions about the relative moral importance of moral reasons not to enable harm and moral reasons not to fail to prevent harm from occurring. It seems that any morally sane person, or any reasonably moral position, would prefer a world in which Free-Trade were adopted to one in which No-Trade obtained.</p>
<p>One could infer from the preceding observation that contribution-based moral reasons should take priority only when everything else is equal, and that the number of deaths involved in this case would give us reason to harm some poor people. But this would mean that contribution-based moral reasons were much less stringent than is commonly supposed. The common assumption (one that clearly motivates Pogge’s appeal to such reasons) is that contribution-based moral reasons are a great deal more stringent than assistance-based reasons. We think, however, that what makes it permissible to adopt Trade in such a case has to do with the fact that Earthlings are contributing to the poverty-related deaths by (at most) enabling them to occur, and that moral reasons relating to enabling harm have quite different characteristics than reasons relating to doing harm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1470594X10387273">
31
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In particular, moral reasons associated with contributing to harm through enabling it seem to be less <italic>constraining</italic> than reasons associated with doing harm. While it seems clearly impermissible in Push to push the cart down the hill towards Victim to save two other unrelated people under threat from a second cart, it might be permissible to save two others in Remove by removing the rock so that it no longer protects Victim, but instead protects two other innocent people who were under threat from a second cart. This is illustrated by the following two cases.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove (Two More Victims)</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent knows that if he kicks the rock away Victim will be injured, but Agent needs the rock to save two other people from a second approaching cart and his only way to save these two is to kick the rock away and block the second cart with it. He kicks the rock away; the first cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1470594X10387273">
32
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>Push (Two More Victims)</italic>. A cart stands at the top of a hill. Agent knows that if he pushes the cart downhill Victim will be injured, but Agent needs the space to save two other people from a second approaching cart and his only way to save these two is to push the first cart away and hide the two from the second cart. Agent pushes the first cart. The cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting at the bottom of the hill.</p>
</disp-quote>It seems intuitively correct to say that Agent can proceed in Remove (Two More Victims), but that he may not proceed in Push (Two More Victims). The same seems true for comparable cases involving the interposition rather than removal of obstacles (for example, the Interpose analogue to such a case). This explains why, intuitively, it seems permissible to select Trade in Venus* rather than to stick with No-Trade. The reason is that it is permissible to <italic>enable</italic> a certain number of deaths if one, by so acting, prevents the deaths of a larger number of other people. So even though we <italic>would</italic> contribute to harm by implementing Trade rather than Fair-Trade, it would be permissible to do so because reasons based on enabling harm are less other-constraining than reasons based on doing harm.</p>
<p>Moral reasons associated with enabling harm may arguably also seem to be less constraining with regard to cost to the agent than those associated with doing harm. Consider, for example, the following cases.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove (Costly Avoidance)</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent knows that if he kicks the rock away Victim will be injured. However, Agent is under threat from a second approaching cart and his only way to avoid a serious impact is to move the rock from his only possible escape route. He kicks the rock away; the cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1470594X10387273">
33
</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>Push (Costly Avoidance)</italic>. A cart stands at the top of a hill. Agent knows that if he pushes the cart downhill Victim will be injured. However, Agent is under threat from a second approaching cart and his only way to avoid a serious impact is to push the first cart away from his only possible escape route. Agent pushes it. The cart rolls down the hill and injures Victim, who is sitting at the bottom of the hill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1470594X10387273">
34
</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The conduct of Agent in Remove (Costly Avoidance) seems easier to justify than a structurally similar case in which he pushes a cart downhill at Victim in order to avoid a threat to himself, such as Push (Costly Avoidance).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1470594X10387273">
35
</xref></sup> Intuitively, at least, a person needs to constrain himself less from enabling harm when he has to act to avoid harm to himself; he is not required to take on as much cost in order to avoid enabling a particular harm as he would be required to take on in order to avoid doing the same type of harm.</p>
<p>One could, perhaps, suggest that since reasons based on allowing harm to occur are less constraining than are reasons based on doing harm, that contribution to harm through enabling is morally equivalent to allowing harm. Matthew Hanser holds this view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1470594X10387273">
36
</xref></sup> He claims that agents who are relevant to some harm in this manner are morally on a par with agents who merely fail to prevent the harm, all else being equal. If this were correct, it would undermine quite significantly Pogge’s argument that affluent people have particularly stringent moral reasons to address global poverty because they contribute to it through FAT, since such a contribution typically involves enabling harm rather than doing harm.</p>
<p>However, while we think Pogge is too quick to assume that all instances of contributing to harm generate moral reason for actions that are similar to those generated by doing harm, we think Hanser is wrong to conclude that enabling harm is morally on a par with merely allowing it to happen. We think that moral reasons based on a contribution to harm through enabling it have distinct normative characteristics from those based on allowing harm. Let us make some preliminary indications of these differences. Consider that even though it seems permissible for Agent to act in Remove (Costly Avoidance) in contrast to the similar Push case, it also seems that a higher level of cost would be required for it to be permissible for Agent to enable harm by removing the rock than for a bystander to refrain from acting to avoid a similar harm. Intuitively, moral reasons based on contributing to harm by enabling it are more self-constraining than moral reasons based on allowing harm to occur.</p>
<p>We indicated that when people are asked to classify an agent’s relevance to some harm in terms of a binary distinction between doing and allowing harm they typically say that Agent in Remove (Knowledge) does harm to Victim, but sometimes deny this in Remove (Non-culpable Ignorance), where Agent is unaware of the approaching cart and cannot plausibly be expected to be aware of it. We think the reason for this is that their judgements are being guided by the moral reasons that they ascribe to these agents. We suggested that the agent is enabling harm in both cases, since each involves a relevant action of removing an obstacle. However, it seems correct to say that the normative characteristics of enabling harm are particularly sensitive to the agent’s knowledge and the cost to him of refraining from so acting. To illustrate this, consider the following.<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Remove (Culpable Demand)</italic>. A cart is rolling towards a point where there is a rock that would bring it to a halt. Agent knows that if he kicks the rock away Victim will be injured, refraining from kicking the rock away is not costly to him, and the potential injury to Victim is quite severe. Nevertheless, he kicks the rock away; the cart is now rolling down the hill and will injure Victim, who is sitting there. Agent can stop the cart at some cost to himself.</p>
<p>
<italic>Push (Culpable Demand)</italic>. A cart stands at the top of a hill. Agent is aware of Victim and knows that she will be injured if he pushes the cart, and refraining from pushing it is not costly to him. Agent pushes the cart. The cart is now rolling downhill and will injure Victim, who is sitting there. Agent can stop the cart at some cost to himself.</p>
</disp-quote>We think that in both of these cases Agent has very stringent moral reasons to stop the cart. Indeed, it is hard to see that there is any significant difference between what, morally, each Agent is required to do, or indeed what the prospective Victims could do to prevent such Agents from contributing to their injuries should they be able to do so. This indicates that when enablers of harm are aware that their conduct will result in harm, and when refraining from so enabling it will not involve significant cost to themselves, their duties to refrain from enabling harm and to compensate for those harms that they enable seem very nearly as stringent and demanding as if they had done these harms. This then, is why cases involving culpable enabling of harm tend to be subsumed into the category of doing harm, while cases of non-culpable enabling of harm are, instead, sometimes treated as instances of allowing harm. In sum, judgements about whether Agent does harm or allows harm to occur in cases such as Remove and Interpose seem to be responding to what Jeff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X10387273">McMahan (1998</xref>: 408) has usefully dubbed the ‘gravitational tug of morality’.</p>
<sec id="section11-1470594X10387273">
<title>Are the affluent culpable enablers?</title>
<p>Our findings in the previous section are clearly relevant for the overall evaluation of Pogge’s claim about the moral reasons of the affluent to address global poverty. If the affluent people that are enabling poverty in developing countries are aware of or at the very least ought to be aware of what they are doing, and if the costs to them of refraining from enabling poverty are small, then his claim that their reasons to address this poverty are very stringent seems quite plausible. If on the other hand the affluent are not aware and cannot plausibly be expected to be aware that they are enabling harm, and if the cost to them of refraining from enabling harm is extremely high, then his claim seems less plausible.</p>
<sec id="section12-1470594X10387273">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>We cannot go into a comprehensive evaluation of whether it is plausible to hold the affluent to be really knowledgeable about their alleged contribution to global poverty by enabling it. It may sometimes be the case that political leaders know of or perhaps even intend the hardships their behaviour engenders for the global poor. But it is not clear that this is usually or even often the case.</p>
<p>For one thing, there is a great deal of honest disagreement among experts regarding the kinds of policies that contribute to or alleviate poverty in the developing world. Some economists claim that tariffs on imports from developing countries and subsidies paid to domestic producers in affluent countries have a very significant negative effect on poverty, while others deny this. Some claim that increasing assistance to developing countries will promote poverty relief and development, while others claim, instead, that such measures will do very little good and may even do significant harm. This is not to say that people should remain agnostic about these issues or that it is impossible to come to a justified position on them. Rather, it suggests that even responsible citizens and politicians that take the time to try to understand these issues cannot be expected to arrive at correct conclusions about them. Certainly, many affluent people may be negligent enablers of poverty, and even such a slight level of moral culpability on their part may increase the stringency and demandingness of their contribution-based duties to address it to a significant extent. In addition, some others may be reckless enablers of harm, which will increase such duties further still.</p>

<title>Cost</title>
<p>For the sake of argument, suppose we implemented some of the seemingly modest reforms to global institutional arrangements suggested by Pogge, and that by doing so we would only reduce the number of poverty-related deaths from 18 to 14 million per year. Call this the ‘low-cost reform package’. Suppose, further, that there is a set of additional institutional reforms within reach that would suffice to eradicate global poverty. Implementing these reforms would be <italic>very</italic> costly. The result of these reforms would nevertheless not be such that the affluent suffered comparable human rights deficits or other ills of comparable magnitude. However, they would have to reduce their incomes by 80 percent. Call this the ‘high-cost reform package’. Would the affluent be morally required to institute the high-cost reform package, and would their failure to do so make them <italic>contributors</italic> to poverty to the extent that they instituted some other package that was suboptimal with respect to poverty alleviation? This seems to be what Pogge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470594X10387273">2008</xref>: 26) suggests, at least provided that the affluent are actively cooperating in designing and imposing these institutions, that it was foreseeable that such institutions would have such results, and that it was knowable that the high-cost reform package would suffice to avoid them.</p>
<p>Clearly, Pogge does not believe that sacrifices of anything like those involved in instituting a high-cost reform package would be necessary to reduce dramatically global poverty. In fact, he claims repeatedly how relatively inexpensive it would be to alleviate severe poverty in our world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1470594X10387273">
37
</xref></sup> Of course, others deny that it is so easy and inexpensive or that merely forgoing minor gains and stepping up foreign assistance will suffice for the affluent to reduce dramatically poverty in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1470594X10387273">
38
</xref></sup> If the cost of preventing poverty in developing countries is indeed very high, then failures to reform and make institutional arrangements in such a way as to minimize this poverty will be more like Remove (Costly Avoidance). In such a case, it is not clear that the affluent would be morally required to implement the high-cost reform package. Indeed, they may not be required to do so even if one agrees with Pogge that by failing to implement the high-cost reform package the affluent would be contributing to global poverty. As observed earlier, reasons based on enabling harm are less constraining than are reasons based on doing harm, especially when the cost of avoiding the conduct that enables the harm is quite high. As in Remove (Costly Avoidance), affluent agents may not be required not to contribute to harm by enabling it if the cost to them of refraining from enabling it is very high. We cannot here adjudicate on the empirical dispute about the cost of relieving poverty. We emphasize only that because the contribution of the affluent to poverty through FAT is at most of an enabling kind, the stringency of their moral reasons based on this fact depends to a very large extent on considerations of cost.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In this article, we have shown that the concept of ‘contribution to harm’ is very broad, bundling together two very different kinds of relations between agents and outcomes. Namely, agents can contribute to poverty through (1) things they <italic>do</italic> and (2) through things that they <italic>enable to occur</italic>. Against many of Pogge’s critics, we have argued that the affluent do often contribute to poverty via FAT. More precisely, we have shown that provided that the empirical facts are as Pogge claims them to be, the affluent often contribute to poverty by enabling it to occur, and that enabling harm to occur can rightly be viewed as contributing to harm. However, we have also shown that enabling harm and doing harm are quite distinct analytic and moral categories, and therefore should be treated differently. In particular, we have shown that the way the affluent contribute ordinarily to poverty via FAT is by enabling these harms to occur, and not by doing harm. Further, we have shown that there are some instances in which FAT would treat an agent as contributing to harm when that agent seems neither to do harm nor to enable it to occur.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, we have indicated why one should not assume, as Pogge and many others appear to, that these different ways of contributing to harm have the same normative implications. The distinct ways of contributing to harm (through doing or enabling it) seem intuitively to give rise to moral reasons that differ significantly in their normative characteristics. Enablers of harm will often have moral reasons to address these harms that are less stringent than those that apply to doers of harm. Showing that an agent would contribute to poverty by enabling it through her conduct, then, falls short of demonstrating that she has stringent reasons not to do so, or stringent reasons to address the resulting poverty if she has already made such contributions. Whether she has such reasons will depend on further facts about her conduct that relate to her culpability, in particular to her knowledge of the consequences of her conduct and the cost to her of refraining from acting as she does.</p>

<p>Pogge contrasts this notion of harm with the notion of harm employed in ordinary contexts, according to which those harmed are either made worse off than they were at some earlier time or worse off than they would have been had some earlier arrangements continued undisturbed. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470594X10387273">Pogge (2007)</xref>. By ‘feasible institutional modifications' Pogge means reforms that could be brought about and maintained if enough agents had the political will to do so – the mere fact that powerful agents simply refuse to entertain such reforms (thus making them <italic>politically</italic> infeasible) does not make them infeasible in his sense.</p>

<p>Perhaps we have some tendency to view subsidy as a stronger form of intervention than merely removing an obstacle? If so, it might be because we think of it as a form of sustaining a harmful causal sequence. By subsidizing our products, we push them along, so to speak.</p>

<p>How Foot’s analysis would handle Interpose is perhaps not so clear. Does Agent initiate or sustain a harmful causal sequence in Interpose or does she merely allow a harmful causal sequence to run its course? Arguably, she does neither, but rather prevents a <italic>good</italic> causal sequence from running its course by preventing the approaching cart from reaching Victim. There is, of course, a bad process under way as well, namely, that Victim is becoming increasingly thirsty. By interposing an obstacle to the cart, Agent could be said to allow that process to run its course. Hence, Foot could hold that Agent in Interpose allows Victim to die of thirst.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that we are assuming that in this case there is no relevant prior interaction between Agent and Victim.

An explanation of the relevance of the erstwhile baby-sitter’s conduct to the death of the child will refer to something he did: his having promised to look after the child. In a case like this, Agent’s overall relevance will therefore be viewed by some people as that of a contributor, even though he merely stands by during the specific period in which the child drowns.</p>
