<abstract>
<p>The present study examined the construct, concurrent and divergent validity, and reliability of the “Taxonomy of Problematic Social Situations-Adolescent self-report version” (TOPS-A) in a sample of 128 adolescents placed in Dutch secure juvenile facilities. The instrument measures inappropriate responses of adolescents to problematic social situations at the living group. Confirmatory factor analysis of a four-factor model (inappropriate responses to situations of disadvantage, competition, accepting/giving help, and accepting authority) with a second-order factor (inappropriate responses to problematic social situations) showed an exact fit to the data, indicating construct validity of the TOPS-A. Evidence for concurrent validity was found in associations with aggression and living group climate. Divergent validity could not be reliably assessed. Cronbach’s α reliability coefficients were satisfactory. The TOPS-A is a parsimonious instrument that can be used to assess and target inappropriate responses to problematic social situations in (delinquent) adolescents in secure institutional and correctional youth care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research in both developmental psychopathology and developmental criminology has established relations between disturbed and impoverished child-rearing environments, deviant social development, and pathological aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512468322">Loeber &amp; Farrington, 1998</xref>; Wenar &amp; Kerig, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512468322">Wikstrom &amp; Butterworth, 2006</xref>). Pathological or nonadaptive aggression in adolescents detained in secure (correctional) facilities, such as youth prisons, is considered a serious problem, not only for adolescents themselves, but also for staff as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468322">Harvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Van Genabeek, Stams, &amp; van der Laan, 2011</xref>). Empirical research on this topic is still scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512468322">Marshall &amp; Burton 2010</xref>), especially with regard to differences between boys and girls, which is an under-researched topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512468322">Slotboom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512468322">Zahn, Day, Mihalic, &amp; Tichavsky, 2009</xref>). High levels of aggression among adolescents could have a negative influence on living group climate, the adequacy of staff responses, quality of therapeutic relationships, and eventually treatment outcomes in secure institutional youth care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468322">Harvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468322">van der Helm, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies support an “import” model, which focuses on adolescents’ characteristics that are considered antecedents of aggression, such as (especially disruptive) mental disorders or mild intellectual disability (Ankarsater, et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512468322">Nijhof et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512468322">Van Nieuwenhuijzen et. al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512468322">Vreugdenhil, Doreleijers, Vermeiren, Wouters, &amp; Van den Brink, 2004</xref>) and problematic social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512468322">DeLisi et al., 2009</xref>; Young, Justice, &amp; Erdberg, 2004). However, there is also research that supports a “situational” model, where a positive living group climate can facilitate rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468322">van der Helm, 2011</xref>), but more often alluded to as a deprivational model, in which repression, loss of autonomy, humiliation, fear, and stress cause aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468322">Dye, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512468322">Gover, MacKenzie, &amp; Armstrong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512468322">Parisi, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512468322">Sykes, 1958</xref>; White, Shi, Mun, Hirschfeld, &amp; Loeber, 2010). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512468322">van der Helm (2011)</xref> showed that a repressive living group climate increases aggression, which supports a deprivational model, whereas an open and supportive living group climate decreases anger, fear, and aggression.</p>
<p>Apparently, a situational model is only synonymous with deprivation if the living group climate is repressive and nonsupportive.</p>
<p>Research has shown that particular social situations can elicit aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468322">Goldfried &amp; D’Zurilla, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512468322">Matthys, Cuperus, &amp; Van Engeland, 1999</xref>). Examples are situations of social disadvantage, competition, problems with authority, and dependency on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468322">Goldfried &amp; D’Zurilla, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468322">Harvey, 2005</xref>). It is plausible to suggest that living group climate is associated with these problematic situations. For instance, a repressive living group climate is characterized by social disadvantage through an asymmetric balance of power, lack of mutual respect, humiliation and contempt of others (both staff and peers), extreme competition, an emphasis on punitive authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512468322">Harvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512468322">Liebling &amp; Maruna, 2005</xref>), and extreme dependency of youths on group workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Klapwijk, Stams, &amp; van der Laan, 2009</xref>). An open living group climate, however, is characterized by a rehabilitative atmosphere that fosters growths, and by supportive staff–youth relationships, advanced social functioning, and respect, resulting in less competition and more acceptance of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Van Genabeek et al., 2011</xref>). In an open climate group workers’ authority is accepted and respected and dependency of youths on group workers is minimal. Adolescents are held responsible for their own conduct, resulting in an internal locus of control and an inclination to accept help from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512468322">van der Helm et al., 2009</xref>) or to help others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512468322">van der Helm, van der Stel, Stams, &amp; van der Laan, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, a valid and reliable instrument that assesses responses of adolescents to problematic social situations at the living group is not available. There is a need for such an instrument for research purposes and clinical use, because inappropriate responses of adolescents to problematic social situations at the living group can be used as a diagnostic means to target problem behavior in particular social situations within individualized treatment and group treatment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468322">Dodge, McClaskey, and Feldman (1985)</xref> developed the Taxonomy of Problematic Social Situations for elementary school children (TOPS) to identify situation-specific social skill deficits. This teacher-report measure assesses responses of children to six problematic social factors: peer group entry, peer group provocation, failure or success, social expectations, and teacher expectations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512468322">Nangle and Ellis (1994)</xref> examined the validity of the TOPS and found it to be stable and convergent with other peer measures. In a replication study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512468322">Matthys, Cuperus, Maassen and Van Engeland (2001)</xref> identified four instead of six types of social situations that are crucial for problem behavior in elementary school children: the perception of being disadvantaged, difficulties in coping with competition, social expectations of peers, and teacher expectations. Thus, TOPS was abbreviated to TOPS-Short Form (18 instead of 44 items).</p>
<p>As the original TOPS-measure is an observation instrument for elementary school children in a normal population, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468322">Freedman, Rosenthal, Donahoe, Schlundt, and McFall (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468322">Gaffney and McFall (1981)</xref> were among the first to demonstrate the necessity of an instrument to assess situation-specific social skill deficits in delinquent adolescent boys and girls. It is in particular the work of Freedman et al., and Gaffney and McFall that laid the ground for developing a measure of situation-specific social skill deficits in adolescents with serious externalizing behavior problems, including aggression and delinquency. As the original TOPS-measure was an observation instrument for younger children (age 4-9) in a normal population, the development of a self-report questionnaire for use with adolescents (14-18 years) in a forensic setting seems to be justified, in particular because social behavior and the nature and impact of social problem situations change during development, especially in deviant youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468322">De Wit, Slot, &amp; van Aken, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0886260512468322">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The present study describes the development of the TOPS-A, which is a self-report questionnaire modeled after the TOPS to assess inappropriate responses to problematic social situations in secure institutional youth care. It should be noted that self-report of behavior in problematic social situations has an advantage over other report, because in particular staff ratings may be too global, as they are collapsed across many social situations and unduly based on interactions with staff instead of interactions among peers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468322">Foster, Inderbitzen, &amp; Nangle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512468322">Nangle &amp; Ellis, 1994</xref>). The TOPS-A purports to measure inappropriate responses of adolescents in four types of problematic social situations: situations of disadvantage, competition, accepting/giving help, and accepting authority.</p>
<p>We examine construct validity, criterion validity (associations with aggression and living group climate), and divergent validity (sensitivity for socially desirable responding) of the TOPS-A. The construct validity is tested in a confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, criterion (concurrent) validity is assessed by examining the associations between inappropriate responses of adolescents to problematic social situations at the living group and with self-reported aggression and perceived living group climate. One would have support for concurrent validity if inappropriate responses to problematic social situations at the living group were associated with more aggressive behavior, a nonrehabilitative atmosphere at the living group, and more repression and less growth and support. Evidence for divergent validity may be found in lack of associations between the TOPS-dimensions and social desirability.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0886260512468322">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The present study was conducted with 128 boys and girls, living in four secure institutional facilities (82% in secure institutional youth care, and 18% in youth correctional centers). The population consisted of male (62%) and female (38%) adolescents. A total of 40% of the adolescents had a non-Western cultural background (<italic>N</italic> = 26 from non-Western countries, most Moroccan youths). Youths living in secure institutional youth care were referred by a judge because of serious conduct problems (e.g., Conduct Disorder [CD]), diagnosed by a psychiatrist, often combined with drugs problems in boys and prostitution in girls. The participants residing in youth correctional centers were sentenced for severe and violent crimes for 1 to 4 years.</p>
<p>The mean age of respondents was 15.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.4, range 12-19 years). The mean stay at the time of filling out the questionnaire was 28 weeks (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.2 range 1-74 weeks). All adolescents present in the four institutions were invited to participate in the present study and participated voluntarily (response rate of 95%), signed an informed consent declaration and were told that their answers would be treated confidentially and anonymously and would be accessed only by the researchers. They filled out the questionnaire in the presence of a research assistant providing help if necessary, which took about 20 min. As a token of gratitude for their participation, they received a telephone card or a small gift of €5.50. All names on the questionnaires were deleted and given a code number in SPSS. In order to protect the privacy of the adolescents, researchers had no access to the names. Questionnaires were administered by specially trained graduate students of the Professional University of Leiden, School of Social Studies (Bachelor of Social Work and Master in Youth Care), and the University of Amsterdam (Department of Forensic Child and Youth Care Sciences). The study was approved by an Industrial Board Review procedure of Leiden University of Applied Sciences.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-0886260512468322">
<title>The Burke–Durkee Hostility Inventory</title>
<p>The BDHI was originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468322">Burke and Durkee (1957)</xref> and was revised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468322">Buss and Perry (1992)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468322">Lange, Hoogendoorn, and Wiederspahn (1995)</xref>, who translated the instrument into Dutch, found two independent factors: overt (direct) and covert (indirect) aggression, rated by boys themselves on a “true”–“not true” dichotomous scale. Direct aggression represents the combination of physical and verbal aggression. Anger and hostility are the core concepts of indirect aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512468322">Lange et al., (1995)</xref> reported good reliability and construct validity. Others have reported good predictive validity and temporal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468322">Biaggio, Supplee, &amp; Curtis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468322">Brunner, 1991</xref>). An example of a “direct aggression-item” is: “If I am angry, I slam doors;” an indirect aggression-term is: “Although you might not see it, I am often jealous.” In the present study reliability was found to be good both for the direct (Cronbach’s α = .77) and indirect aggression scale (Cronbach’s α = .73).</p>
<p>The tendency to give socially desirable answers was assessed with the social desirability subscale of the The Burke–Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI, 5 items). Internal consistency reliability of the social desirability scale was .37. Deletion of three items with low corrected-item total correlations enhanced Cronbach’s <italic>α</italic> to .61, which is considered marginally reliable. The remaining items were “I never disliked anybody” and “I would never call anybody names, even when I am angry,” showing a correlation of .464 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Prison Group Climate (PGCI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Stams, &amp; van der Laan, 2011</xref>)</title>
<p>The PGCI consists of 36 items rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 = <italic>I do not agree</italic> to 5 = <italic>I totally agree</italic>. Each item belongs to only one of the four scales for group climate. The support scale (12 items) assesses perceived professional behavior and in particular the responsivity of group workers to specific needs of the inmates. Paying attention to inmates, taking complaints seriously, respect and trust are important characteristics of support. An example of a support item is: “Group workers treat me with respect.” The growth scale (8 items) assesses learning perceptions, hope for the future and giving meaning to the prison stay. An example of a growth item is: “I learn the right things here.” The repression scale (9 items) assesses perceptions of strictness and control, unfair and haphazard rules, and lack of flexibility at the living group. An example of a repression item is: “You have to ask permission for everything here.” The group atmosphere scale (7 items) assesses the way inmates treat and trust each other, feelings of safety toward each other, being able to get some peace of mind, and having enough daylight and fresh air. An example of a relationship item is “We trust each other here.” Cronbach’s α for all scales exceeded .75.</p>

<sec id="section8-0886260512468322">
<title>Taxonomy of Problematic Social Situations-Adolescent Version (TOPS-A)</title>
<p>The TOPS-A (adolescent self-report version) purports to measure problematic social situations at the living group. Four scales were derived from were derived from TOPS Short Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512468322">Matthys et al., 2001</xref>)) and were adapted to the living group context and age of the respondents, while largely preserving the meaning of the TOPS-items. The names of two scales were changed. “Teacher expectations” was changed to “Accepting authority from group workers,” as group workers constitute the main authority in a closed setting. “Social expectations of peers” was changed into “Accepting/giving help from/to peers,” because the latter statement seemed a better description of the original construct in Matthys’ study in 2001 (all original items were concerned with accepting or giving help). All items were reformulated for use in a self-report measure of inappropriate responses to problematic social situations in secure institutional facilities, with four scales and 18 items: inappropriate responses to situations of disadvantage, competition, accepting/giving help, and accepting authority.</p>
<p>In developing new questionnaires, exact wording of items is crucial. Therefore, eight experienced group workers who worked for more than five years in secure institutional youth care and correctional institutions were asked to comment on the wording and content of all items. They were also asked, if deemed necessary, to provide extra items describing the four social TOPS situations for use in therapy. This resulted in a 22-item list, which was then pilot tested with 10 incarcerated adolescents with a mild intellectual disability, and at least a reading level of third-grade elementary school, because a sizable subpopulation (estimates range between 40% and 75%) of detained youths in the Netherlands is expected to have mild intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512468322">Kaal, Brand, &amp; Van Nieuwenhuijzen, 2012</xref>). We wanted to be sure that this subgroup could understand the questions. The adolescents were asked if they could understand the questions and comprehend the 5-point Likert-type answering scales. In addition, they were asked whether they thought the questionnaire reflected real social problem situations at the living group. Some adaptations to the questionnaire were made on the basis of the responses to these questions, in particular simplifying the items to reduce the level of cognitive complexity.</p>
<p>The final version of the TOPS-A contains four scales assessing inappropriate responses of adolescents to problematic social situations at the living group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512468322">Table 1</xref>): responses to “disadvantage” (8 items), “competition” (5 items), “accepting/giving help” (3 items), and “accepting authority” (6 items).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the validity and reliability of the TOPS-A in a group of adolescents with severe behavioral problems and delinquents placed in Dutch secure (correctional) facilities with a therapeutic living group structure. Evidence for construct validity and good internal consistency was found in a confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analyses. Divergent validity could not be reliably assessed. Evidence for concurrent validity was found in associations with aggression, assessed with the BDHI, and living group climate, assessed with the PGCI, showing that the TOPS-A can be used to validly and reliably assess inappropriate responses of adolescents to problematic social situations within secure juvenile treatment facilities. It is possible that result generalize across different cultures, since the participants of this study came from ethnically diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>The TOPS-A could be important not only for measuring the effectiveness of institutional treatment in reducing problematic social behavior in detained adolescents, but also for signaling problematic social behavior as a precursor of aggression at the living group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468322">Fluttert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Van Genabeek et al., 2011</xref>). In secure institutional treatment for youths, frequent aggressive behavior and violence incidents may have a negative impact on social interactions and social learning, and could negatively affect treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468322">Fontaine &amp; Dodge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512468322">Osgood &amp; O’ Neil Bridell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Boekee, Stams, &amp; van der Laan, 2011</xref>). However, positive social behavior at the living group can promote successful treatment of externalizing behavior and personality problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512468322">van der Helm, Van Genabeek et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some limitations of this study that need to be acknowledged. As the present study only provides preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of the TOPS-A, results should be replicated in a study with a larger sample size that enables a robust test of measurement invariance in a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, focusing on possible differences between boys and girls, different age groups, and between youth prisons and secure treatment facilities. The assessment of divergent validity was hampered by a social reliability scale that proved only marginally reliable, which is a problem encountered in many studies assessing social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512468322">Uziel, 2010</xref>). We should therefore be cautious in drawing a definite conclusion about divergent validity. Moreover, one could argue that it is unlikely to assume that there is no association between social desirability and inappropriate responses to problematic social situations, given that both are tapping into some level of social awareness. That is, social desirability requires an understanding of what response one may want, as does having an appropriate response to social situations. Therefore, it is plausible to expect an inverse relation between social desirability and the TOPS-dimensions. A future validity study of the TOPS-A should further examine convergent, divergent and criterion validity of the TOPS-A, including concurrent and predictive validity. Further evidence of concurrent en predictive validity can be obtained by predicting antisocial behavior (e.g., incidents) during detention and recidivism, respectively, from differences in inappropriate responses to problematic social situations.</p>
<p>Despite several limitations of this study, the TOPS-A has the potential to be an important instrument for studies examining treatment results and research on treatment effectiveness of (judicial) interventions targeting rehabilitation of delinquent youth and youths with severe behavioral problems in secure forensic institutions. Moreover, the TOPS-A can be used to target specific problem situations and inappropriate reactions, often encountered outside residential institutions as well in this particular group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468322">De Jong, 2007</xref>). Recommendations for further research are to test this questionnaire in the general population too, as well as to determine cultural sensitivity and associations with observed aggressive behavior. The identification of the particular social context in which an adolescent with behavioral problems displays his or her inappropriate behavior may help refine treatment goals. This opens the possibility of individualized treatment aimed at the risks and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468322">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2007</xref>) of adolescents with severe behavioral problems. This individualized treatment could be incorporated in cognitive behavioral training schemes with an emphasis on practicing adequate responses to difficult social situations. In the Netherlands, the TOPS-A is already used to assess problem levels and social skills training outcomes of criminal adolescents with Mild Intellectual Disability (MIDB). Also, through better understanding of the cognitive and behavioral disabilities of adolescents in their care, the TOPS-A could help group workers and therapists display effective professional behavior and eventually create a better living group climate.</p>
