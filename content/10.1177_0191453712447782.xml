<abstract>
<p>The <italic>abolition of the state</italic> is a central element in Marx’s vision of human emancipation. However, at a later stage of his intellectual development Marx seems to have retreated from this idea. Marx’s theory should be defined as the primacy of labor: labor, or instrumental productive activity, brings about, as its unintended, as-if-natural results, different social relations, including the state. At the core of communism, as first envisaged by Marx, is the <italic>abolition of labor</italic> <italic>and its unintended social results</italic>. However, Marx did not hold to the idea of abolition of labor in his later writings. If labor cannot be abolished, the social relations that have developed as its unintended results, notably the state, cannot be abolished either. Any revival of the conception of abolition of the state should be connected to a revival of the conception of abolition of labor, as a regulative idea, based on modern, computer technology.</p>

<title>Preface</title>
<p>Marx’s idea of abolition of the state has been much discussed by both Marxists and academic scholars studying his teachings. The classical formulation of Robert Tucker ought to be cited here: ‘Freedom and the state, as he [Marx] saw it, were mutually exclusive concepts. Insofar as any state existed, man would remain unfree.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453712447782">1</xref>
</sup> A new study of this idea should attempt to discuss it in light of a less prevailing line of interpretation. That is, the chosen line of interpretation should emphasize aspects of Marx’s theory, especially in relation to the origins of the state and the nature of its abolition, which have not been given due attention. Marx’s social theory should be defined – as will be elaborated upon in due course – as the <italic>primacy of labor</italic>. Not the relations of production (prior to their legal restructuring) and the productive forces, which, considered as one complex, form the ‘economic substructure’, but rather labor, or instrumental productive activity, as the most basic form of human activity, should be seen as the origin, the <italic>causa prima</italic>, of human history.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453712447782">2</xref>
</sup> This study will attempt to explain the state as an unintended, unasked-for social result of labor. The abolition of the state is inherently connected with the transformation of productive activity into a new form, which is not labor any more, that will enable humans to build their society as their <italic>free</italic> creation.</p>
<p>In a later phase of his intellectual life Marx seems to have retreated from the idea of abolition of the state, and this study will address this aspect of his teachings, the importance of which for the prospects of building a free society should not be underestimated. Such a retreat cannot be an isolated event in Marx’s teachings and the analysis will have to connect it with other trends in his teachings. This fateful retreat has practically not been discussed by Marxists and academic scholars.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>At the core of the highest phase of communist society, as it originally appears in Marx’s writings, is the <italic>abolition of labor</italic>, namely the abolition of the labor-form of production. The abolition of exploitation (often defined as the abolition of private property), the abolition of the division of labor and the abolition of the state are all predicated upon the abolition of labor. However, in his later writings Marx did not hold to the idea of abolition of labor, viewing labor as the <italic>eternal</italic> basis of <italic>all</italic> historical social formations. If labor cannot be abolished – the analysis will show – the social relations that have developed as its unintended results cannot be abolished either. The study will try to show that Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of the state is essentially connected with his retreat from the idea of abolition of labor. The study will also address the dilemma – and the possible elements – of reviving the idea of abolition of the state.</p>

<title>Labor and its indirect social results</title>
<p>According to Marx, from the very day that human beings produce humanly, namely consciously, they shape their production as labor, i.e. as instrumental activity, also defined by Marx as alienated activity. Following Aristotle, Marx differentiated between two kinds of human activity. Any activity of the first kind is a means to an end, i.e. an activity that serves as a tool, as an instrument, for achieving a certain purpose outside itself. To denote this activity, Marx used in his late writings the terms ‘purposeful activity’ [<italic>zweckmäßige Tätigkeit</italic>]<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453712447782">4</xref>
</sup> or ‘activity determined by the purpose’ [<italic>zweckbestimmte Tätigkeit</italic>].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453712447782">5</xref>
</sup> Activity of this kind is subject to efficiency criteria; that is, its purpose should be achieved in the shortest way possible and with the least investment of energy and resources possible. Such activity may be abandoned, if the purpose can be achieved without it. Following Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, we refer in modern philosophy to such activity as ‘instrumental activity’. In performing instrumental activity, a man uses his own body, his legs and arms, as well as mental activities – his attention and thoughts that direct the activity – as means, as tools. That is, he reduces himself to an instrument, thus committing an act of self-estrangement. Hence instrumental production is alienated activity. This form of self-alienation is a primary fact of human existence.</p>
<p>Activity of the second kind is that which is desired and performed for its own sake, that is, the activity itself is the doer’s purpose. Such activity is not a means to an end, i.e. it is not perceived as a tool, as an instrument, for achieving another aim outside itself. Being the aim itself of the subject doing it, such activity is not subject to efficiency criteria and may be performed at will. In the early writings Marx refers to such activity as ‘free activity’, ‘self-activity’ [<italic>Selbsttätigkeit</italic>] and self-activation [<italic>Selbstbetätigung</italic>].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453712447782">6</xref>
</sup> Both in the early and the late writings he terms such activity ‘self-purpose’ [<italic>Selbstzweck</italic>].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453712447782">7</xref>
</sup> We may term such activity ‘non-instrumental activity’. Realization of the second kind of activity within the scope of production would, then, be tantamount to the <italic>abolition of labor</italic>.</p>
<p>Early in his intellectual development Marx did not terminologically distinguish between ‘production’ and ‘labor’ [<italic>Arbeit</italic>]. Differentiating between instrumental and non-instrumental production, he referred to instrumental production as ‘alienated labor’ [<italic>entfremdete Arbeit</italic>] or ‘external labor’ [<italic>entäußerte Arbeit</italic>]. However, from the middle of the <italic>Economic-philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</italic>, namely from the manuscript ‘The Relationship of Private Property’, he began to call only instrumental production ‘labor’; production as such ceased to be identified with labor. ‘Alienated labor’ of the very early phase and ‘labor’ of the later phases both denote instrumental production. Marx never deviated from the new terminology. In this context he used sometimes the term ‘industry’ [<italic>Industrie</italic>], not in its ordinary meaning, but in a philosophical-anthropological sense. This term denotes either labor, i.e. instrumental production, as such, or labor in its modern, technologically highly developed stage. The abolition of instrumental production is defined as the ‘abolition of labor’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453712447782">8</xref>
</sup> or, less often, as the ‘liberation from industry’ [<italic>Befreiung von der Industrie</italic>] and the ‘abolition of industry’ [<italic>Abschaffung der Industrie</italic>].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453712447782">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The primacy of instrumental, alienated production finds an expression in the<italic> Economic-philosophic Manuscripts</italic>. Using the terms ‘labor’ and ‘industry’ as synonyms for instrumental (alienated) production, Marx says:<disp-quote>
<p>… all human [productive] activity <italic>hitherto</italic> has been <italic>labor</italic>, that is, <italic>industry</italic>, <italic>activity estranged from itself</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453712447782">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>We reach now a crucial element in Marx’s conception of history: labor, namely instrumental production, has two sorts of results: desired, planned results and not-asked-for, unintended results. The desired ones are the final products, which were the aim of production from the outset. The unasked-for ones are changes, often comprehensive, either in nature or in human society, which are brought about indirectly by labor.</p>
<p>To denote the unintended social results of labor Marx uses often the German term ‘<italic>naturwüchsig</italic>’. With regard to its special Marxian meaning, i.e. as denoting the indirect results of labor in human society, it should be translated as ‘seemingly natural’ or ‘as-if-natural’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453712447782">11</xref>
</sup> Thus, social relations such as exploitation, the social division of labor and the state are ‘as-if-natural’ results of labor. This means that they are seen as natural phenomena of human society and may even be perceived as natural social powers, which govern human life no less than do natural forces. Actually, however, they are human ‘products’, albeit not voluntarily chosen and created, and can, under certain circumstances, be abolished. In this context Marx speaks of ‘as-if-natural society’, and, in relation to the social division of labor, of ‘activity which is not voluntarily, but seemingly naturally [<italic>naturwüchsig</italic>], divided’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453712447782">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Marx discusses in different places the indirect social results of labor, namely the changes that the social relations undergo as a result of labor. Defining the social relations, mainly the relations of production, as ‘material life’, Marx writes in <italic>The</italic> <italic>German Ideology</italic> (which was jointly composed, in 1845–6, by Marx and Engels but whose philosophical-anthropological part was mainly written by Marx) as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>As human beings produce their means of subsistence, they <italic>indirectly</italic> produce their material life itself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453712447782">13</xref>
</sup>
</p> <p>The fact is therefore as follows: Definite individuals who are productively active in a definite way <italic>get into</italic> these <italic>definite social and political relations</italic>. Empirical observation must in each separate case show, without any mystification and speculation, the interconnection [<italic>Zusammenhang</italic>] of the social and political structure [<italic>Gliederung</italic>] with production. <italic>The social structure and the State continually evolve</italic> [hervorgehen]<italic> out of the life process</italic> <italic>of certain individuals</italic>, however of individuals, not as they may appear in their own imagination or in that of other persons, but as they <italic>really</italic> are, namely as they act [<italic>wirken</italic>], materially produce, namely as they are active under certain boundaries, premises and conditions, which are independent of their arbitrary will [<italic>Willkür</italic>].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453712447782">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The individuals’ ‘getting into’ certain ‘social and political relations’ or the evolvement of the ‘social structure and the state’ ‘out of the life process of certain individuals’ are all expressions of the indirect alteration of social relations through labor. So, the different forms of social relations are, much like the environmental and ecological changes, indirect, unintended results of labor. It should be emphasized: what Marx defines as the ‘economic substructure’ is not a primary fact but rather the whole involuntary, as-if-natural structure, which also includes the <italic>basic form</italic> of the state, which has developed as an indirect result of labor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453712447782">15</xref>
</sup> The famous ‘superstructure’ is the conscious attempt to shape – politically, ideologically and legally – the substructure. Thus, exploitation as based on exclusive ownership of the means of production by certain persons is part of the substructure, i.e. it is a relation of production; the whole legal system, which includes the legal concept of ‘private property’, is part of the superstructure. Marx speaks of private property in two meanings: historical-anthropological and legal. I will speak here of private property mainly in its first meaning.</p>
<p>While humans may gradually come to grasp labor as the cause of unasked-for changes in nature, they usually do not perceive labor as the origin of changes in human society. Therfore they regard the social relations that have developed as unintended results of labor as natural social constants or natural social powers, which are constitutive of human society. Thus, the social division of labor, private property and the state are perceived as natural formations of human society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0191453712447782">16</xref>
</sup> The as-if-naturalness [<italic>Naturwüchsigkeit</italic>], namely the whole social complex of indirect, unintended results of labor, is the second important dimension of alienation in Marx’s teachings. Alienation consists here, first, in the involuntary, as-if-natural development of the social relations; it also consists in the as-if-natural power they exert on the human beings who actually created them: ‘The social power … appears to these individuals, since their joint activity [<italic>Zusammenwirken</italic>] is not created voluntarily but <italic>as-if-naturally</italic> [naturwücsigh], not as their own united power, but as an <italic>align force existing outside them</italic> …’<sup>

<title>The as-if-natural development of the state</title>
<p>The state has, according to Marx, two main features. First, the state is the management of general affairs as an exclusive activity. The exclusive ‘professionals’, who manage this particular ‘branch’, are divided into two groups: bureaucrats and politicians (political rulers). In this respect the state is part of the social division of labor. The politicians, however, do not have their origin in the division of labor, although their activity appears as a ‘profession’ connected with the administration of common affairs.</p>
<p>Second, the state is also – in a contradictory manner – the management of general affairs not for the well-being of the whole community (public, nation), but in favor of private interests. In this regard the state has its origin in the relationship of exploitation, or, in more general terms, in the struggle over the distribution of social wealth. The political rulers, namely the owners of the conditions of production or their agents, form the supreme instance, which conducts the public affairs in a way that benefits private interests. And it does it – as a rule – in the name of the common good.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453712447782">18</xref>
</sup> To sum up, the bureaucrats, and bureaucracy as a whole scope of activity, ensue from the social division of labor, while the politicians and politics ensue from the relationship of private property.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0191453712447782">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The development of the social division of labor is usually described by Marx in a brief manner, although it is defined much more often than other social relations as an as-if-natural social creation. Labor is, as other instrumental activities, subject to efficiency criteria: as a means, it should be carried out in the most efficient way possible. The multiplication of the needs, made possible by labor itself (a conscious activity that can be diversified), reinforces the drive to increase efficiency (productivity). Humans, as a result of the fact that their production is shaped as labor, namely that they produce in instrumental manner, permanently look for or invent new productive forces for making their production more efficient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453712447782">20</xref>
</sup> Each productive force that has been found or invented – such as the discovery of the fertility of the soil, the possibility of taming certain animals (as both objects of consumption and means of production), or the invention of the watermill, etc. – drives humans into a new social organization of labor, namely into new division of labor. Using a military metaphor Marx says:<disp-quote>
<p>With the invention of a new instrument of warfare, e.g. firearms, the whole internal organization of the army has necessarily changed; the relationships within which individuals can constitute an army and act as an army have been transformed; and the relationship of different armies to one another has also changed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453712447782">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Historically the division of labor becomes more and more complex, consisting of more and more scopes and characterized by growing diversity and greater expertise, exclusivity and rigidity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453712447782">22</xref>
</sup> This development of the division of labor includes the separation, or seclusion, and crystallization of the management of common affairs as a special, exclusive occupation, i.e. as a particular branch. Thus, matters such as creating/developing and regulating common economic conditions (large-scale irrigation enterprises, commercial ways and ports, mines, etc.), making decisions as regards peace and war with other communities and performing all communal aspects of religious life (ceremonies, etc.) – these and similar activities are separated from other activities and become a complex exclusive activity, which is carried out by particular, ‘professional’ persons. The development and persistence of the management of general affairs as a particular branch of social-economic activity are all but the development and persistence of the state in its first feature. In <italic>The</italic> <italic>German Ideology</italic> Marx speaks of the state as the ‘special sphere, where the lot of the administration of public interests [<italic>öffentliche Interessen</italic>] has fallen through the division of labor’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453712447782">23</xref>
</sup> In the <italic>Critique of the Gotha Program</italic>, some 30 years later, he explains that ‘the term “state” denotes the governmental machine [<italic>Regirungsmaschine</italic>], or the state insofar as it forms a special organism separated from society through the division of labor’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453712447782">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>With the rise of private property and classes the state itself develops as the main social entity that holds society together, maintaining it as an antagonistic whole by simultaneously restraining and protecting private interests (private property). The evolvement of this role of the state is also ascribed to the emergence of the state from – and being part of – the social division of labor: ‘At the same time, the <italic>division of labor</italic> <italic>placed</italic> the maintenance and protection [<italic>Wahrung</italic>] of the conflicting interests of single individuals <italic>into the</italic> <italic>hands of a few person</italic>s, whereby the barbaric enforcement of right also disappeared.’ <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453712447782">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To sum up: the state, much as the social division of labor, of which it is an integral part, is an indirect result of labor. We also might conclude that the state in its first feature can be abolished only if the division of labor can be abolished, while the latter can be abolished only if labor can be abolished.</p>
<p>We are turning now to the second feature of the state. We shall begin by a brief description of the as-if-natural development of exploitation (private property). We can find in Marx’s writings several explanations regarding the historical development of exploitation. We shall present one of them, converging similar explanations. The explanations appear mainly in the <italic>Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts</italic>, <italic>The</italic> <italic>German Ideology</italic> and <italic>Foundations of the Critique of Political Economy</italic> from 1857–8, known as <italic>Grundrisse</italic>.</p>
<p>Instrumental activity is not only a self-relationship – i.e. an activity in which the subject uses his or her own self, body and soul, as a means to an end – but a relationship with the outside world as well. In such activity the environment, nature, is perceived and treated as a complex of means, in the form of tools and material, for achieving the final goal – the requested products. Nature is not perceived as something to be enjoyed in the process of production – for example, as diversified objects that may be experienced esthetically in an artistic mode of production. Marx speaks in this context of the ‘external relationship to nature’. However, other human beings are part of the environment, part of nature, so they are viewed and treated as a means to an end, either as live tools or as part of ‘matter’ (of production objects: copse or forest, field, pasture), from which products may be obtained. In this way, exploitation develops as social reality. Exploitation is in its essence the use of fellow human beings as a means to an end, and this use is a result of instrumental production – of labor. The most effective expansion of the means of production in ancient times was the conquest of inhabited land, i.e. of land cultivated by its native residents. It was a conquest of a complex means of production, which included, integrally connected, human components. The conquerors viewed these human beings as an ‘organic appendage of soil’, that is, as ‘natural conditions’, like trees or cattle, of their production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453712447782">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We may sum up this discussion with Marx’s own words, which stress that labor (or ‘alienated labor’, as instrumental production was first denoted) is the cause of exploitation (or ‘private property’):<disp-quote>
<p>Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence of alienated labor, of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself …<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453712447782">27</xref>
</sup>
</p> <p>The whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production, and all relations of servitude [slavery, feudalism, capitalism – U.Z.] are but modifications and consequences of this relation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0191453712447782">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>If labor, instrumental production, is the cause of private property, private property cannot be abolished unless we abolish labor: ‘… alienated labor is the immediate cause of private property. As the first side falls, the other side must fall as well.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0191453712447782">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In several passages in his early and late writings Marx reiterates in different formulations his famous conception that the state is a means for the all-embracing social consolidation of exploitation, that is, that the state is part of the relationship of private property. An explanation of the development of this second feature of the state as a result of the evolvement of private property is to be found mainly in the early writings and in the <italic>Manifesto of the Communist Party</italic> (the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>). Marx suggests that ‘personal domination’ (the master or masters in the relationship of private property) can maintain its position permanently only if it takes over the management of general affairs (namely the state in its first feature) and shapes it in a way conducive to its own interests. Thus, the economic – turned political – rulers of society anchor their domination in laws, namely in rules that are issued and imposed by the state in its feature as the administration of public affairs. In this respect they make use of the ‘self-deception in law and right’ that necessarily develops in an antagonistic society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0191453712447782">30</xref>
</sup> In short: they ‘subject the whole society to their own conditions of appropriation [<italic>Erwerb</italic>]’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0191453712447782">31</xref>
</sup> That is, they shape the socio-economic life, using the state apparatus, into a system conducive to their own interests. With regard to the bourgeois class Marx says in this context: ‘The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0191453712447782">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We can present this development as follows: certain human beings who use their fellow human beings as a means to an end need an auxiliary means for safeguarding this use, namely exploitation, and making sure that it takes place smoothly and effectively. The best means that they can find for this purpose is the state in its first feature. They take over this administration of public affairs and turn it into an apparatus serving their own interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0191453712447782">33</xref>
</sup> They usually present this conduct of general affairs, which deviates from its ‘original’ aim, as an activity serving the general good. This political ‘game’ is forced on them as from the management of the general affairs it is always expected that it be carried out for the benefit of the whole community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0191453712447782">34</xref>
</sup> The state in its second feature is a further development – one might say a manifestation – of the relationship of private property, namely expanding this relationship on the state in its first feature. Thus, private property turns the state in its first feature into – in Marxist terminology – a ‘class state’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0191453712447782">35</xref>
</sup> The state’s function of holding society together as an intact, internally antagonistic whole has not been abolished but become biased towards the ruling class. As private property is an indirect result of labor, so the second feature of the state is just as much an indirect result of labor. And this second feature can be abolished, only if private property is abolished.</p>
<p>In lines that can be seen as a summary of his conception, Marx says, identifying the ‘mode of production’ and the ‘[social] intercourse’ with the ‘division of labor’ and ‘private property’, that this complex of relations forms the ‘real basis of the state and remains so at all stages at which the division of labor and private property are still necessary, wholly independent of the <italic>will</italic> of the individuals. These actual relations are in no way created by the state power. On the contrary, they are rather the power creating it.’<sup>

</p>
<p>The state, then, is an integral part and a convergence of two relations: the social division of labor and private property. As these relations are indirect, as-if-natural results of labor, so the state is just as much an indirect, as-if-natural result of labor. It is a social relation, whose origin is unknown to humans, which governs them as a natural social power. It follows that the state can be abolished, only if labor, its origin, can be abolished.</p>

<title>The abolition of labor and the abolition of the state</title>
<p>The abolition of the state is inherently connected with the abolition of the social division of labor and of private property, and the abolition of these two relations is predicated on the abolition of labor. Communism in its entirety in Marx’s writings, as social vision embracing all aspects of life, is the abolition of labor and its indirect, as--if-natural results.</p>
<p>The abolition of labor should not be understood as the abolition of clearly alienated labor in the capitalist mode of production, but rather as the abolition of labor as such, namely as the abolition of the primary – alienated, instrumental – form of productive activity. In <italic>The German Ideology</italic> Marx says:<disp-quote>
<p>In all previous revolutions the mode of activity always remained unchanged and it was only a question of a different distribution of this activity, a new distribution of labor to other persons, whilst the communist revolution is directed against the hitherto existing <italic>mode</italic> of activity, does away with<italic> labor</italic> [<italic>die Arbeit beseitigt</italic>] …<sup>

</disp-quote>Marx writes further, attempting to prevent any misunderstanding, as if he was speaking of the communist revolution as the liberation of labor from all forms of domination and not as the total transformation of the character of production, not as the abolition of labor as such:<disp-quote>
<p>The <italic>modern</italic> state, the rule of the bourgeoisie, is based on the <italic>freedom of</italic> <italic>labor</italic>. … Freedom of labor is the free competition of workers among themselves. … Labor <italic>is</italic> free in all civilized countries; [in the communist society] it is not a matter of freeing labor but rather of <italic>abolishing it</italic> [<italic>sie aufzuheben</italic>].<sup>

</disp-quote>All revolutions hitherto – those that constituted slavery, feudalism and capitalism – have left labor intact and only distributed it anew, thus creating new forms of exploitation and new classes of exploiters and exploited. They did not call in question labor itself. The communist revolution, in contrast, abolishes labor itself. The abolition of labor is the abolition of the <italic>instrumental</italic> form of productive activity, the transformation of production from activity, which is a means to an end, into activity, which is an end in itself. Marx defines the new mode of production, which should not be termed ‘labor’, as ‘self-activation’, ‘self-activity’ (in the early writings) and ‘self-purpose’ [<italic>Selbstzweck</italic>]<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0191453712447782">39</xref>
</sup> (both in the early and the later writings). These terms denote activity that is done for its own sake. Human beings, whose activity is not labor any more, develop themselves, by their conscious free choice, as multi-sided persons, fostering capabilities and faculties, which enable them to exercise their self-activity inside and outside production. Marx speaks in this context of the ‘development of a totality of capacities in the individuals themselves’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0191453712447782">40</xref>

</sup> When I draw a picture, sculpt a statue, or write a poem or a piece of music, I perform these activities for their own sake and not as a means to an end. Thus, my activity is not a means to an end – the picture, the statue, or the poem – but rather a path towards an end which is itself an end. In other words: the activity is not less an aim or purpose than the artistic objects that it creates. Between the activity and its final product there exists no means–end relationship. As artistic activity is non-instrumental, it is not subject to efficiency criteria.<sup>

</p>
<p>Marx believed that the transformation of labor into non-instrumental activity would bring about the abolition of its unintended results. In other words: productive activity that would be an end in itself [<italic>Selbstzweck</italic>] would not bring about indirect, unasked-for social results. Human beings who produce non-instrumentally can shape their social relations voluntarily inside and outside of production. Marx describes the abolition of the indirect social results of labor as the abolition of the as-if-natural [<italic>naturwüchsig</italic>] relations. Thus he writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Only at this stage [in communism] <italic>does self-activity coincide with material life</italic> [namely with production – U.Z.], which corresponds to the development of individuals into total individuals, and to <italic>removing all as-if-naturalness</italic> [<italic>Naturwüchigkeit</italic>]. The <italic>transformation of labor into self-activity</italic> corresponds to the transformation of the hitherto conditioned intercourse into the <italic>intercourse of the individuals as such</italic> [as free subjects – U.Z.].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0191453712447782">44</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>He says further:</p>
<p>Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the <italic>basis</italic> [namely labor – U.Z.] of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all as-if-natural [<italic>naturwüchsig</italic>] premises as the creations of hitherto existing human beings, <italic>strips them of their</italic> <italic>as-if-naturalness</italic> [<italic>Naturwüchsigkeit</italic>] and subjugates them to the power of the individuals.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The concurrence, or convergence, of ‘self-activity’ with ‘material life’ (which denotes here ‘production’ or ‘productive activity’) is but the abolition of labor – the transformation of instrumental productive activity into non-instrumental activity. This transformation essentially entails the abolition of the hitherto as-if-natural social relations. Humans who do not produce any more in instrumental manner can develop their social relations voluntarily (as their conscious free choice) as various forms of self-activity, what Marx describes as the ‘production of the form of the intercourse itself’ or as the subjugation of the form of intercourse to the ‘power of the individuals’. We should emphasize: humans can become – according to Marx’s conception of history – full masters of their social relations only if they produce non-instrumentally. The abolition of all as-if-natural relations means primarily the abolition of the division of labor, private property and the state.<sup>

</p>
<p>The abolition of the division of labor should not be understood as the abolition of most or all branches of economic activity, but rather turning them from exclusive instrumental scopes of activity into various non-instrumental fields of activities, which are open, or accessible, to all members of society. The new, rich human beings that have developed themselves universally can exercise their self-activity in various fields. As the economy is not subject to efficiency criteria, but to criteria of creativity, the boundaries between economic and free time activities become blurred. The abolition of the division of labor finds a classical expression in a famous passage in <italic>The</italic> <italic>German Ideology</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can cultivate himself in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I feel inclined to, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic.<sup>

</p>
</disp-quote>In important lines Marx clearly connects the abolition of the social division of labor with the abolition of the state:<disp-quote>
<p>It follows from what has been said above against Feuerbach that all previous revolutions, taking place within the division of labor, were bound to lead to new political institutions; it likewise follows from the things said against him that the communist revolution, which <italic>abolishes [aufhebt] the division of labor</italic>, finally <italic>removes the political institutions</italic>.<sup>

</p>
</disp-quote>The abolition of the state as stemming from the abolition of the division of labor is the transformation of the management of common affairs from a scope of a special professional expertise subject to efficiency criteria into a scope of activity open to all members of the community as a major field of self-fulfillment, of self-activity. As such it is inherently connected with the rise of multi-sided human beings for whom dealing with the common affairs is a prime need. The abstract, as-if-natural private citizen, whose public functions have been separated from her or him and realized by a special professional group, will become an essentially public individual. As such, communism is the abolition of bureaucracy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0191453712447782">49</xref>
</sup> We may conclude that a socialist/communist revolution that would not abolish the division of labor would fail to abolish the state. Soviet socialism attests to such a failure.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>The abolition of private property, which leads to the abolition of the second feature of the state, is also predicated on the abolition of labor. In the manuscript ‘On Frederick List’s Book “The National System of Political Economy”’ from 1845,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0191453712447782">51</xref>
</sup> Marx says:<disp-quote>
<p>We must attack not only private property as a <italic>material state of affairs</italic> [as ownership of objects–U.Z.], but private property as <italic>activity</italic>, as <italic>labor</italic>, if we want to strike at it a mortal blow. … The abolition of private property will become a reality, if we perceive it as the abolition of ‘labor’, an abolition which has naturally become possible through labor itself, that is to say by the material activity of society [namely by the technological achievements of social production–U.Z.].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0191453712447782">52</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>For Marx, social relations are activities, i.e. patterns of behavior in which human beings relate to the environment and to each other in a certain way. For him, the instrumental relationship to the environment is a feature of labor. Since private property is an instrumental relationship to the environment, it is a kind of labor. Marx says several times in this regard that ‘labor is the essence [<italic>Wesen</italic>] of private property’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0191453712447782">53</xref>
</sup> The environment, the sphere of means, of this kind of labor includes other human beings. This ‘labor’, which exploits other labor, has developed out of the latter.</p>
<p>We have seen that private property is an instrumental activity, an activity in which one person uses other persons as a means to an end. This instrumental relationship to other human beings is not a primary, but rather a derivative social fact – an indirect result of labor. By modifying or abolishing the latter, we modify or abolish the first.</p>
<p>When humans do not produce instrumentally, but in an artistic manner, they do not view and treat their environment, both natural objects and human beings, as a means to an end. When natural objects are turned into moments of creative activity, human beings can become partners in that same activity. When I am not driven by efficiency criteria, I am not inclined to overlook the human character of other persons, their character as beings who have an essential need for self-fulfillment, namely for freedom; so I am not inclined to turn them into vital components of my complex of means. Socially, the new mode of production will be shaped as cooperation between mutually respected subjects. Erich Fromm, who integrated Marx’s idea of abolition of labor in his own socialist vision, speaks in this context of the new productive activity and the new social relations that develop inside and outside production as ‘collective art’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0191453712447782">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Marx did not directly say that the abolition of private property would entail the abolition of the second feature of the state. But this aspect of the abolition of the state should be inferred from the hitherto reasoning: the abolition of the instrumental relationship to the natural and human environment would bring about a change in the attitude towards the activity dealing with the common affairs: that activity would cease to be perceived and exercised as a means for bolstering private interests, mainly for fortifying and expanding exploitation. Positively, the abolition of the state would be the transformation of the administration of public matters from instrumental, exclusive activity that formally serves ‘general’ interests, but actually private interests, into dealing with the common affairs as a social complex consisting in non-instrumental activity and non-instrumental relations, which Marx describes as turning the state into a ‘community’ [<italic>Gemeinwesen</italic>], namely into a free association that has always existed within the state as a potential social formation opposed to political-bureaucratic domination. Human beings would thus become ‘species beings’ [<italic>Ggattungswesen</italic>], namely beings who have realized their real, non-instrumental social essence.<sup>

<title>Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of the state</title>
<p>In a late phase of his intellectual life Marx seems to have retreated from the idea of abolition of the state. In the <italic>Critique of the Gotha Program</italic> – a critique of the draft program of the united German Socialist Workers’ Party written by Marx in 1875 and published by Engels in 1891 – Marx first criticizes the quest of the newly established party for the ‘free state’:<disp-quote>
<p>Free state – what is this?</p> <p>It is by no means the aim of the workers, who got rid of the narrow mind of ordinary subjects, to set free the state. In the German Empire [<italic>Reich</italic>] the ‘state’ is almost as ‘free’ as in Russia. <italic>Freedom consists in turning the state from an organ imposed upon society into an organ completely subordinated to it</italic>. And today, too, the forms of the state are free or less free to the extent that they [the workers, or maybe all the citizens] restrict the ‘freedom of the state’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0191453712447782">56</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>We see already in these lines that the ‘abolition of the state’ does not appear as an alternative expression – and as an alternative way of life – to the ‘free state’. Instead, Marx states, very cautiously, that freedom (human? political?) consists in turning the state into an organ subordinated to society, i.e. to the people. The formulation sounds more as a democratic manifesto, which declares that not the state but rather the people should be the sovereign in any future social formation. Freedom does not consist in the abolition of the state but in turning it into an apparatus that serves the people instead of ruling them. That is the first sign of Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of the state. The retreat becomes much clearer in the following lines:<disp-quote>
<p>The German Workers’ Party – at least if it adopts the program – shows that its socialist ideas are not even skin-deep; in that, instead of treating existing society (and this holds good of any future society) as the <italic>basis</italic> of the existing state (or of the <italic>future state</italic> in the case of <italic>future society</italic>), it treats the state rather as an independent entity [<italic>Wesen</italic>] that possesses its own <italic>intellectual</italic>, <italic>ethical</italic> <italic>and libertarian bases</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0191453712447782">57</xref>

</p>
</disp-quote>As we see, Marx does not criticize the authors of the program of the newly established German Socialist Workers’ Party for their failure to mention the abolition of the state as one of their ideals. Rather, he censures them for their failure to realize that the state is not a social entity having its own life independent of other dimensions of society. Marx hints here at his famous theory that the state is essentially connected with production and the relations of production, which constitute the core, or ‘substructure’ [<italic>Unterbau</italic>], of society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0191453712447782">58</xref>

<p>As the discussion in the <italic>Critique</italic> unfolds, Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of the state becomes very clear:<disp-quote>
<p>The question then arises: What transformation will the state undergo in communist society? In other words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present functions of the state [<italic>Staatsfunktionen</italic>]? …</p>
<p>Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. There corresponds to this also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the <italic>revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat</italic>.</p>

</p>
</disp-quote>As we see, in communism there will be maintained social functions, which are ‘analogous to present functions of the state’, namely have the same character.

<p>What could be the reason for this fateful retreat from the humanist idea of abolition of the state, an abolition that Marx viewed for quite a long time as central to any free society? As the evolvement of the state is connected with labor as a form of production, and the abolition of the state is predicated on the abolition of labor, we ought to elaborate on this matter. I would suggest that Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of state is essentially connected with his retreat from the idea of abolition of labor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0191453712447782">
<title>Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of labor and the necessary ensuing retreat from the idea of abolition of the state</title>
<p>In the late phase of Marx’s scientific work a trend toward retreating from the idea of abolition of labor becomes more and more apparent. In some cases – for example, in <italic>Capital</italic> – he totally retreats from this concept, asserting that production cannot be turned into self-activity, that is, cannot be freed from its labor form, and thus cannot become the basis of human freedom. In other writings, however, he still acknowledges the idea of abolition of labor. Indeed, such writings often present a contradictory description of future society by both advocating and negating the idea of abolition of labor. It seems that as a result of new ‘insights’, Marx tended to retreat from the idea of abolition of labor. Nevertheless, as he was aware of the consequences of such a retreat for the prospects of abolishing exploitation and political domination, he hesitated to abandon the idea completely.</p>
<p>In <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, Marx still held to his view that labor could be abolished. In this work he speaks of the ‘development of the rich individuality’ based on the material achievements of capitalism, ‘which is all-sided in its production as in its consumption, and whose labor therefore appears<italic> no longer as labor</italic>, but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity [<italic>Naturnotwendigkeit</italic>] in its immediate form has disappeared’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0191453712447782">61</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One year after this illuminating discussion in <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, Marx seems to have changed his mind abruptly regarding the possibility of abolishing labor. In <italic>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</italic>, published in 1859, Marx states:<disp-quote>
<p>As <italic>purposeful activity</italic> [<italic>zweckmäßige Tätigkeit</italic>] directed to the appropriation of natural factors in one form or another, labor is a natural condition of human existence, a condition of the material interchange between man and nature, quite <italic>independent of all forms of society</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0191453712447782">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>In these lines, Marx defines labor as ‘purposeful activity’, namely as useful activity, as activity that is not an end in itself – instrumental activity. The labor character of production, i.e. its instrumental structure, which is a primary fact, cannot be changed at any stage of human historical development. In other words, even in a highly developed technological society, human beings are not free to choose the most basic mode of their productive activity. Communism, though not mentioned by name, is undoubtedly not excluded here.</p>
<p>In <italic>Capital</italic>, written mainly in 1864–7, Marx’s tendency to retreat from the idea of abolition of labor intensifies. Thus, in the first part of this masterpiece, Marx says that ‘the labor process’ is ‘an <italic>eternal natural condition</italic> of human existence, and therefore <italic>independent of every social phase of that existence</italic>, or rather it is <italic>common to all social forms of this existence</italic>’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0191453712447782">63</xref>
</sup> This and another similar formulation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0191453712447782">64</xref>
</sup> express the same idea: the labor form of production cannot be abolished. Human beings must come to terms with this feature of production, just as they must come to terms with the domination of natural laws. In all forms of society, indeed even in the highest phase of communism, humans are forced to shape production as labor.</p>
<p>The trend toward retreating from the abolition of labor reaches its peak in a well-known passage in the third part of <italic>Capital</italic>. In this passage, Marx differentiates between two spheres of human activity, the ‘realm of necessity’ and the ‘realm of freedom’, and says:<disp-quote>
<p>The realm of freedom commences in fact not before the point where labor, which is determined by want and external purposefulness [<italic>äußere Zweckmäßigkeit</italic>], ceases. It lies, in the very nature of things, <italic>beyond the sphere of material production</italic>. … The freedom in this field [of material production] cannot consist of anything else but of the fact that the socialized man, the associated producers, regulate their interchange with nature rationally, bring it under common control, instead of being ruled by it as by a blind power; that they accomplish their task under conditions most adequate to their human nature and most worthy of it. But<italic> it always remains a realm of necessity</italic>. <italic>Beyond it begins the development of human powers which is an end in itself</italic> [<italic>Selbstzweck</italic>]<italic>, the true realm of freedom</italic>, which, however, can flourish upon that realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day is its fundamental premise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0191453712447782">65</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Here, as in the early writings and in <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, the highest freedom consists in non-instrumental activities. In the first part of <italic>Capital</italic>, Marx defines such activities as ‘the full and free development of each individual’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0191453712447782">66</xref>
</sup> The realm of freedom encompasses all of these activities. The realm of necessity, in contrast, consists in unavoidable instrumental activity. For Marx – and in this respect he follows Aristotle – the most genuine and strongest human drive is to be active non-instrumentally. If – in spite of this drive – we act instrumentally in certain fields, this is a result of natural or historically developed social and material conditions that cannot be adapted to non-instrumental activity. Production, Marx tends here to believe, cannot be taken out of the realm of necessity. That is, production must be shaped instrumentally – namely as labor. Even when humanity has developed to the point where genuine scarcity has long been overcome, some features or qualities of production, not explained in the passage, cannot be changed, thus preventing humans from transforming production into non-instrumental, free activity.</p>
<p>In the manuscript <italic>Critique of the Gotha Program</italic> – in which his retreat from the idea of abolition of the state finds clear expression – Marx seems to soften his retreat from the idea of abolition of labor, allowing this idea to reappear. The reappearance of this idea alongside continued expressions of retreating from it leads to an unavoidable contradiction. Thus, Marx first states that in a higher phase of communism the division of labor would be abolished. Such abolition is essentially an aspect of the abolition of labor. Marx, however, does not elaborate on this point. Rather, in a very problematic sentence, he states that in the higher phase of communist society labor would ‘become not only a means of life but life’s prime want’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0191453712447782">67</xref>
</sup> As a means to an end, labor cannot become a prime need. Satisfying a need is essentially an end in itself. Any activity that is a means to an end is basically neither a need nor the satisfaction of a need. An instrumental activity may create the conditions or the objects for satisfying a need, but it is not itself the satisfaction of that need. Another, non-instrumental activity, in which these conditions or objects constitute essential moments, will satisfy the need. The above-cited sentence is clearly self-contradictory unless we interpret it as Marx’s considerable desire to temper, though not to abolish, the labor character of production. The highest phase of communism would also be characterized by the following principle: ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0191453712447782">68</xref>
</sup> This formulation is another sign of the retreat from the idea of abolition of labor. Here, production is not defined as the satisfaction of a need, the need to be active non-instrumentally, artistically, in the interchange with nature, but rather as a social task to whose execution everyone should contribute according to his or her physical and intellectual abilities. The strong should work longer and more intensively than the weak; one person might assume a managing role, while another would perform a simple factory job. In short: the <italic>Critique</italic> is by no means a deviation from the trend toward retreating from the idea of abolition of labor. Its uniqueness in this regard consists in the attempt to soften the retreat.</p>
<p>What are the possible reasons for Marx’s fateful retreat from the idea of abolition of labor? It seems that the main reason is a certain feature of industrial production that should be termed the ‘instrumental character of technology’. This character is so innate, that Marx became convinced that it does not allow mankind to abolish labor in any modern society, including a communist society.</p>
<p>In his long study of the capitalist mode of production Marx dealt intensively with the nature of modern mass production technology. In chapter 13 of the first part of <italic>Capital</italic>, ‘Machinery and Modern Industry’, he surveyed the structure of modern machinery, the nature of technical improvements and the function of time, indeed the entire character of technology. It seems that he concluded that modern technology has an instrumental character that cannot be substantially changed. By the ‘instrumental character of technology’ we mean that the main criterion of modern technology is efficiency. Machines and machinery are built according to this criterion, since they are said to serve instrumental production as a means, and, like every means, are measured according to their efficiency. Modern technology has sprung directly from instrumental production. Therefore, it is instrumental to the very core and cannot help but develop along instrumental lines.</p>
<p>The instrumental character of modern technology expresses itself in various ways, and it will suffice to describe the most important ones, mainly according to <italic>Capital</italic>:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>machinery should produce as many products as possible in the shortest time possible;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>technical improvements have one aim: to optimize the above relationship;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>machinery should save time. Movements either of the machines or of the workers that are non-instrumental, that is, non-purposeful, not useful, are forbidden. The working mode of machines, as well as of the workers who together with them constitute a mechanical whole, is not allowed to have any elements of artistic creation or play.<sup>

<p>Marcuse suggested that Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of labor ‘belongs to a now obsolete stage in the development of productive forces’, which Marx mistook for a very high level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0191453712447782">70</xref>

</p>
<p>As labor, in its different forms, including modern industrial production, is the origin of the main social relations, i.e. the social division of labor, private property (exploitation) and the state, so if labor cannot be abolished, these relations cannot be abolished either. So any theoretical retreat from the abolition of labor necessarily leads to a theoretical retreat from the conception of abolition of these relations. Thus, if labor cannot be abolished, the division of labor cannot be abolished, and if the latter cannot be abolished, the special branch, which has become a special organism – the professional (political-bureaucratic) administration of public affairs – cannot be abolished. And by the same logic we must conclude that if labor cannot be abolished, private property cannot be abolished. Marx clearly says in this regard: ‘Labor is here the chief thing, the power <italic>over</italic> the individuals, and as long as labor exists, private property must exist.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0191453712447782">71</xref>
</sup> And if private property cannot be abolished, so the second feature of the state, using the administrative apparatus as a means for furthering private interests, cannot be abolished either. In other words: politics and politicians will continue to exist as a major social phenomenon.</p>
<p>We do not find in Marx’s writings a clear expression of retreat from the idea of abolition of the division of labor or from the idea of abolition of private property, but we must conclude such a retreat. We find clear expressions of retreat from the abolition of labor; and we find a clear expression of retreat from the idea of abolition of the state. The missing link – that should be inferred – is a retreat from the abolition of the two major relations, whose convergence forms the state.</p>

<sec id="section7-0191453712447782">
<title>Can the idea of abolition of the state be revived?</title>
<p>As we have seen, any retreat from the idea of abolition of labor actually means accepting exploitative and other forms of non-free relations. If we want to save freedom, we must look for ways to preserve the idea of abolition of labor. Even a partial abolition of labor would have an effect of liberation: reducing the as-if-natural power of the social relations indirectly created by labor and, consequently, reducing the power of the state.</p>
<p>Marx’s retreat from the abolition of labor is, in fact, a departure from his historical outlook. Human beings, as opposed to animals, do not have a fixed mode of behavior, nor do they have fixed forms of social relations. Human nature, then, is <italic>historical</italic>. Thus, humans change the modes of their activity and their social relations either directly or indirectly. It is impossible to understand why the mode of human productive activity should not be part of this historical nature. That is, human beings are capable of fully or partially changing their own productive activity. It is impossible to say whether labor can be completely abolished. Nonetheless, if we want to abolish the state and other unfree relations, or at least reduce their as-if-natural power substantially, the concept of abolition of labor ought to become a regulative idea. This means that we should strive to integrate more and more aspects of non-instrumental activity into production, keeping in mind the goal of completely abolishing instrumental activity. Such integration is fundamentally tied to a change in the character of technology. To use Marcuse’s formulation, we should strive to bring about a ‘convergence of art and technique’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0191453712447782">72</xref>
</sup> that is, to transform machines, or machine systems, into moments of non-instrumental, artistic activity.</p>
<p>Can we discern any recent technological development upon which a qualitative change in technology itself could be based? I believe that computer technology represents such a new development. This technology, which has been expanding since the 1980 s, has the potential to overcome, or rather displace, instrumental technology embodied in the conveyor belt. Over the last decade, the boundary between free time and labor time has become blurred, and both are marked by computer technology. Free-time activity has become more and more a computer-oriented culture, with computer technology being shaped as non-instrumental, i.e. with computers or computer-directed objects being turned into technical components of non-instrumental activity. As such, free-time computer technology can exert enormous influence on shaping its counterpart in the sphere of production. Such influence is by no means certain, since interests of economic and political domination can prohibit its free flow. However, computer technology could be developed toward the new direction hinted at here, whereby machines and machine systems would be transformed into moments of creative, that is, artistic or playful, activity. If we succeed in promoting this new direction, computer technology will become – in Marcuse’s words – a ‘technology of liberation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0191453712447782">73</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Marcuse, who did not live to see the rise of computer technology, believed that modern technology, that is, technology as developed in the second half of the 20th century, could be transformed into a new, non-instrumental technology. Such transformation would liberate and develop a hitherto repressed feature of modern technology. As such it would enable the revival of the Marxian idea of abolition of labor, or, as he also puts it, the abolition of the late Marxian dichotomy between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom.<sup>74</sup>
</p>
<p>An important conclusion of this discussion is that the struggle to abolish economic exploitation and political domination is to a great extent a struggle over the nature of technology as applied to production. Protagonists of human freedom should undertake to initiate the non-instrumental development of technology used in production. Their political activity should aim, <italic>inter alia</italic>, at removing obstacles to the free flow of technological influence from the sphere of leisure time to the sphere of production. The principles and practice of organizing non-labor can only develop step by step with the development of non-labor.</p>
<p>If we fail to view freedom as predicated on the abolition of labor and fail to concentrate our scientific and political efforts on transforming production – in a regulative manner – into non-labor, then different forms of the state, based on different forms of the division of labor and exploitation, will be ‘eternalized’.</p>

<p>In emphasizing the primacy of labor in Marx’s social theory, I mainly develop Herbert Marcuse’s view. Elaborating on his own theory regarding the centrality of labor in human history, Marcuse writes: ‘Only in labor man really becomes historical …’ See Herbert Marcuse, <italic>Kultur und Gesellschaft</italic> [Culture and Society], 2 vols (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1965): ‘Über die philosophischen Grundlagen des wirtschafswissenschafltlichen Arbeitsbegriffs’ [On the Philosophical Elements of the Scientific Economic Concept of Labor], ibid., vol. 2, p. 33. Marcuse suggests that the primacy of labor is mainly to be found in Marx’s early writings (ibid., p. 11). I suggest that Marx always held in his social theory to the primacy of labor.</p>

<p>As to the official Marxism, with all its streams, old and young, the explanation of the failure to acknowledge Marx’s retreat from the idea of abolition of the state might be easy: communism as consisting in the abolition of the state, alongside the abolition of private property, has been the hard core of the Marxist ‘religion’, most conspicuously in Soviet socialism, so that any acknowledgement that Marx did not hold to that idea, would have undermined this ‘religion’, which has never sought to realize its humanist core. Thus, Soviet socialism, while maintaining and even strengthening the state, declared its devotion to the idea of abolition of the state. See, for example: R. N. Carew Hunt, <italic>Marxism Past and Present</italic> (New York: Macmillan, 1955), pp. 108–19; Herbert Marcuse, <italic>Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis</italic> (Harmondsworth, Mx: Penguin, 1971[1958]), pp. 86–90.</p>

Wolfdietrich Schmied-Kowarzik says, very interestingly, that according to Marx, as long as the ‘social practice’ of the individuals ‘runs in spontaneous-natural fashion … what they created will be experienced as if it were the consequence of a natural law, having become so by necessity, and so something which determines them and rules over them’. See Wolfdietrich Schmied-Kowarzik, ‘Karl Marx as a Philosopher of Emancipation’, in Ryszard Panasiuk and Leszek Nowak (eds.) <italic>Marx’s Theories Today</italic> (Amsterdam and Atlanta, GA: Editions Rodopi, 1994), pp. 365–78 (369). Schmidt-Kowarzik suggests, in a Hegelian manner, that the ‘spontaneous-natural’ character of social relations is solely a result of humans lacking collective consciousness of the human origin of these social relations.</p>

<p>In modern democracy the right to participate in the political process is bestowed on all citizens. This universal right (equality of political rights), undoubtedly a new development in politics, does not change the fact that politics ensues from the relationship of private property; it rather means that all classes, including the exploited ones, can contend for the right to control and direct the administration of general affairs for promoting their own interests.</p>

<p>Another development is also possible (as the relationship of private property might permeate all parts of society): the upper stratum of bureaucracy can constitute itself as the master in the relationship of exploitation, thus uniting in the same subjects both aspects of the state. This is typical, in Marx’s teachings, of oriental despotism. In other cases this stratum may share power with other classes while holding a supreme position. This is the case with absolute monarchy and Bonapartism and other forms of bureaucratic-military regimes in the feudal-bourgeois and bourgeois era. Soviet socialism corresponds to the former case. In the case of oriental despotism and Soviet socialism this development may legally appear as the abolition of private property (see in regard to oriental despotism <italic>MEW</italic>: ‘Marx an Engels, 2. Juni 1853’ [Marx to Engels, 2 June 1853], vol. 28, p. 254; <italic>MEW</italic>: ‘Engels an Marx, 6.

<italic>MEW</italic>: Marx and Engels, <italic>Die deutsche Ideologie</italic>, vol. 3, p. 68. The Marxian concept of abolition of labor has been considered by two prominent thinkers of the Frankfurt School, Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, who integrated it into their own socialist visions. See Marcuse, <italic>Soviet Marxism</italic>, p. 138; Herbert Marcuse, <italic>An Essay on Liberation</italic> (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1969), pp. 20–2; Herbert Marcuse, ‘Liberation from the Affluent Society’, in David Cooper (ed.) <italic>The Dialectics of Liberation</italic> (Harmondsworth, Mx: Penguin, 1969), pp. 173– 92 (184); Herbert Marcuse, ‘Das Ende der Utopie’ [The End of Utopia], in <italic>Psychoanalyse und Politik</italic> [Psychoanalysis and Politics] (Frankfurt am Main: Europäische Verlagsanstalt, 1968), p. 70; Erich Fromm, <italic>Marx’s Concept of Man</italic> (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1961), pp. 40–3; Erich Fromm, <italic>The Sane Society</italic> (New York: Fawcett Premier, 1956), pp. 37, 223–5, 234, 302–4. Robert Tucker should also be mentioned as a scholar that has considered the concept. Tucker rightly says that the communist revolution, as envisaged by Marx, would constitute ‘a radically new mode of production that altogether abolishes and transcends … labor itself in the sense in which mankind has always known it’. See Tucker, <italic>The Marxian Revolutionary Idea</italic>, p. 27. The concept has also been discussed by: Yigal Wagner, <italic>The Bounds of Politics: The Relation of State, Society and Labour in the Teachings of Karl Marx</italic> (Ramat Gan: Masada, 1978), pp. 228 ff. [Hebrew]; Michale Strauss, <italic>The Relationship between the Ontological and Practical Meaning of Determinism</italic> (Haifa: self-published, 1969), pp. 198–204 [Hebrew]. In contrast to these scholars, Jürgen Habermas, the influential German philosopher, argues that Marx did not envisage non-instrumental production as the basis of free society. He even says that in the <italic>German Ideology</italic>, a seminal work in which Marx discusses the idea of abolition of labor, Marx makes instrumental productive activity the paradigm of human activity; that is, even in communist society, as Marx envisaged it, humans will voluntarily shape their activities, first and foremost production, instrumentally. It appears that Habermas is unaware of the Marxian concept of the abolition of labor. See: Jürgen Habermas, <italic>Technik und Wissenschaft als ‘Ideologie’</italic> [Technics and Science as an ‘Ideology’] (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1968), pp. 44–6, 62 ff., 92. Consider also Jürgen Habermas,<italic> Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns</italic> [The Theory of Communicative Action] (Frankfurt am Main: suhrkamp, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 208–9; ibid., vol. 2, pp. 500–2. The Marxian idea of abolition of labor has not been given due attention in recent academic research. Analytical Marxism of all stripes is quite unaware of this idea. The concept of non-instrumental development of productive forces is quite strange to this school. For example, in a representative study devoted to the internal debate within this ‘school’ both the primacy of labor and the abolition of labor are not mentioned at all.

<p>In <italic>Grundrisse</italic> Marx relates to this matter in several passages, which illuminate his conception. Thus, for example, he discusses the nature of the activity of the medieval handworker. This activity used to have dimensions of creativity, which substantially reduced its instrumental character: ‘Here is labor itself still half artistic, half self-purpose [<italic>Selbstzweck</italic>], etc. mastery’ (p. 397).</p>

<p>Melvin Rader says, very importantly, in this context: ‘In healthy [non-alienated] society art and esthetic impulses occupy an important place in the [economic] base.’ See Melvin Rader, <italic>Marx’s Interpretation of History</italic> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 50.</p>

<p>See to that point Shlomo Avineri, <italic>The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx</italic> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 48. The Israeli kibbutzim – mainly in their utopian phase that was brought to an end abruptly in the 1990s by a dystopian internal ‘counter-revolution’ – had partially abolished bureaucracy. This was based on a partial ‘abolition of labor’, defined as the ‘self-value of labor’; they organized their communal life – production and distribution, education, healthcare and cultural life – at the general assembly and the various committees, in the activity of which all members participated according to the principle of rotation. In contrast, cities and towns in Israel, which are part of the state, have always been dependent on an administrative apparatus.</p>

<p>Thus, in the countries of Soviet socialism, which did not abolish the division of labor – and they could not abolish it, as they did not abolish labor – the activity of centrally organizing the economy, i.e. the central planning and management of production, formed the core of the state.</p>

<p>The state in its ‘raw’ form, i.e. prior to taking different political and ideological shapes, is also a relation of production, and actually a convergence of two relations of production: the social division of labor and private property; as such it belongs to the substructure.</p>

<italic>MEW</italic>: Marx, <italic>Das Kapital</italic> (First Part), vol. 23, pp. 393, 408, 425, 430, 442, etc. In his short article ‘On Authority’, published in 1873, Engels rounds out Marx’s discussion in <italic>Capital</italic> regarding the nature of modern technology. The machine, or the machine system, he says, functions in modern industry as a ‘mechanical automaton’ which deprives workers of their autonomy and imposes involuntary activity upon them. ‘The mechanical automaton of the big factory is much more despotic than the small capitalists who employ workers have ever been.’ Engels regards this development as the heavy price that humankind is forced to pay for having subdued nature. The subjugation of the forces of nature leads to the loss of the dream of free activity. In other words, modern technology and non-instrumental activity are incompatible (<italic>MEW</italic>: Engels, ‘Von der Autorität’ [On Authority], vol. 18, pp. 305–8 [306]).</p>
