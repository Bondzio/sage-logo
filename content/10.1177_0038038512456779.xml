<p>The emergence, social differentiation, and reproduction of human communities require socialization of the young. Socialization practices require caregivers and socially distributed, intuitive, normative knowledge systems to enable progeny to acquire and sustain habitual, socially organized skills and belief systems.</p>
<p>Neurobiological, cognitive, emotional, and socio-cultural evolution enabled and paralleled the acquisition of communicative and socio-cultural skills indispensable for the emergence and reproduction of a sense of others. Stable adult capacities differentially weaken over the life cycle. This ‘reverse socialization’ means gradual loss of self, sense of others, and decline of routine practices necessary for reproduction of communal life.</p>
<p>A modest corpus of data (10 minutes of discourse between six couples, two deemed ‘normal’, and four where one spouse diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease or Frontotemporal Dementia) is used to illustrate caregiver scaffolding simulation of appropriate socio-cultural interaction, illuminating the origin and demise of socio-cultural presentations of self from birth to death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The article examines why socio-cultural processes cannot be reduced to, yet are necessarily enabled by, neurobiology, cognition, and emotion. The simultaneous evolution of neurobiology and the human genome enabled cognition, emotion, and culture to evolve, and for contemporary human groups to create culturally derived concepts called intelligence, belief systems, religion, philosophy, literature, art, myths, and science. Sociology, therefore, need not ‘look inside’ the human brain and genome for social structure, but to contemporary documentation of socio-cultural processes and structure using a variety of theories and methodologies. The present work relies on discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512456779">Brown, 1995</xref>) and linguistic anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512456779">Hanks, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512456779">Duranti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512456779">Sapir, 1949[1933]</xref>). The methodology encourages the reader to follow the discourse material and ethnographic settings depicted to discern the plausibility of the author’s interpretation of different speech events and their substantive relevance.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous necessity of communication skills embedded in ethnographically confirmed settings underscores their fundamental role in creating human communities and socially organized activities or ‘social structure’. Native speakers are expected to display ‘appropriate’ communication through normative, locally evolved dialectical speech (or sign language) patterns, gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Formal and informal speech events are shaped and constrained by socially organized normative expectations. Ignoring such expectations can invite sanctions.</p>
<p>The article hypothesizes that dementia and related illnesses can be diagnosed using socio-cultural discourse data as evidence. Further, that the emergence, social differentiation, and reproduction of human communal life is necessarily linked to socialization practices of the young and caregiver practices with aged persons, especially when the latter group is diagnosed as having modest or advanced dementia. The empirical evidence for the hypothesis identifies differences in social interaction among spousal couples diagnosed as ‘normal’ in contrast to couples where one spouse has been diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The author was unaware of the diagnosis of the six cases prior to his analysis of 10 minutes of videotaped interaction between the spouses. The results of the empirical section suggest ways that socially organized discourse material may improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with dementia.</p>
<p>The practices called ‘scaffolding’ (see below) are hypothesized to be constitutive of the emergence, sustenance, and reproduction of human communal life. Socializing the young to adulthood and the aged to death requires the simulation of ‘normal’ social interaction despite the variable lack of social competence of those attended. The ‘scaffolding’ practices (simulation of ‘normal’ social interaction) by caregivers enable them to maintain their own identity and sense of social structure during exchanges with socially, cognitive, and emotionally ‘compromised’ consociates. Scaffolding practices presuppose normatively evolving communicative skills across different human communities.</p>
<p>Children acquire, and elderly adults begin to lose, the necessary problem-solving skills, communicative, and socio-cultural practices constitutive of the emergence and persistence of a ‘sense of social structure’ we associate with the acquisition of a ‘social self’ necessary for socio-cultural stability and change over the human life cycle.</p>
<p>Communal life revolves around the individual’s possession of agency, or a socio-cultural self. The notion of a social self and the awareness and ability to take others into account requires collective living conditions only sustainable through collaborative social interaction between conspecifics. Whereas neurobiologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512456779">Seeley and Sturm, 2007</xref>) speak cogently of the biological origins of the notion of social self, the present work takes as self-evident the proposition that human communal life could only have emerged had there been simultaneous evolution of neurobiological, cognitive, emotional, and cultural processes and structures.</p>
<p>The theoretical perspective followed in the present work is indebted to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512456779">George Herbert Mead (1934)</xref>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512456779">Mead (1934</xref>: 135):
<disp-quote>
<p>… the language process is essential for the development of the self. The self has a character which is different from that of the physiological organism proper … [and] arises in the process of social experience and activity, that is, develops in the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals with that process.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512456779">Mead (1934</xref>: 154) continues: ‘The organized community or social group which gives to the individual his unity of self may be called “the generalized other.” The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the whole community.’ Socially organized activities, therefore, are constitutive of social structure.</p>
<p>The following pages begin with a discussion of neurobiological aspects of a ‘social self’ to give readers a sense of how neurobiology enabled the possibility of socio-cultural life forms. Despite the clear relevance of the brain and the human genome for the human acquisition of a social self, the study of the brain and genome cannot explain the evolution of human communities. Going beyond neurobiology requires specifying elements of the cultural origins of cognition; the unavoidable interaction between culture and cognition, and their essential role in the socialization of infants and children into socio-cultural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512456779">Tomasello, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The following section includes literature on caregiver practices and the necessary development of a communicatively competent social self required for the reproduction of human communal life. The conditions viewed as necessary for communal reproduction parallel observable aspects of the gradual deterioration of social and communicative competency evident in the patients with dementia discussed below.</p>

<title>Neurobiological Aspects of ‘Self’</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512456779">Seeley and Sturm (2007</xref>: 317) ask: ‘How do our brains build the self as we know it?’ I assume brains and genes can only understand and ‘build [and conceive] the self as we know it’ within an evolutionarily emergent, socio-cultural community of others noted by Mead. The neurobiological, emotional and cognitive conceptions of ‘self’ presuppose the necessary role of culturally organized ‘others’ and essential daily social interaction constitutive of human group survival.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512456779">Seeley and Sturm (2007</xref>: 317) refer to self-representation as a ‘neural accomplishment’ that emerges ‘… from a dynamic set of component processes’. The authors ‘… stress that self-representation involves diverse processes within broadly distributed, interacting neural networks’ at many biological levels. Further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512456779">2007</xref>: 318), the notion of self includes ‘… recyclable mental representations of objects, including the self’ [and] ‘… permanent others (her, him, perhaps them)’ [that provide] ‘… predictability and security in competitive social environs’.</p>
<p>How did the anterior insula cortex (AIC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACI) noted by Seeley and Sturm emerge and guide the development of an infant social self, interact with other areas of the brain to enable memory systems to emerge and sustain the notion of a human primate ‘self’?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512456779">Seeley and Sturm (2007</xref>: 318) also refer to the necessary human ability to reflect on one’s representations of self and thus develop an ‘<italic>awareness of</italic> awareness’. The reflexive notion of ‘self’ by Seeley and Sturm, therefore, acknowledges the existence of locally organized, socio-cultural environments (‘the social realm’), but does not refer to normative, cross-cultural socialization practices needed for the survival and development of an infant social self.</p>
<p>Taking the role of one’s self reflexively is part of an essential cultural accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512456779">Mead, 1934</xref>) whose assumed neurobiological substrates are unavoidable, but whose emergent functional accomplishment in daily life remains unclear and which the present work seeks to explore with socio-cultural evidence.</p>
<p>If the notion of self emerges as an embodiment of neurobiological, cognitive, emotional, and socio-cultural systems, then it must consist of constantly renewable, culturally coherent, sequential, temporally ordered, interacting, socially functional memory systems which nourish a ‘self’ observable initially in infancy, then adulthood, and it declines with age. Normatively organized human communities, therefore, are an unavoidable evolutionary necessity for socializing the young. The evolutionary processes whereby group social interaction, patterned socio-cultural activities or structure emerged remain a mystery, yet their variable, cross-cultural, present-day existence is an incontrovertible material fact.</p>

<title>Childhood Socialization and Evolution</title>
<p>Six million years are said to separate human beings from other great apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512456779">Tomasello, 1999</xref>: 2); a brief period of evolutionary time. Yet despite a 99 percent overlap in their genetic composition, Tomasello notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>… there has not been enough time for normal biological processes of evolution to have taken place in terms of genetic variation and natural selection in order to have created one by one each of the cognitive skills necessary for modern humans to invent and maintain complex tool-use industries and technologies … [much less] … complex forms of symbolic communication and representation, and complex social organizations and institutions. The problem is magnified by the claim of paleontologists; for most of the 6 million years, no new cognitive skills emerged.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512456779">Tomasello continues (1999</xref>: 4–5):
<disp-quote>
<p>… (b) the first dramatic signs of species-unique cognitive skills emerged only in the last one-quarter of a million years with modern Homo sapiens. Even if 6 million or 2 million or 250,000 years, there would not have been enough time to account for cognitive evolution as the biological mechanism responsible for the rapid evolution. Hence the only possible solution to the puzzle would be ‘social or cultural transmission.’ Hence cultural evolution works much faster than organic evolution.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cultural evolution is species-specific, and could only occur with species-unique modes of cultural transmission. Humans are unique because of ‘… so-called cumulative cultural evolution’ or the modification of accumulated cultural traditions and artifacts over time not shown by other species. The invention of a primitive version of an artifact or practice and its modification or improvement enabled others to adopt it, perhaps without change for several generations. Tomasello calls this ‘the ratchet effect’.</p>
<p>Creative invention and faithful cultural transmission are essential to prevent slipping backward, and holding on to the new and improved form until modifications or improvements came along.</p>
<p>A key issue of primate cultures is the intentional significance of tool use or some symbolic practice, what it is ‘for’, and what others do with. Thus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512456779">1999</xref>: 6):
<disp-quote>
<p>Processes of cultural learning are especially powerful forms of social-collaborative creativeness and inventiveness, that is, processes of sociogenesis in which multiple individuals create something together that no one individual could have created one ‘another’, she identifies with that other person and his intentional and sometimes mental states … [The suggestion is] … that only human beings understand conspecifics as intentional agents like the self and so only human beings engage in cultural learning (Tomasello, 1996b, 1998; Tomasello and Call, 1997; see Chapter 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tomasello’s discussion provides a sociological basis for cognitive processes. Hence, the focus of psychologists on individual cognitive skills always presupposes socio-cultural structures and processes for their identification and study.</p>

<title>Culture, Information and the Emergence of Social Structure</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512456779">Roberts (1964</xref>: 438–9), cultures can be viewed as information economies whereby ‘information is received or created, stored, retrieved, transmitted, utilized, and even lost’. Socialization to adulthood and death, therefore, requires an information economy that is ‘stored in the minds of its members and, to a greater extent, in artifacts’.</p>
<p>Socialization of infants and children through adulthood requires essential ‘scaffolding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512456779">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). The labour-intensive role of scaffolding practices after birth parallels the social interaction employed during socialization of the aged to death. Socialization to adulthood and to death sustains human communal systems and their variation across cultures and functional specificity in different settings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512456779">Vygotsky’s (1978</xref>: 81) notion of the ‘zone of proximal development’, adult guidance of children, suggests neurobiological maturation involving a simultaneous fusion of learning and development. A key notion of his work (1978: 85) is that ‘what children can do with the assistance of others might be in some sense even more indicative of their mental development than what they can do alone’. Scaffolding, the ‘assistance of other’ is embedded in socio-cultural conditions tacitly presupposed but not addressed by Vygotsky.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512456779">Vygotsky (1978</xref>: 86), the ‘zone of proximal development’ refers to ‘… the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers …’ [Thus,] ‘… what a child can do with assistance today she will be able to do by herself tomorrow’.</p>
<p>Vigotsky’s ‘zone’ refers to local social settings created or structured by parents or caregivers or teachers in which a peer or adult’s guidance and collaboration (‘scaffolding’) can enable the child (or a patient) to succeed at (or simulate) a given task or problem-solving activity that is not as likely to occur if the child or patient were left to her or his own devices or capabilities.</p>
<p>The scaffolding used by caretakers of patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) enables the reproductive ‘simulation’ of routine socio-cultural contexts essential for communal stability; for example, enabling patients, temporarily, to access memories of past socio-cultural experiences and/or events they can hopefully recognize as relevant to an existing here and now framed by a caretaker. The extent to which scaffolding can improve the patient’s cognitive, linguistic, or cultural skills is doubtful, but scaffolding can enable caregivers to simulate a needed social sense of self to sustain ‘normal cultural stability’. The extent to which caregivers differentially maintain a sense of denial vis-a-vis their scaffolding activities is an empirical issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0038038512456779">
<title>Social Structure and Cognition</title>
<p>Social structure can be viewed as local and abstract patterns of institutionalized, often bureaucratically organized, developmental, cultural, and cognitively devised belief systems and activities, empirically grounded in daily life practices. Such practices invariably consist of ‘representational re-descriptions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512456779">Karmiloff-Smith, 1992</xref>); memory-dependent re-descriptive language which goes beyond the limitations of our immediate sensory capabilities.</p>
<p>Socio-cultural childhood socialization activities and practices expose the young to an active life-world and different, overlapping forms of normative communal existence. Between the end of adolescence, and the early or late onset of aging, adults experience various forms of apprenticeship practices associated with a wide variety of task environments whose locus of authority resides in familial, interpersonal, and bureaucratically organized institutional settings of power.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512456779">Roberts’ (1964</xref>: 438–9) structural view of cognition and culture notes that tribal communities are too large for single individuals to absorb and store overlapping, distributed, elements of socio-cultural life.</p>
<p>An explicit, related, real-time cognitive view of culture can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512456779">D’Andrade’s (1989)</xref> notion of culture as an immense, distributed, self-organizing productive system. An essential aspect of D’Andrade’s cognitive perspective of culture includes explicit references to daily life encounters faced by human groups, and memory systems consisting of large collections of sustainable, partial (re-descriptive) solutions for problems. The work of Roberts and D’Andrade underscores a constitutive element of culture: the necessity of human memory systems and artifacts for addressing distributive systems of learning and practice.</p>
<p>Building on Roberts and D’Andrade, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512456779">Hutchins (1991</xref>: 284) has proposed the existence of socially distributed cognition in locally ‘cooperative efforts of humans working in socially organized groups’ within a variety of task environments. For Hutchins, a socially organized task environment:
<disp-quote>
<p>… involves the distribution of two kinds of cognitive labor: the cognition that is the task, and the cognition that governs the coordination of the elements of the task. In such a case, the group performing the cognitive task may have cognitive properties that differ from the cognitive properties of any individual.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The integration of cognition and culture, therefore, is a socio-cultural accomplishment of social interaction.</p>

<sec id="section6-0038038512456779">
<title>Caregiver Practices and the Development of a Social Self</title>
<p>The literature on child language acquisition, cognitive development and socio-cultural socialization suggests that early exposure to socio-cultural activities and practices includes communication skills that begin after birth and are linguistically acquired between 10 and 44 months for most languages. In Western cultures, parallel findings exist between middle-income adults’ speech to young children, and how four-year-olds speak to two-year-olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512456779">Gelman and Shatz, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038512456779">Shatz, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038512456779">Shatz and Gelman, 1973</xref>). Routine conversational practices reveal the caregiver’s role in simulating a community of ‘others’ during speech events with the young. The same kinds of speech events occur between caregivers and aged persons with cognitive and socio-cultural deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512456779">Cicourel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512456779">Elissa Newport’s (1977</xref>: 177) research in the United States on ‘motherese’ begins with the recognition that others must speak with the infant or child and ‘… the child acquires whatever language is spoken to him’ [sic].</p>
<p>I summarize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512456779">Newport’s (1977</xref>: 178) succinct review of the literature about a special speech register – ‘motherese’. For example, the child limits its language environment by repeating (parsing) utterances that go beyond her or his speech production capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038512456779">Shipley et al., 1969</xref>), and ignores language perceived to be too difficult or unfamiliar. As noted by Newport, the nature of the selectivity of utterances suggests the child does not rely on innate preprogramming abilities and is probably incapable of processing complex speech. Caregivers are presumed to be sensitive to constraints on the child’s capabilities, including their short-term memory limitations. Adults, in this view, become selective in their use of speech acts assumed to be appropriate – less complex lexically, and structurally simplified. Similar to Vigotsky’s zone of proximal development, the child reacts to utterances somewhat beyond its current rule system.</p>
<p>Newport notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512456779">1977</xref>: 179) ‘… even 3- and 4-year old children, who in some cultures are the primary caretakers of younger siblings (Slobin, 1968a), produce this type of speech to young language learners (Sachs and Devin, 1976; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038512456779">Shatz and Gelman, 1973</xref>)’. Newport concludes her review by describing a hypothesis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038512456779">Gelman and Shatz (1973</xref>: 33) that speakers select utterances perceived as relevant for particular contexts by assessing appropriate conversational meaning. Newport and others she cites acknowledge leaving ‘the problem of [cultural] meaning untouched’.</p>
<p>Child development research on adult speech to young infants and children refers to ‘interpretative frames imposed by the caregiver’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512456779">Ochs, 1988</xref>: 21) often viewed as self-evident. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512456779">Ochs (1988</xref>: 23) continues:
<disp-quote>
<p>While all researchers will readily admit that exotic peoples have a culture, very few see themselves as having a culture and even fewer see their middle-class research subjects as having a culture (but see Lock 1981; Shotter 1974). As noted in Ochs and Schieffelin (1984), middle-class language acquirers and caregivers have an <italic>invisible culture</italic> (see Philips 1983). Their culture is not usually perceived because the researcher usually speaks the same language and participates in the same cultural system as the children and caregivers and/or because the researcher does not have a heightened awareness of his or her own orientations and behaviors, and does not look for these underpinnings in interpreting the behavior of others.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512456779">Ochs (1988</xref>: 23) also raises questions about missing cultural implications of the notion of ‘simplification’ in caregiver speech:
<disp-quote>
<p>We do not see, for example, that the speech of caregivers to and in the presence of young children is organized by cultural expectations regarding the status and role of children and caregivers and regarding relative incompetence (see Ochs and Schieffelin, 1984) … Simplified caregiver speech is one kind of caregiver speech that exists in the world’s societies. It is a social register. It is not universal and not a necessary environmental condition for language acquisition to take place.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above remarks suggest we are missing data showing different socio-cultural settings in which variable scaffolding conditions can be said to exist or in which the claim could be made that such conditions can be minimized yet can result in ‘normal’ language acquisition, cognitive skills, and socio-cultural problem solving. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512456779">Ochs (1988</xref>: 24) suggests that:
<disp-quote>
<p>American caregivers indulge the egocentric tendencies of children, whereas traditional Samoan caregivers resist these egocentric tendencies. American white middle-class caregivers compensate for the inability of infants and small children to meet the informational and social need of others by carrying out a lot of the work for them … and caregivers will often fill in missing information or paraphrase (expand) what the caregiver interprets to be the child’s intended message.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ochs’ remarks parallel the cultural problems existing when communicating with the aged.</p>
<p>The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512456779">Miller (1994)</xref> also provides convincing data on the emergence of a socio-cultural self in early childhood (approximately at 2½ years of age). Citing work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512456779">Basso (1984)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512456779">Sapir (1949[1933])</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512456779">Herdt (1981)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512456779">Malinowski (1984[1926])</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512456779">Miller (1994</xref>: 158) refers to the essential role of myth for preserving the culture of a community by the use of narratives. She underscores the ‘socializing potential’ of:
<disp-quote>
<p>… informal, mundane, and often pervasive narrative accounts that people give of their personal experiences. The verbal activity of telling other people about events that have happened to oneself may well be a cultural universal: Versions of this type of storytelling occur in diverse cultural traditions within the United States and around the world.

<p>The child’s early familial socialization experiences with systems of meaning occur within specific kinds of discourse, especially personal storytelling. For Miller, the three-year-olds’ storytelling reflects a ‘self-construction process’ notable for its revision and reconstruction.</p>
<p>In contrast, among the aged with dementia, spontaneous storytelling diminishes sharply and becomes a diagnostic marker for the study of patients with AD and FTD.</p>

<title>Comparing ‘Normal’ and ‘Diminished’ Displays of Self and Social Structure</title>
<p>The materials presented below are from white middle-income adult patients diagnosed with AD and FTD. The six pairs of patients and spouses were initially seen at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC) (Department of Neurology) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and subsequently tested for their emotional displays and psycho-physiological correlates at the Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). I was not told the diagnosis of the relevant spouse of the six cases selected by the Director (Robert Levenson) of the UCB Lab where I conducted most of my analysis.</p>
<p>A key empirical issue is the extent to which we can assess the ability of patients with AD or FTD to ‘share’ the immediate social environment, and prospectively and retrospectively assess and anticipate relevant motivations, intentions, and emotional states of others. Among early onset AD patients, partial islands of storytelling with caregivers occur, but patients with moderately advanced stages of AD and FTD have difficulty articulating spontaneous storytelling.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of focused discussion by six couples enabled the author to identify ‘normal’ and clinically relevant speech acts and discourse, and infer a differential diagnosis suggestive of an inability by the patients to present a viable socio-cultural self before others.</p>
<p>The dyads were asked to discuss marital ‘conflict’ situation(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512456779">Gottman and Levenson, 1992</xref>) experienced prior to the initial neuropsychological and clinical assessments at the MAC. All subjects engaged in the requested social interaction about a ‘conflict’ situation, but differences quickly emerged between patients designated as having AD and FTD, and those perceived as ‘normal controls’.</p>
<p>The videotaped sessions were examined independent of the patients’ clinical diagnosis, prior occupational history, public contacts, participation in active social networks and routine social activities at home. Ten minutes of discourse proved sufficient to infer which of the couples were ‘normal’. The couples in which one spouse was presumed to have FTD also appeared self-evident. But a 10-minute session proved puzzling for a misdiagnosed case of AD. The problems associated with the misdiagnosed case are discussed below.</p>
<p>The study of speech events during ‘staged’ but surprisingly spontaneous social interaction in the Berkeley Lab provided a valuable source of information about the couples’ awareness of self when communicating with each other and others about daily life topics, planning activities, problem solving or carrying out tasks or activities at home and in their community.</p>
<p>In the two assumed ‘normal’ cases, the subjects readily initiated speech acts with detailed elements of past family relationships, social activities and work experiences, or a long-standing marital problem. The 10-minute sessions could be viewed as microcosms of ‘normal’ marital life for these articulate subjects.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of discourse, however, lack the ecological validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512456779">Bronfenbrenner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512456779">Brunswik, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038512456779">Cicourel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038512456779">Cole, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512456779">Neisser, 1982</xref>) of home visits in which audio and videotapes of patients’ initiating and sustaining a sense of self during discourse could differ from semi-controlled clinical and controlled psychological settings.

<list-item><p>That’s the part that frustrates me.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The couple recreates a long-time ‘conflict’ in their marriage; the wife’s view of the husband’s ‘domineering’ mother. The husband subsequently acknowledges the wife’s view; his submissive behavior in dealing with his mother, but he subsequently refers to her aging years to justify his mother’s behavior. The husband (line 3) contextualizes the ‘conflict’ by using a metaphor (‘we used to go off about’) alluding to prior occasions of conflict, and the metaphoric, alleged claim by the wife ‘… that I [the husband] put my mom first and um I contend I don’t’. The husband presumably favors his mother over his wife and did not (line 5) recognize his ‘mother’s manipulative tactics’. The wife (line 4) initially retracts her presumed earlier claim by stating ‘<italic>I</italic>’m not sure that’s the case anymore …’ The remainder of her remarks in lines 4–11 demonstrates her ability to articulate a long-standing ‘conflict’ in their marriage by underscoring the ‘frustration’ she cites in line 4, but does not provide substantive details about what ‘manipulative tactics’ were used by her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>The language used by each party remained articulate and substantively convincing throughout the session. Each spouse appeared to engage in animated social interaction with no sign of apathy, as well as a strong command of English syntax, phonology, semantics, paralinguistic skills, and task-oriented cognitive reasoning. The couple used appropriate metaphors and deictic lexical items such as pronouns like ‘I’, ‘we’, ‘them’, ‘they’, ‘you’, and spatiotemporal adverbs like ‘that’, ‘there’, ‘these’, ‘those’, and ‘this’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512456779">Hanks, 1990</xref>). They referenced substantive conditions of a ‘normal conflict’ consistent with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512456779">Gottman and Levenson (1992)</xref> on social interaction in ‘normal’ long-term marriages.</p>

<list-item><p>/H: My, my; the question’s not on the specifics,</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The opening three lines reflect ‘small talk’, but in line 4, the wife introduces a topic (‘a strike vote at uh, Peninsula Hospital’). Apparently she is a nurse and not a patient. The wife seeks to justify the strike (lines 6–9); better retirement conditions for nurses and health care after retirement. The husband (line 12) challenges the wife’s remarks using an indexical expression ‘the specifics’, implying there is a problem to be found in unstated details of the negotiations, suggesting a ‘conflict’ between them.</p>
<p>My commonsense interpretation of the husband’s facial expressions and initial comments also suggests he is not a patient. Both husband and wife engage in ‘expected’ presentations of self and marital conflict. The next section of discourse appears to clarify these initial impressions by an articulate polarization of their views about unions. For example:</p>

<list-item><p>26 and not a bunch of people that are willing to negotiate.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The husband’s anti-union perspective (lines 21–23) seeks to refocus the issues raised by the wife (better retirement benefits for nurses) on the union’s tactics. The wife, meanwhile also introduces (lines 17–19) the notion of a long-term goal of ‘universal health care’, which for the wife ‘is the real solution to the problem’. The husband disagrees (lines 21–26). The wife and husband appear to be in good control of their views and consistently reveal an ability to express them clearly. The remainder of the discourse continues in a spirited vein with the wife defending her position and husband doing likewise but without any appearance of rancor or irritation. The couple did not mask the seriousness of their different perspectives, yet remained ‘civil’ throughout the discourse, perhaps motivated by the ‘public’ (recorded) nature of the social interaction.</p>

</list>
<p>In the present and subsequent case, the wife’s ‘scaffolding’ simulates a socially ‘stable speech zone’, thus giving the patient access to a limited set of current and past events. The patient does not introduce his own topics. My initial impression suggested the husband’s face consistently lacked expressive features, in contrast to the wife’s immediate animation even during the silent period. The husband seemed ‘subdued’, not motivated to engage in discourse, and presupposes my having viewed the videotape and prior familiarity with FTD patients. The wife’s scaffolding practices simulate a speech event about future events involving both spouses. The husband’s speech acts were limited to occasional, appropriate, truncated, limited views about the wife’s reference to activities. He did, however, remember their plans to play tennis on the weekend.</p>
<p>In lines 9–11, the wife asks a leading question which provides a scaffolding frame for the husband’s negative response. In lines 16–30, the wife (not shown) again asks leading questions to sustain the conversation. The husband responds appropriately in lines 18, 20, and 22, and expands on the topic in line 20. The husband employs deictic pronouns but the speech events do not contain speech acts that use spatiotemporal deictic expressions (‘those, here, that, there, these’). There appears to be a lack of affect and emotional lexical items and phrases in the husband’s responses.</p>
<p>Speech events that follow (not shown) make reference (by the wife) to a possible pending suspension of the husband’s driving license and her claim that she can drive an RV with his guidance. The husband insists she should not drive the RV. There are other indications that the husband is the ‘patient’. The wife suggests that she and her husband do little socializing, and she refers to a trip to Paris that apparently had been planned and alludes to not taking the trip because of the husband’s medical condition.</p>

<title>Case 7162</title>
<p>The wife begins the exchange with winks and chuckles. The husband moves his fingers to his lips, suggesting comprehension of lab assistant’s remarks to observe silence. The wife smiles broadly. The husband’s head drops to his chest and then up again. The husband’s facial expression appears ‘frozen’ and barely animated when communicating. The husband says something and the wife puts a finger to her lips to signal ‘don’t talk’. Brief non-verbal facial expressions follow and husband smiles slightly. Wife closes her eyes. Husband looks around. Wife puts fingers on her eyes to indicate the husband should close his eyes but he doesn’t and looks around. The silent period ends with the laboratory assistant asking the couple to begin the ‘problem’ conversation.</p>
<p>The wife’s immediate reference to ‘clutter’ appears to presuppose a prior, long-standing problem. The wife immediately begins to control the exchange by providing the initial scaffolding needed to initiate the exchange. I assumed the wife believes the husband is not likely to initiate the discourse.</p>

<p>The wife (lines 1–5) immediately asks a ‘question’, which turns into a prolonged complaint about the husband’s apparent long-term disregard for cleaning the garage. The wife uses several deictic and indexical terms including one fragment (line 4) of alleged unreported speech attributed to the husband whose reported usage we cannot confirm. The deictic term ‘it’ refers to unidentified entities that were placed in the garage. The husband’s response is a ‘flat’ ‘Okay’. The husband makes no attempt to refute the wife’s allegations and she begins to elaborate ‘the problem’. The opening lines, therefore, resembles a caregiver monologue I assume is typical.</p>

<p>The wife (lines 6–9) continues the monologue by reference to the indexical term ‘clutter’. The wife accuses the husband of making no attempt to organize the ‘clutter’ and notes the situation remains the same now as when they first moved into the dwelling. Instead of taking advantage of many opportunities to organize the garage, the wife notes (lines 11–12) her husband would ‘watch TV’. The wife pursued the allegation through lines 13–16. The scaffolding provided by the wife is clear and closely resembles the prior case. In the next fragment, there is a shift to the patient’s present ‘problem’.</p>

<p>The wife (lines 17–18) states ‘ I understand why I can’t expect for you to do the garage any more, is that you are incapable of it because of the new prognosis we have on you.’ The direct reference to ‘the new prognosis’ is stated as a self-evident ‘fact’, and the wife (line 19) associates the husband’s inaction with ‘clutter’ to be a consequence of the ‘new prognosis’ apparently identified ‘2, 2½ years ago’. The wife (line 20) asks the husband to reflect on her analysis of the reason for his not organizing the ‘clutter’. The husband’s response is brief and semantically ambiguous, but perhaps could be viewed as ‘appropriate’, given the information about the ‘new prognosis’ and the lack of a more elaborate response by the husband. The husband’s answer, however, is not self-evident. Should we assume he is not capable of understanding the wife’s linking of ‘clutter’ to his ‘new prognosis’? Subsequently (not shown), the husband appears to reveal a minimal sense of self and comprehension and the wife persists with her view of the ‘problem’.</p>

Thus, early on, the husband seemed to be informing the lab assistant of the kind of scaffolding appropriate for discussion. The wife’s animation appeared appropriate when she did speak. The wife’s facial expression, however, appeared to be periodically ‘fixed’ and she frequently lowered her eyes after speaking. Her facial appearance seemed subdued and lacked expressiveness, except when speaking. The reference in lines 8–10 to ‘a problem with eating’ seemed appropriate.

</list>
<p>The wife (line 2) expresses doubt about ‘clutter’ as a topic, yet in line 3 seems to claim they ‘have a lot of clutter’. In lines 5–8, the wife expresses concern about ‘getting the stuff OUT of the house’, suggesting she cannot be the one who can remove ‘all the stuff’ to a storage space, and tells her husband (line 8) ‘but you don’t want to do that’. Is the wife saying the husband opposes moving the ‘band stuff to the storage space?’ In line 9, the husband seems about to negate something, and the wife cuts him off (line 10) by noting ‘And I can’t drive’. There is no way to know if the wife’s driver’s license has been suspended or if she has never driven. The husband’s reply (‘I know’ (laughs)) suggests but does not confirm a suspended license. The remarks suggest the wife has been diagnosed with AD.</p>
<p>In lines 11–13, the husband seemed surprised by the wife’s reference to ‘the band stuff’, and states it was ‘the first time you mentioned about the band stuff going to the storage space’. Perhaps this is an example of memory difficulties. Yet, the wife remembers their having more storage space than needed. The dialogue appears appropriate for both spouses; the wife by reference to the ‘band stuff’ and unneeded space, and the husband (line 17–19) suggesting he will call someone (name), presumably to help him remove the ‘stuff’. The husband suggests a way to solve their problem.</p>
<p>Although the case seemed somewhat perplexing, I viewed the husband’s expressions of planning actual activities to facilitate the movement of ‘clutter’ as indicative of his creative scaffolding role for the wife despite her periodically ‘competent’ remarks.</p>
<p>Several of the wife’s initial remarks appeared appropriate in lines 21–26 (not shown). The husband’s remarks, however, seemed more appropriate, especially his reference to using email to contact (first male named) to have him help move the ‘stuff’.</p>
<p>In lines 32–42 (not shown), the husband states ‘I want to sell that drum set’ and the wife (line 33) agrees. The husband suggests the wife call (first female named) to see ‘… if she’ll come and take some of our stuff’. Thus both spouses initiate possible plans and suggest ways of achieving solutions. But the husband’s remark that he will ‘email (first male named)’ suggests an ongoing, complex cognitive skill.</p>
<p>In lines 69–73, 77–79, and 88–90 (not shown), the wife laughs and changes the topic, but appears to experience difficulty articulating her concern with ‘our finances’. She continues by stating her desire to consolidate their finances. An awkward use of syntax, lack of semantic clarity, and the use of many confusing deictic expressions (‘And you know, I don’t, it, I, I’m, I, I, our, I’d, I, I, I, it’). The husband (line 74) remains supportive and does not question the wife as she continues expressing uncertainty about financial matters.</p>
<p>In lines 77–79, the wife’s confusion about her funds (‘we just don’t know what, how to deal with it’) could be viewed as a common problem among the aged but this wife appeared to be in her fifties (and I subsequently learned she was 60 years old at the time of the session). The husband (lines 80–81) provides a scaffolding response that ‘legitimizes’ the wife’s remarks by noting ‘this’ would be a good time to reconsider doing something about mutual funds not identified by the wife. After the wife murmurs apparent agreement with the husband’s remark, the husband continues by implying (line 83) an unstated possible solution (‘Actually, I feel that, you know, we could figure out’). The husband then states his own doubts (‘I don’t even [line 83] know where to begin with your stuff)’. The husband’s use of the metaphor ‘your stuff’ is followed by the wife (line 86) stating ‘With my stuff?’ as if to question its meaning. Perhaps she forgot what was said a few lines earlier. I decided the wife was the patient.</p>

<title>The Puzzling ‘AD’ Case 5268</title>
<p>After making presentations to the UCB psychophysiology laboratory and a seminar at the Memory and Aging Center at UCSF, I was told I had misdiagnosed one of the two AD cases. I was not surprised; the videotapes of the AD cases proved difficult. I subsequently returned to the tape I suspected was the problem case for an additional review. The case alerted me to a problem about which I needed reminding: non-verbal and emotional displays and the word-by-word analysis of the videotape require repeated (necessarily ‘filtered’) representational re-descriptions of what are presented as ‘data’. I asked myself: ‘What knowledge about antecedent ethnographic conditions would be helpful to the research analyst before beginning her or his analysis?’ The conceptual/methodological issue is how do analysts decide intuitively and factually what elements are indicative of bringing into existence a defining or explanatory frame of reference (to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512456779">Kahneman and Miller, 1986</xref>). The problem of behavioral ‘indicative elements’ is also paramount for the families or caregivers who must decide when a referral to a physician appears necessary, and is also a deep concern of clinicians during their initial interaction with caregivers and interviews with patients.</p>
<p>Initially, I assumed the wife was the patient; her appearance seemed somewhat ‘disheveled’ for someone who appeared to being in her fifties and at a formally arranged session in a university laboratory. Her glasses were sitting on the lower part of her nose, and her hair seemed un-combed. The husband appeared to be well groomed, and his face seemed to be somewhat ‘fixed’, with an occasional smile, but no laughter.</p>
<p>The wife appeared to initiate the conversation, but the husband intervened immediately, yet he seemed ‘odd’ to me because of his ‘serious’ facial expression, lack of animation, and ‘rigid’, ‘controlled’, direct manner. The wife’s voice appeared clear and moderately animated with appropriate prosody. I began thinking the husband was the patient, yet the husband was active in the conversation. The ‘diagnosis’ of AD for the husband appeared not to be substantiated. The husband seemed quite articulate in expressing his views about religion, yet some viewers might suggest that the husband seemed to be somewhat dogmatic about his religious views. On the other hand, his views could also be based on prior, well-rehearsed discourse known to the wife.</p>
<p>As the discourse continued, the wife, unsurprisingly, seemed to ‘know’ the husband’s previous views on religion. She wanted the husband to address his religious beliefs. The initial exchange follows.</p>

<p>In lines 6–14, the wife begins with several false starts and finally (lines 9–10) uses the deictic term ‘it’ (line 12) and the metaphor ‘give it a chance’ to refer back to line 8 (‘try – to go to church’). The wife’s remarks seemed confusing. I viewed her difficulty in topicalizing the source of ‘conflict’, coupled with my initial perception of her appearance, as indicative that the wife was the patient. The husband seemed impeccably groomed and his opening remark seemed articulate. The wife’s remarks in lines 9–13, however, revealed a moderate ability to first frame, and pursue the husband’s reluctance to attend church with her. The wife suggests he is ‘afraid to go’, and sounds frustrated with this reluctance. The wife’s remarks could be viewed as ‘scaffolding’ in order to motivate the husband to address an apparently long-term, contentious issue in their marriage. The husband (line 13) insists his wife already knows his views. The wife, however, insists the husband tell his views again.</p>

</list>
<p>In lines 15–20, the husband displays a clear self-conception of his religious views, and states ‘It doesn’t mean that I don’t believe in god.’ He reiterates this view in line 19. The husband did not appear to be the patient; his speech acts appear to reveal a strong sense of self-awareness about his dislike of organized religion. The wife’s ‘interrogation’ appeared deliberate and suggests an equally strong sense of self. Husband and wife seemed ‘obsessed’ with their conflict over religion and church attendance. The case appeared confusing.</p>
<p>The wife appears to use a subtle but organized form of adult ‘motherese’. Is this a strategy to ‘entice’ the husband to speak about his views and perhaps satisfy the request of the lab team? The husband’s ‘preoccupation’ with his description of the ‘evils’ of organized religion is difficult to assess given the paucity of ethnographic observation and only a 10-minute, staged speech event.</p>
<p>After re-examining the videotapes of Case 5268, and despite finding both negative and supportive ‘evidence’ for perceiving the woman and her husband alternatively as the ‘patient’ or as ‘normal’, I decided the husband was probably the patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The article attempts to build on and extend the innovative research of scholars who have focused on developmental issues by applying some of their insights to social interaction among the aged.</p>
<p>The analysis of the six cases sought to identify and document socio-cultural scaffolding practices necessary for understanding the emergence and stability of a social self, and coping with the decline of human communal life among the elderly.</p>
<p>The empirical materials presented above are a modest beginning. Current research by the author explores the diagnostic process, including the role of bureaucratic constraints faced by the neurology clinic with their patients, and then obtains audio and videotapes of the patients in their home environments.</p>
<p>Making diagnostic inferences using videotapes of ‘staged’ 10-minute discourse sessions about an elicited ‘problem’ that spouses had experienced appeared to be self-evident for the two controlled cases and two FTD patients, but daunting in the analysis of one AD patient. I attribute my diagnostic difficulty to not having access to more than 10 minutes of discourse given that the two cases were diagnosed as early onset AD. For example, the wife of the misdiagnosed case was 59 years old at the time of the session while the first case of AD was 60 years old. I believe 30 minutes of ‘open’ discourse between the misdiagnosed AD case and her husband would have suggested the wife was the patient.</p>
<p>The empirical data suggest social research methods can contribute to our understanding of human development and decline. Further, that ‘normal’, sustained social interaction is the hallmark of socially organized, normatively constrained social structures. The patients revealed both fairly self-evident and subtle problems for maintaining expected ‘normal’ presentations of a social self during social interaction.</p>
<p>Sociological studies of local social interaction in which patients and others engage in problem solving and social exchanges can help caregivers and clinicians understand the significance of routine and complex daily life activities for diagnosing early signs of socio-cultural-cognitive deterioration, and conditions which led the spouse or family members to consult health care professionals. The early observations and inferences of family members, friends, neighbors, and work colleagues remain clinical empirical issues, and are difficult to document. Within clinical settings, such data are seldom transparent and their discourse properties are seldom self-evident.</p>
<p>The author’s current research explores the initial clinical diagnostic process and asks: How do health care personnel obtain evidence about when, with whom, and to what extent patients with signs of dementia begin to exhibit aberrations or alterations in their behavior with others? When do patients show signs of having difficulty engaging in routine and abstract tasks, re-conceptualizing memories of past events, and coping with everyday social interaction? Recorded home visits are being pursued to obtain independent evidence on daily life communication skills and problem solving.</p>
<p>The modest corpus of data examined above underscores the relevance of necessary moment-to-moment communicational skills ubiquitously present in local communal living, including the useful ‘staged’ 10-minute exchanges presented above. The data identify aspects of ‘appropriate’ and ‘inappropriate’ communication skills among the couples studied and reveal aspects of the normative expectations participants expect if they are to perceive socially organized activities as ‘life as usual’ or ‘normal’ or ‘unexpected’ or ‘inappropriate’ displays of social interaction. The results support the hypothesized differences in social interaction among spousal couples diagnosed as ‘normal’ in contrast to couples where one spouse has been diagnosed with either Alzheimer’s Disease or Frontotemporal Dementia. Normatively expected social discourse, therefore, proved useful in distinguishing communicational differences among ‘normal’ couples and those in which one patient was diagnosed with dementia.</p>
