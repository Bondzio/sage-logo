<abstract>
<p>Genetic characterization of the hemagglutinin gene of the 6 selected Thai Swine influenza virus (SIV) isolates (4 H1 and 2 H3 isolates) used in the establishment of a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was analyzed. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, Thai SIVs could be divided into 3 clusters of the H1 viruses (clusters I and II belonging to classical swine H1α, and cluster III belonging to classical swine H1γ), and 2 clusters of the H3 viruses both belonging to human-like 1970s. The serological results indicated that swH1N1-06 (H1 cluster I) is a suitable representative SIV for the HI test antigen to detect H1 SIV-specific antibodies in the Thai swine population, while both swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07 should be used for Thai H3 SIV-specific antibody detection. The HI test results of swine sera collected from pigs in the 4 highest pig population provinces of Thailand indicated that the percentage of pigs seropositive to swH3N2-07 was highest compared to swH1N1-06, swH1N1-09, and swH3N2-05 (85.4%, 50.1%, 18.6%, and 15.8%, respectively). It should be noted that countries lacking SIV genetic information should be concerned with determining the most suitable HI test antigens to use when performing the tests due to the genetic variation and limited cross-reaction of SIVs. The results of the current study demonstrated that HI tests should be implemented with the suitable field strains as the representative test antigen to ascertain accurate SIV serostatus in Thailand and that test antigens should be genetically analyzed and compared with circulating strains regularly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by <italic>Influenza A virus</italic>. Three major subtypes including H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 are currently circulating worldwide in swine populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712466554">2</xref></sup> including Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712466554">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> Swine influenza virus (SIV) infection causes acute respiratory syndrome including cough, dyspnea, fever, and prostration with rapid recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref></sup> The morbidity rate of SIV is high and may increase up to 100% in immunologically naïve pig populations whereas the mortality rate can be as low as 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712466554">2</xref></sup> Infected pigs will lose weight, resulting in an increased growing period to normalize weight before going to the slaughterhouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712466554">11</xref></sup> In addition, SIV is one of the primary pathogens of porcine respiratory disease complex causing major economic losses in many swine production countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712466554">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1040638712466554">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1040638712466554">41</xref></sup> In addition to causing health problems in pigs, SIV is a public health concern due to its zoonotic potential. Retrospectively, cases of SIV isolated from human beings with respiratory symptoms or serologic evidence of SIV infection were occasionally reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712466554">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712466554">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638712466554">24</xref></sup> For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many public organizations encourage influenza surveillance not only in human beings but in all animal species, particularly in pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712466554">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Retrospective and cross-sectional studies of <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> in pigs both virologically and serologically are important for early recognition of pandemic outbreak threats. Data gained from such studies will not only provide basic information of the current status in the swine population but can also generate data for vaccine development leading to effective prevention and control in both pig and human populations. Direct detection of SIV and/or viral genetic materials, however, can be problematic because the duration of SIV shedding in infected pigs is short.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638712466554">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref></sup> Thus, SIV-specific antibody detection used as an indicator of previous SIV exposure can become helpful particularly in areas where SIV vaccination is not commonly performed, such as in Thailand. Because no SIV vaccines are currently used in the Thai swine population, SIV-specific antibody detected in pigs, therefore, reflects SIV infection or previous exposure to the specific virus. Unfortunately, minimal SIV serological data in Thai pigs is currently available. A previous study in 2008 using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, a virus detection method for surveillance, reported a small amount of SIV-positive pigs (2.8%) in the central and eastern regions of Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638712466554">25</xref></sup> However, the low incidence of SIV detection can be confounded by the short shedding period of the virus. As a result, SIV serological surveillance is necessary to provide an overview of the disease particularly in countries where SIV diagnostic laboratories are not widely established.</p>
<p>Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) is a gold standard for influenza A–specific antibody detection recommended by the WHO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1040638712466554">40</xref></sup> The HI test is highly subtype-specific and requires a suitable representative virus from the locally circulating field strains for the test antigens. In general, SIV is genetically unstable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712466554">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1040638712466554">39</xref></sup> Many subclusters have emerged within the different H1N1 and H3N2 SIV subtypes around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712466554">21</xref></sup> Historic data indicates that H1N1 SIV is comprised of 2 major lineages: the North American and Eurasian swine lineages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712466554">2</xref></sup> Interestingly, in Thailand, the reassortant H1N1 SIV between the North American and Eurasian lineage has been reported as swine breeds have been continuingly imported from both continents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> Similarly, antigenic and genetic diversity of swine H1N1 and H1N2 viruses in Europe have been documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712466554">19</xref></sup> This indicates that a constant update of the representative filed strain virus within different regions of the world is required to reflect true SIV serologic data. It is also important that the selected virus have a wide cross-reactivity to antibodies against different SIV strains within the same subtype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712466554">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712466554">29</xref></sup> Previous SIV genetic data in Thailand showed that H1 and H3 SIVs circulating between the years 2000–2005 formed at least 2 clusters within each subtype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> Data published in 2010 showed that the pandemic H1N1 2009 (pH1N1) virus is now circulating in Thai swine herds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712466554">31</xref></sup> It should be noted that before the introduction of pH1N1 in Thailand, SIV HI test antigens and serological data had not yet been evaluated. The objectives of the current study were 1) to genetically characterize the hemagglutinin (<italic>HA</italic>) gene of Thai H1 and H3 SIV field isolates; 2) to establish H1 and H3 HI test antigens by investigating cross-reactivity among the Thai H1 and H3 SIV isolates; 3) to use the established HI test for swine sera evaluation collected from the 4 highest pig density provinces of Thailand; and 4) to compare the findings of the established HI test with the SIV commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for H1- and H3-specific antibody detection.</p>

Among the 4 swine H1 viruses in the current study, the PIR was similar except for pH1N1-09 at residue 96. The amino acid residue 96 of swH1N1-06, swH1N1-09, and swH1N2-09 is threonine (T), which is similar to A/sw/NC/00573/2005, but pH1N1-09 contains isoleucine (I) similar to A/sw/Minnesota/37866/1999. The amino acid residues 133 and 183 are similar to A/sw/Minnesota/37866/1999 (valine [V] and proline [P], respectively). In addition, amino acid change on the presumed antigenic site (Ca, Cb, Sa, and Sb) of the HA1 region was evaluated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1040638712466554">Table 5</xref>. A total 19 amino acid residues were different among the 4 H1 viruses. There were 4 residues similar in 3 H1 viruses (swH1N1-09, swpH1N1-09, and swH1N2-09), but different from swH1N1-06 (Ca141, Cb73, Sa162, and Sa155). For the HA H3 subtype, the 8 major potential immunodominant positions (121, 135, 144, 145, 155, 156, 157, and 188) were compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1040638712466554">Table 6</xref>). Seven amino acid positions were different, and only an amino acid on residue 156 was similar in swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07.</p>

<p>For antigenic properties using rabbit antisera, HI titers of each group of the studied rabbits reached ≥1:160 against the homologous virus within 5 weeks post inoculation. Antisera from those rabbits injected with the H1 antigens had no antibody titers to the other 2 H3 subtypes and vice versa. The HI geometric mean titers in each group against H1 and H3 antigens are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638712466554">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1040638712466554">3</xref>, respectively. Rabbit antisera against swH1N1-09, pH1N1-09, and swH1N2-09 isolates had high cross-reactive HI titers (&gt;1:160) against swH1N1-06. Interestingly, swH1N1-06 antiserum had no cross-reactivity against current H1 isolates. Similarly, swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07 antisera had no cross-reactivity to the heterologous viral antigen. These findings indicated that swH1N1-06 is a suitable representative isolate for use as the HI test antigens for H1 SIV-specific antibody detection in the Thai swine population. Furthermore, both swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07 are suitable for use as the HI test antigens for H3 SIV-specific antibody detection in Thailand.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, SIV genetic mutation normally occurs by point mutation, reassortment, and introduction of new viruses into the local area. Unlike North American or European SIVs, Thai SIVs contain mixed genomes from both North American and European lineages. In the United States, swine H1 is divided into 3 clusters, classical H1N1, reassortant H1N1, and H1N2-like.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712466554">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1040638712466554">38</xref></sup> Interestingly, genetic characterization of the <italic>HA</italic> gene of Thai SIV subtype H1 belongs to classical swine, similar to the swine H1α and H1γ clusters of the North American swine lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> but is genetically different by antigenic drift from its original. Thai SIV subtype H1 can be further divided into 3 clusters (clusters I–III).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638712466554">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712466554">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> Therefore, whole genome characterization of previous and current Thai SIV isolates is necessary because it could provide essential epidemiologic data and diagnostic and disease preparedness of the current viruses. Currently in Thailand, there are only 16 whole genomes of 2000–2005 (6 H1N1, 9 H3N2, and 1 H1N2), 8 H1N1 whole genomes of 2009–2010,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638712466554">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712466554">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638712466554">34</xref></sup> and 38 <italic>HA</italic> genes available in the public database. In addition, Thai SIVs can be divided into 5 clusters. However, the internal genes of the current 14 Thai SIV isolates are unavailable (unpublished data). Such data is needed for reassortant detection and virus evolution, as each gene segment may possibly derive from different origins. For an epidemiology study, all 8 gene segments must be evaluated regularly. In addition, HI testing requires the use of specific local or regional viruses as test antigen for each location or region under surveillance. Both direct and indirect diagnostic tools are required to generate the current genetic data for the circulating viruses in each local Thai area because SIVs from the United States and Europe are genetically and antigenically different from those of the viruses in Thailand.</p>
<p>Antigenic properties by HI testing using specific rabbit antisera were evaluated in the current study. To elucidate H1 cross-reactivity, the representative isolates of subtype H1N1 in each cluster and the H1N2 isolates were selected for evaluation of the HI titers using known rabbit antisera. The results showed that sera from the previous swH1N1-06 (H1 cluster I) inoculation had no cross antibody reactivity with any of the 3 current swH1 in 2009 (H1 clusters II and III) viruses. However, all 3 swH1 rabbit sera in the present study demonstrated cross-reactivity to the previous swH1N1-06 virus. It should be noted that for routine serosurveillance using HI testing in each country, the specific endemic subtypes isolated in the local area having a broad cross-reactivity must be used for the test to obtain the most accurate results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712466554">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638712466554">29</xref></sup> In the current study, swH1N1-06 could be used as the representative virus for Thai H1 subtype HI test because it showed one-way cross-reactivity to other H1 viruses. For H3N2 subtype, the rabbit sera showed no cross antibody reactivity in either selected H3N2 isolates. Interestingly, both swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07 viruses were isolated from the same farm in 2005 and 2007, respectively. However, the swine serum collected during this studied period showed different seroprofiles, with a high seroprevalence for swH3N2-07. The results suggest that the virus could have genetic mutations and become endemic in the original farm. The virus antigens used for HI testing and genetic monitoring locally, therefore, should be evaluated regularly.</p>
<p>From June 2008 to May 2009, serologic surveillance in the present study showed that all 4 selected provinces in Thailand had higher H3N2 seropositive percentages than those of the H1N1 subtype (swH3N2-07: &gt;70%; swH1N1-06: &gt;40%). It should be noted that pH1N1 emerged in Thai pigs in late 2009,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712466554">31</xref></sup> and the current seroprofile of the Thai SIVs could possibly be different from the current study. Continuous monitoring of SIV status in both virology and serology is suggested.</p>
<p>Based on the farm history, all 12 selected pig farms in the present study showed respiratory problems concurrently with the presence of <italic>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus</italic> and <italic>Porcine circovirus-2</italic>. However, the economic loss from those pathogens was not evaluated. In addition, the economic impact of Thai SIVs should be evaluated, as the virus may play a major role in the porcine respiratory disease complex.</p>
<p>It should be noted that SIV has gained significant attention because of its public health concern, particularly, after the emergence of the pH1N1 in 2009. Moreover, this pandemic flu showed continuing reassortant with endemic SIV in pig populations worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712466554">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712466554">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712466554">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712466554">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638712466554">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638712466554">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1040638712466554">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1040638712466554">42</xref></sup> Similarly, cocirculation of both pH1N1 and endemic Thai swine H1N1 viruses was found in the same farm with no reassortant virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1040638712466554">31</xref></sup> However, a novel reassortant virus could possibly emerge without notice. Based on intensive surveillance, the pandemic reassortant virus was demonstrated in Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712466554">13</xref></sup> It should be noted that SIV-infected pigs may show only acute mild respiratory distress that could be overlooked by farmers or veterinarians. In addition, human to pig transmission or vice versa may occur without notice. The current study has sought to demonstrate the benefit of HI testing, which could be useful for interspecies transmission surveillance.</p>
<p>The current study illustrates the importance of global swine influenza surveillance because it demonstrates that the use of SIV test antigens from nonendemic sources should be carefully scrutinized, as the genetic and antigenic variation of SIV might not be suitable for the surveillance of local SIVs. In the present study, the genetic and antigenic variation of antigens in different assays was apparent when compared using commercial ELISA test kits with the established HI tests. Therefore, evaluation of commercial test kits from other countries is necessary to ascertain current epidemiology data due to the genetic and antigenic differences of the circulating viruses.</p>
<p>In general, nucleotide sequences encode the amino acid sequences most related to protein function. The PIRs suggesting possible host adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1040638712466554">39</xref></sup> were located at the amino acid residue 96 of the H1 <italic>HA</italic> gene. The change at amino acid residue 96 from threonine→isoleucine of pH1N1-09 was different from other swine H1 viruses in 2006–2009. The pH1N1-09 virus found in pigs in the current study is similar to the pH1N1 virus that emerged and spread worldwide in human beings and that is currently well adapted to both human and swine populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638712466554">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638712466554">27</xref></sup> In addition, the endemic swine H1N1 virus had been reported in 1 human case in 2005 in Thailand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712466554">16</xref></sup> Moreover, sera from rabbit inoculated with pH1N1-09 showed no cross antibody reactivity to other Thai swine H1N1 viruses, and all sera tested in the present study had no cross-reactivity to pH1N1-09 (unpublished data). Hence, the HI test using pH1N1-09 virus antigen could be applied for the pandemic H1N1 2009 infected pig detection retrospectively. For HA H3 subtype, 7 out of 8 major potential immunodominant positions were different between swH3N2-05 and swH3N2-07<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712466554">19</xref></sup> and showed no cross-reactivity. Again, the swine H1 viruses have similar PIRs with the exception of pH1N1. In addition, swH1N1-06 virus showed one-way cross-reactivity to other swine H1 viruses. Such results could possibly be from the change of 4 amino acid residues on the proposed antigenic site of the HA1 region (Ca141, Cb73, Sa162, and Sa155). Although, changing amino acid residue may have less affect on protein function, many factors related to binding ability of antibody and antigen such as protein sequences and conformation may have an impact on HI test results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638712466554">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, results of the current study demonstrated that at least 5 clusters of SIVs circulated in Thailand had a high prevalence of antibodies against H3N2 virus during the study period. In addition, general SIV data including genetic characterization, virology, and serology are of importance for disease diagnosis, prevention, and control in order to reduce spreading to human beings and other species. Due to the limited genetic, virologic, and serologic data on Thai SIVs in the past 10 years, the results from the present study provide necessary data for better disease diagnosis of Thai SIVs. Such data can be modified for SIV diagnosis in other countries as well. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of <italic>Influenza A virus</italic> is necessary for pandemic influenza preparedness especially in the pig population. Because evidence of interspecies transmission between human and pig populations is occasionally reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712466554">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712466554">14</xref></sup> the effectiveness of an influenza surveillance control and prevention program must focus on pig surveillance. In addition, using a suitable antigen in diagnostic tests is recommended to demonstrate the true local SIV status. The results of the current study demonstrated that HI tests should be implemented for SIV serosurveillance using suitable local strains, and that test antigens and routine diagnostic tests should be evaluated regularly as well as genetic monitoring in the endemic area.</p>
