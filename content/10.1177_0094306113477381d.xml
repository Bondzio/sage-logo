<p>Why does conflict occur? Why are some conflicts worse than others? Donald Black articulates his theory of moral time to answer these and <italic>many</italic> other questions in <italic>Moral Time</italic>. Black begins by introducing us to his concept of social time, “a distinctively and purely sociological form of time: <italic>Social time is the dynamic dimension of social space</italic>” (pp. 3–4). After equating social time with social space, Black uses this new concept of social space/time to further claim that “<italic>The fundamental cause of conflict is the movement of social time</italic>” (p. 4). Social time is then defined along three axes: relational distance, vertical distance, and cultural distance. Relational distance is articulated through discussions of areas like intimacy, vertical distance through inequality in wealth or authority, and cultural distance through differences in religion or ethnicity. After a very brief/thin introduction to these new concepts, Black uses evidence and anecdote to lead us through a wide-ranging discussion that weaves together topics like rape, crime, virtue, injustice, class, art, adultery, secrecy, lying, witchcraft, health, religion, and more under the umbrella of his pure sociology. He concludes with a brave fight against his spell checker, claiming that conflict is a direct function of (1) overintimacy, (2) underintimacy, (3) overstratification, (4) understratification, (5) overdiversity, and (6) underdiversity, and a final discussion of conflict in tribal, modern, and postmodern societies.</p>
<p><italic>Moral Time</italic> seeks to offer us a new and different way to look at the world sociologically. In some ways, Black has succeeded in this goal as he articulates a language through which conflict can be understood as emerging from a change or a movement in social space/time and morality can be understood as forbidding these movements or changes. If one can accept Black’s language then there is little of the theoretical premise to dispute—change and conflict go hand in hand.</p>
<p>This is where the greatest shortcoming of this work emerges. <italic>Moral Time</italic> adds little to our understanding of the social world. For instance, Black claims early on that “[b]ecause every form of social control is a movement of social time, social control also causes conflict” (p. 9). There is nothing new or unique about the claim that social control causes conflict, Black just adds complexity by inserting social time into the equation with no clear reasoning for why it adds to our understanding. Instead of clarifying how exactly conflict occurs, Black has obfuscated conflict by adding confusing language that equates social change with social space with social time.</p>
<p>If Black spent time discussing these concepts and engaging with the literature, <italic>Moral Time</italic> would be a far better work of theory. Instead, he cherry picks literature that fits his framework, does little to clarify his new confusing concepts, and writes off huge swaths of theory grounded in research with a few brief sentences. The constructionist view of the world, for instance, is incorrect because it makes the world look arbitrary. Instead of engaging with constructionist viewpoints in order to articulate a better approach, Black offers the reader a caricature of constructionism and moves on to other issues. As he works through the central chapters, he makes this same move over and over again; any explanation that might not fit within his framework is shown to be wrong within a few sentences and his theory proven correct with a few anecdotes.</p>
<p>This rather brief and extremely thin coverage of the issues under discussion in <italic>Moral Time</italic> regularly left me disappointed. One of the more egregious claims Black makes, for instance, is that homosexual men face more ire from society than homosexual women because men have sex with strangers more frequently than women. For Black, this is not at all a question of heteronormativity; instead, he says this overintimacy in homosexual men creates more conflict and then he moves on to other issues.</p>
<p>The imperialism of <italic>Moral Time</italic> shines most clearly in the concluding chapter where he resurrects an old, tired distinction between tribal, modern, and postmodern morality. This concluding chapter would feel disconnected from the rest of the book if it did not so clearly bring together the imperialism of the framework. Through his attempt to articulate a grand explanation covering all conflict in all cultures at all times, Black gives us a thin analysis. He initially tells the reader that he will be offering a social scientific explanation for conflict, but in the end it seems like he has written off most of social science as wrong and offers explanations that, supported or not, are written to feel like unreflexive anecdotes.</p>
<p>My overall impression of Black’s pure sociology framework is that it is so malleable it could fit anything, so loose it could be shaped to any issue. In order to make a framework so malleable, Black had to create a malleable language. Once the language is in place, one who accepts it and uses it can apply it to any situation they like. In this attempt to explain everything, the book fails to explain anything at all.</p>
<p>Finally, to add to the confusion created by inserting new concepts into well-articulated social processes with little explanation or attention to context, the content of the book itself is only about 150 pages long but has a full 46 pages of footnotes, offering the reader 67 footnotes from page 3 to page 16 alone! While one might hope these footnotes are helpful, they largely link you to another reference section—so have fun connecting footnotes with sources!</p>
