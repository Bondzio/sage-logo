<p>This is a peculiar book. It has been subjected to the indignity of hand-written corrections; its references are often out of sequence, the numbers in the text not corresponding to the numbers in the footnotes; and it sometimes descends into banalities, such as, ‘In the church as a whole apostles seem to have had a special authority.’ (p. 82)</p>
<p>Yet it addresses important issues. For example, Lee returns repeatedly to the question of the canon. He never escapes, however, from the idea that it was a creation of the church, which ‘chose’ the books and ‘formed’ the canon. There is no reference to the alternative view that the canon imposed itself on the church through the witness of the Holy Spirit; and while the criterion of ‘apostolicity’ might work well enough for Mark and Luke it is more problematical for Hebrews (and, possibly, Revelation and 2 Peter; and this is before we even mention the Pastorals).</p>
<p>Lee also raises the question of the authority of the interpretative tradition, particularly the extent to which it is compromised by cultural relativism. In the scientific world, the most recent is the most authoritative, but this can hardly apply in theology. Nineham cannot be promoted above Athanasius simply on chronological grounds. More important, as Lee recognises, the very notion of an interpretative tradition presupposes a cut-off point at which authoritative development ceases and we are left with ‘the faith once delivered to the saints’. What follows thereafter is interpretation, which is authoritative only in proportion to its faithfulness to the canon. The theologically ‘new’ (which is always possible) must arise out of the original divine self-disclosure.</p>
<p>Alongside the canon and the interpretative tradition Lee sets the authority of the church universal (all the faithful baptised throughout the world and down the ages). This takes us back to the 5th century Vincentian Canon, according to which the test of a doctrine was whether it had been believed ‘everywhere, always and by all’. Such agreement is a useful indicator of the hierarchy of truths: the things on which Athanasius, Calvin and Wesley are agreed are more fundamental than the things that divide them. But as Lee recognises (p. 120), ‘it has not always been majorities who have been found to be right in the long term’. Tragically, too, some of the fissures that run through the church (for example, episcopacy and infant baptism) are now unbridgeable. The absence of consensus may be taken as proof that these are secondary issues, yet they form a serious barrier to ‘life together’.</p>
<p>What of the authority of councils and synods? Most Christians recognise the authority of the great ecumenical councils, but, as Lee reminds us, there is no agreement as to which councils were in fact ecumenical. Nor is it possible in the divided state of the church today to convene any such council; and while local or national synods may serve useful administrative purposes, they are hardly in a position to formulate doctrine. Even the ecumenical councils have no inherent authority. They were never more than part of the interpretative tradition.</p>
<p>What is on offer here is a useful collection of questions out of which a more focused book might one day come.</p>
