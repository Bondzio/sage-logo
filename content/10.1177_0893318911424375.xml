<p>Amidst enormous economic uncertainty, rising levels of inequality, and steady declines in state funding for social services, nonprofit organizations provide increasingly critical social, political, and economic goods and services. Scholars have long recognized the centrality of nonprofit labor to our collective well-being. However, because nonprofits are so closely associated with civil society, and bound up in notions of the public good, research tends to minimize critical issues of power and control. The development of richer theories of nonprofits must include a sustained focus on how communication and organizing are inextricably linked with power. Such a focus highlights the need to understand nonprofits politically. Three interrelated areas ripe for increased critical attention include (a) the contested nature of “nonprofit” categorizations, (b) the status of nonprofit work and compensation, and (c) problems of accountability and representation.</p>
<p>First, the very categorization of nonprofit organizations as a cohesive category of similar organizations minimizes meaningful differences. The category “nonprofit” is problematic because it belies the contingent nexus of economic, political, and social relations that these organizations differentially navigate. For example, in the U.S. context, the term <italic>nonprofit</italic> reflects a legal designation originating from the 1969 Tax Reform Act. This legislation attempted to rationalize the process of philanthropy, requiring compliance with complex reporting and tax laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911424375">Hall, 1992</xref>). One outcome of these regulations has been that U.S.-based nonprofit organizations are required to demonstrate fiscal responsibility in perhaps unique ways. Legal classifications spurred the development of special expertise, in turn creating a new class of professional managers. The rise in nonprofit standards of behavior, a body of professional literature on nonprofit management, and the establishment of training programs each reflect a particular type of increased professionalization and formalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911424375">Hall, 1992</xref>). Such histories and relationships between nonprofit organizations and the nation-state meaningfully shape the very nature of nonprofit-ness across political contexts.</p>
<p>A related issue deserving attention includes the various ways in which nonprofits are positioned in relation to the market and commercializing interests. Research often assumes nonprofits provide a critical check on corporate power, for example, lobbying shareholders to enact meaningful social and environmental commitments. Here, nonprofits tend to be understood as vital alternatives to corporate public relations and marketing; nonprofit campaigns highlight labor and environmental violations and conduct research in the public interest. However, the understanding of nonprofit organizations as “sacred spaces” set apart from market forces requires challenging. The rapid growth of social entrepreneurship and cause marketing all point to the increasingly blurry boundaries between nonprofits and corporations. Nonprofits problematically exert agency through their partnerships with corporations and funding agencies. They are not exempt from forms of corporate colonization, including their own problematic divisions of labor and forms of compensation. Importantly, nonprofits also differ in terms of the extent to which they emerge from, and are led by, those directly experiencing the social problem being addressed by the organization. While many nonprofits identify with the grassroots, such claims deserve critical attention. In problematic cases, nonprofits function as self-elected representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911424375">Dempsey, 2011</xref>). A fruitful area for future research, then, includes highlighting meaningful differences within and across nonprofits, including a greater understanding of how nonprofits are constituted within a contingent field of economic, political, and social relations.</p>
<p>Second, while much research has rightfully focused on the voluntary relationships that are so prominent in the nonprofit sector, nonprofits are simultaneously vital sources of paid employment. As such, they prompt important questions about the nature and status of nonprofit work, including the division of nonprofit labor and compensation. Within organization studies more broadly, there has been a concerted effort to better understand the differential impacts on the nature of work and employment amidst corporate globalization, new information and communication technologies, and changing modes of governance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911424375">Ashcraft, 2006</xref>). The concept of “precarity” has emerged as a powerful way to understand contemporary employment relations increasingly characterized by declining employee attachment, long-term employment, greater job insecurity, and the normalization of nonstandard forms of employment, including temporary, itinerant, and part-time work. Precarious work is uncertain, unpredictable, and risky from the point of view of the worker and is understood as becoming increasingly central to more and more job sectors and occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911424375">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>). There exists an overlapping need for nonprofit researchers to maintain a tight focus on the changing employment conditions and practices constituting nonprofit organizations, including the extent to which nonprofit work is rendered increasingly precarious for workers. Such a move is particularly warranted given the tendency to see the nonprofit sector as a key place to pursue meaningful work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911424375">Dempsey &amp; Sanders, 2010</xref>). Approaching nonprofit work through the lens of precarity draws attention to the need for research addressing the nature and status of underpaid and unpaid labor, including how nonprofit work may be devalued.</p>
<p>Third, nonprofits can be largely defined by their communicative labor, whereby professionalized members represent on the behalf of sometimes distant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911424375">Dempsey, 2009</xref>). Professionalized nonprofits often have a disproportionate ability to speak on the behalf of others, shaping public understandings of social problems and advocating for preferred solutions. Nonprofits are increasingly important sites in which critical decisions about social problems are made; this ability to represent deserves careful attention. Nonprofits are political actors, in so far as they produce and circulate images of social problems and their solutions, assign praise and blame, and represent the concerns of groups with limited access to the public sphere.</p>
<p>Increased critical attention to the communicative labor of nonprofits provides a particularly productive entry point for communication scholars. A focus on the production, distribution, and effects of communicative labor places organizational communication processes at the center of nonprofit studies. A communicative labor lens depicts nonprofit participants as being centrally involved in the work of communicating social problems and their solutions. Much research is needed to better understand the politics of their communicative labor, including how nonprofits mobilize discourses, and how these discourses themselves carry their own sets of politics and forms of power.</p>
<p>In summary, I have argued for the need to understand nonprofits politically, and to move toward greater engagement with the politics of nonprofit communication. Such a research agenda calls for, at the very least, increased critical attention to the very category of “nonprofit,” including important differences across and within economic, political, and social relations. Developing this critical agenda also calls for increased attention to recent trends toward nonprofit marketization, including the politics of corporate sponsorships, and the corporate colonization of social change initiatives. There also exists a need for greater attention to the nature and status of nonprofit employment relations, including the extent to which nonprofit work is rendered increasingly precarious. Such a focus would usefully complicate taken for granted accounts of nonprofit work as enriching, meaningful work. A final area ripe for analysis includes problems of accountability and representation. In particular, increased attention to the politics of communicative labor highlights the tension-filled work involved with advocating on the behalf of others. These nonprofit representational practices—including the material conditions of their production and circulation—deserve greater critical attention.</p>
