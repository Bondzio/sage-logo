<p>When the Gestapo called to take away retired opera singer Therese Rothauser, she made one final request of the Gestapo officials. Explaining that she wished to bid her piano farewell, she took her seat at the piano and sang a song, while the officials removed their hats and listened. Therese, a Jewess by birth, had written to Hermann Göring asking to be added to his list of cherished artists who should be spared deportation. Her request went unheeded however, and following her deportation to Theresienstadt on 21 August 1942, she died in April the next year. This poignant tale is one of many told in <italic>Jews in Nazi Berlin</italic>, which shines the spotlight on the experiences of persecution in the Reichshauptstadt. Before the Nazi seizure of power, Berlin was home to the largest Jewish population in Germany. A resident population of 160,000 Jews at the start of the 1930s, this was dramatically reduced to 8000 by the end of World War Two. Despite this, little academic research has been carried out into what it was like for Jews to be living in Berlin at this time. This collection of articles focuses in particular on the experiences of Jews who remained in Berlin after the major waves of expulsion and deportation had taken place.</p>
<p>Probably most familiar in our narrative of the twisted path to Auschwitz is the escalating discrimination against German Jews during the 1930s, with the introduction of the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935 and the violence of Kristallnacht in November 1938, culminating in the deportation of Jews to the East from late 1941. Particularly memorable signs of discrimination are the yellow stars which Jews had to wear, the signs outside Jewish shops telling people not to go in, and park benches marked with ‘Juden verboten’ (Jews forbidden). Albert Meirer’s contribution shows other, less well-known ways in which Jews were harassed, revealing just how needlessly vindictive Nazi policies were. Not content simply to make Germany ‘judenfrei’ (free of Jews) as quickly as possible, the Nazi leadership sought to persecute Jews in as cruel and humiliating a way as possible. Take, for example, the requisitioning of all Jewish-owned radios. Not only were Jews forced to hand over their radios in September 1939, they were also required to take them in person on a specific day, chosen by the Nazi leadership to be Yom Kippur, one of the most important days in the Jewish calendar. Similarly vindictive was the announcement at the beginning of 1942 that Jews had to hand over all woollen clothing. Even if these garments had been intended for German soldiers in the field, the regulations were deliberately complicated and difficult to follow, leading to the arrest of many Jewish men and women for violating them.</p>
<p>In light of this catalogue of persecution, it is safe to say that while there are many points of contention within the historiography of Nazi Germany, Jewish victimhood is understandably not considered to be one of them. <italic>Jews in Nazi Berlin</italic> however, muddies the water of common assumptions whereby there were cold-blooded Nazis and innocent Jewish victims. By moving beyond this familiar dichotomy, it shows how Jews remaining in Berlin from 1943 were sometimes forced to walk a moral tightrope between protecting fellow Jews and collaboration with the Nazis. It was the Jewish community itself, Christian Dirks shows, which was forced to arrange the deportations of Jews. We hear from Paul Scheurenberg, a former transport marshal, who explained that marshals risked deportation themselves if they did not comply with orders. Indeed he recalled an occasion where a deportee had run off, and two marshals were put on the transport as ‘replacements’. At the same time, the Gestapo instituted a Search Service intended to root out Jews hiding underground. Offering select Jews the chance for them and their families to be spared deportation, the Gestapo demanded in return that they help to round up the remaining Jews. Some Jews refused to be corrupted and were deported, others committed suicide, but around 18 Jews worked as spies for the Gestapo. The Reichsvereinigung, the only institution in Nazi Germany representing Jewish interests, also faced a moral quandary. Since the Gestapo was its supervisory body, the Reichsvereinigung had limited power to protect Jews. In working with the regime, it sought to ‘do as much good as possible for those concerned’, but in reality, as Beate Meyer points out, ‘the representatives became entangled in the Nazi policy of extermination, for which they were at the same time not responsible’.</p>
<p>This collection is thought-provoking and well-written. There is some repetition between chapters, and the decision to launch the Final Solution is assumed throughout to have been taken at the beginning of the war, when in fact the timing is still very much hotly debated. Overall though, it covers important but hitherto overlooked aspects of Jewish persecution in Nazi Germany.</p>
