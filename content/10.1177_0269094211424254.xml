<p>The importance of rural transport in addressing social exclusion has been acknowledged for some time. We report and comment on one particular case in North Yorkshire, a predominantly rural county in England, of how state, non-state and third/societal sectors worked together to market and improve public transport links and reduce social exclusion. The article examines the outcomes of a SIS (Stimulating Innovation for Success) project: a leisure-based public transport network located in North Yorkshire. It comments on the efficacy of this relationship and in particular with one agency, the Dales and Bowland Community Interest Company.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Services to help people with multiple needs and exclusions exist but only in limited geographical areas. How can the provision of services expand to help those most in need? (Rt Hon Hilary Armstrong, former UK Minister for Social Exclusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424254">Armstrong, 2010</xref>: 25)</p>
<p>Volunteering should be promoted by the Government as an end in itself … Government should broker ways to help charities and small community groups tap into the business, financial, and fundraising expertise they need … Community Interest Companies are a new, innovative and successful business model which should be promoted more strongly as a means of making community activity self-financing and sustainable … Social enterprises often manage to succeed in areas where both public and private business models continue to fail. (Rt Hon David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424254">Blunkett, 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These two quotations, emanating from prominent UK Labour politicians, exemplify the significance of volunteering and third-sector activity to deliver what were traditionally ‘publicly provided’ services, as well as enhance services for socially excluded individuals and groups with multiple needs. The Blunkett statement confirms the importance of Community Interest Companies (CICs) as vehicles for creating sustainable and self-financing community development initiatives. The 2010 UK Coalition Government has embraced this concept with its ‘Big Society’ proposals.</p>
<p>The importance of rural transport in addressing social exclusion has been acknowledged for some time. The aim of the article is to report and comment on one particular case in North Yorkshire, a predominantly rural county in England, of how state, non-state and third/societal sectors work together to market and improve public transport links and reduce social exclusion. The article comments on the efficacy of this relationship and on one agency in particular, the Dales and Bowland Community Interest Company (DBCIC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211424254"><title>Theoretical basis</title>
<p>Theoretically and conceptually the article is set within a context of the broader political agenda to address social exclusion in deprived areas. It is underpinned by partnership and stakeholder theory and illustrates how state and non-state actors and agencies worked in collaboration to market and improve public transport links.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094211424254"><title>Third sector and partnerships</title>
<p>The adoption of partnership working and involvement of the third sector was part of New Labour’s ‘re-fashioned ideology of social democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094211424254">Whitehead, 2007</xref>: 6) and sustained interest in the sector as a partner in governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211424254">Chapman et al., 2008</xref>). This theme was given greater impetus when, shortly after achieving power the then Labour Government took the unprecedented step of announcing a compact between government and the third sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094211424254">Smith, 2010</xref>: 48–65). It represented the first attempt to mainstream the third sector into the Government’s public policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094211424254">Kendall, 2000</xref>). Although as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094211424254">Diamond (2010)</xref> suggests, the UK Government’s explicit promotion of the third sector, to encapsulate a host of community sector organizations, revealed a narrow and poorly developed understanding of the sector; nevertheless for social democrats, argues Diamond, social democracy remains high up the political agenda as a means of addressing some of the social exclusion and poverty issues. Clearly, social democracy is not a shared aspiration of all.</p>
<p>However, there are numerous barriers to overcome in bringing socially excluded individuals/groups and voluntary/community/third sector organizations into delivering public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094211424254">Mayo and Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094211424254">Taylor, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Putting the community at the heart of policy is central to the new Coalition Government’s replacement of the Office of Third Sector (OTS) with the Office of Civil Society (OCS) and reflected in Ministerial statements and guidance notes, under the umbrella of the Big Society. The ideas underpinning the Big Society are yet to be fully fleshed out, but in essence it aims to promote community involvement in decision making, and to foster community/social enterprise. It may be suggested that not only are these aims unrealistic but that the Big Society isa romanticized version of old neo-liberal aversion to the state and is a foil for shrouding the unpopularity of public spending cuts articulated in the public demonstrations of 2011. An IPPR Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094211424254">Cox and Schmueker, 2010</xref>) is one of the first, and important, contributions to the debate on what exactly the Big Society means.</p>
<p>The Compact, which outlines how the voluntary and public sectors should behave towards each other, was established in 1998 and updated in 2009. The Coalition Government and Compact Voice, which represents the voluntary sector on Compact issues, recently renewed the agreement. The new version was published in November 2010 and contains 37 key principles.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0269094211424254"><title>Social enterprise</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094211424254">Somerville and McElwee (2011)</xref> note that social enterprise is a comparatively recent term in public policy literature. References to the third sector, community enterprises and worker cooperatives are championed by the European Union as a means to tackle some of the challenges of globalization such as rising unemployment, poverty and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094211424254">Mawson, 2010</xref>). In 1989 a Social Economy Unit was established at European level to foster all types of community and social enterprises that might respond to unmet social needs, often through collaborative community activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094211424254">Molloy et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The current economic downturn has brought into sharp focus the imperative for sustainable communities; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094211424254">Kagan (2007)</xref> suggests, the quest has been dominated by the establishment of inter-organizational and inter-agency partnerships, which offer new organizational forms, possibilities and challenges. Across the public, private and third sectors a reduction in public expenditure, constrained private investment and a general slowdown in activity will critically impact on localities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094211424254">Liddle, 2009</xref>). All governments desperately seek answers to the problems of the economic downturn, financial constraints and potential social disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094211424254">Liddle, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In different national contexts, the key non-governmental agents of civil society are variously referred to as non-profit sector, voluntary and community sector or third sector economy.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years an extensive body of research has developed concerned with changing relationships between the state and non-governmental agencies in the UK, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094211424254">Osborne et al., 2008</xref>). The creation of a wide body of theory has further enhanced our understanding of the importance of non-governmental agencies delivering public services (Chew and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211424254">Osborne, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094211424254"><title>New Public Governance</title>
<p>New Public Governance (NPG), with its emphasis on a <italic>pluralist</italic> state and multiple processes informing the policy-making system, and a <italic>plural</italic> state, where multiple interdependent actors contribute to public service delivery, evolved from earlier concepts of traditional public administration (PA) and the transitory stage of New Public Management (NPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094211424254">Osborne, 2009</xref>). Service delivery and policy making were radically re-interpreted with the shift from ‘top-down’ policy processes as negotiation, it was argued, became essential between a variety of stakeholders. For effective delivery, services should no longer restsolely with managers; rather the aim isto move towards co-production with users and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211424254">Bovaird, 2007</xref>). To overcome fragmentation of public service organizations, co-production should act as a useful integrative mechanism for service planning, <italic>commissioning</italic>, management, delivery, monitoring and evaluation. As part of overall service provision, <italic>commissioning</italic> is an important ingredient that also requires trusting relationships between actors who self-organize and negotiate new rules, norms and institutional frameworks. Therefore, existing, outdated conceptions of service planning and delivery are no longer appropriate to modern day service provision, but what is needed is a new public service ethos of the Compact in which public sector professionals support, encourage and coordinate the co-productive capacities of service users and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211424254">Bovaird, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for a Compact between the Government and the third sector was first developed in the UK but has also been used as a model in several Eastern European countries as well as Canada and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211424254">Lyons, 2002</xref>). In Canada Compacts began to take shape from the mid-1990s onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211424254">Lyons, 2002</xref>) as a means for promoting the concept of third sector within government departments, including a place in policy making, capacity building and proposals for output-based performance measurement<bold>.</bold> In Australia, some attempt was made at a state level and by individual government departments to improve engagement with the third sector. However, despite the existence of several of the preconditions for involvement, there was not a coordinated government approach nor a coordinated third sector response and the potential for developing and growing a similar relationship with the third sector looked unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094211424254">Lyons, 2002</xref>). Both Canada and England had entered into national bilateral voluntary sector-government policy agreements<bold>.</bold> The Canadian Accord, like the UK Compact, is a framework agreement which outlines a shared vision, values, general principles and a mutual commitment to building a positive future relationship toward common purposes.</p>
<p>The UK Government had established the Office for the Third Sector, based in the Cabinet Office in 2006,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094211424254">1</xref></sup> to lead work across government to support the environment for a thriving third sector (voluntary and community groups, social enterprises, charities, cooperatives and mutuals), enabling the sector to campaign for change, deliver public services, promote social enterprise and strengthen communities. The ‘third sector’ was defined as encompassing all non-governmental agencies/bodies that principally reinvest surpluses in the communities or organizations and seek to deliver social or environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211424254">CLG, 2007</xref>). This commitment to greater engagement of the third sector is based on the need to give voice to a wider range of stakeholders/agencies and partners in designing, delivering and measuring services, but also to widen the choice of providers of services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094211424254"><title>Stakeholders</title>
<p>Stakeholders can be defined as ‘any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424254">Freeman, 1984</xref>: 46). Thus, stakeholders are agents or classes of agents, such as employees, managers, suppliers, funders, owners and consumers (service users in the public organization’s domain), who have a stake in the organization’s objectives and without whose support the organization would cease to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424254">Freeman, 1984</xref>). Stakeholders canalso be classified as: primary—those that have formal, official and contractual relationships with the organization; and secondary—those not directly related to the organization, but, nonetheless able to exert some sort of influence upon the organization or even be influenced by it.</p>
<p>As examples of stakeholders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094211424254">Freeman (1984)</xref> suggests customers, employees, shareholders, stockholders, government, local community, suppliers, partners and competitors. As stakeholders of public organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424254">Bryson (1995</xref>) proposes the following list: citizens; taxpayers; service users; the different tiers of government; employees; trade unions; interest groups; political parties; the financial community; the business community; and other entities and spheres of influence in government. Some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424254">Bryson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094211424254">Hood, 1995</xref>) advocate the inclusion of stakeholders’ expectations in the performance evaluation of public organizations. In this sense, satisfying stakeholders should be the target of successful public managers, who therefore need to know exactly who their stakeholders are and what they expect from the organization in terms of performance and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211424254">Bryson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>As we will see stakeholder groups were very significant to the success of DBCIC.</p>
<p>We now define our key terms: social exclusion, access and rural transport.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094211424254"><title>Social exclusion and transport</title>
<p>Two key policy documents relating to transport and social exclusion have framed the debate on transport and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094211424254">Titheridge, 2008</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094211424254">DETR/TRac (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094211424254">Social Exclusion Unit (2003)</xref> policies address the role of transport in reducing social exclusion, and the existence and accessibility of services. Social exclusion is greatest amongst unemployed and elderly people but other groups are excluded from social and leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094211424254">Scottish Executive Central Research Unit, 2009</xref>). Transport deprivation, i.e. lack of access to affordable and timely transport, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094211424254">Mackey et al. (2004)</xref> and supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094211424254">Shucksmith (2000)</xref> is a perennial issue in rural areas, with many people having no access to any mode of transport.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is evidenced across the UK. For example, Northern Ireland’s Rural Transport Initiative is tackling social exclusion in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094211424254">Transport 21, 2006</xref>) and the Northern Ireland Rural Women’s Network examined access to transport for women in rural areas in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094211424254">NIRWN, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094211424254">Coleman et al. (2003)</xref> find that the take up of education in Further Education (FE) Colleges is hampered by a lack of information on transport facilities and long journey times; FE students in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire face a daily four-hour round trip by bus to their nearest college.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0269094211424254"><title>Accessibility</title>
<p>Accessibility is a mainstream policy goal in the UK Government’s aims of achieving greater social justice and social inclusion. Access can be conceptualized as ‘absolute’, i.e. limited access in one particular rural location, or in relative terms, i.e. limited relative to other regions. However ‘access’ is defined, ‘it must be connected to individual needs, rights, wants and deserts’ Farrington and Farrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094211424254">2005</xref>: 10). Clearly, access ison the policy agenda as all English LocalTransport Plans address the issues of socially excluded groups, promoting access and improving environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094211424254">Lancashire County Council (2010)</xref>, for example, has a clearly defined policy. Other authorities, such as London Transport’s Capital have linked transport and social exclusion, developed indicators of access to activities and services, and identified the need to combat social constraints placed on individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211424254">Church et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Voluntary organizations such as the UK National Cycle Network (SUSTRANS) contribute to societal welfare through such initiatives as health improvements, social inclusion, regenerating economies and providing an alternative to environmentally damaging transport. It also enhances economic opportunities for recreation, leisure and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094211424254">Cope and Lumsdon, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094211424254"><title>Rural transport</title>
<p>Rural transport priorities are heavily skewed towards the provision of school transport asthis is a statutory duty given the distancesinvolved between home and school. Journeys to work and to access health and shopping facilities (often only on one day per week, market day in the nearest market town) are the next but much lower priorities, with voluntary car schemes often being used for journeys to hospital outpatient appointments, leaving transport to access leisure facilities (including access to the countryside from adjacent urban areas and the ability for rural residents to access employment in the associated leisure and tourism industry) as the lowest priority.</p>
<p>Local authority boundaries between rural and urban areas often mean that neither authority takes responsible for such cross-boundary services; in the past many National Park Authorities had a limited budget to support such services but budget cuts of 25 percent have led to such support ceasing in most cases. The necessary placement journeys associated with these services often provided journey to work opportunities for rural residents.</p>
<p>Leisure trips in England constitute 40 percent of all distances travelled and constitute 30 percent of total trips whilst walking for leisure is the main activity undertaken on 36 percent of day trips to the English countryside and 18 percent of the 3.6bn day trips made in England each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094211424254">Natural England, 2006</xref>). The benefits to the rural economy generated by users of these services are greater than the costs due to local multipliers and the effects on health, reduction in emissions and congestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094211424254">Guiver, 1993</xref>). Research undertaken by the University of Central Lancashire for the DBCIC in 2010 showed that the average expenditure by a visitor to the countryside by bus was £13.30. With the average DalesBus subsidy of £2.46 per journey in 2010, this gives aBCR (benefit to cost ratio) for a return journey to the Dales of 2.6.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of marketing a growing network of services, DBCIC bid for a SIS Project in early 2009 in conjunction with Nottingham Business School. SIS is an academic enterprise programme supporting the exploitation and development of new ideas, funded by the UK Higher Education Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>The SIS Project markets the DalesBus network to increase patronage and to attract new customers, especially younger people, students and members of the socially deprived and ethnic minority populations of the Leeds City Region and Bradford Metropolitan areas. The objective was to establish an efficient cost-effective marketing strategy for DBCIC using suitable media and to expand the customer base. It is also intended that the marketing strategy takes advantage of the voluntary assistance available to distribute publicity by hand to local shops, libraries, information centres, tourist attractions, accommodation providers, pubs, cafes and churches.</p>
<p>The SIS Project devised and supported the operation of new Summer Wednesday direct ‘Dales Experience’ buses from Bradford to the Dales, tailored to attract low income families and ethnic minorities to experience the countryside around them. The project coordinated events at destinations run by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority and National Trust together with volunteer-led guided walks and some events resourced using members of the SIS Project and their families.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0269094211424254" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>As part of the SIS Project, primary data were collected from users by means of 20 semi-structured interviews conducted on the return journey of Dales Experience buses to Bradford and with conversations with stakeholders. These interviews enabled participants to reflect upon the activities undertaken during the day and demonstrated the importance of organized events to infrequent visitors to the countryside; some adult participants had never visited the Dales despite being born and living their entire life less than 30 miles away.</p>
<p>Views were collected from one member of each family or friendship group and the number in each group together with their ages and ethnic background noted. The research examined barriers to visiting the Dales and the importance of providing short guided walks and nature observation events; one third of interviewees had access to a car but had never considered using it to visit the Dales, whilst few interviewees had realized that rural bus services existed and were affordable.</p>
<p>The primary data were discussed by stakeholders at the end of the season and taken into account in planning an expanded programme in 2010, leading to several of 60 recommendations to DBCIC contained in the marketing strategy. All of the stakeholders agreed the recommendations based on results derived from the primary data. A SWOT analysis of the results was compiled.</p>
<p>The CIC accepted and implemented more than half of these recommendations in 2010; a few recommendations were rejected due to philanthropic ideals whilst others were deferred due to practicality and voluntary time constraints.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0269094211424254"><title>An appraisal</title>
<p>In view of the economic downturn and unprecedented large budget reductions imposed by the Coalition Government, many transport authorities are faced with a dilemma as they try to maintain vital but lightly used rural bus services within diminishing budgets. Once essential journeys for access to educational, health, employment and shopping facilities have been provided, there is likely to be little funding remaining for weekend leisure journeys. Reducing the journeys operated increases the proportionate fixed costs per trip (for both operator and authority) and makes the operation less attractive and economic for many potential operators. Reduced tender bids are received, accompanied by reduced service quality and increased subsidy levels per passenger; the Cairngorms Heather Hopper services in 2009 required £78 subsidy per passenger and, whilst this is atypical, many rural bus services require subsidies approaching £10 per passenger journey. Local authorities across the UK are faced with making critical choices about how rural travel is resourced and financed.</p>
<p>This scenario prevailed in the Yorkshire Dales (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094211424254">Figure 1</xref> for map of the area) for many years, with reductions in the budgets of North Yorkshire County Council (NYCC) and Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority (YDNPA) leading to the loss of many Sunday bus services which brought visitors and their spending power to the Dales from the West Yorkshire conurbation.
<fig id="fig1-0269094211424254" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Yorkshire Dales.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094211424254-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In 2008 funding from YDNPA threatened to dry up completely and the NYCC budget was only sufficient to provide a skeletal service which few passengers would find attractive. At this point the DBCIC secured a unique rescue bid which has rejuvenated the DalesBus network, growing passenger numbers by 54 percent in 2009 with further 31 percent growth in 2010, reducing passenger subsidy from £6 in 2006 when the services were public sector managed to just £2.46 in 2010–11 and introducing new services and initiatives within existing budgets. DBCIC has achieved this by using knowledgeable and enthusiastic professional volunteers to manage the network, and by drawing upon funding from a variety of partners and sources.</p>
<p>DBCIC is a not-for-profit organization owned by the Yorkshire Dales Society, a registered charity, and established in 2007 in conjunction with the Yorkshire Dales Public Transport Users Group to restore the Ilkley to Skipton Sunday bus service, now branded as CravenLink and a well-established all year round Sunday bus service used by local residents and visitors with bus and train connections at Ilkley and Skipton to Leeds and Bradford. Directors of the DBCIC include transport professionals, academics and a former Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT) President (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094211424254">Disney and Speakman, 2009</xref>), whilst volunteers from the Users Group distribute publicity and lead guided walks for bus users.</p>
<p>A CIC is a limited liability company with the specific aim of providing benefit to a community, combining the pursuit of a social purpose with commercial activities. It is incorporated under the Companies Act 1985 by the Registrar of Companies and conforms to the same company and insolvency laws as any other UK company. CICs can be companies limited by guarantee or limited by shares. A CIC limited by guarantee is a not-for-profit company. CICs can take advantage of the risk-taking features of a company such as accessing the debt market for loans and bonds or by selling additional shares (if limited by shares).</p>
<p>A CIC can be readily set up because the UK Registrar provides model memorandum and articles of association, which include an asset lock. The asset lock prevents the CIC from giving away its assets for less than the true market value, except where the assets are transferred to another asset locked body such as a charity or another CIC, or used to benefit the community which it was set up to serve. The asset lock provides legal protection against demutualization and windfall profits being paid to members and directors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094211424254">Regulator of Community Interest Companies, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>2000 CICs now exist, representing a huge growth since their inception in 2005. Although only 1 percent of these are specifically transport related, many others encompass transport within their remit.</p>
<p>DBCIC contracts out services to commercial bus operators ranging from AS Coaches, an example of a diversified farm business, to multinational Arriva, rather than owning and operating its own buses. New funding was secured from diverse bodies including Metro Nidderdale AONB; train operator Northern; Natural England; Friends of the Settle-Carlisle Line (FoSCL) and some visitor attractions, in addition to continued funding from NYCC and YDNPA.</p>
<p>DBCIC is keen to address social inclusion with services and promotions targeted at residents of socially deprived areas and students and other young people. Metrocard commuter season tickets are valid on DalesBus services from West Yorkshire, giving commuters the opportunity to experience the countryside at weekends without needing to own a car. Most fares for 2010 and 2011 were pegged at or below 2008 levels despite the low reimbursement rate for concessionary fares which has not been compensated by increased loadings due to capacity constraints on some routes and unprecedented increases in fuel costs.</p>
<p>In 2008–9 DBCIC carried over 13,000 passengers with a budget of £80 k. In 2009–10 it grew this to over 20,000 passengers with a similar budget and in 2010–11 it exceeded 26,000 passengers with new services from York increasing its catchment area. It also provides essential journeys to work for Dales residents in the tourism and healthcare sectors often on what are essentially placement journeys from and to the operating base at the start and end of the operating day.</p>
<p>Data confirm that DBCIC has turned around the fortunes of DalesBus and it is now setting a new standard for rural public transport. Passenger numbers grew by 106 percent from 2008 to 2011 and the services expanded geographically and in terms of frequency of operation. The SIS Project identified the variety of stakeholders (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094211424254">Table 1</xref>), the strengths and weaknesses in the DBCIC and highlighted the many opportunities and challenges facing the company. Its status as a CIC means that it undertakes tasks which a commercial operator would never consider, such as providing publicity for other operators’ connecting or feeder services sometimes without any recompense or reciprocal arrangement, although a growing relationship with TransDev in Harrogate has led to TransDev producing high quality joint publicity which the Users Group distributed door-to-door to households in addition to the usual outlets.

<sec id="sec13-0269094211424254"><title>Results and recommendations</title>
<p>The key issues seen as important recommendations are as follows:
<list id="list1-0269094211424254" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to introduce a sub-branding for DBCIC services under the generic ‘DalesBus’ branding;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to tighten up DBCIC’s contracts with suppliers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to concentrate and improve service deficiencies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to refocus the marketing strategy.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In an attempt to distinguish DBCIC services from others, a recommendation of the SIS Project to DBCIC was to introduce a sub-branding for DBCIC services under the generic ‘DalesBus’ branding which is used for all bus services in the Dales, together with a distinctive alphanumerical route numbering system for DBCIC controlled services. However, this was rejected by DBCIC Directors on the philanthropic grounds that they wished to promote all public transport in the Dales, irrespective of the provider. Whilst this is a commendable stance, it makes little business sense, especially if some non-DBCIC services fall short of expectations.</p>
<p>Although the DBCIC wishes to ensure that its services are reliable and provide high levels of customer service, its contractors sometimes fail to deliver. DBCIC initially appeared to underestimate the damage to customer perceptions that these failures can cause. This is often because the Directors are strong advocates for public transport and committed users, who over the years have witnessed many examples of poor customer service, and are thus resilient to service failure. However, less than 50 percent of journeys made on DBCIC services could be described as essential; on some services essential users would comprise less than 10 percent of passengers carried.</p>
<p>This is to be expected on Sunday bus services principally targeted at leisure users but discretionary expenditure is particularly at risk in an economic recession. Furthermore, if DBCIC services fail to meet the expectations of users, these customers may decide to spend their leisure money elsewhere as witnessed during the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001, which curtailed access to the countryside and incurred huge losses for the providers of many rural bus services.</p>
<p>The SIS Project advised DBCIC to tighten up its contracts with suppliers to ensure that there were financial sanctions available for non-compliance. It is recognized that even the best suppliers will be less vigilant if they are under the impression that their customer will accept substandard service.</p>
<p>If there are service deficiencies for which the DBCIC receives financial compensation from suppliers, it should utilize this to fund a compensation scheme for its customers affected by the failure and also affected by problems outside the operators’ control such as traffic congestion causing connections to be missed. The CIC is now becoming much more aware of the need for service quality excellence and is working with suppliers and stakeholders to raise standards.</p>
<p>The marketing strategy which the SIS Project produced for the DBCIC emphasizes the importance of promoting attractions and destinations, rather than the actual bus journey.</p>
<p>A Sunday bus/train interchange has been established at Ribblehead on the Settle-Carlisle railway line (S&amp;C) with connecting buses supported by Northern, the train operator, and the Friends of the Settle Carlisle Line (FoSCL) and promoted as a branch line extension to the S&amp;C through leaflets and posters produced by the train operator and DBCIC. FoSCL arranged volunteer marshals to ensure a smooth interchange and guided walks to encourage patronage. This enabled journey times from Leeds/Bradford to the remoter northern dales of Swaledale and Wensleydale to be comparable with or better than a private car journey. Branded as the Northern Dalesman, the interchange experienced strong growth during the initial 2009 season with loads exceeding 75 percent capacity regularly carried in September and October and was repeated in 2010 and 2011 with support from Northern and FoSCL with faster journeys in response to customer feedback.</p>
<p>DBCIC is seeking to strengthen the relationship between bus and rail users and their groups as ultimately they share similar ideals, although they are in commercial competition with each other. There is also a recognition that rail passengers have different perceptions and expectations to bus passengers and are more likely to have access to a car and choose to travel by train on the grounds of journey time and comfort. Connecting buses therefore need to be as fast and direct as possible with smooth interchange and easily understood timetables. This will also increase the likelihood of such connections being picked up by online journey planners which are increasingly used by rail passengers.</p>
<p>DBCIC has a unique opportunity which Northern offers them for integrated bus/train services. Northern’s franchise is now mid-term and it has experienced 8 percent annual passenger growth against a forecast nil growth when the franchise was let Furthermore, Northern is owned by Serco and Abelio, neither of whom has any bus interests in Northern England, unlike other operators. This makes them more willing to cooperate with DBCIC and small operators and to take heed of the CIC’s expertise on bus services rather than drawing upon internal expertise transferred from elsewhere inthe UK. The challenge facing DBCIC is ensuring that bus/train interchanges become so well established that the new franchisee(in 2013) continues to support them, although it is highly unlikely that they will feature in the franchise specification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0269094211424254"><title>Opportunities and threats facing DBCIC</title>
<p>The Managing Director of DBCIC has received expressions of interest from other rural areas, especially National Parks and AONBs (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty), to replicate the DBCIC model if there was sufficient voluntary expertise available. In many cases, rural bus networks especially at weekends are similarly not promoted because there is no budget for this activity, depriving them of valuable income from leisure users: a perpetual cycle of declining services and passengers ensues. However, despite its success, the SIS Project had identified a number of threats and challenges to the DBCIC.</p>
<p>Funding from public sector bodies is under threat and the new Local Sustainable Transport Fund may not be set up in time to retain services through summer 2011 without a gap in provision. Previous experience shows that such gaps lead to a loss in patronage with a substantial marketing effort subsequently needed to restore customer numbers, let alone maintain growth. However, the new passengers attracted by services such as ‘Dales Experience’ enable DBCIC to demonstrate that they are indeed tackling social exclusion; public bodies are more inclined to support a bus service used by 300 people once a year as opposed to 30 people 10 times a year as the reach of such services is calculated to be 10 times greater.</p>
<p>Although the DfT repeatedly claims that operators should be ‘no better, no worse’ for participating in the mandatory English National Concessionary Fares scheme, it is apparent that the DBCIC has lost vital fares revenue although it has benefited from increased passenger numbers. Furthermore, capacity is finite and it is often impossible to use a larger vehicle due to the road infrastructure whilst staff are not available on standby to operate duplicate buses as required.</p>
<p>DBCIC is not alone in suffering such losses, especially on long distance routes but it has been understandably reticent to voice its concerns, being so dependent upon public funding.</p>
<p>Changes are being made to the current Concessionary Fares scheme post General Election as the £1bn cost is higher than first envisaged and growing. A rise in the age of eligibility to 65 has already been announced and routes deemed to be purely for the benefit of tourists have been excluded. Accordingly DBCIC must not be dependent upon concessionary passengers to fill buses and is recommended to support any proposals for a half-fare UK-wide all-modes scheme with a flat-rate incentive per passenger to supplement the half fare revenue generated. This would be much simpler to administer and granting all concessionaries half-fare rail travel without the need to purchase an annual railcard would make bus/rail interchange more attractive to older persons.</p>
<p>The reduction in Bus Service Operators Grant in April 2012 will have a greater effect on rural bus operations than on theirurban counterparts, as fuel is a much greater proportion of total operating costs in rural areas, up to 25 percent as opposed to 15percent in urban areas. Small rural bus operators face higher fuel costs as they are unable to negotiate discounts and fixed pricedeals with fuel suppliers enjoyed by the larger groups in urban areas.</p>
<p>The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) requires all service buses to be fully accessible to wheelchair users by 2015. Whilst this accessibility can be achieved by use of a lift on a step-entrance vehicle, most UK operators will have switched to low floor buses by 2015. These vehicles are, however, unsuitable for some roads in the Dales due to adverse cambers so the DBCIC may need to be prepared to either amend some routes or accept that there will be few operators and buses available to operate some existing routes with obvious cost implications. The CIC has also already discovered that low floor buses are also less robust in inclement weather conditions than their predecessors; in particular they have lower clearance in floods and snow, resulting in cancellations in winter.</p>
<p>The EU Driving Hours Regulations have been a problem for DBCIC since 2007 due to the intransigence of certain operators. At present, splitting longer routes into shorter linked routes seems to be acceptable under UK Domestic Regulations which do not require the use of tachographs and permit longer driving hours and shorter breaks. However, with the EU Working Time Directive and increased demands for safety improvements and better working conditions, this derogation may not continue ad infinitum and DBCIC should be encouraging its suppliers to be prepared for the imposition of EU Driving Hours Regulations on all local bus services.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0269094211424254" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has commented on how a combination of public private and third sector organizations have cooperated to ensure the ongoing success of the Dales and Bowland Community Interest Company. In its first three years DBCIC overcame numerous funding and operational challenges and is now evolving as a blueprint for other National Parks and AONBs.</p>
<p>Rural public transport is a major challenge to most local authorities and planners faced with increased operating costs and a declining ageing market for such services. Most authorities have priorities for the provision of rural public transport with access to education, work, health and shopping facilities predominant requirements. Shared cars and taxis, demand-responsive minibuses and volunteer-driven cars often provide the solution rather than conventional tendered bus services. The weekday bus service between Garsdale Station and Hawes is now operated morning and early evening by the Upper Wensleydale Community Partnership using voluntary drivers with the minibus being used to ferry patients to hospital appointments during the day. These services are usually offered at best Monday to Saturday but in practice many services are only Monday to Friday school terms with a skeleton Monday to Friday service in school holidays and on Saturdays for shopping purposes.</p>
<p>Findings from the SIS project show that much time and effort is currently expended on a voluntary basis by a small number of individuals with minimal prioritization of effort to concentrate upon those activities which are likely to yield the most revenue and patronage. The first challenge is to rationalize and prioritize these efforts without upsetting the individuals involved or making them feel that their voluntary efforts are not appreciated.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality of printed materials, grants and partnerships have been sought to produce good marketing materials. The Users Group website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.dalesbus.org">www.dalesbus.org</ext-link> is now recognized by partner organizations as a valuable resource with full timetables and information on attractions, guided walks and events. Unfortunately the national public transport journey planners which this site links to often ignore the existence of DalesBus services as it is a low priority for the local authority to upload information on seasonal services and, to ensure data integrity, operators are not allowed to upload their own information. Given the growing dependence of younger people on web-based information, this is a serious deficiency which needs rectification.</p>
<p>The DBCIC has shown what can be achieved by volunteers with a modest amount of funding. None of the services operated are commercially viable at present and with the reimbursement rates for concessionary fares and the capacity constraints noted above, they are unlikely to be commercially viable unless operation could be linked with other commercial activities. Possibilities include marketing services to overseas visitors based in York with commentaries and inclusive packages including entrance to attractions and refreshments.</p>
<p>Realistically, however, the majority of services will always be dependent upon public funding. With tighter public sector budgets this is a major challenge but the success of the services in terms of the passengers carried with modest subsidy and community involvement contributed to make a strong case for funding through the new Local Sustainable Transport Fund (LSTF) to ensure access to the Dales is not to become elitist and carbon footprint generating.</p>
<p>However, LSTF bids were only accepted from local transport authorities so the DBCIC and its partner organizations formed the Dales Integrated Transport Alliance (DITA) to work with Metro as the lead authority for the bid. The bid was approved in June 2011 releasing over £1 m of funding over the coming four years. However, this funding is only accessible to DBCIC through a third party (Metro) with the possibility that administration costs could absorb a sizeable proportion of the money available.</p>
<p>The granting of this funding may preclude DBCIC from obtaining other funding, whilst some funders may now feel that they have supported the CIC for long enough and divert their support to other worthwhile causes. If DITA is to be incorporated itself as either a CIC or IPS (industrial and provident society) this will lead to more volunteer time being diverted into administration rather than delivering the services required. It is recommended that future DfT schemes allow bids directly from third sector organizations with suitable screening to ensure their integrity and financial soundness.</p>
<p>The CIC model is recommended to other National Parks and AONBs for adoption as it is clear that putting the management of leisure services into the hands of competent users through a CIC leads to a better focused network of services provided at a lower cost per passenger carried.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094211424254">Thomas (2010)</xref> reports on the Ideas in Transit project which is encouraging more transport users to design their own bespoke services, whilst the 2010 UK Coalition Government has pledged to encourage more volunteers to become engaged in the provision of local services.</p>
<p>Dependence upon volunteers brings its own risks as they are not bound by any contractual obligations. Study of several CICs and other social enterprise companies has shown that they are dependent upon at most two or three individuals contributing a huge amount of volunteer effort and expertise; the loss of a key person could decimate the business. Furthermore, many CICs are dependent upon a large pool of volunteers comprising recently retired people. Such people are likely to become more difficult to recruit whilst the existing volunteers will grow older and retire naturally.</p>
<p>It is accordingly recommended that third sector organizations spend at least 10 percent of their turnover on salaried, contracted personnel in order to ensure continuity and stability and in order to convince funders, especially in the public sector, that they can transfer vital services to the third sector. Social enterprises will have to realize that with funding comes responsibility. However in the case of DBCIC this would enable them to offer a better focused service for the local communities at less cost that the current local authority managed provision.</p>
