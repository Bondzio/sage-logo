<abstract>
<p>Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common form of non-melanotic skin cancer, may develop in long-standing discoid lesions, especially those that are depigmented and located in sun-exposed areas. The clinical course of this complication may be aggressive, with early metastases and a risk of mortality. We report three cases demonstrating this emerging trend of secondary squamous cell carcinoma in discoid lesions as the incidence of this secondary malignancy in other diseased skin lesions is on the decline.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313490243" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, characterized by well-defined, photosensitive, inflammatory plaques that frequently evolve into atrophic depigmented scars. It may occur independently, or as a clinical feature in as many as 33% of patients of African origin with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p>
<p>Since the first description of their association more than 60 years ago, DLE has emerged as an important risk factor for aggressive subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as the occurrence of other premalignant dermatoses like phagedenic ulcers decline. The following case series highlights this potentially devastating disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313490243" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 1</title>
<p>An 18-year-old female was diagnosed with SLE based on the presence of discoid lesions (face, scalp, hands), a malar rash, polyarthritis, proteinuria, lymphopenia and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. The discoid lesions on the hands were severe and would prove resistant to topical and oral steroids and to antimalarials. Poor adherence to the contraceptive mandates of thalidomide therapy led to its withdrawal in spite of efficacy. The patient had also been on azathioprine for four years to treat the extracutaneous manifestations of SLE. After 20 years of disease, the patient reported the development of a new lesion on the right hand several weeks before clinical presentation and was found to have a tumourous mass on the ventral surface of the right carpus on an area of depigmented DLE scarring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313490243">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The lesion was confirmed on biopsy to be an invasive SCC (suspected spindle-type) with no bony involvement evident on computed tomography (CAT) scan. The patient would go on to decline surgery in favour of alternative medicine and presented months later with metastatic right axillary adenopathy which was secondarily infected with frank suppuration. Once the infection was controlled, a biopsy of the lymph nodes confirmed the high-grade spindle cell subtype of SCC with positive immunohistochemistry for p63.

</fig></p>
<p>Distant metastases followed shortly thereafter resulting in death some 22 months after initial presentation of the malignancy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203313490243" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 2</title>
<p>Biopsy-proven DLE affecting the scalp and extensor aspect of the upper limbs was the first manifestation of SLE in a 32-year-old woman who would go on to develop polyarthritis, oral ulceration, pleurisy, cytopenias and a positive ANA test a few months later. The discoid lesions responded sub-optimally to topical and oral steroids and to antimalarials. Thalidomide therapy was not tolerated. After 13 years of disease a painful posterior scalp mass developed over an area of atrophic scarring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313490243">Figure 1(b)</xref>) and the patient was prompted to seek medical attention three months later. The biopsy reported moderately differentiated SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313490243">Figure 2</xref>) and cranial CAT scan excluded bony involvement. The initial treatment involved surgical resection of what was then a 15 cm × 8 cm crusting, necrotic mass over the occipital area. A rotational flap and skin graft from the left thigh was used to close the wound. It was reported histologically that there was a 1 cm tumour-free resection margin but only a 0.5 mm tumour-free area in the deeper layers.
<fig id="fig2-0961203313490243" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p>Photomicrograph of the moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp from Case 2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203313490243-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Three months after that initial surgery, a recurrent lesion developed over the left mastoid area which displayed exuberant growth, local invasion and marked secondary necrosis. The lesion was surgically debrided but could not be excised. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was being considered when the patient developed purulent secondary infection of the scalp with resultant severe sepsis which led to her abrupt demise some seven months after the initial diagnosis of SCC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313490243" sec-type="cases"><title>Case 3</title>
<p>A 53-year-old man with an 11-year history of DLE which was quiescent on hydroxychloroquine developed a markedly exophytic tumour originating in an old depigmented DLE scar on the right forearm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313490243">Figure 1(c)</xref>). He reported the lesion as having emerged only over a few short weeks. The patient went on to decline further investigation and surgical management of this biopsy-proven moderately differentiated SCC in favour of alternative medicine and absconded from hospital care. He died at home a few months later.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961203313490243" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>DLE, a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, is manifested clinically by erythematous, scaly depigmented plaques characterized histologically by vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer of epidermis and patchy dermal lymphocytic infiltration. It may occur as a single entity or as a clinical feature of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490243">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a clinical criterion it is reported to occur in 3%–10% of Caucasian populations with SLE and 21% and 33% of their African American and African Caribbean counterparts, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490243">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490243"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313490243">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cutaneous SCC, the second most common form of non-melanoma skin cancer, is typically described as indolent with low metastatic potential and for most patients with early recognition of primary non-invasive lesions, the prognosis is excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490243">5</xref></sup> SCC is rare in patients of African origin and in most cases is reported to occur in the setting of a pre-neoplastic dermatosis. Conditions such as DLE are amongst the emerging predispositions replacing previous predominant causes such as phagedenic ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313490243">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>First described in 1953,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313490243">7</xref></sup> DLE complicated by SCC has since been the subject of close to 50 case reports. Early work by Millard and Barker in 1978 reported the prevalence of SCC to be 3.3% in Caucasian patients with chronic cutaneous lupus, the scalp being the most common site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313490243">8</xref></sup> Sporadically there were reports of other neoplastic lesions in DLE such as basal cell carcinoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and atypical fibroxanthoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313490243">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the earliest case reports of DLE and SCC in patients of African origin was by Martin et al. in 1979 who opined on the potential for enhanced metastatic potential when SCC arises in DLE of the lips.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313490243">10</xref></sup> Keith et al., in 1980, cautioned that hypopigmented atrophic DLE plaques in sun-exposed areas carry a risk of future development of skin cancer due to loss of the inherent pigmentary protection and as such required vigilance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313490243">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reports from the literature suggest that the emergence of SCC in DLE is a late complication, with most cases having a latency period between seven and 41 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313490243">12</xref></sup> Few reports highlight an atypical presentation such as that of the precocious advent of SCC in a recent DLE plaque in a sun-protected area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313490243">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general SCC occurring in diseased skin is said to have a 40% risk of metastases, and lesions greater than 2 cm in diameter have a risk of recurrence and metastases that is twice and three times that of smaller lesions, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313490243">14</xref></sup> DLE-related SCC is felt to be even more aggressive with higher rates of recurrence, metastases and death than those that are non-DLE-related.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490243">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our three cases displayed the typical commonality of SCC developing in depigmented scars located in sun-exposed areas in the setting of long-standing DLE. Our cases all presented with very large lesions and in two cases declined medical intervention, allowing the natural history of the disease to unfold. The aggressive nature and rapid pace of these cancers and the risk of mortality were made evident. The delayed disease presentation and behaviour that was discordant with clinical advice occurred in the setting of free, readily accessible health care and we speculate may have been due to the patients’ lower level of education and sociocultural fear of traditional medicine and surgery.</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism by which our cases made the transformation from DLE to SCC is the subject of speculation but intuitively it is suspected to be similar to those proposed for other potentially pre-malignant dermatoses where chronic inflammation, scarring and actinically damaged epidermis are critical causal factors. The continuous inflammation as seen in phagedenic ulcers; the scarring as seen in burns; the actinic damage from ultraviolet (UV) exposure as seen in fairer skins have all been described to result in the development of keratinocytes with an activated immunophenotype preceding the malignant transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313490243">16</xref></sup> Additionally, from the organ transplant literature, the use of systemic immunosuppressives has been shown to predispose to the development of SCC typically after 20 years;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313490243">17</xref></sup> this may have been a cofactor influential in case 1 though her exposure time of four years would be considered modest.</p>
<p>A recent review of a cohort of over 3000 Swedish patients with cutaneous lupus matched to a control cohort from the general population confirmed a four-fold increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in the disease group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313490243">18</xref></sup> This risk was the same as that for lymphoma, which in other recent reports is demonstrated to be the most common malignancy in the SLE populations studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313490243">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313490243">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the future, reducing the risk of SCC in DLE would involve aggressive attention to the treatment of DLE as well as the mitigation of other confounding, potentially modifiable risk factors such as tobacco use and excessive sun exposure. Patients also need to be sensitized to the gravity of this complication. Those most at risk must be monitored closely, with once to twice yearly screening in keeping with the early detection guidelines for other predisposed individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313490243">21</xref></sup> Rapid therapeutic intervention is necessary to reduce the risk of mortality.</p>
