<abstract>
<p>Drawing on ethnographic data collected throughout British Columbia’s coastal regions, in this article, the authors examine people’s experiences of ordinary weather. Data show how people experience weather multisensorially and how the weather plays a central role in the way individuals and collectives define sense of place. Experiences of weather, the authors argue, are a reflexive and active form of dwelling. A focus on skillful embodied practices and dwelling highlights how weathering is a process through which people make and remake places and shape their sense of self. The authors conceptualize the practice of weathering as a form of somatic work and explain how through somatic work places and weather emerge within a performative ecology of movements.</p>

<p>It rains so much here that I’ve had mushrooms growing in my car.</p>

<p>Mark Twain once famously quipped that “everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.” However, Twain’s wit aside, as we describe in this article, nothing could be further from the truth. Far from passive meteorological dupes, people skillfully weather their lives by moving alongside atmospheric patterns, creatively “weaving” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>) original micro-climates within their dwellings, seeking a sense of balance and harmony with place. Weather is a noun, but it is also a verb. In the process of <italic>weathering</italic> people make and remake dynamic places and selves in a performative ecology of movement. Thus, the experience and practice of weather cannot be understood in abstraction from the self—intended here as “the agency and identity of the geographical subject” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 405)—and the sensual and affective body, which “links this self to lived place in its sensible and perceptible features” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 405). To weather is an active, reflexive, practical disposition to endure, sense, struggle, manipulate, mature, change, and grow in processes that, over time, implicate the place-making of one’s dwelling. To weather, in short, is to dwell.</p>
<p>Take for example the case of Eleanor—one of our informants. Eleanor was born in Ontario, but 15 years ago she decided she needed a life change. She was tired of the cold, the snow, her job, her partner, and herself. “So I moved to Tofino,” she says, “as far west in Canada” as she could go. “Why here? Why move to a town where you have no real job, where you had no friends, and no prospects?”—I ask—“Why move to a place where it rains 230 days a year?” “Take a look outside,” she answers, “do you see any umbrellas? Do you see anyone running to their car trying to cover their head with a newspaper? Do you see anyone mind the fact that it’s raining?” “Let me tell you why I moved here,” she continues,
<disp-quote>
<p>In Toronto you stay indoors when it rains. Or when it snows. Or when it’s cold. Or when it’s too hot. Regardless of the weather, you live your daily routine. You work, you shop, you get stuck in traffic, and you get home. Here I have learned to live in relation to the weather. If it’s stormy I like to go out for a bike ride. When it’s dark and rainy I love to write, or read. If it’s windy I need to allow for a longer time for my kayak ride to work, from my float-house. If the sun is out for a long time, like it does in the summer, I need to figure out how I’m going to get water for my house because the creek I get water from starts to dry out. Dealing with the weather here is a way of facing life, a different kind of life. In the city it feels like you live regardless of the natural cycles of life. Here you try to find some kind of harmony with them. It’s not that the weather doesn’t affect you in the city. It’s just that by moving away from the city I moved away from a certain way of living with the weather, and with other people, and with my own self. Moving here was a choice for a different life. I wanted to learn to be somebody different, I wanted to live with a place and its weather instead of in spite of it. Even though I love the rain and I think of myself as a rain person, the weather isn’t always better than Toronto here. It sucks to have a sleepless night because the waves turn my float-house into a surfboard. But it’s just different. The place is different. I am different.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As illustrated by Eleanor’s quote, our ethnographic study examines experiences of weather and practices of weathering. We conceptualize the relationship between weather, place, body, and self as inextricable. With our article we contribute to interactionist and phenomenological approaches to the perception of the environment and to literature on the senses. We tackle the embodied experience of weather and the practice of weathering as a sensorial and ecological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211412269">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331211412269">2007</xref>). We focus on the embodied, multisensorial perception of weather places—since “weather affects us through many senses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito, 2005</xref>, p. 157; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2005</xref>)—but given the limited space we have here we choose to emphasize a sense generally neglected in the literature: the sense of movement.</p>

<title>Studying Weather</title>
<p>Weather has occupied a somewhat “absent-presence” in sociological, economic, anthropological, historical, cultural, and geographical research. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1206331211412269">Strauss and Orlove (2003</xref>, p. 3) reflect,
<disp-quote>
<p>physical experience of the weather provides a common focal point in many societies, through both commiseration and celebration. Many cultures note links between exceptional climate events and historical events. In a related manner, the regular sequence of the seasons often serves as an image for the steadiness of time’s passage and the permanence of the fundamental parameters of human existence. Ritual practices integral to the spiritual life of many societies often address these annual cycles. Accounts of cultural or moral change are often associated with narratives of changing climate and vice versa; references to a “golden age” of prosperity are often accompanied by descriptions of a mild climate. Weather can be called or diverted by human actions, and atmospheric conditions have frequently been explained with reference to a religious context.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, the ways people experience and talk about weather, the ways they develop emotional attachments and inhibitions to it, and the ways they sense and comprehend meteorological processes and draw significance from them are not only interesting but also particularly valuable as keys to deciphering larger scale social processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1206331211412269">Strauss and Orlove (2003)</xref> are not the only social scientists to reflect on such issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1206331211412269">Douglas (1962)</xref> reflected on the relationship between varying climate experiences and the stipulation of different agricultural calendars among neighboring Congolese tribes. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211412269">Berland (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211412269">1994</xref>) reflected on Canadian weather in relation to media representation and the technological colonization of space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331211412269">Matthewman (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1206331211412269">2001</xref>) remarked on the centrality of weather in popular discourse, in academic thought, and with regard to national identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331211412269">Harrison (2001)</xref> studied weather-related changing patterns of mood in a tribal village in Papua New Guinea. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331211412269">Sturken (2001)</xref> critically deconstructed the representation of El Niño in the context of California’s media culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331211412269">Vannini and McCright (2004)</xref> identified the ideological components of forecasts and reports on The Weather Channel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1206331211412269">Ross (1992)</xref> examined the science of weather prediction (see also Fine, 2007) and the rhetoric of climate change in light of the postindustrial obsession with information control and technocultural efficiency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1206331211412269">Nash (1981)</xref> studied public behavior in winter urban settings and compared them with summer settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito (2005)</xref> remarked on the mundane aesthetic dimensions of weather appreciation in the context of Japanese people’s sense of place and seasonal rhythms. The weather has also been given attention in relation to the seasonality of landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1206331211412269">Palang, Sooväli, &amp; Printsmann, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, our study hinges on the concept of dwelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331211412269">Heidegger, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>) within the context of everyday life. In its most basic denotation to dwell refers to inhabiting, to organizing space, and to cultivating a relationship with place, but more insightfully it also refers to living “in a manner which is attuned to the rhythms of nature, to see one’s life as anchored in human history and directed towards a future, to build a home which is the everyday symbol of a dialogue with one’s ecological and social milieu” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331211412269">Buttimer, 1976</xref>, p. 277). Given the obvious existentialist and humanistic legacy informing the concept of dwelling, and given the critiques that these intellectual projects have endured lately, it is important to qualify our use of the concept. For our present goals we need to purge dwelling of the cavalier romanticist heritage that conflates it with an assumed authentic, rooted existence and with fixed notions of place. By transcending the earliest dualist limitations of this concept and highlighting performative and nonrepresentational dynamics, a more contemporary approach (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331211412269">Cloke &amp; Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>) posits dwelling as an emergent and fluid process constantly shaping the “rich intimate ongoing togetherness of beings and things which make up landscapes and places, and which bind together nature and culture over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331211412269">Cloke &amp; Jones, 2001</xref>, p. 651). More precisely, with reference to the weather, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331211412269">Ingold (2007)</xref> suggests that dwelling means to “inhabit the open . . . within a weather world in which every being is destined to combine wind, rain, sunshine, an earth in continuation of its own existence” (p. S20).</p>
<p>We adopt dwelling as an analogy for weathering because it so efficaciously recognizes the bodily embeddedness of human experience <italic>in place</italic>. Dwelling allows us to avoid the mistake of arguing that people mentally and symbolically “construct” weather by teasing it out from abstract space and attaching meaning to it, as if weather was immaterial, and as if a weather-neutral experience was simply natural and primordial, awaiting genesis by voluntarist action and by the sudden discursive jumpstarting of culture. A dwelling perspective implies that bodies and selves are always “emplaced” in the world, and this incipient being-in-the-world mutually shapes the formation of place <italic>and</italic> subjectivity, of ways of becoming <italic>and</italic> ways of knowing, ways of understanding <italic>and</italic> ways of acting. Furthermore, dwelling is both a noun and a verb. Indeed, weather is to weathering what place is to dwelling. As a noun dwelling refers to a particular place, but its gerund quality highlights the fact that dwelling is also an active process of place-making that is in constant tension and movement. Dwelling is therefore emergent, contextual, lived, practiced, and only static in space or time in the most facile of sense (i.e., a photographic moment is, at best, an exceedingly momentary, decontextualized, and partial re-presentation of the ongoing lived experience of one’s dwelling).</p>
<p>It is particularly important to conceive of dwelling as a place-making process because, like weather, it is always in motion: an ever-changing entity. And yet weather, like dwelling, is also a place of sorts: subject to haunting attachment, identification, familiarity, and to the binding powers of imagination, idealization, and narration that is typical of more “traditional” places. Indeed, weather may be seen as akin to transcendent concepts (such as “God” or “love”) since weather can refer to anything—from the most macroscopic meteorological events such as El Niño to locally specific conditions such as the Santa Ana winds, from visible cumulonimbus clouds to the barely perceptible barometric pressure, from the directly and sensuously experienced temperature to the jet steam, which can only be known through measurement and instrumentation. Just about anything is either a part of the weather, or can be made so (i.e., trees and other vegetation contribute to atmospheric conditions that affect weather, and high-winds may blow down trees that, in turn, are part of how weather-related damage is assessed). And, yet, in spite of its seemingly transcendent qualities “weather,” like dwelling, is necessarily emergent, lived, and experienced. However it is defined, “weather” is produced as much as it is experienced, and the processes of how weather is produced are inseparable from how it is experienced.</p>
<p>Understanding the related practices of weathering and dwelling allows us to conceptualize place as a form of becoming. Weather constantly makes and remakes place. A storm—like a bridge that is built or a tree that is felled—interacts with the more permanent features of place, marking not only the spatial features but also the temporal dimensions of the human experience of that place. Recurrent storms make some places different from other more arid counterparts, for example. Weather movements over time shape not only the material features of place but also provide affordances for the human engagement of place. Building refuge from storms—or surfing mighty waves, or coping with what has come to be called seasonal affective disorder—are performances of place that practically engage weather, making weather-places different from one another. From stormwatching to alpine skiing, from sunbathing to irrigating, various forms of dwelling shape the materiality of place and reproduce ways of life, emplacing the embodied self and organizing place-sharing communities. A dwelling is thus not a mere place of being, but a taskscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>): an ensemble of mutually interlocking tasks that “come into being through movement” (p. 197). Engagement with a taskscape is an occasion for the articulation of the relation between places as becoming and embodied selves as becoming.</p>
<p>Our research is focused on one region of Canada: coastal British Columbia. Our choice to limit empirical data collection to this area is driven by our will to evoke a clearly bounded sense of place and treat weather and place within a well-defined regional cultural context. We began data collection by inventorying publically available experiences of weather, such as narratives and reflections contained in blogs and other published writings. We then organized a small regional media campaign: during radio shows in which we took part as guests, and through newspaper op-eds focusing on weather as folklore. We invited audiences to share with us reflections on the role that weather plays in their everyday life. In response, we received letters and e-mails containing narratives, poems, and photographs. We then began to conduct interviews with some of the people who contacted us following our media appearances, and through snowballing. These interviews allowed us to refine our focus and to devise a more structured, but still open-ended, set of interview questions. Armed with the latter we recruited volunteer participants through a wide sample of students enrolled at the first author’s university, and conducted interviews with them face to face and through the telephone and email. Also, two of the authors—the first and the fourth—travelled extensively throughout the entire climate region discussed in this article to observe weather-related behaviors and conduct more interviews. In all we spoke with 55 people and conducted participant observation in public spaces for over a year.</p>

<title>To Weather, Skillfully</title>
<p>Here on the West Coast of Canada we don’t quite live <italic>in</italic> the rain. Rather, the rain lives in us. I<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1206331211412269">1</xref></sup> haven’t always loved the rain, and I am not entirely sure I even do now. But I have learned to live with it. It is easy to learn to live with the rain when you get to listen to its soothing melody all night long, and then wake up to its fresh smell and to the promise of a sunrise in a clearing sky. It’s easy to love the rain when it means home, when it makes home. A poem by fellow Lasqueti islander, Sophia Rosenberg, expresses how you can learn to love what many people in the world have come to despise.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Why I love Rain</p>
<p>Because I hear it as I slide towards waking</p>
<p>whispering “stay in bed” with its little fingers</p>
<p>spinning spider silk to my dreams.</p>
<p>Because it soaks the earth dark</p>
<p>and fills the pond so</p>
<p>birds fly below green hills</p>
<p>and there’s a puddle of sky in my clearing.</p>
<p>Because it washes in visitors</p>
<p>with bright colored slickers</p>
<p>that pile their gumboots by the door</p>
<p>and drink tea for hours.</p>
<p>Because it’s why gumboots were invented.</p>
<p>Because there’s always too much, or too little</p>
<p>yet someone coined the term “right as rain”</p>
<p>Because it’s how the deer take showers.</p>
<p>Because its feelings are hurt</p>
<p>when weather reporters use the term “nice day”.</p>
<p>Because it dances to the beat of its own drumming as I write this</p>
<p>wet.wet.wet..wet.wet..wet.wet…wet…wet.</p>
<p>Because it’s company for tears.</p>
<p>Because when I was twelve I washed my hair in it</p>
<p>and I still feel that smoothness</p>
<p>when I see water running over glass.</p>
<p>Because you can smell it coming,</p>
<p>the way sailors can smell land in the distance.</p>
<p>Because it seeps into every tent</p>
<p>eventually defeats all tarps</p>
<p>and forest fires.</p>
<p>Because it’s so well colour-coordinated with air.</p>
<p>Because of those trick fountains that look like taps just hanging there with water pouring</p>
<p>but somehow invisibly it must be rising back up again.</p>
<p>Because you can collect it from your roof</p>
<p>to quench your thirst or take a bath or boil rice.</p>
<p>Because it’s a patient teacher</p>
<p>endlessly demonstrating gravity and pointing out sea level.</p>
<p>Because each drop is a whole room made of windows.</p>
<p>Because it can rain invitations</p>
<p>Because it can rain blood, frogs, cats and dogs</p>
<p>but mostly it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Because it makes me wonder if any two raindrops are alike and</p>
<p>if all raindrops are alike until my mind</p>
<p>drips.</p>
<p>Because sometimes it just goes on and on</p>
<p>and doesn’t know when</p>
<p>enough is enough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sophia is right: The rain sometimes just does not know when enough is enough. And sometimes there is no way to know if it has even stopped falling. Here on Langara Island, for example, nothing is more confusing than a fine mist. You see, on Langara Island it “only” rains an average of 1957 mm a year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1206331211412269">2</xref></sup> That is almost twice as much as Vancouver, but it is less than half than some soggy corners get in the north and central coast of the province, or the west coast of Vancouver Island. In fact, Langara’s claim to fame is not the size of its rainfall. Sure, sometimes the fine mist gets rudely pushed aside by a fast-bursting downpour or, at times, gets ridiculed by a brash all-day, sideways-lashing torrent. But Langara’s weather’s true feature is its persistence: it rains 267 days a year, almost twice as many rainy days as Victoria. And on many of those 98 days left there is no recorded precipitation because the drizzle is a mist so fine, and yet so thick, that it all blends into an almost solid mass reaching down without touching the ground, and mixing and mingling with the ocean water spray so that all you can see is thick, grey soup in every direction. In these conditions, a measuring instrument cannot discern rain, sky, and ocean. Your sense of sight won’t help you detect much of it either. But if you learn to move through it you can sense it haptically; you can feel the drops on your skin as you walk, as every layer of clothing on your body gets soaked in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The extended grayness of the sky typical of the region hugging the Hecate Strait—such as the Queen Charlotte Islands and the British Columbia north coast on the mainland—make for a unique place and a distinct way of life. Prince Rupert takes pride in reminding its visitors that its mean 2593 mm of rain make it the wettest city in Canada. The city also has the dubious national record of least average annual sunshine (1,229 hours a year), and of being the most overcast city in the continent (6,145 hours a year). Jennifer moved to Prince Rupert when she was 11 years old. She then moved away—first to Victoria and then to Vancouver—as soon as she graduated from high school, but returned to stay on and off, attracted by good summer jobs. She finally moved back 3 years ago, planning to stay here for 5 years, envisioning herself moving somewhere warmer and drier down south again in the future. “The weather is perpetually rainy,” says Jennifer. “I have adapted my lifestyle to survive the constant state of rain,” and that has meant learning to live with feelings of “resentment, frustration, awe, fatigue, pessimism, doubtful [sic], loneliness, and lifelessness.”</p>
<p>Jennifer is not alone in her struggles to adapt to the climate of Prince Rupert. Susan, who also plans to move away in 2 years, is equally moved by the weather. “I often feel very cold on rainy days,” she says, “when it rains for an extended length of time—days, even weeks—my bones feel cold and I just can’t get warm. I feel trapped. We are so isolated here and when it’s really grey and raining you can’t see the sky or the water. It’s a claustrophobic feeling.” Feeling trapped, Susan senses her body is fatigued and unwilling to move; trapped without a way to escape other than by heading south or going on vacation. Like her, Jennifer seeks relief in holidays to sunny destinations, but admits that coming back home requires a great deal of sensory work in order to readjust. Because of the constant rain and grey skies, she writes, “I definitely feel out of balance and crave sunlight. In the sun I feel energized, positive, and ambitious. I have an understanding now that it takes me up to two weeks to acclimatize back to the rainy city of Prince Rupert every time I go away.”</p>
<p>Like Susan, Jennifer is highly reflexive about the skills required to weather life in the North Coast. When it rains, she forces herself outside, often walking in the woods with her dogs. At other times she remains inside enclosed in a special room in her house: a bright pottery room filled with loud music, insulated from the pelting rain knocking hard on her roof. Jennifer never used to think of herself an artist, but pottery is now an important form of self-expression for her. The colors she uses to glaze her creations resemble the tones of the rain. Her pieces are molded by her moods. Sometimes they are bright and cheery with smooth edges and even shapes. Sometimes they are rough and unevenly shaped, with unique designs carved into them. When the rain is light Jennifer creates more standard pieces. When it rains hard, she feels more creative, wilder, not unlike the rain and wind pounding violently at the window and making both the sky and Jennifer’s mood dark. The dark mood pieces, says Jennifer, “are my favorite pieces; they tend to not resemble each other and I surprise myself with what I create.”</p>
<p>The weather is a unique object of perception for at least two reasons. First, it is neither spatially nor temporally enclosed nor independent of us, but rather it envelops us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito, 2005</xref>). Second, perception of the weather intersects with perceptions of climate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1206331211412269">Strauss and Orlove (2003)</xref> point out, the weather is the climate’s manifestation in the present moment. We sense weather in the present moment, but our sensations are shaped by sensory skills that are informed by both past memories and future expectations. In sum, perceptions of the weather are difficult to articulate, and its sensory experience is just as complex. Like all sensations, sensations of weather are performative and reflexive, in that they “are produced, enacted and perceived in combination with each other, intertwined with emotion, meaning and memory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1206331211412269">Hsu, 2008</xref>, p. 440). In other words, just as reflecting on the significance of the weather requires mindful interpretive practice, sensing the material qualities of weather in their immediacy requires a great deal of effort. Through that effort, though, we can make sense of weather and we learn to dwell within it. As Sophia’s poem shows, to make sense of weather and to dwell within it means to actively and reflexively interpret it and manipulate it, to draw meaning from one’s lifeworld, and to actively shape it. Through this type of routine work we weather places.</p>
<p>This approach to sensing—as a skillful and performative activity—is well established. Phenomenologists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331211412269">Merleau-Ponty (1968)</xref>, and more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331211412269">Serres (2008)</xref> have argued that sensing is governed by a degree of embodied intentionality and intelligence that transcends linguistic reflexivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331211412269">Dewey (1934)</xref>, and more recently authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1206331211412269">Rodaway (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold (2000)</xref>, have similarly argued for treating the somatic awareness of “nature” as an active, skillful, performative disposition that is mutually generative of selfhood, embodiment, and place. In light of this and related ideas we have generated the concept of “somatic work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1206331211412269">Vannini, Waskul &amp; Gottschalk, 2011</xref>). Somatic work refers to the range of linguistic and alinguistic reflexive experiences and activities by which individuals create, extinguish, maintain, interrupt, and/or communicate sensations that are congruent with personal, interpersonal, and/or cultural notions of moral, aesthetic, or and/or logical desirability. In short, somatic work highlights that sensations are social relations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1206331211412269">Geurts, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We can understand how people weather places as a form of somatic work. To weather means to subject oneself to the elements, to undergo exposure to challenges, to somehow adapt, and to make sense of one’s environment by mastering it, controlling it, understanding it, making it familiar, sensible, and intelligible. To weather also means to struggle, to endure, to suffer, to brave, and to strive to cope with climatic elements, at times even failing, experiencing pain and discomfort. Weathering in itself is neither a positively nor a negatively charged process. Indeed the practice of weathering at times has a complex feel to it, irreducible to “black or white” characterizations. One informant provides us with a good example of this:
<disp-quote>
<p>I love gardening. It allows me to be outdoors, to feel the ground, to experience the weather on my skin. I’ll garden even if it rains, even heavily. I have learned to dress properly for it, and there is a unique sense of comfort in being dry when it’s raining cats and dogs. But it’s a mixed bag. I obviously prefer to garden when it’s sunny. Regardless of how dry you can keep, gardening in the rain always has its downsides. Your shoes get muddy, your hair always gets a little wet, and sooner or later you get cold and uncomfortable. So I realize that I do it just because it’s what we do out here on the west coast. I used to live in the interior where people go ice fishing. They freeze their nuts off out on the lake. Maybe they do like that, but it still feels like they do that kind of stuff, and we do this kind of stuff, just because it’s what we do. So that we can say we’ve done it; to feel better about ourselves. And also probably because getting back inside the house and going under a warm blanket feels a lot better afterwards.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dwelling with weather is a skillful practice, a way of shaping our place in the world. We weather in reflexive ways. We perceive what the weather does to us and others, and to the surfaces (even depths) of the world in which we live. We recall the weather of the past and compare it to the present. We talk about it with others; we make sense of it collaboratively or in conflict with others. We dress in accordance with it, plan the day by weather forecasts and reports, or simply by looking to the sky or feeling the temperature. We dedicate certain activities to rainy days and others to sunny days. In sum, “perceiving the weather is a mode of being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2005</xref>, p. 102).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold (2000)</xref> writes, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331211412269">Gibson (1968)</xref>, that our presence in the lifeworld is so deeply marked by our experiences of weather because the weather is not just a material object of our perception, but it is rather a “medium of our perception” (p. 102). To suggest that the weather is what we perceive is to suggest that “we are our weather” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211412269">Berland, 1993</xref>, p. 207). Weather mediates between place and our embodied being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211412269">Berland, 1993</xref>, p. 207). Toby’s experience on Langara Island of being unable to detect the rain through sight is a good example. Weather is not an object we contemplate from a distance, as if it were separate from us or from the surfaces it touches. Weather envelops us, unfolds us, and it is by moving through it that we come to its most immediate—carnal and mindful—recognition.</p>
<p>The concept of medium has multiple meanings. Medium refers to a channel, and thus to something people and things move through, as Toby’s experience of walking in the thick, misty, gray soup of Langara’s sky has shown. Another example of how people move through the weather comes from Susan. Susan has been struggling with the climate of Prince Rupert. Her emotional response is a feeling of claustrophobia, brought about by the visual confinement that overcast skies afford, and by the cold temperatures of the falling rain, which almost freeze her to inaction. If weather is a medium we move through, then feeling “trapped”—unable to move through—is a perfectly sensible reaction. But medium also refers to something that stands in between an actor and its purpose, like a means, a tool. For Jennifer, the weather is a medium precisely in this sense. Jennifer’s routine responses to rainy days highlight how the weather is a means to two enjoyable activities: walking in the woods with her dogs and doing pottery. In this sense the rain is not only something that Jennifer acts <italic>in</italic> or <italic>toward</italic> but also something that Jennifer acts <italic>with</italic>. Her wildest pottery pieces are molded with the heavy rain falling outside and pelting on her roof, and if she did not have the rain to shape with she would not shape at all.</p>
<p>Our informants’ experiences highlight how the weather is a medium, but also how it is a “taskscape” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>). The weather occasions activities, provides us with resources, facilitates certain types of actions and discourages others, and prompts us to learn certain kinds of techniques for everyday living. Thus, while the weather has obvious symbolic meanings, its primary manifestations are practical affordances for the performance of our common ways of life. The “meanings” of weather are therefore less referential than they are orientational—perhaps not unlike a map. A map has symbolic qualities because it is representational <italic>of</italic> a landscape. But most important, a map is <italic>for a</italic> landscape: its primary significance lies in its orientational qualities, which afford us the possibility to navigate. The weather, like the map, is most consequential as a taskscape that reveals our engagement with the world. Take the Robinson family, for example.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In our family we have always used the weather as a way to keep our family close together. It rains a lot in Comox, which may make you feel the need to stay indoors. But we don’t want our kids to spend all their free time watching TV and playing video games. So every weekend we go for a little hike in the forest. Our kids have a blast jumping in puddles, or finding areas of the forest where the trees are so tall and their branches so thick that the rain hardly gets through. Or sometimes we go to the beach and the kids build a fort with driftwood. It’s much more fun to build a fort when you actually have a reason to want a refuge. It’s like the rain throws a challenge at us as parents, and we take it on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a taskscape the weather invokes the work of our senses. The weather brings forth a distinct sensual dimension to place. The weather immerses us into a world of sensations that underwrite our capacity to touch, taste, see, smell, and hear place, by affording us with possibilities for movement, for action. Take Sophia’s poem, for instance. For Sophia, the rain is a seductive opportunity to seek balance and rest, to listen to her neighbors’ stories, to smell the earth, to enjoy the taste of tea, and to tune into the dance-like qualities of its sonic rhythm. But the weather is not just a landscape, a soundscape, a smellscape, or a tastescape, but also a taskscape: it is a tool for cleansing, for emotional relief, for quenching hunger and taste, for walking in puddles. And at times the weather is a tool to self-medicate, a reason to escape pain and sorrow:
<disp-quote>
<p>Every winter our family reaches a point when we just can’t cope anymore with the darkness and the grayness. We like the winter here, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing. We need change, diversity. We crave light, the feeling of the sun on our skin. Just to look for some balance after three or four months of grey days. That’s when we go on a little holiday. Like a cruise to the Caribbean, or a little trip to Mexico. When the rain isn’t moving, the clouds aren’t going anywhere, we go somewhere. We go after the sun. We try to do that right around spring break. By the time we get back generally our senses are recharged. We get back home and we take notice of the cherry trees blooming. When the tide is low the ocean smells differently than it has all winter long. A lot of the birds are back, and they’re getting louder. After a trip away we crave coming back home to these sensations, and the minute we get back we search for them and try to go out and enjoy them as much as we can.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The “meanings” of the rain—and weather writ large—then are orientational, indexical, embodied. The meanings of the weather are felt by our body’s five best-known senses, but also by our sense of temperature (or thermoception), of pain (nociception), of material textures (touch), and through our body’s senses of movement of itself in space (the kinesthetic sense).</p>
<p>The human senses are social orientations to the world. They are not organs for individualized responses. Sensations are not atomistic knee-jerk reactions. For example, on rainy days Jennifer finds refuge in house “corners” and “nests” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331211412269">Bachelard, 1994</xref>) that affords her cocoon-like sensations. This affective response is not unusual. All of the people we interviewed enjoy making themselves “cozy” at home instead of going out, or as a way of warming up after a walk outside. The ritualistic aspects of these experiences tell us that sensations of weather are not isolated or atomistic, but socially organized. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331211412269">Harrison (2001)</xref> has found in relation to the nostalgic moods evoked by heat-haze amidst Avatip people of Papua New Guinea, these affective dispositions are not subjective phenomena but instead a “social activity” whose “enactment is as public and observable as bridewealth transactions or the proceedings of the village court” (p. 260).</p>
<p>Sensations are skills. Skills are “the capabilities of action and perception of the whole organic being (indissolubly mind and body) situated in a richly structured environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>, p. 5). Skills emerge over the course of interacting with and in lifeworlds. Like students of complex movements such as martial arts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331211412269">Cohen, 2006</xref>), people learn to make sense of the ways they move in and out of weather-places, and learn how to weather places. Martial art skills require that one learn how to move, to take aim, and hit while maintaining balance, whereas weathering skills require that one learn how, when, and why to move across climate regions, and how to adapt to the unique features of particular weather-places, struggling to reach an ecological balance with surrounding people and elements. As people acquire these skills over time—and the means to actualize the possibilities of movement (such as travel)—their weathering skills improve: they learn to reflexively understand their bodily sensations of weather, they learn to move, to understand weather movements and patterns, and thus their dwelling skills become less abstract and more idiolocalized. Familiar sensations over time build personal memories and intersect with collective memories and common skills, hence shaping weather-based personal, social, and collective identities, which themselves are then used as resources to make sense of weather and to weather places.</p>

<title>Weather, Body, and Place</title>
<p>No towns on the British Columbia coast have a more symbiotic relationship with the rain than Ocean Falls. Ocean Falls lies in a very remote coastal inlet. Although it is on the mainland, the surrounding mountains are so steep and so far removed from any inhabited center that no roads have ever been built to reach it. To get to Ocean Falls one must travel by seaplane or a ferry boat. The weather plays a key role in connecting and disconnecting Ocean Falls from the rest of the world. While seaplane journeys are quick, they are frequently delayed—at times for days—by the weather. Fog and low ceiling conditions make it impossible to safely descend into the deep fjord where, at the end, Ocean Falls lies. Because it never gets cold enough for the sea to freeze ferries are more reliable, but also slower—taking anywhere from a day and a half to 6 hours, depending on which direction one is travelling. If getting there is hard work, living there is even harder. Only 30 or so brave souls weather the four seasons there. During summer, the population swells to 100, but still not enough to accommodate the shops and services that would make everyday life “easy” by southern coast standards. Groceries, for example, must be sent for. They arrive by barge once every 2 weeks from the greater Vancouver area. People come out to the dock in the pouring rain, get on the barge, and load their grocery boxes onto the beds of their pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Pelted by rain and hail, roads are in constant state of disrepair. Most of the town is a “ghost” town of sorts—not invisible ghosts, but instead dripping <italic>wet</italic> ones. It pours 4 meters of rain a year here. And, still, not as much as it used to. After the pulp mill closed, it started raining less, almost overnight. When the mill was running it would rain twice a day, almost every day, when the tide would come in and bring cool air. The channel is so deep that the air would get funneled in, all the way to the mountains behind the mill, where a large lake lies. The mill’s operation would produce a lot of steam. That steam would mix with the moisture rising from the lake and the dampness dragged by the tide, making the perfect conditions for a good rain soaker for every high tide.</p>
<p>Ocean Falls’s year-round residents experienced a remarkable 3 days of consecutive sunshine in the summer of 2009. “At first a lot of us went out on our boats around the inlet,” says Nick, recalling those days:
<disp-quote>
<p>The excuse was to go fishing, but mostly we went out to drink beer and swim. By the afternoon the sun was still out. By the evening it was still out. We woke up hung-over the following day and the sun was still out. That’s when things started getting weird. Some people went out on the boat again, wondering how long it would last. Some people started getting kind of sick. It wasn’t an actual feeling of being ill, though. It was more like fatigue, like something was off, something was wrong. It was pretty creepy. Most of us aren’t used to all that sun and heat. It got up to 28 degrees [Celsius].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There isn’t a lot of action in Ocean Falls, and sleep comes easy with all the rain, the quiet, and isolation. But 3 days of sunshine busted that habit. “When it rains more than usual we like to sleep lots,” admits Nick, “but with the sun and the heat you couldn’t go to sleep.”</p>
<p>The weather has a special relationship with place. At its most elementary level the weather is itself a feature of place. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331211412269">Brassley (1998)</xref> has argued the weather is an ephemeral landscape. “Natural ephemera,” he explains, “range from the slow cyclical progress of the seasons to the momentary effects of sun and cloud. They result from the interactive changes of weather and the seasons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331211412269">Brassley, 1998</xref>, p. 121). Most of the ephemeral changes the weather and place undergo are anticipated. Tidal movements and normal variations in temperatures and barometric pressure are routine, though at times ephemeral changes brought by dramatic and unusual atmospheric phenomena come more or less unanticipated. Unanticipated changes such as Ocean Falls’s last summer heat wave are the subject of much local attention and even drama. But whereas unanticipated changes evoke the most clamorous of reactions, anticipated ephemeral changes enter the realm of familiarity in such depth that they become part of place itself. Indeed ephemeral changes are so part and parcel of place that places cannot be understood outside of its ephemeral, constant flux. Place <italic>is</italic> movement, and thus inevitably ephemeral.</p>
<p>Weather makes place symbolically meaningful as well. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331211412269">Matthewman (2000)</xref> has argued, “weather at once speaks to notions of identity, community, locality, ‘race,’ and nationality” (p. 209). Few identity performances epitomize West Coast culture more than the sense of distinction—whether loved or loathed—that the rain and warm temperatures. Canadians regularly identify the entire territory north of the 49th parallel with ice, cold, and snow (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211412269">Berland, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211412269">1994</xref>). But most often these caricatures tend to misrepresent the West Coast where the temperature rarely dips below freezing. Dwelling in and weathering a particular climate and representing that climate to others through discourse affords place-based distinction. In this sense, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211412269">Berland (1994)</xref> argues about Canadians versus Americans can be argued about West Coasters versus the rest of Canada: “an affirmative awareness of local climate becomes an identity and difference: among regions, countries, ethnicities, livelihoods” (p. 94). These differences arise within the regional realm too. Ocean Falls residents are “the rain people;” the west coast of Vancouver Island is storm country; and Victoria—protected from the rain by the Olympic Mountains rain shadow—is the “garden city.” When one of our informants moved from Victoria to Vancouver recently, family and friends warned her, “The rain in Vancouver will drive you crazy.”</p>
<p>If weather is a medium, it is also a medium for the expression of various layers of collective identity, and for the framing of experience. All summer long in Vancouver, Lindsay loves “to bask in the sun, swim in the ocean, kayak with blissful abandon across sun-drenched water.” But after a lot of sun, just like Nick, she starts to crave the rain:
<disp-quote>
<p>Crave? Yes. Because with the rain comes a gloomy permission, or rather, a permission to be gloomy, introspective, moody, self-absorbed, even depressed, maybe. The rain gives me the right to examine dark interiors that sunshine does not invite—all that bright light is far too happy. When the rain comes, I head to the library, walking, sloshing, trudging through puddles and letting myself get soaked en-route. The rain turns me into a “cocooner,” a lover of books, a tea drinker, a recliner looking for tactile fabrics to soothe my cold wet self; flannel and fleece are good company. Rain invites my solitary self. The West Coast love affair. Who else would live here unless in a love affair with rain? A certain type; melancholic maybe? The rain gives me permission to go to all the places of deep personal drama, trauma, fear and trepidation. All the mysteries, cruelties, ironies and cloudy thoughts that nobody talks about on a sunny day. A rainy day gives me a break from the expectation of having to be happy, or balanced, well adjusted, content. For those like me who want to contemplate the deeper side of life the rain is the perfect catalyst to feel all those old and difficult emotions that do not accompany a day on the beach, a walk in the park, a happy, sunny, (bloody) sunny, day! The rain brings out the deep and dark side of my previously party girl life. The dark evenings and heavy sound of rain gives me permission to stay home and read serious books while drowning in brooding thoughts.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Weathering the rain the way Lindsay does is an “acquired taste” of sorts, and a great example of somatic work. Acquired tastes are learned dispositions to appreciate the peculiar aesthetic elements of something, in spite of their alleged disqualifying characteristics. Acquiring a taste is a way of making sense of the world, of cultivating strangeness and weaving it into familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331211412269">Haapala, 2005</xref>). Learning to live with the rain is an instance of somatic work because—in spite of the rather basic need for warmth and shelter that reputedly characterize all human beings—it requires a reflexive perceptive strategy and manipulative action. For example, while most people recur to umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain, few west coast residents do. This phenomenon never fails to surprise visitors from the rest of the country and the world. As Mike explains, “we have learned to live in the rain; it rains so often that we don’t need protection from it, as if it was an unexpected and unwanted guest. People get used to it: it’s the place they live in.” Just about every British Columbian has a story to tell on how an outsider to the region, after visiting the coast for the first time or moving here, gasped at the very thought of how a mundane activity such as walking outdoors or gardening could take place in the pouring rain. And yet, over time, outsiders develop an understanding and an appreciation of these otherwise unseemly behaviors; if life as usual were to stop for a rainy day, nothing could go on.</p>
<p>Lindsay turns into a “cocooner” as the sensuous self becomes made up of what it learns to feel, what it learns to do, the ways in which it learns to dwell. Being-in-the-weather is no different than any other form of being-in-the-world, and it becomes the basis not only for skill, but for personal, social, and collective identity, and also for the very subjectivity of weather and of place. Thus, learning to weather places involves immersing oneself not only in a particular world of atmospheric conditions, but a meaningful and sensuous world: a sensory order weaved by sensations, skills, affect, and intersubjective values and dispositions shaped by endless articulations of comparisons with other, different weather patterns and places. Thus, just like we can never think of place without self (or vice versa), we can never think of places without their weather.</p>
<p>A simple and convenient way of referring to both the place dimensions of weather, and the climatic components of place, is the concept of <italic>weather-place</italic>. As all places do, a weather-place “owes its character to the experiences it affords to those who spend time there—to the sights, sounds and indeed smells that constitute its specific ambience. And these, in turn, depend on the kinds of activities in which its inhabitants engage. It is from this relational context of people’s engagement with the world, in the business of dwelling, that each place draws its unique significance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2000</xref>, p. 192). Weather-places are the interactional outcomes of weathering.</p>
<p>Just like weather-places are “enselfed,” they are embodied: an outcome of affective and sensual practice and experience. Similarly, bodies are emplaced and always constituted within weather-places. “The body is the vehicle of being-in-place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 413) in two important ways. First, the body is “outgoing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 414) in the senses that it physically and materially goes out to meet weather-places. This is a basic form of directional movement: lateral, vertical, and horizontal. As people seek out, or stay in, the weather-places where they feel they belong they encounter sensations of balance—intended as harmony with one’s place—or lack thereof. Second, the body is “incoming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 414) in that it is inscribed by the weather-places it has encountered and known, weather-places which leave traces of a body’s specific “somatogeography” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 414). A body is shaped by the weather-places it has come to know, shaped by a special kind of “placial incorporation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey 2001</xref>, p. 414). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331211412269">Milligan (1998)</xref> has referred to this somatogeography as a place’s interactional past, that is, as an ensemble of memories tied to experiences that have unfolded within a place.</p>
<p>The weather’s somatogeography is both tenacious and subjectivizing. It is tenacious in that weathering places often leave a lasting trace on our bodies, a mark of intense experiences or prolonged ones, which “lingers in us indefinitely and in a thousand ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 414). What lingers are affective sensations that may fall dormant for years but that once reawakened by weather conditions can bring one back into a particular weather-place and into the lived bodily experiences of the time. The weather’s somatogeography is subjectivizing because the weather is in us, incorporated into our very identities, into our very dwellings and sensations. Paraphrasing both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211412269">Berland (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey (2001)</xref> we may say that to be subject to weather-place is to be who we are as an expression of our weather-place. In becoming subject to weather-places over time our bodies become our weather regions. Hence weather and climates become part of our character, of how we compare ourselves to others, of how we judge the day. The weather is persistent within our bodies. The clouds may sail away with the wind, but they remain within us, as our clouds, our overcast skies, our horizon line, forming an “idiolocalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 415) which invokes the subject who incorporates and expresses a particular place, and the peculiar places that envelops this subject.</p>

<sec id="section4-1206331211412269">
<title>Moving With the Weather</title>
<p>Weather is sheer movement. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito (2005)</xref> has remarked, our sensual experience of weather cannot be understood outside of the weather’s constant movement, and the ways we move along with it. Movement is synonymous with change, as well as a cause of change. People talk about the weather because it changes regularly enough to allow for habituation, but irregularly enough to allow for surprise and drama. We would not chit-chat about the weather, or attempt to predict it, if it did not move. But weather is also meaningful movement in itself, meaningful in the sense that its changes are not expressive or referential, they are not representational or symbolic. The constant movement of the weather is a desirable state in itself—regardless of what atmospheric conditions changes may bring—because the weather is part of what provides life, growth. Not one of the people we spoke with told us they wished the weather remained always the same: few occasions are celebrated as unanimously as a downpour after a long stretch of sunny days, or a warm and sunny day at the end of streak of brutally wet and cold days. The impermanence, transience, instability, evanescence, and uncertainty of weather are celebrated aesthetic values because, at least in part, they remind us of the timelessness of nature and the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Movement can be loud, heavy, and it can move us in turn, in many ways. For Toby rain on the roof of her house is like thousands of pixies river-dancing. Heavy rain on the roof, even if it happens to be the roof of her house, always takes Toby back to a boat, to her dad’s boat or later in life her own boat. Sitting out storms under the sound of heavy, torrential rain. Rain that lasts for days and days and weeks. Rain that hides any scrap of blue sky for months. Rain is life on Lasqueti. Not because it rains more here than it rains elsewhere on the east coast of Vancouver Island, but because Lasqueti—more than anywhere else on the coast—dwells off the grid. Small island, dirt roads, wood heating, big gardens, long bike ride to school, long ferry ride to “the other side,” no street lights, no easy plug in power. Rain simply means more work in all this, more movement. It means getting dressed up before running down to the woodshed to get the nights’ firewood. It means extra layers, especially if the mode of transportation is foot or bicycle. It means dark, dark nights. It means pot holes in the gravel roads. It means washed out hills, on the gravel roads. It means mud. Thick, sticky, everywhere mud. It means dripping mud rooms and steamy dry-rooms. It means wearing gumboots out to the community dance, and brining a pair of nice shoes to change into.</p>
<p>Rain means different sensations. Your food comes from the garden, which means a soggy trip in gumboots. Or it comes from the tiny shop which hardly has anything to sell, which means another drudge through the mud, up the driveway, into the mud-caked truck and into False Bay and back. Or food and supplies come from the other side: Vancouver Island. The foot passenger-only ferry across leaves from False Bay, so you endure the rough, muddy trudge up the driveway with whatever is headed across with you. Park in False Bay, hike down the hill (again in the mud) with your purse, your dirty laundry to take over and wash, your dog who needs to see the vet, your fresh slaughtered pig chopped into pieces and shoved in totes on its way to the butcher, your generator that needs a tune up at the dealership, your kid(s), and whatever else you’re bringing along. Load everything onto the ferry. Endure the usually stormy ride—choppy, sloppy, messy seas—often completed with a few seasick passengers polluting the air and space with the sounds and smells of vomit. Then there are the chaotic hours on the other side, dealing with said laundry, dog, pig, kid, generator, and so on. And, the time constraint: to be back on the ferry. Every trip between car, ferry, into the car parked on the other side, waiting. And from the other-side-car back onto the ferry, and from ferry back into the Lasqueti car, every trip means wet. Wet laundry, wet dog, wet pig, wet kids, wet groceries. Then, after this day, this long, trying, wet day, you get home. But you are still wet. No drive-in garage. There is a trek, by trail from car to house, so again everything gets wet, or perhaps wetter. Then once in the house it is not a matter of turning up the heat. It is about still staying wet, lumbering down to the woodshed, splitting kindling, stacking arm loads of fire wood and setting about the task of lighting a fire in the house. Once the fire is going—everything must be unpacked and hung and strung about—to dry . . . clean laundry, dog, groceries, kid . . . all this—for a few groceries and supplies from the other side when it’s raining.</p>
<p>Moving in the rain is different in the city. Tracy grew up in Jamaica and then moved to Toronto. Vancouver is the place she calls home right now. Vancouver is easier to move around than Toronto on a winter day. One of the primary feelings that Tracy associates with being in Vancouver is relief: “relief that I am unlikely to ever have to stand at a bus-stop while the -40 degree wind chill cuts through me like a jagged knife with rusty edges.” She is not alone. Many of our informants told us they moved away from central and eastern Canada to be able to move more freely. Pete explains, “I don’t like driving, but I’d rather drive in the rain than in snow and ice. Plus, I like to go for walks, and I like running. Try and do that in Edmonton in January. You asked me why I moved here. Well, because I couldn’t move around there.”</p>
<p>For Tracy, moving about town in the rain is also associated with a special memory of when she first came to Vancouver: “I was walking to the gym. It was raining so hard that water was dripping off my hair and nose and I felt as if I was almost becoming part of the rain itself.” Tracy lives by Stanley Park and that walk gave her “a sense of being connected to the primordial elements of nature around: the old growth forest, rocks, and ocean that had experienced many downpours before” her arrival to the city. Merleau-Ponty’s words on contemplating the blue of the sky might come in handy to interpret Tracy’s experience, save for the <italic>blue</italic> part of his reflection. “I am not set over against [the sky] as an acosmic subject,” writes Merleau-Ponty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331211412269">1968</xref>, p. 214), “I abandon myself to it and plunge into this mystery . . . I am the sky itself as it is drawn together and unified . . . my consciousness is saturated with this limited blue” or, well, grey.</p>
<p>Tracy and Paula enjoy the rain for the ways it affords movement, whereas others view the wet coast’s climate as the occasion for different types of movement. Paula, for example, hated living on the rain coast, and eventually she had to move away from it. With her parents she relocated to Vancouver when she was 15 years old and she lived there until she was 32, when she relocated to Vancouver Island where she lived until the age of 39. Paula calls the interior of the province home. 100 Mile House is where her heart, home, is. She’s never been able to associate Vancouver or Vancouver Island with a sense of home. Of all the things that she disliked about Vancouver in particular, was the weather: “the weather impacted my ability to appreciate anything else about this area.” Paula just moved back home, to the interior. She’s just had enough rain. Living in Victoria Cynthia and Russ feel the need to move down to California every year so that they can “see the sunshine and renew” themselves. Many other local “snowbirds” like to move to Arizona in order to weather the British Columbia winter in absentia. Ashley “battle[s] with migraine headaches, sinus infections, and joint aches and even depression” and has to get out of the region periodically too.</p>
<p>Victoria was never home for Radha either. She lived there for 1 year for school and the stagnant character of the rain made her feel unable to move. She “experienced a radical shift in climate from the warm dry prairies of Calgary” where the weather changes very frequently and suddenly “to the wetter marine climate of Victoria where the long rainy season depressed me,” she says,
<disp-quote>
<p>the grey skies, the all-pervasive wetness, dampness, and the cold moisture made me long for home. I found the misting rain especially annoying because I would rather have the rain come down in sheets, leaving the clouds fluffy and the sky clear rather than days and weeks of misting, drizzling rain with dark skies and charcoal clouds. As an impatient person I like my rain to fall and be done with it, which is why I love Calgary’s thunderstorms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, after breaking her right ankle a couple of years ago, the bone never quite healed properly. Her ankle always acts up in cold or rainy weather, so rain time becomes Tylenol or aspirin time. It is a feeling of being stuck. Living in Victoria during the rainy winter months brought Radha down physically. She was in pain most days and the gloomy grey of the sky didn’t help her mood at all. The rain reminded her “of being lonely, and the feelings were reiterated in Victoria,” where she was “away from family and away from friends as well.” The several bouts of the blues were one of the reasons why she says she gained a lot of weight during her stay in Victoria. She reflects,
<disp-quote>
<p>Warm, rich food was my comfort during days or nights when the rain wouldn’t let up, leaving me physically and mentally in pain. I even tried smoking, despite it being against my religion, because I thought that sucking in some warmth might be a good idea, and the nicotine might improve my mood. I stopped after a few cigarettes because I just hated the way I smelled after a smoke, but the weather did depress me to a point where I tried something I truly detest.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She too had to move away because of the intolerable pain and sadness.</p>
<p>Weather-places are matrixes of movement. Ways of moving in a weather-place are ways of perceiving it. Movement, especially slow movement, affords absorption. For example, the level of absorption that living on Lasqueti demands of Toby allows for her thicker discovery (and performance) of the features of that weather-place. Rather than sneak from air-conditioned building to building through underground tunnels and parking lots, skywalks, and cars, Toby’s physical movement and exposure to the elements affords her absorption into place: a sensuous engagement and understanding of place that is so “deeply embroiled that [her] being-in-the-world, [her] very self is part of the scene and not something that hovers above it at a transcendental remove” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 407). This is not only a world of work, but also a world of habit. Habits weave the very fabric of weather-places: “customary actions [that] ensure that the work-world counts as a coherent and lasting world to which recourse can be made again and again: a world that I,” writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey (2001</xref>, p. 409), “the worker, can continually reenter.” Toby’s practical orientation to this work-world—her “customary body,” to borrow from Merleau-Ponty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331211412269">1968</xref>, pp. 139-147)—is composed of demands for problem-solving and responses consisting of skillful behaviors. Her ways of dwelling unfold by means of “concerted bodily movements that are the embodiment of habitudinal schemes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey, 2001</xref>, p. 412).</p>
<p>“Different beings,” writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331211412269">Ingold (2000</xref>, p. 98), “whether or not they qualify as persons have characteristic patterns of movement—ways of being alive—which reveal them for what they are.” Weather systems move in characteristic ways too, and weather-places hold our movements. Either by moving through them, by moving toward them, away from them, or by seeking stillness in them weather-places encapsulate our bodies’ sensuous memories, our kinesthetic paths, our durable habits. To sense the weather is to hold on to places which hold us in return, beyond the present moment and the present space. Movement allows for the unfolding of relations through which beings emerge. The ways in which we dwell within are based in movement. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211412269">Casey (2001)</xref> suggests “there is no place without self; and no self without place” (p. 406). The constitution of the self and of place depends on kinesthesis. Through movement the self uncovers new weather-places and new sensations: “In discovering ourselves in movement and in turn expanding our kinetic repertoire of ‘I cans,’ we embark on a lifelong journey of sense-making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331211412269">Sheets-Johnstone, 1999</xref>, p. 136). The senses are the performative skills we use to explore, and our kinesthetic sense is the most clearly implicated in these processes:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are a moving-in-the-world being. [ . . . ] Whatever the initial way of motivations and incipient intentionalities might be, they develop by way of a tactile-kinesthetic body. That body is itself the object of motivations and intentionalities—in the form of head turning, stretching and so on. In such ways the tactile-kinesthetic body is itself constituted: we put ourselves together; we learn our bodies. We do so through movement. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331211412269">Sheets-Johnstone, 1999</xref>, p. 253)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Practical considerations matter greatly in the affective and sensory ways we relate to weather-place. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1206331211412269">Saito (2005)</xref> observes that our experience of the weather “is intensely personal in the sense that it is circumstance- and person-dependent” (p. 163). Our data, as imaginable, are very inconclusive to this regard. Some people love the rain, some hate, some don’t mind it, and some only like it every now and then. Obviously, this is of limited interest. What is more interesting is the somatic work that gives rise to these dispositions. In almost all of Canada, for example, where the fall and the winter are long and very cold it is rather difficult to pursue outdoor activities year-round. Those people—such as Pete—for whom being outdoors year-round matters greatly—because of their passions, their professions, their hobbies, or their health, for example—view the West Coast, with its relatively warm temperatures and low snow precipitation, as a way to “work” on, to cultivate, their dispositions and inclinations. Many people uproot themselves from the places where they are born and raised to move and grow roots elsewhere. Weaving these routes—from weather place to weather place—with the momentary roots we grown in some weather places, are in great part what weathering is all about. Weathering, therefore, is a form of home-making; “the life of a person,” writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1206331211412269">Wagner (1986</xref>, p. 21) “is the sum of his [sic] tracks, the total inscription of his movements.”</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Whereas debate and research about climate are legion—especially in light of the dominance of climate change in the international political agenda—social scientific research about weather is scarce. The modest attention that weather garners as a topic of social science research is particularly surprising given weather’s omnipresence in everyday conversations, and given that the weather is a primary medium of human existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331211412269">Ingold, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1206331211412269">2007</xref>). With the ever increasing attention to climate, however, research on weather is finally growing, albeit still slowly. To better understand the dynamics underpinning climate and climate change, social scientific explorations of weather in everyday life across societies are especially important not only for their documentary and awareness-raising value, but also in light of the role that context-sensitive interpretive understandings and reflections can play in theoretical development and policy formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331211412269">Hulme, 2008</xref>;).</p>
<p>As students of the senses we have taken into account the weather as a multisensory phenomenon. Throughout this paper we have made the argument that weather is not just something that happens, something that is mere contour to other seemingly more important aspects of daily existence. Rather, we have suggested, weather <italic>is</italic> everyday life because its textures and actions inform our place-based existence in multiple and nuanced ways. Few of our mundane activities remain untouched by weather. The weather shapes our personal and social identities, our lifestyles, our line of work, our places of residence, and our leisure activities. But we are not victims of weather. As reflexive beings, we act toward the weather much like we do toward other people and other inanimate objects—in agentic ways. As the weather moves, we move. We have described these activities as a form of weathering: a skillful disposition toward weather as a taskscape. Like dwelling—a concept with a rich cultural-phenomenological legacy—weathering is an embodied practice, a performance through which we transform the weather-places in which we dwell, and the individuals that we are.</p>
<p>By weathering place we make an environment familiar, at times adapting to it, at times cultivating an appreciation of it, at times hardly coping with it, but always regularly manipulating our own sensations. We have referred to this as an instance of somatic work. Making sense of weather-place occurs through the constant negotiation and re-interpretation of the way we somatically relate to our surroundings. Making sense of weather-place is a hermeneutic, existential activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331211412269">Haapala, 2005</xref>) in that weathering a place is a way of establishing connections, drawing meaning, creating place itself:</p>
<p>While we are living in the lifeworld, doing and making things, acting in different ways in different situations, we create ties to our surroundings, and in this way familiarize ourselves with it. We make the environment “our own,” we create relations that are significant for us and serve our purposes and interests. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331211412269">Haapala, 2005</xref>, p. 44)</p>
<p>In dwelling within a weather-place we develop a relation with it and with the people who share that place with us. We make weather and climate our own. On the basis of our orientation to the lifeworld we form different bonds with weather-place. Indeed we are weather, and weather is us.</p>
