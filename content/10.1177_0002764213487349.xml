<p>This article examines the consequences of undocumented immigration status for those who grow up in the United States. The aim is to examine the relationship between undocumented immigrant status and mental and emotional health. Our efforts focus on undocumented immigrants who arrive as children and spend most of their formative years in the United States. The experiences of these undocumented members of the 1.5 generation are quite different from those who migrate as adults. We are interested in better understanding the effects confusing and conflicting experiences of inclusion and exclusion have on their mental and emotional health as well as the protective factors that may shape resilience. While previous scholarship has drawn some important implications to experiences of stress among undocumented youth and young adults, to our knowledge, no work has been done to explicitly draw the link to mental and emotional health. The article concludes with some suggestions for future research on the topic.</p>

<p>Eighteen-year-old Joaquin Luna Jr. came to the U.S. with his parents as a 6-month-old infant. Growing up in the small town of Mission, Texas, among his American-born peers, this church-attending, guitar-playing, strong student had hoped to become the first in his family to pursue college. Despairing that his undocumented status would block his ability to achieve his dreams to go to college, however, he took his life on November 25, 2011. His suicide triggered a firestorm of attention regarding the consequences for youth living in the United States without legal residency status and refocused awareness on immigration reform, particularly for the “DREAMer” generation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764213487349">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several months later, Yanelli Hernandez Serrano, a 22-year-old undocumented immigrant living in Ohio, was deported to Mexico after having been charged with a DUI. While in immigration detention Yanelli attempted suicide twice—her second and third attempts. Like Joaquin Luna, she had been living in the U.S. since childhood. However, she carried tremendous responsibility, having to begin work at an early age, placing herself in constant risk of apprehension and deportation, and causing ongoing stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of undocumented immigration status for those who grow up in the United States? While the stories of Joaquin Luna and Yanelli Hernandez Serrano represent extreme cases, similar stories of hopelessness and despair are surfacing all over the country. These stories provide some important clues to the conflicted experiences of a group of young people coming of age under untenable legal circumstances. Presently, undocumented immigrants who migrate as children number 2.1 million, just under, 19 percent of the overall undocumented population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764213487349">Batalova &amp; McHugh, 2010</xref>). While their numbers are especially small, compared to the overall immigrant population, their circumstances merit special attention. These young people who migrate with their parents at early ages, and grow up in the United States, move through confusing and contradictory experiences of belonging and rejection as they make critical transitions from childhood to adolescence and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>; Suárez-Orozco, Yoshikawa, Teranishi, &amp; Suárez-Orozco, 2012). They have a constitutionally guaranteed right to a K-12 education, but cannot legally work, vote, receive financial aid, nor drive in most states. They can also be deported at any time. In school they are told that if they work hard they can attain their dreams. But when their peers begin to move through important rites of passage—taking their first jobs, getting their driver’s licenses, and applying to college—their inability to join them sets off a series of discoveries about what it means to be undocumented. In addition to the onset of multiple exclusions, their lives are fraught with feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and guilt.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to examine the relationship between undocumented immigrant status and mental and emotional health. Empirically, our efforts focus on undocumented immigrants who arrive as children and spend most of their formative years in the United States. The experiences of these undocumented members of the 1.5 generation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764213487349">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002764213487349">Rumbaut, 2004</xref>) are quite different from those who migrate as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764213487349">Gleeson &amp; Gonzales, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>). Empirically, we are interested in better understanding the effects that confusing and conflicting experiences of inclusion and exclusion have on their mental and emotional health as well as the protective factors that may shape resilience. While previous scholarship has drawn some important implications to experiences of stress among undocumented youth and young adults, to our knowledge, no work has been done to explicitly draw the link to mental and emotional health.</p>
<p>Thanks to a burgeoning body of research over the last few years, we know much more about undocumented immigrant youth and young adults than we did even 5 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764213487349">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213487349">2011</xref>; Albrecht, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">American Psychological Association [APA], 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764213487349">Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco, Suárez-Orozco, &amp; Todorova, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>). From recent studies, we know they experience high levels of stress due to the barriers of their unauthorized status and decreased motivations in high school. Nevertheless, many questions remain. The dearth of empirical knowledge leaves many questions of how stress intervenes in their mental and emotional health during adolescence and young adulthood. To date, much of what is known about immigrant mental health is based on the experiences of those who migrate as adults. While select studies attempt to draw implications to their children, with only few exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764213487349">Bacallao &amp; Smokowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764213487349">Perreira &amp; Ornelas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002764213487349">Potochnick &amp; Perreira, 2010</xref>), none seeks to explicitly examine these youth’s unique experiences. Nevertheless, we can begin to draw together important implications from the general literature related to immigrant communities and mental health and the more tailored scholarship on undocumented immigrant youth and young adults.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the main factors that have been found to negatively shape immigrants’ health and well-being include <italic>pre- and post-migration trauma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764213487349">Jaycox et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764213487349">Levers &amp; Hyatt-Burkhart, 2012</xref>; Perez-Foster, 2001), <italic>acculturative stress</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764213487349">Finch, Frank, &amp; Vega, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764213487349">Finch &amp; Vega, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0002764213487349">Thoman &amp; Surís, 2004</xref>), <italic>anxiety related to job insecurity and the strains of low-wage work</italic>; and <italic>experiences and perceptions of discrimination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764213487349">Finch, Hummer, Kolody, &amp; Vega, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0002764213487349">Virruel-Fuentes, 2007</xref>). Among undocumented immigrants, immigration status creates additional layers of stress related to a lack of access to resources and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0002764213487349">Willen, 2007</xref>). They face barriers to accessing bank accounts and other financial services, and are less likely than legal immigrants to have health benefits at work. In addition, their fear of deportation negatively shapes self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764213487349">Cavazos-Rehg, Zayas, &amp; Spitznagel, 2007</xref>) and positively predicts stress better than English proficiency and family separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764213487349">Arbona et al., 2010</xref>). Such fears also prohibit them from accessing health services for themselves and their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764213487349">Berk &amp; Schur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764213487349">McGuire &amp; Georges, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002764213487349">Shattell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa, 2011</xref>). Undocumented Latino immigrants have been found to visit doctors less than their documented counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764213487349">Berk, Schur, Chavez, &amp; Frankel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764213487349">Ortega et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the stresses associated with parental immigration status and poverty, undocumented immigrant youth face notable barriers growing up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>). As ethnographic studies have shown, many undocumented immigrants settle in de facto segregated areas of dense poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764213487349">Chavez, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764213487349">Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0002764213487349">Zlolniski, 2006</xref>), and face severe challenges moving from impoverished circumstances to leading lives with a little more breathing room and financial security. Research also demonstrates that their children are much more likely to be poor, live in crowded housing, lack health care, and reside in households where families have trouble paying the rent and affording food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764213487349">Caps et al., 2005</xref>). Adding undocumented status to the already troubling mix of unfavorable conditions severely undermines efforts to move out of poverty. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, the average income of families with at least one undocumented parent is 40% lower than that of either native-born families or legal immigrant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764213487349">Passel, 2006</xref>). Parents in these families are often working in low-paying, unstable jobs for long periods of time. As a result, almost two-thirds of undocumented students under 18 are low-income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764213487349">Batalova &amp; McHugh, 2010</xref>). Such indicators of disadvantage have been clearly demonstrated when experienced in early childhood but may have implications well beyond this stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764213487349">Duncan, Ziol-Guest, &amp; Kalil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa &amp; Kalil, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>But for undocumented 1.5 generation young people, these early problems represent only the tip of the iceberg. As they grow older, family responsibilities increase, while legal options decrease. Research on contemporary immigrant families is finding that many adolescent and adult children of immigrants do not receive financial assistance for higher education from their families and that many actually have considerable financial responsibilities in their households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764213487349">Fuligni &amp; Pedersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco &amp; Suárez-Orozco, 1995</xref>). In some cases, these young people are financially supporting parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002764213487349">Rumbaut &amp; Komaie, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, adolescence and young adulthood bring problems directly related to their own legal constraints. As they begin to make these critical transitions, undocumented youth confront a series of barriers that prohibit them from moving forward in tandem with their documented peers. While friends begin driving, taking their first jobs, and receiving financial aid for college, undocumented youth are legally excluded from these important rites of passage. Qualitative research has linked these experiences to leveled motivations and feelings of anger and hopelessness, particularly near the end of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764213487349">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco, Suárez-Orozco, &amp; Todarova, 2008</xref>). Interview and observational data, show a link between these stressful circumstances and reported anxiety over obtaining jobs and financing higher education as well as constant fears of deportations. Many also speak of deep feelings of shame about their undocumented status and blame themselves for the barriers they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764213487349">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213487349">Abrego &amp; Gonzales, 2010</xref>; Albrecht, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213487349">Castro-Salazar &amp; Bagley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764213487349">Dozier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002764213487349">Perez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764213487349">Seif, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213487349">Abrego (2011)</xref> argues that while for adults the primary experience of undocumented life is manifested in fear, for young people who grow up in the U.S. and are socialized in a school environment the primary experience is that of stigmatization and shame. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales (2011)</xref> argues that this stigma serves as a secondary border, reinforcing legal exclusions. By keeping their undocumented status a secret to peers and even romantic partners, as well as potential mentors and advocates, undocumented youth both disengage from critical networks of support and opt out of activities and potential opportunities (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764213487349">Castro-Salazar &amp; Bagley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, today’s undocumented youth and young adults are also coming of age amid a hostile political backlash and rising anti-immigrant sentiment that has produced a hostile climate, ratcheting up levels of fear in immigrant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764213487349">Massey &amp; Sánchez, 2010</xref>). Over the last decade, as hate crimes largely against Latino immigrants have gained increasing visibility, federal immigration raids of workplaces and private homes have intensified, resulting in the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764213487349">Capps, Castañeda, Chaudry, &amp; Santos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764213487349">Chaudry et al., 2010</xref>). In this last fiscal year, ending September 30, the U.S. deported more than 400,000 immigrants. Swept up in this immigration “dragnet” have been many high school graduates and college and university students who have been detained, placed in deportation proceedings, and, in some cases, deported. In the absence of federal immigration reform, hundreds of laws and ordinances have been introduced at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764213487349">Olivas, 2007</xref>) banning undocumented young adults from access to their public 2- and 4-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2010</xref>). Taken together, these trends have heightened levels of anxiety and fear throughout immigrant communities. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, more than one in two Latinos worry about discrimination and deportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764213487349">Lopez, Morin, &amp; Taylor, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, this hostile social and political climate, the cumulative stress from increased responsibilities to contribute to their families, decreased options to participate as full members of society, and daily fear and anxiety resulting from the ever-present fear of deportation as well as stigmatized identities can serve to take a toll on youth mental and emotional health.</p>
<p>Despite these students’ challenged circumstances, research has uncovered key mechanisms that promote positive outcomes. For example, when given opportunities for mentorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764213487349">Portes &amp; Fernandez-Kelly, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002764213487349">Smith, 2008</xref>) and financial assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764213487349">Flores, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764213487349">Flores &amp; Horn, 2009</xref>), these young men and women are able to develop academic resilience, performing as well as their legal peers. To be sure, legislation providing in-state tuition has provided a big boost to these students. Scholarship has found that undocumented students in these states are faring better than similar students in states without such legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764213487349">Flores, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764213487349">Flores &amp; Horn, 2009</xref>). Recent studies have examined efforts of undocumented youth and young adults to find ways to make the most of their lives in this country, sometimes through civic engagement and advocacy, fighting to change the laws that define them as outside of society and the perceptions of their outsiderness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764213487349">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213487349">Abrego &amp; Gonzales, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764213487349">Jensen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764213487349">Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002764213487349">Seif, 2004</xref>). As many have settled into adult life, they also try to minimize anxiety and frustration by holding on to tangible aspects of their lives such as relationships, hobbies, and other everyday concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Assessing the mental and emotional well-being of 1.5 generation undocumented immigrant young adults raises several important questions: What are the particular challenges facing undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States since childhood? How do such challenges shape mental and emotional well-being and everyday functioning? And how do the dual experiences of inclusion and exclusion intervene in their self-esteem, confidence, future outlook, self-identity, interpersonal relationships, and development?</p>

<title>Vulnerabilities for Mental Distress</title>
<p>Today’s immigrants are diverse in their origins and the ways in which they are received once in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764213487349">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2006</xref>). While some arrive with advanced degrees, good jobs, and visas, others arrive with minimal levels of education and find employment in low-wage labor markets, and have no documentation. Notably, some parents arrive with high levels of education and some sort of tourist, education, or temporary work, but overstay their permits. For the children and youth who are brought to this country clandestinely, through no fault of their own, there are clear developmental implications for living in the shadows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa &amp; Kalil, 2011</xref>). Presently, there are more than 2.1 million undocumented children and young adults who have lived in the United States since childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764213487349">Batalova &amp; McHugh, 2010</xref>). These young people fall outside normative pathways to adulthood and assimilation. Because this population is still relatively young, it is only very recently that it has received scholarly attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764213487349">Abrego &amp; Gonzales, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Adolescence is a period during which young individuals are concerned about who they are and thus actively explore and start defining their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213487349">Erickson, 1963</xref>). Although often seen as an individual process, identity formation is embedded in larger social, structural, and temporal contexts, each with corresponding sets of values and demands. Such consideration is especially relevant when studying the identity formation of immigrant youth, as they navigate between different cultural systems facing the need to integrate different worldviews into a single, yet plural identity. For several decades now, sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists, among others, have explored the linguistic, educational, developmental, economic, and cultural gaps these individuals have to overcome in order to be successful in the process of assimilation to the host culture as productive and functional adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764213487349">Berry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764213487349">García-Coll et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002764213487349">Rumbaut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco &amp; Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0002764213487349">Whitting, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Adolescence is also a period of particular psychological vulnerability; three-quarters of lifetime psychiatric disorders emerge in adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764213487349">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). While this holds true for the general population, studies focusing on Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. have demonstrated that depressive and anxiety symptoms, along with substance use disorders, are the most prevalent among this specific group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487349">Grant et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0002764213487349">Vega et al., 2004</xref>). While we might assume that undocumented youth are more at risk both because of their parental profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa &amp; Kalil, 2011</xref>) as well as their own immigration status constraints, we know very little about their overall health challenges, given the difficulty in reaching this specific group of immigrants. Chronic diseases among the undocumented are estimated to be relatively high given the existence of several risk factors including poverty, ethnic vulnerability, low educational level, lack of insurance, and thus scarce preventive care and treatment seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764213487349">Chávez, 2011</xref>). Even less data is available in regards to their mental health status.</p>
<p>The few existing studies linking issues related to mental health and undocumented status describe symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as substance abuse disorders <italic>among adults</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764213487349">Kiang, Grzywacz, Marin, Arcury, &amp; Quandt, 2010</xref>). But little is known about the <italic>dynamics</italic> in which these symptoms appear, particularly for youth. For instance, factors like decreased social networks and chronic stress have been shown to negatively impact physical and mental health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0002764213487349">Thoits, 2011</xref>) and to be linked to anxiety and depression symptoms. It is possible to hypothesize that growing up without legal residency status entails a unique type of stress—one that is linked to repeated experiences of discrimination, blocked access to health care and work opportunities, and the urgent need to develop survival strategies to carry out mundane day-to-day activities while under the constant threat of deportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487349">Gonzales &amp; Chavez, 2012</xref>). Extended exposure to stress, especially during childhood and adolescence, is known to create long-standing consequences due to structural and functional changes in individuals’ capacity to deal with and react to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764213487349">Plessow, Kiesel, &amp; Kirschbaum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764213487349">Spear, 2009</xref>). In addition, undocumented status has been shown to have a pervasive impact on the quality and size of the social and support networks, as it alienates the individual from old relationships and fosters a constant fear of “being discovered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764213487349">Abrego, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>). In this context, a significant decrease in social networks becomes especially pervasive because strong social bonds are known to play a key buffering role against stress.</p>
<p>What are the long-standing implications for the development and well-being to these youngsters? What does healthy identity mean for this population? The lack of a theoretical or conceptual model on healthy identity formation among undocumented youth prevents mental health workers from building an evidence-based approach to the vicissitudes this particular population goes through while passing from experiences of belonging in childhood to exclusion in adolescence and adulthood, from a de facto legal status to an “illegal” one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Studying Undocumented Immigrant Youth and Young Adults</title>
<p>Here we provide data from several studies on the West and East Coasts: (a) a 4-and-a-half-year study in Los Angeles, involving extensive fieldwork and 150 individual semistructured interviews with 1.5 generation Mexican-origin young adults (20 to 34 years old) who migrated before the age of 12; (b) a companion study in the state of Washington, involving 40 young adults of the same age range, immigrant generation, and immigration status; and (c) a study of 60 foreign- and native-born Latino and Asian emerging adults between the ages of 18 and 25 in the Boston and New York City metropolitan areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764213487349">3</xref></sup> While the Boston and New York study sampled 1st, 1.5, and 2nd generation respondents, all of the West Coast participants spent much of their childhood, adolescence, and adulthood as undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Of the west coast studies, while the Washington sample consists exclusively of college-going young adults, the California sample includes nearly equal numbers of individuals who dropped out of or completed high school (73) and those who attended at least 2 years of college (77). The pool from which the first author recruited respondents for the study is made up of various community-based settings, including continuation schools, community organizations, college campuses, and churches. Along with the first author who collected all data for the California study, members of the research team in Washington accompanied respondents throughout their school and work days, volunteered at local schools and community organizations, and sat in on numerous community meetings. Through these efforts, we located an initial group of respondents, then utilized snowball sampling to identify subsequent respondents.</p>
<p>The study focuses on the portions of the larger interview that asked respondents a series of questions regarding childhood, adolescent, and early adulthood experiences along the broad themes of family, community, schooling, friendship and social networks, and undocumented status. Transcripts of interviews were analyzed using open coding techniques. Conceptual labels were placed on responses that described discrete events, experiences, and feelings reported in the interviews. Next, each individual interview was analyzed across all questions to identify meta-themes that emerged within each interview. Finally, after analyzing all interviews, responses were examined for common meta-themes across all interviews.</p>
<p>Due to their undocumented status, access to this population is difficult and poses significant challenges to a random sampling design. Our qualitative approach allows for a close assessment of the unique ways in which undocumented status is experienced during adolescence. Furthermore, numerous procedures were put into place to ensure confidentiality. Upon Human Subjects approval, all respondents were given pseudonyms, and none of their personal information—such as proper names of family members, addresses, and names of schools or places of work—was collected. Respondents were asked to provide verbal, rather than written consent, so as not to leave a paper trail with their names. All audiotapes were destroyed immediately after being transcribed, as were all records of correspondence between the interview team and respondents. All interviews were conducted in English and respondents were given gift cards for their participation.</p>
<p>Participants for each of these projects were recruited from community organizations, community colleges, and 4-year colleges using snowball sampling, gatekeeper recommendations, and outreach efforts such as flyers, postcards, and online recruitment. We conducted in-depth interviews that ranged from 1 and a half hours to 3 hours and 20 minutes (in English or Spanish as preferred by the participants) that consisted of a variety of question formats, including structured questions as well as open-ended, semistructured, “person-centered” questions; Q-sorts; sentence completions; and “dilemma” type scenarios. We asked questions designed to gather information about childhood, adolescent, and early adulthood experiences; civic trust; and engagement. Interviews were translated (when necessary) and transcribed. We used open-coding techniques using conceptual labels (and the programs Dedoose and NVivo). Responses were examined for common meta-themes across interviews. This article focuses on interview questions that addressed issues related to coming of age under the shadow of undocumented status.</p>
<p>The four states of our study—California, Washington, New York, and Massachusetts—receive large shares of the country’s undocumented immigrants. While California is known to have the largest undocumented immigrant population in the U.S., New York is only behind two other states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002764213487349">Passel &amp; Cohn, 2009</xref>). In addition, Washington, with its large agricultural industry, is among the top 10 destinations for undocumented immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764213487349">Hoefer, Rytina, &amp; Baker, 2012</xref>), and Massachusetts has a growing undocumented community.</p>
<p>Although interviews were not designed to explore nor assess the participants’ mental health, talking about the experience of being undocumented irremediably prompted the participants to express their feelings about themselves and the experience of living in such a situation. Thus, no formal diagnoses were made during this study, but results rely on the validity of the declarative knowledge of individuals about aspects of their own mental state, such as knowledge about cognitive competence, emotional states, past behavior, personal experience, or aspects of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0002764213487349">Tergan, Knäuper, &amp; Ballstaed, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>By identifying important gaps in current knowledge, these data shed light on the ways in which young undocumented immigrants develop identities and to identify the most important risk factors that might exacerbate mental health problems. They provide insights into understanding the unique dynamics between undocumented status and mental health among adolescents and young adults.</p>

<sec id="section3-0002764213487349">
<title>“Illegality” and Distorted Identity Formation</title>
<p>Like other foreign-born children in a new country, respondents experienced childhood in settings defined by thin boundaries, where school served to bridge the constant movement between cultural systems, and helped them integrate multiple worldviews into one plural identity. As a result, they became proficient in English; learned culture-specific attitudes, behaviors, and values; assisted the older generations in crossing cultural barriers and developed expectations and goals according to the American culture.</p>
<p>However, their transitions from adolescence to adulthood precipitated them into greater levels of responsibilities and engagement with institutions, most of which required legal residency status. At this stage, their undocumented status acted as an externally imposed border that prohibited the accomplishment of important adolescent transitions like finding a part-time job, obtaining a driver’s license, and applying for financial aid for college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>). Seemingly overnight, once-fuzzy cultural barriers become impenetrable. Furthermore, many respondents reported not realizing they were undocumented until these pivotal turning points. As one described, <italic>“It was like waking up to a nightmare”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487349">Gonzales &amp; Chavez, 2012</xref>). For all respondents, this now thick boundary created the need to reorganize, or retell, discourses they held about themselves and to reformulate the answers to the essential questions during adolescence about “who am I?” and “where am I going?” Respondents reported worrying much more about what others thought about them. Miguel, who grew up in Southern California, began to belabor mundane decisions to which he previously gave little thought. <italic>“I didn’t want to be seen as different. I mean, I wasn’t different. But I felt like I had a big sign above my head.”</italic> They also began to reassess future plans. For many, school performance started trailing off during the last years of high school. Carolyn from coastal California summed up the sentiment shared by many respondents:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the longest time I thought I was going one way. You know, we all have a sense of what we hope our future will look like. But all of a sudden I was going the other way, and I couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the mass media and dominant political discourse, the loaded term “illegal” has a clear contextual and political meaning implying that many Americans believe undocumented immigrants do not and should not belong to the U.S. society. It also carries normative messages that these immigrants have broken the law and should be punished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764213487349">Chavez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764213487349">Massey &amp; Sánchez, 2010</xref>). The internalization of such messages left respondents feeling scared, alone, distrustful, without solid footing, and lacking the possibility of successful societal integration as adolescents. Once these negative feelings were integrated into their identity narratives, there were devastating implications for their sense of the self. Respondents articulated a distortion in coherence between previous and current beliefs about themselves as individuals.</p>
<p>Respondents struggled to assimilate their undocumented status as an element of their self-narratives, finding difficulty achieving a sense of coherence and continuity, both essential determinants of a healthy identity. The pejorative and externally imposed label “illegal” progressively became a constituent part of their identity, shaping not only the way in which they defined themselves but also how they interpreted themselves as individuals.</p>
<p>Coming of age undocumented entailed intense feelings of anxiety, confusion, frustration, and stress. Many described heightened feelings of self-awareness. Leticia from Eastern Washington said that her fear prompted her to more carefully scrutinize the clothes she wore.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know why but I was afraid of being seen as an immigrant. I told my mom that I needed new clothes. She couldn’t understand. I didn’t know how to explain it, but I started doubting myself a lot.</p>

<title>Missing Milestones and Constricted Trajectories</title>
<p>Important questions about “Where am I going?” tacitly imply that individuals are able to progressively gain independence through tangible milestones such as obtaining driver’s licenses, applying for jobs, and college, and have minimum levels of certainty about the future with a projection of goals that are attainable in the medium and long term. Adolescents require a certain level of congruence between the current self-defined meaning of oneself and its continuity into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002764213487349">Schwartz, 2001</xref>), including goals, aspirations, and ideals. For undocumented respondents, the sense of dislocation, the uncertainty about their future along with the eventual resignation to the restrictions of the immigration status, had a powerful effect on their self-esteem, motivation, sense of personal empowerment, and self-advocacy (Viruell-Fuentes, 2007), as well as the projection of themselves in the medium and long term. Their undocumented status affected their sense of self-efficacy, closely tied with the conviction of having a defined purpose in life. Sergio from a large suburb in California put it this way: <italic>“When you don’t have papers you don’t have any motivation. I mean, you can’t go further than where you are.”</italic></p>
<p>Respondents’ realizations of their legal exclusions from adolescent rites of passage and the onset of a stigmatized status manifested in various areas of their lives. For instance, we found a link between how early a person came to know about his or her immigration status (i.e. knowing as children vs. finding out later in life) and educational trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>). Among the participants, those who came to learn of their undocumented status early on achieved modest levels of education. While it is not possible to assume a causal relationship, personal empowerment and self-motivation are known to be important predictors of educational attainment, along with the relative value given by the individual to more years of education based on his or her perspective of succeeding in the future. Knowledge of one’s undocumented status and a revised perspective of success in life decreased the value attributed by respondents to themselves and—in most cases—diminished the prospect of achieving more years of education.</p>
<p>Chuy, from a large urban area in California, described this time as a low point in his life: <italic>“I felt really alone and didn’t know what to do. I felt like giving up. Just giving up on everything. I mean, why should I try? What good was it going to do? That’s what I thought.”</italic></p>
<p>Respondents who dropped out of school tended to have children earlier, were in more direct contact with law enforcement, and had greater contact with drugs and alcohol. While the association between these outcomes and school dropout has been previously documented among the general population, a closer look at the differences between respondents who continued in school and those who dropped out reveal that among this group of undocumented youth the devaluation of the self in light of a re-signification as undocumented immigrants not only influenced their motivation to remain at school but correlated with life choices that reflect less self-care, more impulsivity, more risk-taking behaviors, and increased orientation towards immediate reward despite the apparent irrationality of such choices.</p>

<sec id="section5-0002764213487349">
<title>Isolation and Contracting Social Networks</title>
<p>Legal exclusions and the inability to participate in important adolescent rites of passage that peers were moving through led to social isolation. In order to keep secrets about undocumented status, most respondents created alternative narratives, as to why they were not working, driving, or going on to their dream colleges. Having to conceal important details about their lives with peers and friends led to the severing of important networks of support.</p>
<p>Grace, from inland California, described the impact on her social life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just stopped going out. I was tired of asking for a ride and coming up with excuses and every time it was a hassle with my friends. They wouldn’t let it go. They wouldn’t let it go. So I started telling them I was too busy with school. At first they didn’t like that, but after a while they stopped inviting me. I end up spending a lot of weekends by myself because most of my friends don’t call me anymore. It’s such a hassle to explain everything to people. And it has affected the way I am when I meet new people. I used to be very outgoing, but I try to keep my guard up, try not to get too close to people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants reported spending less time in public spaces, venturing less and less outside of their communities. All the respondents reported intense feelings of isolation and hopelessness derived from the extreme concealment, self-censure, and hyperawareness about others discovering “who they really are.” The longer participants were aware of their immigration status, the more likely they were to anticipate negative reactions against them. Respondents talked about emerging difficulty to trust and count on their friends, as they felt in constant danger of being discovered and denounced. Few new relationships were established, and respondents struggled to build and maintain healthy relationships. These experiences constituted another bump in their development, as healthy relationships require individuals capable of trusting others to build meaningful connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0002764213487349">Winnicott, 1971</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0002764213487349">
<title>The Chronic Stress of No Place to Belong</title>
<p>At some point in their adolescent lives, respondents’ undocumented status began to subsume most activities and identity choices. After periods of struggling with legal restrictions and resisting the idea of becoming an “illegal immigrant”—albeit without a clear picture of how to reorder their lives and their future perspectives—participants eventually came to accept that their immigration status inevitably generated uncountable constrictions of their life plans and goals. These restrictions not only became materialized into reported experiences of exclusion, discrimination, and isolation but also as a stigmatized identity that was gradually assimilated into the core identity discourse of these young individuals. As they learned to live with such restrictions, these external barriers were progressively internalized, starting to function as an internal boundary, or border, with implications for almost every aspect of their lives, extending beyond the immigration barrier itself with deep implications for their identity, mental health, and well-being.</p>
<p>Repeated attempts by respondents to restructure their self-narratives of identity, with the dawning awareness that they had no place to belong, elicited feelings of uncertainty and stress. The fear of deportation was a constant threat to the continuity and congruence of the self at a symbolic level. But meeting daily and family needs was also a concrete and ongoing stressor. At the same time, many respondents had considerable responsibility of taking care of younger siblings, acting as a go-between for their parents and school teachers and other institutional agents, and taking jobs to contribute to family finances requiring active venturing into the society. Balancing these two realities required the development of diverse strategies such as using false forms of identification in order to acquire work or driving without license (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764213487349">Chavez, 1998</xref>). While these strategies were useful for solving immediate, day-to-day problems, as markers of undocumented life they added to respondents’ identity incoherence and stigma, providing added layers of stress and anxiety. Many described constant worry about getting caught and always having to look over their shoulders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487349">Gonzales &amp; Chavez, 2012</xref>). Such exposure to chronic stress is especially harmful for adolescents because this particular developmental stage entails far-reaching neurobiological and psychological reorganization including structural changes in stress and emotion reactive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002764213487349">Stortelder &amp; Ploegmakers-Burg, 2010</xref>). A drastic increase in stress levels during adolescence is linked to vulnerability to numerous negative affects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002764213487349">Spear, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the discovery of the undocumented status, along with the exposure to experiences of stigmatization and discrimination led to internalizing the self-stigma of being <italic>“illegal”</italic> with immense consequences for their identity, relationships, and mental health. The respondents self-described isolation in order to hide their “secret” was problematic in and of itself. Concomitantly it led to a progressive ossification and internal constriction to grow, to explore, to be creative, to build and pursue goals. This boundary not only caused strong feelings of frustration and anger but triggered a process of grief for the person they might not ever be. Jessica from a small town in Washington told us that by the time she was 19, she could hardly see any of her former life in her present activities. <italic>“Nothing was the same anymore. Everything I thought I was going to be, everything I did, totally different. It was like I was living some other person’s life. But it wasn’t. This was me. It was my life.”</italic></p>
<p>This particular grief, which confronts individuals with multiple losses, including identity, sense of belonging, and role definition—is akin to the anticipatory grief experienced by people with diseases leading to functional loss or possible death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764213487349">Hottensen, 2009</xref>). Working through this type of grief is especially difficult due to the uncertainty of the outcome. Spending time with respondents allowed us a detailed picture of its effects. Respondents described a range of symptoms typically linked to unsolved grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764213487349">Lannen et al., 2008</xref>) like changes in appetite, trouble sleeping, anxiety, aggressiveness, anger, lack of desire to carry on, and decreased physical health including gastrointestinal symptoms and hair loss.</p>
<p>The subsequent reorganization of identity discourse that followed respondents’ revised self-valuation impacted important health-related decisions. For many other respondents, as initial problem-solving strategies faltered, the mounting stress progressively reduced their functionality. Indeed, long periods of stress are known to decrease cognitive performance, short term and working memory, and also decrease impulse control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764213487349">Plessow, Kiesel, &amp; Kirschbaum, 2012</xref>). For some respondents the patterns fell in what has classically been described in the literature as externalizing behaviors—engaging in excessive drinking and experimentation with other drugs; and arguments with peers, teachers, or their parents.</p>
<p>Manny, from an inner-city area in Southern California, recalled feeling as though nobody understood him.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It really made me mad. Nobody understood. I know I didn’t let them in, but it just frustrated me. You know, get off my back. And it would really make me mad when they assumed I was being lazy. If only they knew [shaking his head].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For some it led to externalizing and acting out behaviors, such as substance abuse or engaging in sexual behaviors, that have been found to be especially relevant during adolescence and young adulthood. Increased alcohol and drug use was described by several respondents as a way to self-medicate distress. Geraldo from inland California reflected on his excessive drinking: <italic>“I was like ‘screw it, it doesn’t really matter anyway.’ I just felt numb.”</italic> In the cases where substance use was a problem, it contributed to a build-up of negative emotions, resulting in “acting out” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002764213487349">Oliffe, 2010</xref>), and precipitated further risk-taking behaviors, aggression, and potential for self-harm in other dangerous ways. Geraldo’s drinking led to several problems, including arguments with his girlfriend, and his mother asking him to leave her home because she had become scared of his behavior. Other respondents shared stories of running away from home, a decline in school performance, and arguments with friends and teachers. All this is especially concerning as many forms of risk behavior initiated in adolescence (drug use, for example) are known to elevate the risk for the behavior in subsequent adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002764213487349">Steinberg, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For many others, however, we see a classic pattern of internalizing, or turning inward the distress. Many participants spoke of their anxieties, of chronic sadness, of depression, of overeating or undereating, of difficulties sleeping, and of a desire simply to never get out of bed. Participants talked about exacerbation of chronic diseases like high blood pressure, chronic headaches, toothaches, and bodily pain that have been reported to be experienced by highly acculturated immigrants with chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764213487349">Bui, Doescher, Takeuchi, &amp; Taylor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764213487349">Hacker et al., 2011</xref>; Viruell-Fuentes, 2007).</p>
<p>Still others described symptoms of self-harm behaviors and suicide attempts as a last resource to try to escape their situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0002764213487349">Zayas, 2011</xref>). In a group conversation with Jenny and her longtime boyfriend Jesus, Jenny described her former self-destructive behavior.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I was younger I used to cut myself. You can’t hardly see it because I got a tattoo to cover it up. Those days were really hard. I don’t know how many times I thought about ending everything. It’s hard to describe that place. It was hard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several of these young people talked about past attempts of suicide. Julia recounted two separate attempts in a period of 3 months. She said she had <italic>“gotten to a place where I lost hope.”</italic> The reasons others gave for considering suicide included the discovery of undocumented status and their legal limitations, ongoing stress and worry, multiple experiences with exclusions, and not being able to envision themselves in the future. The multiple experiences of acute mental distress described by respondents—along with a revised self-definition; a diminished self-value; and the age-related vulnerability to depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and impulsive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764213487349">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011</xref>)—got aligned as risk factors contributing to a particularly severe risk of suicide attempts and successes.</p>
<p>A common denominator of many of the respondents’ narratives was a strong difficulty to imagine themselves in the future. The suicide thoughts and attempts were a clear allusion to the sense of hopelessness and despair they experienced during adolescence as they looked ahead to an uncertain adulthood, a process that for them also meant burying aspirations and dreams. Their situation became more severe as the solution to the core stressor –their undocumented status—was beyond their control. Extreme isolation and concealment, graduation from educational institutions without tangible options, and reported fears and anxieties about becoming adults were all good predictors of suicide amongst the participants in our study. With no place to belong, no clear roles, no sense of meaning, what could the future mean?</p>

<title>Maintaining Hope in the Face of Hopelessness</title>
<p>Essential to mental health is the capacity to maintain hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002764213487349">Seligman, 1990</xref>). For unauthorized youth coming of age without a clear sense of where and how they belong in society, maintaining a sense of hopefulness is often severely compromised. In spite of these daunting obstacles, we have encountered youth that are remarkably resilient maintaining hope in the face of hopelessness.</p>
<p>Those who were able to maintain strong friendships or had caring adults (teachers, counselors, or other adult mentors) with whom they could talk openly about their struggles described less emotional distress and were much more likely to remain at school. Carolina, who disclosed her immigration status to her best friend and high school English teacher, felt as though doing so opened up possibilities she did not think she would have had, if she had kept her immigration status a secret.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what I would have done without their help. I was scared and gave up on going to college. They had to shake me out of it, you know like “snap out of it, okay? You’re going to do it.” I really owe them for that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The capacity to trust others and actively seek out meaningful relationships played a powerful psychological resource for Carolina as well as other respondents in dealing with the stressors created by undocumented status.</p>
<p>We also found that youth that took on a shared identity with others in similar circumstances appeared to feel less isolated. We have spoken to a number of self- identified “DREAMers”—youth who were pursuing (or have pursued) an education in the U.S. and advocating for broader inclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764213487349">4</xref></sup> Many of these youth would benefit from the passing of the Development, Relief, &amp; Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764213487349">5</xref></sup> Excluded from an American identity, though raised in this country, they sought solidarity among others who shared their plight and dreamed for a better future.</p>
<p>Marco, who had been struggling with isolation on campus but began reaching out to other DREAMers, explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I started going to college, I mean, I saw the difference right away between myself and others . . . because I lacked that 9 digit number. But there are a lot of DREAMers in the class—you just don't know who. We—as DREAMers, could have a lot of power, but we are afraid—to come out. And I think that is maybe what's been holding me back. If all the DREAMers would come out, we pretty much—we could make a difference with that little push “you can make it!”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Bella told us,
<disp-quote>
<p>Like when I say I am a DREAMer, I mean I am undocumented, so like, I understand the struggles, I understand what it means to be frustrated, I understand why others like me are depressed, why it's so frustrating to feel like you want to do so much but you can’t. You are so close but yet so far. So I want to work with others like me to help us have an optimistic view. So I like I got involved with and it has been helpful because it has helped me mature and grow as a person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participation in civic activities to effect change can serve as a catalyst out of “learned helplessness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764213487349">Peterson, Maier, &amp; Seligman, 1995</xref>) into “learned hopefulness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002764213487349">Seligman, 1990</xref>). Rumbaut has eloquently described how immigration-related controversies can mobilize some to participate in a variety of civic and political activities in a phenomenon he termed “reactive ethnicity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002764213487349">Rumbaut, 2008</xref>, p. 108). Young people on campus who are “coming out” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764213487349">Jones, 2010</xref>, p. 36), sign petitions, participate in sit-ins, organize letter-writing campaigns in support of the DREAM Act, and engage in public demonstrations, all examples of reactive ethnicity mobilized in the service of civic engagement.</p>
<p>Civic engagement often starts out in an act of desperation—having few options or opportunities. Maya, for example, explained that she had
<disp-quote>
<p>actually graduated from college and I am undocumented, so I felt like I couldn't do anything. And I always felt the need to help other people, like I have my undergrad in psychology, so I always had that need—I feel that need to help people. And I met Manny [a community organizer] and he started talking to me about opportunities for volunteering and I gave it a try. I started working—well, volunteering at the Esperanza Center teaching English as a Second Language. I found that I really enjoyed it, and from there I just started networking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From there, Maya became active in DREAM organizing.</p>
<p>Isabel talked about her work in a community organization with other unauthorized youth:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because I am undocumented, the work that I do there, somehow it also helps me out a little too—you know, in some sense. So I have been working with them since, 2007 and it's just like very gratifying to see how the undocumented youth get to get involved in like their education changing some things that affect them as well and then see how that also impacts their families. So that's why I do it and just because I see the real life change that I can do through the work that I do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bella, undocumented herself, mobilized to start the DREAM Team, a club to support undocumented students on campus, because
<disp-quote>
<p>there was no club whatsoever that could help students who were undocumented, they felt alone. And now, like that I have helped create that club, I see the students and they are like, happier, they are more outgoing, they're like—they're not so into themselves, they're like, into campus life, they're like, very—like, more optimistic about the future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For many college-going respondents, this civic work often turned into a virtuous circle where, by helping others, they found a sense of purpose and a role that served to augment their own well-being.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>The experiences of young 1.5 generation undocumented immigrants transitioning to adolescence and young adulthood reported in this study provide clear examples of the intrinsic connection between human development and broader social, political, and historical contexts. For these participants, becoming adolescents implied entering the world of the “illegal immigrant,” which represented a fracture in their developmental trajectories, forcing a redefinition of their narratives of identity and altering their way of connecting with others, with severe impacts on their well-being. The findings from this and other studies help advance the growing body of knowledge about the impact of the immigration policy on the process of identity formation among undocumented youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764213487349">Gonzales &amp; Chavez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa, 2011</xref>) and can serve as a conceptual platform for further research as well as to point to designing mental health interventions specifically tailored to this population.</p>
<p>The study of the psychosocial development and successful pathway from childhood to adolescence and (eventually) adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764213487349">Erikson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0002764213487349">Whitting, 1990</xref>) among undocumented youth requires recognizing the particularities of their developmental crisis. Long-standing cultural requirements corresponding with adolescence (and leading to adulthood) are presently unattainable to individuals whose lives and identities are at the margins of citizenship. The experiences described by our respondents uncover a large gap in the classical model of development. To be sure, their undocumented status denies them a place in the cultural symbolic order as individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764213487349">Lacan, 1991</xref>), beyond their status as undocumented immigrants. But it is also difficult for scholars to find a place for this particular group when using normative definitions of mental health.</p>
<p>The state of our knowledge, however, is rather nascent. We have conceptual maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>) and a strong foundation of qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764213487349">Gonzales, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764213487349">2011</xref>) to provide a glimmer of understanding into the inner lives and vulnerabilities of undocumented youth. But there is much work to be done. We need mixed methods work that provides insights into prevalence rates on internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as contributing and mitigating factors. The work we have thus far is most strongly focused on Latino populations, and while the largest numbers of undocumented youth are of Latino origin, they are distributed across regions as well as socioeconomic backgrounds. Undocumented youth from all origins are growing up in the shadows across our nation. And it should go without saying that a gendered perspective in this research is essential. Research tells us that across immigrant families and within our social and cultural institutions, adolescent and young adult development is being shaped by ideas about gender roles. Many females, for example, carry a tremendous responsibility for the care of younger siblings and brokering between parents and the outside English-speaking world. Young men, on the other hand, are often singled out as targets for police profiling, and must manage the stress of navigating the outside world by avoiding apprehension, detention, and deportation. Certainly, these burdens fall on young women and men alike. But incorporating a gendered lens into the broader analysis of stressors will provide much-needed nuance to our general understanding.</p>

<sec id="section9-0002764213487349">
<title>Implications for Mental Health Practice</title>
<p>The World Health Organization defines mental health as “a state of well-being, in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0002764213487349">2011</xref>). In sharp contrast, important transitions to young adulthood are distorted by the complex process of coming of age “illegal”—including exclusion, the inability to meet developmental milestones, constricted social networks, and absence of purpose or belongingness.</p>
<p>Given the identity threats and constant exposure to stress outlined in this article, undocumented youngsters are vulnerable to poor mental health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764213487349">Alegria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764213487349">APA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764213487349">Grant et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0002764213487349">Vega et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0002764213487349">Yoshikawa, 2011</xref>). Some youth are at risk of living out the self-fulfilling prophecy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764213487349">Merton, 1936</xref>) and acting impulsively, becoming exposed to harmful situations that can increase their likelihood of coming into contact with law enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764213487349">Menaster, 2011</xref>). Still others are at risk of internalizing the low expectations of the negative social mirror and giving up on themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002764213487349">Suárez-Orozco, 2000</xref>); for these young people, growing up unauthorized means falling prey to internalizing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and the ultimate form of giving up—suicide.</p>
<p>Clearly, citizenship is not a guarantor of mental health, nor does its absence necessarily lead to mental illness. Many of these young people are remarkably resilient in the face of great adversity. Some of our respondents were able to remain functional, maintain relationships, and access higher education, showing good levels of resilience in pursuing high levels of education; advocating for themselves, their families, and their peers; and becoming civic leaders. However, our study suggests that undocumented status can, and all too often is, a catalyst for increased mental distress. Thus, a priority of a mental health intervention for this particular group should be to strengthen the capacity to build a narrative of identity that includes—but is not restricted to—undocumented status.</p>
<p>Developing a sense of belongingness, of meaning, and of purpose—all processes that are prone to disruption in coming of age undocumented—require particular attention and nurture. To that end, we recommend a guided facilitation that allows adolescents the ability to explore and give meaning to undocumented status while providing encouragement for the exploration of other key aspects of their identities. In addition, these young individuals might need assistance to reformulate goals that can be accomplished in the short term while maintaining the motivation required to produce workable routes to achieve desired larger goals. Helping them to identify legally permissible options for education, community participation, civic engagement, and continued belonging can play an important role in reducing anxiety and preventing self-destructive cycles of alternate impulsive behaviors. Mental health interventions can also be of help by strengthening psychological resources and modifying counterproductive coping strategies resulting from the process of <italic>absence of belonging</italic>. Developing positive counternarratives, finding meaningful roles, regaining control over their lives in avenues where this is possible, and establishing alternative pathways of hope are essential for developing and maintaining well-being. Expanding safety nets and social networks are also important steps in helping these youth to realize they are far from alone.</p>
<p>Finally, suicidal thoughts and attempts should be directly addressed in mental health interventions with undocumented youth. Particularly as these young people start leaving school without tangible options, signs like extreme isolation and concealment, and reported fears and anxieties about becoming adults, are indicators that need to be rapidly identified by those involved in the lives of these youngsters, namely, teachers, mentors, counselors, community organizers, and church members. Individuals close to these youngsters (as well as organizations serving them) can (and should) play a key role in providing emotional support, information, structure, and a sense of belongingness in the absence of nationally available membership.</p>
