<abstract>
<p>The mineral content of cancellous bone from sheep and pig vertebral bodies was determined by ashing at 800 °C. The results were compared with published results for human vertebral cancellous bone. The results for sheep (0.37 ± 0.06 g cm<sup>−3</sup>, mean ± standard deviation) were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.127) to those from pigs (0.33 ± 0.03 g cm<sup>−3</sup>). The results from both species were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than those from human bones (0.15 ± 0.02 g cm<sup>−3</sup>). This means that cancellous bone from sheep and pig vertebral bodies is not a good model for corresponding human bone. However, sheep and pig bone are useful, for example, for providing stringent tests of cutting instruments to be used in human spinal surgery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animal models are often used in tests of surgical implants and instruments because the availability of human tissue is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911426807">1</xref></sup> An alternative approach, when investigating bone, is to use a suitable polyurethane foam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911426807">2</xref></sup> for example, to investigate the pull-out force for pedicle screws used in spinal surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911426807">3</xref></sup> but this may not be suitable for some applications, such as developing specialist cutting instruments for spinal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911426807">4</xref></sup> Sheep spines have been widely used as models for the human spine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911426807">1</xref></sup> and pig spines have also been used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911426807">1</xref></sup> Sheep intervertebral discs have been shown to be good models for human discs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911426807">5</xref></sup> The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the cancellous bone in sheep and pig vertebrae can be used to evaluate instruments used in spinal surgery; the gross anatomy is similar, but the properties of the bone have not been evaluated.</p>
<p>Bone ashing is a conventional method for determining the mineral content of bone in biomechanical studies;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911426807">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911426807">7</xref></sup> bone with a high mineral content has a high stiffness and hardness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911426807">8</xref></sup> The bone mineral content of human vertebrae has previously been measured by ashing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426807">9</xref></sup> In this technique, bone is heated to about 800 °C to burn off organic materials; at this temperature, bone mineral does not decompose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911426807">10</xref></sup> The present paper compares the bone mineral content of sheep and pig vertebrae with published human values and discusses the applicability of these bones for evaluating cutting instruments used in spinal surgery.</p>

<sec id="section3-0954411911426807">
<title>Specimens</title>
<p>Three sheep and three pig lumbar vertebrae were obtained from a butcher and used as a source of 12 specimens of sheep cancellous bone and 12 specimens of pig cancellous bone (dimensions about 10 × 10 × 10 mm). Since the specimens were obtained from a butcher, the exact ages of the animals were unknown. However, all were from meat that was suitable for the human food chain in the UK, i.e. from sheep less than 2 years old and pig less than 30 weeks old.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411911426807">
<title>Ashing</title>
<p>Before ashing, the volume of each specimen was determined by X-ray micro-tomography (SkyScan 1072, SkyScan, Kartuizersweg 3B 2550 Kontich, Belgium) with a source voltage of 50 kV and a current of 98 µA. On average, two frames of 2 s exposure time were acquired at each 0.675 ° rotation step. This generated 207 shadow images, with a pixel size of 18.61 µm in 50 minutes. The tomography images were then processed using CTAN software (CT analyser, SkyScan, Kartuizersweg 3B 2550 Kontich, Belgium) to obtain the volume of each sample. The advantages of this method are the ease of measurement and its high precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911426807">11</xref></sup> It has been used, for example, to measure pore sizes in materials used in fuel cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911426807">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411911426807">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bone was ashed (at 800 °C) by exactly the same technique as described in a study of human vertebrae,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426807">9</xref></sup> except that a porcelain crucible was used. The mass of ash was divided by the specimen overall volume to obtain the mineral content of the bone.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The Anderson–Darling test showed that all sets of data were normally distributed. Therefore, they were compared using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test (not assuming equal variances in the samples). All statistical calculations were performed using Minitab Version 15 (Minitab Inc., PA, USA). Thus, three sets of results were compared pair-wise. A more powerful approach might have been to compare all data sets simultaneously using analysis of variance, with the specimen and individual animals as explicit variables. This approach can identify significant correlations that may not be detected by pair-wise comparison, which, nevertheless is still a valid means of testing the hypotheses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911426807">15</xref></sup> However, the results obtained here are so clear (see below) that there was no need to perform a more sophisticated analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results from this study (from sheep and pig vertebrae) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411911426807">Table 1</xref> where they are compared with published results for human vertebrae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426807">9</xref></sup> The human vertebrae had not failed under an applied compression of at least 2.3 kN. However, the source of the specimens included three females aged about 60 years, or above, and a male who died from alcoholic liver cirrhosis; all of their bone could have been osteoporotic. Therefore, a subset of ‘strong’ human vertebra was identified that did not fail, even under an applied compression of 5.5 kN; however, the results from this subset were identical to those from the human population as a whole.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study concentrates on cancellous bone because it constitutes nearly all of the bone in a vertebra; a thin shell of cortical bone then provides stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911426807">16</xref></sup> The ashing technique was used in this study because, unlike the techniques used clinically, it is a direct method for measuring the mineral content of bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911426807">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426807">9</xref></sup> It is also simple and can be performed in most laboratories. Results on human cancellous bone, obtained using this technique, are available in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426807">9</xref></sup> for comparison.</p>
<p>It is clear, from these results, that the cancellous bone from the vertebral bodies of both pig and sheep have about twice as much mineral as human bone. This difference cannot be explained by the human bones being osteoporotic because the same result was obtained from a subset of vertebrae that did not fail under a compression of 5.5 kN (see Results). Radiological measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) have shown that pig vertebral bodies had a consistently higher bone mineral content than human vertebral bodies, but the difference was not as great as that detected by ashing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911426807">17</xref></sup> Cancellous bone in sheep and pig vertebral bodies are very similar to each other, but they are not good models for human bone. Although bone ashing is widely used to investigate mineral content,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911426807">6</xref></sup> no publications were found that are directly related to the subject of this paper.</p>
<p>However, the bone from either sheep or pigs could be useful as a substitute for bone in the development of cutting instruments used in spinal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911426807">4</xref></sup> The higher mineral content of these bones, measured by ashing, means that they are stiffer and harder than human bones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911426807">8</xref></sup>. Thus, they provide a stringent test of any surgical cutting instrument; if it is able to cut these bones without becoming blunt, during the intended life-time of the instrument, then it is likely to cut human bones successfully.</p>
