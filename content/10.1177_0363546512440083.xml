<p>There is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures early in life.</p>

</p>
<p>If you have been watching this space recently, you probably are aware that the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> is celebrating its 40th year of publication in 2012. In January and February, I put my feet up while Jack Hughston and Bob Leach recounted the early history of <italic>AJSM</italic>. When I began to brainstorm for this month’s editorial, I asked myself what I might do to continue the anniversary theme. In preparation of the 2-part history, I had reviewed the contents of the early issues of the Journal. Despite the demurrals of my predecessors, I was impressed with the quality and continued relevance of many of those initial studies, which introduced or developed topics that are still very timely. From the beginning, <italic>AJSM</italic> featured an eclectic mixture of surgery, nonsurgical treatment methods, epidemiology and injury prevention, and translational laboratory research.</p>
<p>Although many articles from <italic>AJSM</italic>’s first years of publication were remarkably prescient of contemporary thinking, it’s not surprising that some of them reported theories or techniques that have since been discarded. It’s human nature to want to forget our missteps and move on; unsuccessful ideas usually fade into oblivion as time passes. In medicine, however, remembering what didn’t work can often be as valuable as remembering what did. Awareness of earlier practices may point out methods that should be avoided in the future or furnish inspiration for approaches that might be fruitful in a different context.</p>
<p>One idea from the ’70s that may surprise younger readers was the concept of using a patient’s meniscus to reconstruct a torn anterior or posterior cruciate ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512440083">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512440083">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512440083">8</xref></sup> While this notion may seem puzzling today, it becomes more understandable when one recalls the state of cruciate ligament care in that era. Because MRI was not available and even diagnostic arthroscopy was limited in its distribution, most ACL tears were not identified until they had led to chronic instability. Even when a correct diagnosis was made at the time of the initial injury, many practitioners did not feel that reconstruction was justified unless a patient had experienced recurrent episodes of giving-way. As a result, patients who came to ACL reconstruction often had concomitant bucket-handle meniscus tears. Preserving one attachment of the unstable meniscus and transplanting the other to the femur seemed like a logical and anatomically economical inspiration to enthusiasts of this technique. The meniscus had a proven ability to survive in an intra-articular environment, and its predominant circumferential collagen fibers would be aligned along the longitudinal axis of the neo-ligament. Supporters of meniscal substitution did not just proceed without thoughtful reflection and research. <italic>AJSM</italic> authors of the era tested the method in an animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512440083">3</xref></sup> and compared its clinical results with patellar tendon reconstruction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512440083">8</xref></sup> urging caution before widespread adoption of the technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512440083">3</xref></sup> Although reported outcomes seemed comparable to other methods of the era,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512440083">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512440083">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512440083">20</xref></sup> enthusiasm for it eventually waned as the importance of preserving the meniscus was better appreciated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512440083">4</xref></sup> and other, more effective alternatives were perfected.</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>AJSM</italic>, several groups of conscientious authors report results that suggest a need to return to the drawing board to develop more effectual methods. In one of the most noteworthy, Smith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512440083">17</xref></sup> investigated the ability of the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) to serve as a screening tool for risk of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament. In recent years, extensive research has been undertaken in an attempt to understand the factors that might predispose to noncontact ACL tears in order to facilitate the recognition of athletes at increased risk of injury and the development of effective, targeted prevention programs. Studies utilizing sophisticated laboratory equipment have identified movement parameters that may place the ACL in greater jeopardy and have even correlated some of these parameters with subsequent ACL tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512440083">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512440083">15</xref></sup> The LESS is the result of one group’s efforts to develop a relatively simple tool for identifying athletes with an increased risk of ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512440083">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior studies by the developers of the LESS have shown that the scores correlated with the results of sophisticated kinetic and kinematic laboratory analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512440083">14</xref></sup> The current effort, from a different research group, attempted to demonstrate correlations between performance on the LESS and subsequent noncontact ACL rupture. This was an ambitious project that received funding from the National Institutes of Health. Over a 3-year period, the investigators screened 5047 high school and college athletes with the LESS during a drop-jump landing. Twenty-eight of these individuals, who subsequently sustained noncontact ACL ruptures, were each matched with 2 or 3 uninjured teammates. Unfortunately, whether the LESS scores were analyzed as a continuous or a categorical variable, the authors were not able to demonstrate a significant correlation with the risk of noncontact ACL injury. This held true both when the injured cohort was considered as a whole and when it was broken down by sex or level of educational enrollment.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this outcome is disappointing. It is important to remember, however, that one study rarely provides the definitive assessment of a technique, even a study as large and as carefully planned as this one. In this case, the authors point out that a much larger number of injured athletes would have been necessary to have 80% power to detect a 3-fold risk increase in each of the 3 higher LESS categories compared with the lowest category. In their discussion, they offer some possible explanations for their findings: The LESS may not be looking at the most discriminating parameters for predicting ACL injury risk, or the drop-jump task may not be the best one for simulating risky athletic activity. I’m sure that the search will continue for a convenient, inexpensive screening tool and we will be seeing additional studies on the LESS and other proposed techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512440083">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several other papers in this issue of <italic>AJSM</italic> report varying degrees of ineffectiveness for the methods they studied. Two of these involve the problematic subject of tendinopathy, in which the role of neovascular ingrowth has generated considerable controversy. In one study of semiprofessional badminton players, Boesen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512440083">1</xref></sup> were unable to find an association between intra-tendinous flow, as measured by color Doppler ultrasound, and the presence or subsequent development of Achilles, patellar, or quadriceps tendon pain over the course of a season. In a therapeutic investigation, Hoksrud et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512440083">6</xref></sup> report a case series of 101 jumper’s knee patients in whom power Doppler ultrasound was able to visualize neovascularity at the site of their pain. These athletes were treated with guided sclerosing injections and followed for 2 years. The outcomes were not as impressive as one might hope: Although there was a significant overall improvement in the group’s mean VISA-P score, few of the patients were cured and the majority still had substantial pain and reduced function at the close of the study.</p>
<p>Studies of diagnostic techniques may also demonstrate the need for further improvement. Elsewhere in this issue, another group of authors attempted to confirm the ability of 2 different MRI classification systems to predict the stability of capitellar osteochondritis dissecans fragments against the “gold standard” of arthroscopic evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512440083">9</xref></sup> Although the 2 systems were fairly sensitive, they both had specificity of only 44%. Accordingly, the authors cautioned that an MRI appearance of fragment stability cannot be relied upon to predict similar findings at the time of surgery.</p>
<p>Reporting the shortcomings or frank failure of a technique may not be as satisfying as reporting a positive breakthrough, but it’s a vital part of the winnowing process that gradually advances medical science. When we fail to report the deficiencies of diagnostic or therapeutic methods, we effectively encourage their continued use and decrease the impetus to develop better approaches. Much has been written over the years about publication bias in medical literature, particularly in the case of therapeutic interventions. Some reviewers have found that studies that demonstrate efficacy are both more likely to be published and to appear in print faster than those that yield negative or indeterminate results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512440083">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512440083">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512440083">19</xref></sup> Critics point out that these proclivities can taint the medical literature so that it only reflects a biased selection of the research that has been carried out.</p>
<p>Studies of publication bias have found that it occurs long before papers are submitted to medical journals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512440083">19</xref></sup> A 2008 analysis of supporting trials for FDA-approved drugs reported that half remained unpublished 5 years after approval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512440083">10</xref></sup> Although registration of prospective trials has been instituted as one means of encouraging balanced publication, studies comparing printed texts with the original trial registrations have shown that even published studies may propagate publication bias by selectively reporting positive results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512440083">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512440083">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The selection process for professional meetings has been identified as one major source of publication bias. Studies with negative findings are less frequently accepted for presentation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512440083">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512440083">19</xref></sup> and rejected meeting abstracts are less likely to be submitted to a journal for consideration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512440083">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512440083">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512440083">21</xref></sup> The body of work that reaches a journal editor’s inbox may thus already be filtered. Some available literature suggests that the journal review process itself may not be biased against papers with negative outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512440083">21</xref></sup> A study of articles actually submitted to the <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic> (<italic>JAMA</italic>) failed to show any bias toward positive results in the rate of acceptance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512440083">13</xref></sup>; this finding was supported by a 2009 systematic review of cohort studies that followed research from its inception.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512440083">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term “negative study” has been applied to investigations that fail to show a difference between 2 alternatives or those that find the experimental choice is less effective than the standard one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512440083">7</xref></sup> In a noncomparative case series, a finding of poor efficacy may also be considered a “negative” result. Not all such studies deserve publication: sometimes the negative outcome of a study stems from poor design, flawed implementation, or inadequate power. A single study, whether positive or negative in its findings, is not as authoritative as multiple studies with similar results. Nevertheless, good-quality negative studies represent an important part of the accumulated evidence and should not be lost from the medical literature. Investigators, journal editors, and conference program committees need to keep this in mind to ensure that the literature accurately reflects the totality of available evidence. Knowing that a technique falls short of expectations can tell us when it’s time to go back to the drawing board to develop a better alternative.</p>
