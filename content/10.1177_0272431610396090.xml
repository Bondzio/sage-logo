<abstract>
<p>School-based peer-to-peer sexual harassment (SH) emerged as an issue of concern in the early 1990s. As a developing field, this literature has several notable gaps. The current study extends previous research by, (a) exploring the understudied experiences of middle school students, (b) assessing students’ experiences <italic>witnessing</italic> SH, and (c) evaluating how SH is related to students’ emotional well-being and academic outcomes. Survey findings indicate that the vast majority of middle school students are both SH targets and witnesses. SH experiences were negatively associated with psychological well-being and academic performance. Psychological distress mediated the relationship between direct SH and academic outcomes; however, no significant relationship was found between witnessing SH and psychological or academic outcomes. Students’ incident reports offered insight into the context of SH. Most perpetrators are male, victims are both male and female, and SH occurs in public spaces with few adult witnesses. Implications for research, practice, and interventions are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>This brief report examines middle school students’ experiences of school-based, peer-to-peer sexual harassment (SH). SH is a significant problem in the lives of young people. Approximately 75% to 80% of students experience direct SH, defined as any unwanted sexual behavior that interferes with a student’s life, prior to graduating high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610396090">Fineran &amp; Bennett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610396090">Lacasse, Purdy, &amp; Mendelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431610396090">Lee, Croninger, Linn, &amp; Chen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>). SH ranges from name calling to unwanted touching, and 58% of harassed youth report that they experience it “often” or “occasionally” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>). As a result of these experiences, youth report negative psychological effects such as feeling upset, worthless, and hopeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610396090">Shakeshaft, Mandel, &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>) and academic withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>). Early experiences of SH have also been linked indirectly to increased shame about one’s body in both boys and girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610396090">Lindberg, Grabe, &amp; Hyde, 2007</xref>). These studies suggest that SH is a common occurrence in the lives of students with potentially serious negative consequences for those victimized. The research on adolescent SH is still quite formative, with several notable gaps regarding age of participants, analytic sophistication when examining the effects of SH, and the exclusive focus on direct victimization experiences. Each of these gaps is described below.</p>
<p>Research indicates that SH becomes a part of students’ school lives early. Across studies, the majority of participants report that their first peer-to-peer SH experience occurred in middle school and some report first incidents occurring as early as elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610396090">Murnen &amp; Smolak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431610396090">Stein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>). Despite these findings, the majority of research on adolescent SH focuses on secondary school youth or retrospective accounts of experiences that occurred during secondary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610396090">Fineran &amp; Bennett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610396090">Lacasse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431610396090">“Sexual Harassment,” 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>). Little research has attended to the SH experiences of students in late childhood (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610396090">Murnen &amp; Smolak, 2000</xref> for an exception) or early adolescence, with few studies providing frequency and impact data focused on middle school samples (e.g., Grades 6 through 8; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610396090">Felix &amp; McMahon, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610396090">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610396090">McMaster, Connolly, Pepler, &amp; Craig, 2002</xref>, for exceptions).</p>
<p>Youth targeted by SH report myriad negative consequences. As a result of SH, youth describe experiencing negative psychological outcomes such as feeling moderately upset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>), feeling worthless, feeling helpless against the harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610396090">Shakeshaft et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>), and feeling afraid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>). Victimized students also report talking less in class (25% of students); difficulty paying attention at school (20% of students); and skipping school, dropping out of activities, or dropping classes as a result of harassment (17% of students; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>). This pattern of findings emerged principally from research asking students to <italic>subjectively</italic> assess how SH affects them; to date little research has <italic>objectively</italic> measured psychological distress or academic outcomes in order to evaluate the associations among these outcomes and SH experiences. The few exceptions to this tend to focus on older adolescents rather than middle school-aged youth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610396090">Goldstein, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean, &amp; Eccles, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610396090">Felix and McMahon’s (2006)</xref> study of multiple forms of peer-to-peer victimization provide preliminary findings regarding middle school students, suggesting statistically significant associations between SH and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Additional research employing objective psychological outcome measures is needed.</p>
<p>Extant research on peer SH among youth focuses exclusively on the experience and impact of <italic>direct</italic> SH. This approach fails to account for the experience and impact of <italic>witnessing</italic> the SH of another student. The majority of youth harassment occurs in public spaces such as hallways, classrooms, and cafeterias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610396090">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610396090">Trigg &amp; Wittenstrom, 1996</xref>) making this a highly visible form of peer victimization. In their own words, youth describe SH as “more usual than unusual” and “a way of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610396090">Shakeshaft et al., 1997</xref>), thus indicating the normalization of this behavior. Given the proportion of youth that are victimized, the frequency of the perpetration, and the locations in which it occurs, it is probable that many young people are both directly targeted by SH and witness the victimization of others.</p>
<p>The current study sought to expand our understanding of middle school students’ SH experiences as well as the impact of SH by answering the following research questions: (a) What are middle school students’ experiences of direct SH? (b) What are middle school students’ experiences of witnessing SH? (c) What is the context of witnessed SH incidents? (d) What are the relationships among students’ SH experiences (both direct and witnessing harassment), psychological distress symptoms, and academic performance (i.e., grade point average)? Students completed a survey that assessed their SH experiences, distress symptoms, and grades as well as a detailed incident report describing a single instance of SH they witnessed. Path modeling was used to examine relationships among SH and the psychological and academic outcomes. It was hypothesized that higher levels of SH would be significantly related to increased psychological distress, decreased academic performance, and that the negative relationship between SH and academic outcomes would be mediated by psychological distress. Gender differences in SH experiences were also examined.</p>

<title>Research Site and Sample</title>
<p>A Midwestern public middle school (Grades 6 through 8) was the focal site for this study. The school is located in a predominantly rural community. Parental consent was sought for all 265 students in the middle school through a multiphase process consisting of multiple mailings, announcements, and phone calls. This process yielded 196 consent forms and 27 refusal forms, thus responses were obtained from 223 out of the 265 parents/guardians originally contacted with an 84% response rate and a 74% consent rate. One hundred eighty six students with parental consent were present on the day of survey administration, and 163 had sufficiently complete data for analysis (i.e., completed at least 75% of each measure). No mechanism was available for systematically evaluating differences among those who responded and those who did not; however, the demographic characteristics of the sample obtained was representative of the school population suggesting nonresponse bias was not a concern. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610396090">Table 1</xref> presents the demographic background of this sample.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-0272431610396090">
<title>Direct SH</title>
<p>The Sexual Experiences Questionnaire-High School version (SEQ-HS) was used to measure direct SH experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610396090">Collinsworth, 2000</xref>). Items reflect a broad range of unwanted, sexual, or gender-focused inappropriate behaviors. The SEQ-HS was selected as the most appropriate measure for this study (as opposed to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610396090">American Association of University Women, 1993</xref> measure) for a variety of reasons. The 13-item American Association of University Women (AAUW) measure is the most frequently adopted measure of youth SH; however, limited psychometric or scale development information has been published on that measure or any of its reincarnations in other studies. In contrast, the SEQ-HS is an adapted version of the psychometrically sound measure of adult SH, the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ). It was born out of qualitative research with women, and its validity and reliability are firmly established in empirical literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610396090">Fitzgerald et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610396090">Fitzgerald, Gelfand, &amp; Drasgow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431610396090">Fitzgerald, Swan, &amp; Magley, 1997</xref>). The SEQ-HS also incorporates substantially more items and accounts for more specific forms of harassment, thus providing greater insight into the nuances of students’ SH experiences than the AAUW measure. This measure has been predominantly employed with high school students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610396090">Ormerod, Collinsworth, &amp; Perry, 2008</xref>); to date, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610396090">Felix and McMahon (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610396090">2007</xref>) have published its use with a middle school sample.</p>
<p>The 29-item modified SEQ-HS asked participants to report the frequency (i.e., “0” meaning <italic>never</italic> to “2+” meaning <italic>twice or more</italic>) at which they experienced a variety of SH behaviors during the current school year. Direct SH scale scores were summed and averaged across all items. Scale scores reflect the overall frequency at which participants experienced direct SH, ranging from 0-2 (Cronbach’s α = .86). SH behaviors are not <italic>necessarily</italic> correlated with one another; therefore, measures of internal consistency (e.g., Cronbach’s Alpha) should be interpreted with caution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610396090">Koss et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431610396090">Goodman, Dutton, Weinfurt, &amp; Cook (2003)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272431610396090">
<title>Witnessing SH</title>
<p>The SEQ-HS was adapted to measure witnessing SH experiences. For example, one item measuring direct victimization read “has any other student pulled your clothing down or off.” This item was changed to read “have you witnessed any other student pulling another student’s clothing down or off.” Items that could not be witnessed were excluded from the measure. One item, “have you seen any students making obscene gestures at other student(s),” was removed from analysis based on extensive missing data. After all modifications, a 24-item measure of witnessing SH remained. As with the direct SH scale, the witnessing SH scale scores were summed and averaged across all items, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 2 (Cronbach’s Alpha = .91).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272431610396090">
<title>Incident report</title>
<p>To capture contextual details about students’ experiences witnessing SH, participants were asked to report about the single most salient incident of SH they witnessed in the past year. Specifically, participants were asked to indicate the gender of the victim and perpetrator (i.e., 1 = <italic>boy</italic>, 2 = <italic>girl</italic>, 3 = <italic>both</italic>), the number of victims and perpetrators (i.e., 1 = <italic>one</italic>, 2 = <italic>two</italic>, 3+ = <italic>three or more</italic>), the location of the incident (i.e., a list of locations was provided and participants circled the location the harassment occurred, with the option of writing in an alternative location not listed), and who else witnessed the incident (i.e., participants were asked to circle 1 = <italic>yes</italic> or 0 = <italic>no</italic> whether or not other students, teachers, or administrators witnessed the event; if yes, participants were asked to indicate the number of people from that category were present: 1 = <italic>one</italic>, 2 = <italic>two</italic>, 3+ = <italic>three or more</italic>; participants also were able to write in someone else who was present that was not represented by these three groups). They also were asked if, to their knowledge, the incident was reported to school officials (i.e., 0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). Descriptive findings are reported (e.g., percentages, means).</p>

<sec id="section7-0272431610396090">
<title>Distress</title>
<p>The 53-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a standardized measure of psychological distress, was selected because it is sensitive to a variety of distress manifestations, are well validated and highly reliable, stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431610396090">Derogatis &amp; Melisaratos, 1983</xref>), has been used in studies of victimization similar to SH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610396090">Koss, Figueredo, &amp; Prince, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431610396090">Moradi &amp; Subich, 2002</xref>), and has been repeatedly used with youth matching the middle school age range (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610396090">Al-Krenawi, Slonim-Nevo, Maymon, &amp; Al-Krenawi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610396090">Kalter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431610396090">McCaskill, Toro, &amp; Wolfe, 1998</xref>). Participants indicated the degree to which they experienced each distress symptom over the previous month on a 5-point scale (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> and 4 = <italic>extremely</italic>). A mean distress score was computed for each participant (α = .97).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272431610396090">
<title>Grade point average</title>
<p>Students reported the number of As, Bs, Cs, Ds, and Fs they received on their most recent report card. Each letter grade was converted to a 4-point scale (i.e., A = 4.0, B = 3.0. C = 2.0, D = 1.0, and F = 0.0), and an average grade point was computed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272431610396090">
<title>Significant life events</title>
<p>The nine-item significant life events index measured events that happened in the previous year that may account for participants’ distress levels. Participants indicated whether they had experienced the described event (yes or no). The average score across index items was used as a covariate in all analyses to account for factors not associated with SH experiences that may have impacted participants’ psychological distress (Cronbach’s α = .63).</p>

<title>What Are Middle School Students’ Experiences of Direct SH?</title>
<p>On average, students reported experiencing approximately 7 of the 29 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.01) direct SH behaviors measured, with a frequency score of .39 (<italic>SD</italic> = .33). Only 11 participants reported never being the target of SH in the previous school year (i.e., they did not endorse any of the direct SH items). There were no significant differences between boys and girls in SH frequency, <italic>t</italic> = −1.02, <italic>p</italic> = .311. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610396090">Table 2</xref> lists the 10 most frequent direct SH behaviors in order from highest to lowest frequency (i.e., percentage of participants reporting experiencing the behavior at least once). The most frequently reported items were primarily forms of verbal harassment (e.g., name-calling and commenting on a student’s body or looks) and fell into the gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention subsets of SH. The least frequently reported items were more physical in nature and reflected unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion.</p>

<title>What Are Middle School Students’ Experiences of Witnessing SH?</title>
<p>On average, students reported experiencing 12 of the 24 witnessing SH behaviors (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.98). One participant endorsed witnessing all 24 of behaviors included on the witnessing SH measure, and only six participants reported never witnessing SH in the previous school year. There were no significant differences between boys and girls regarding SH frequency, <italic>t</italic> = −1.55, <italic>p</italic> = .125. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610396090">Table 2</xref> lists the 10 most frequently witnessed forms of SH in order from highest to lowest frequency (i.e., percentage of participants reporting experiencing the behavior at least once). Similar to direct SH, verbal harassment (e.g., name-calling) was the most frequently witnessed behavior.</p>

<sec id="section13-0272431610396090">
<title>What is the Context of Witnessed SH Incidents?</title>
<p>Students also reported on the context of the most memorable SH incident they witnessed (i.e., the incident reports). Participants were asked the gender and number of perpetrators and targets involved in the incident. When asked the gender of SH perpetrators, 44% of participants indicated that boys were the perpetrators, 37% reported that both boys and girls were perpetrators, and 19% indicated that girls were the perpetrators. Both boys and girls reported that boys were most frequently the perpetrators of the observed incidents. When asked how many perpetrators were involved, participants reported most often witnessing incidents with a group of perpetrators (i.e., three or more) or one perpetrator involved in the incident (40.5% and 39.7%, respectively). The remaining 20% of participants reported two perpetrators.</p>
<p>Girls were most often reported to be the targets of the witnessed harassment (39%). Thirty-one percent of participants reported that boys were the targets of witnessed incidents, and 30% reported both boys and girls were targeted. However, this finding may be an artifact of the sample composition (i.e., including more girls than boys) combined with participants observing their own gender as the most frequent targets of harassment. A significant chi-square test revealed that girls and boys reported witnessing members of their own gender being harassed more often than expected by chance, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 27.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; although they were equally likely to report both boys and girls were the target of the witnessed harassment. Specifically, 37% of boys reported that boys were the most common targets, followed by both boys and girls (24%) and girls only (10%). Forty-six percent of girls reported observing other girls as the most frequent targets of harassment, followed by both boys and girls (21%) and boys only (11%). The majority of participants reported that either one or a group of students (three or more) were targeted in a given incident (42% and 40% respectively). Finally, 18% of participants indicated that two students were the targets of the harassment they had witnessed.</p>
<p>Regarding where SH occurred, participants most often reported that the SH they witnessed took place in the hallway (41.8%), although to a lesser extent it was witnessed in the cafeteria (23.0%), classrooms (19.7%), and gym class (17.2%). Less than 14% of participants indicated they had witnessed SH occurring in the locker room, at recess, or on the bus. It is also important to note that rather than circling the provided answer choices, a number of participants wrote that it happens “every where.”</p>
<p>Participants also reported who else witnessed the incident. They were asked about other students, teachers, and administrators. Eighty percent of participants indicated that other students witnessed the incident, with the majority (69.4%) reporting three or more students saw the incident (not including the participant). Only 10.8% of participants indicated teachers witnessed the incident. Of this 10.8%, 61.5% reported that there was only one teacher who witnessed the harassment, 23.1% indicated two teachers witnessed it, and 15.4% reported three or more teachers witnessed the incident. Only three participants reported that an administrator witnessed the incident, with two indicating there was one administrator and one participant indicating two administrators witnessed the incident. Finally, when asked if the incident was reported to school officials (to their knowledge), 84.7% of participants indicated the incident was not reported.</p>

<p>Direct SH was positively related to witnessing SH, <italic>r</italic> = .59, <italic>p &lt; .</italic>001, and psychological distress, <italic>r =</italic> .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but was negatively related to GPA, <italic>r =</italic> −.26, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Thus, students who reported experiencing more direct SH also reported more experiences witnessing SH, more psychological distress, and lower GPAs. Witnessing SH was positively related to psychological distress, <italic>r =</italic> .22, <italic>p</italic> = .007, but was not significantly related to GPA, <italic>r =</italic> −.03, <italic>p</italic> = .726. Finally, psychological distress was negatively related to GPA, <italic>r =</italic> −.26, <italic>p</italic> = .001; individuals reporting more psychological distress also reported lower GPAs.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the relationships among direct SH, psychological distress, and GPA, a mediational path model was tested in which psychological distress mediated the relationship between direct SH and GPA. It was hypothesized that the negative effects of direct SH on individuals’ GPA would be explained by accounting for individuals’ psychological distress levels resulting from the SH experiences. Given that no direct relationship was found between witnessing SH and GPA, this model was only run with direct SH as the independent variable.</p>
<p>Path analysis was conducted using the structural equation modeling software AMOS version 7.0; maximum likelihood methods were employed to estimate the direct and indirect effects and bootstrapping was used to establish the significance of the indirect (mediated) effect rather than the Sobel test, which can be overly conservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431610396090">MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). The chi square was nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 0.245, <italic>p</italic> = .621, indicating no significant difference between the tested model and the data. However, the model tested was nearly saturated. As such, examination of model fit indices does not provide additional meaningful information about the current model (e.g., RMSEA = .00). Traditional hierarchical and logistic regression analyses similarly do not provide insight into the extent that tested models fit the data. As such, the current analyses provide comparably limited insights into model fit. The model explained 10% of the variance in GPA, and 38% of the variance in psychological distress.</p>
<p>As expected, after controlling for significant life events, the direct path between SH and psychological distress was significant, β = .84, <italic>p &lt; .</italic>001, 95% CI [0.48, 1.17], as was the path between psychological distress and GPA, β = −.32, <italic>p</italic> = .038, 95% CI [−.57, −.03]. The path between SH and GPA was not significant in the full model, β = −.56, <italic>p</italic> = .050, 95% CI [−1.13, −0.06]; however when the mediator (psychological distress) was removed from the model this unconditional relationship was significant, β = −.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 95% CI [−1.45, −0.48]. This finding is consistent with a traditional mediation effect such that the direct effect becomes nonsignificant when the explanatory variable is present in the model. The formal test of an indirect effect was significant; the SH-GPA relationship was significantly mediated by psychological distress, Indirect Effect = −.25, <italic>p =</italic> .018, 95% CI [−.59, −.04]. In order to test whether the effect was fully or partially mediated, the model was rerun with the paths from SH to GPA set to zero; the resulting chi-square value was compared with the full model to determine whether a significant additional proportion in the overall variance was explained by the direct SH to GPA path. The difference in chi-square values between the models indicated full mediation, LR χ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 3.80, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. These findings support the hypothesis that the negative effects of SH on GPA could be explained by the increased psychological distress associated with SH experiences.</p>
<p>The partial correlations among the variables appeared to vary by gender (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272431610396090">Table 3</xref>); therefore, we tested for gender differences in the overall model. Multiple group analyses were completed in AMOS to determine whether the model performed differently for girls and boys; specifically, all parameters were allowed to vary by gender in one model, and the parameters were constrained to be equal in another model. The chi-square values from the two models were compared with assess whether allowing the parameters to vary improved the fit of the data. No significant differences emerged, LR χ<sup>2</sup> (5) = 2.68, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, indicating there were no significant gender differences in the modeled relationships.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study expanded the developing literature on youth SH by exploring middle school students’ experiences of direct SH and witnessing SH. Findings from this study indicate that middle school students both witness and are directly targeted by peer SH, with direct harassment occurring at higher rates than have been documented in research to date. Previous research has found that approximately 80% of students experienced direct SH at least once prior to graduating high school, whereas 94% of the middle school students surveyed in this study were directly harassed <italic>in the previous school year</italic>. This higher rate of SH may be due to the use of the comprehensive SEQ-HS measure. With a more complete spectrum of SH behaviors represented, this study was more sensitive to the many manifestations of SH compared with studies that adopted the briefer AAUW measure. Additional research sampling middle school students and employing the SEQ-HS is needed to draw more refined conclusions regarding the rates of SH. Experiences of direct SH were significantly related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower overall GPAs. This high rate of direct SH among middle school students and the significant negative relationships with students’ psychological and academic well-being reinforce the need to include this population in future studies of SH among youth.</p>
<p>The results of this study also highlight the importance of exploring students’ experiences <italic>witnessing</italic> SH. Over 96% of students reported witnessing a peer being sexually harassed in the past year, and students reported witnessing more forms of SH than they experienced directly. This finding suggests that SH is not simply a dyadic phenomenon involving solely perpetrators and targets, but instead extends to others in the setting, particularly student witnesses. Witnessing SH was only modestly correlated with increased psychological distress and was not all associated with academic outcomes. It seems logical that youth would experience worse outcomes when directly targeted by harassment than when observing the victimization of others, therefore this finding is not surprising. It is possible that witnessing SH is associated more strongly with other outcomes such as perceived school climate (e.g., tolerance for gender-based harassment) and sense of safety. Overall, these findings speak to the importance of attending to students’ experiences witnessing SH and the potentially detrimental effects on individuals and overall school climate.</p>
<p>Students also reported on the context in which SH occurs. Consistent with previous research, students reported that SH occurred in public spaces. However, despite the fact that incidents were occurring in public spaces, students reported that virtually no teachers were present during these incidents. Most often other students were the only witnesses to the harassment.This finding seems to suggest that SH is rarely occurring when adults are present. Thus, one change in schools’ physical space that might impact SH is to increase teacher/adult presence in the hallways. Additional research on the context in which SH occurs is needed to determine the most efficient strategies for stopping its occurrence.</p>
<p>Although no gender differences were detected in the frequency of direct or witnessing SH or in the meditational model, past research has found gender differences in SH frequency, severity, and reactions to SH (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610396090">Fineran &amp; Bennett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610396090">Hand &amp; Sanchez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431610396090">Roscoe, Strouse, &amp; Goodwin, 1994</xref>) as well as distinctions between cross- and same-gender SH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610396090">McMaster et al., 2002</xref>). The current study did not account for the gender of the perpetrator when assessing overall SH experiences, and the sample size offered limited power for the multiple group analysis. Therefore, future research should continue to attend to gender differences in SH experiences and associated outcomes.</p>
<p>While these findings provide useful insight into the SH experiences of middle school youth, there are some limitations to this study that merit consideration. First, active consent requirements when surveying minors resulted in a loss of potential participants due to parental nonresponse during the consent process. In addition, approximately 10% of participants who were in attendance on the day of administration did not complete the survey sufficiently to analyze their data (e.g., skipping entire pages inadvertently or only completing the initial pages of the survey). Not enough data was available from these students to determine whether they were distinct from the participating students. To the extent that these students differed in a nonrandom way, the generalizability of the findings would be limited. Generalizability was also limited by sampling from a single middle school with a racially homogeneous student population. As the school district contained only one elementary school, one middle school, and one high school, the student body does not vary at each of the major educational transitions (i.e., by combining elementary schools into one middle school). It is possible that SH among more diverse, less socially constrained students occurs at different rates and in different ways (e.g., context, type of harassment). In addition, it is possible that school level effects, which were not measured in this study, influence the prevalence and nature of SH (e.g., tolerance for SH, comprehensiveness and enforcement of SH and gender discrimination policies, training of teachers to intervene on SH incidents and their intent to do so). Multisite studies in diverse communities of varying sizes that attend to school level effects on SH would greatly improve our understanding of adolescent SH. Finally, this study was cross-sectional and therefore limited in the extent to which temporal (causal) inferences can be drawn from the meditational analyses. However, the findings of this study should be viewed as a call to SH and gender-based bullying researchers to engage in longitudinal research that attends to adolescents’ psychological well-being and academic performance.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provides useful insights into middle school students’ SH experiences. Future research should continue to gather details regarding the context of SH among youth, such as the relationship between perpetrators and targets (e.g., is this happening among friends, dating partners, enemies, or all of the above) and the motivation or purpose of SH (e.g., are students using it as an expression of sexual interest or as a mechanism of hierarchical social restructuring). In addition, longitudinal research is needed to examine the how SH changes throughout the course of development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610396090">Goldstein and colleagues’ (2007)</xref> longitudinal study speaks to the potential for long lasting negative effects of early SH; however, additional work beginning in late elementary school and following youth through high school that documents patterns of SH (both direct and witnessing) over time, including the timing of and unique ways in which SH manifests as youth progress through adolescence into adulthood, is needed. Furthermore, complimentary qualitative research exploring how youth make meaning of their direct and witnessed SH experiences and what they believe should be done to address it would be invaluable to the development of effective interventions. Finally, to paint a more comprehensive picture of SH, future research should sample from more diverse communities in order to understand how race/ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and social class may relate to peer-to-peer harassment. SH among youth is a serious issue with significant negative effects on students’ well-being and academic outcomes that warrants additional attention among researchers.</p>
