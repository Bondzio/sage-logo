<p>These results suggest that PPV administered before or after sensitization suppresses Th2 response and enhanced induction of regulatory T cells in an allergic rhinitis model. In addition, there was no significant difference between the degrees of effects in these 2 conditions. In the future, we can consider PPV to be a preventative agent for allergic rhinitis.</p>

<body>
<p>Allergic rhinitis is an immunologic disorder by allergen-specific IgE in response to environmental exposures. Allergic rhinitis occurs in more than 500 million people worldwide, and its prevalence has shown a rapid increase, particularly in developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472864">1</xref></sup> This tendency could be explained by the “hygiene hypothesis” that better hygiene, resulting in decreased microbial exposure, leads to an increase in allergic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472864">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a common respiratory pathogen and is a principal cause of otitis media, bacteremia, and meningitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472864">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472864">4</xref></sup> <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> colonized in the hypopharyngeal region of neonates increases the risk of asthma early in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472864">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812472864">6</xref></sup> Conversely, Talbot et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812472864">7</xref></sup> reported that asthma was associated with a doubled risk of pneumococcal infection.</p>
<p>The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) were developed to reduce the burden of pneumococcal diseases. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is approved for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults, and PCV was added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472864">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812472864">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated the effect of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> on allergic airway inflammation in experimental animal models. Killed <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> attenuated T-cell cytokine production, goblet cell hyperplasia, airway hyperresponsiveness, and tissue eosinophilia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812472864">10</xref></sup> Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine suppressed development of the allergic airway by inducing regulatory T (Treg) cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812472864">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of PPV on allergic inflammation and induction of Treg cells in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis. We also aimed to explore whether differences exist regarding the effect of PPV according to the timing of its administration. To know this, we compared the effects of PPV before sensitization with those of PPV after sensitization. Interferon (IFN)–γ and T-bet mRNA expression for Th1 responses were measured. Allergic symptoms, eosinophil counts in nasal mucosa, interleukin (IL)–13, serum <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic> (<italic>Der f</italic>)–specific IgE levels, and GATA-3 mRNA expression were evaluated to know Th2 responses. Interleukin-10, Foxp3 mRNA expression, and the proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen, markers of Treg cells, were also examined.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of topical PPV treatment in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis. In addition, an important strength of the current study is the use of <italic>Dermatophagoides farinae</italic>, which is a common allergen associated with allergic airway disease in patients.</p>

<title>Allergic Rhinitis Model and Treatment Protocol</title>
<p>As we had no a priori knowledge of the expected outcome in numerical value, no statistical sample size determination was performed. To determine the sample size in this study, we referred to the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812472864">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812472864">13</xref></sup> Forty mice were randomized to 1 of 4 groups with 10 animals each: control, <italic>Der f</italic> (allergic rhinitis), Pre-S (administration of PPV before sensitization), and Post-S (administration of PPV after sensitization). Allergen sensitization and challenge are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812472864"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Briefly, on days 2 and 9, all mice except those in the control group were immunized with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 µg <italic>Der f</italic>. Mice in the Pre-S group were treated intranasally with 33 µg PPV on days 0, 0.5, 1, and 2, whereas mice in the Post-S group were treated on days 14, 14.5, 15, and 16. One week after sensitization, all sensitized mice were challenged intranasally with 20 µg <italic>Der f</italic> for 7 consecutive days. The control group received PBS intranasally instead of <italic>Der f</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section12-0194599812472864">
<title>Nasal Lavage Fluid</title>
<p>Using ether anesthesia, thoracotomy was performed on the mice 24 hours after the final allergen challenge. Nasal lavage fluid (NALF) was obtained after partial tracheal resection using 22-gauge catheters. The catheter was inserted into the tracheal opening in the direction of the upper airway into the nasopharynx. The nasal passages were perfused with 1 mL PBS from the choana to the nostril, and NALF was collected from the nares.</p>

<sec id="section13-0194599812472864">
<title>Nasal Mucosa Tissue Evaluation</title>
<p>The decapitated heads were fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified with Calci-Clear Rapid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, Georgia), and embedded in paraffin blocks. The blocks were sliced into 4-µm-thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to evaluate general morphology and number of eosinophils in the lamina propria. The average number of eosinophils was counted in 4 areas around the nasal septa under a light microscope. The individual who counted the eosinophils was blinded to the protocol.</p>

<sec id="section14-0194599812472864">
<title>Cytokines in NALF and <italic>Der f</italic>–Specific IgE Levels in Serum</title>
<p>To evaluate the allergic reaction with NALF (supernatant from each group), interferon-γ for the Th1 immune reaction and IL-13 for the Th2 immune reaction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Multiplex; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts). In addition, IL-10 was measured using the Multiplex ELISA kit. The serum <italic>Der f</italic>–specific IgE level was measured using an ELISA kit (INDOOR Biotechnologies, Manchester, UK).</p>

<title>Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Spleens were removed aseptically 24 hours after the final challenge. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) from splenic mononuclear cells, and the first strand was reverse-transcribed using a random primer (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). The oligonucleotide primer sequences were as follows: T-bet forward primer, 5′-GCCAGGGAACCGCTTATA-3′ and T-bet reverse primer, 5′-CCTTGTTGTTGGTGAGCTTTA-3′; GATA-3 forward primer, 5′-CTGGATGGCGGCAAAGC-3′ and GATA-3 reverse primer, 5′-GTGGGCGGGAAGGTGAA-3′; Foxp3 forward primer, 5′-GAAAGCGGATACCAAATGA-3′ and Foxp3 reverse primer, 5′-CTGTGAGGACTACCGAGCC-3′; and β-actin forward primer, 5′-CCCATCTACGAGGGCTAT-3′ and β-actin reverse primer, 5′-CCCATCTACGAGGGCTAT-3′. The expression levels of T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3, and β-actin mRNA were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the ABI PRISM 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) and SYBR Green PCR master mix (TaKaRa). The levels of expression of these mRNAs were analyzed using the ABI 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The results were normalized to β-actin expression and are shown as the fold increase over the expression of the control group.</p>

<title>Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>For cell surface staining, 10<sup>6</sup> splenic mononuclear cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated mouse CD4 (GK1.5) antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, California). For intracellular staining, cells stained with CD4 were incubated with fixation/permeabilization working solution, and Fc receptors were blocked with excess mouse Fc block. Cells were then stained with phycoerythrin (PE)–Cy5-conjugated mouse Foxp3 (FJK-16s) and APC-CD25 antibodies (eBioscience). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>T cells were analyzed using FACS-Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All measured parameters are expressed as means ± standard deviations. The differences among the groups were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis. If statistical significances were found, the ranked parameters were compared using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison tests (PASW Statistics 18; SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). A value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> causes respiratory infections worldwide. Because PCV was added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has declined by 60% to 90% in children younger than 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472864">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have been reported regarding the association between allergic diseases and pneumococcal infection. Klemets et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812472864">14</xref></sup> suggested that working-age adults with asthma were at an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal infections and pneumococcal vaccination might be needed for these patients. Atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis are also associated with an increased risk of serious pneumococcal diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812472864">15</xref></sup> In experimental studies, pneumococcal infection reduced circulating eosinophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812472864">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine includes 23 capsular polysaccharide antigens (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F) and induces a persistent functional antibody response in adults. However, PPVs are generally not considered to be immunogenic in children younger than 2 years and are recommended for children older than 24 months of age who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812472864">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812472864">18</xref></sup> A retrospective cohort study reported a decrease in the risk of hospital admission for asthma in vaccinated compared with nonvaccinated subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812472864">19</xref></sup> However, the Cochrane review of PPV in 2002 concluded that the effect of pneumococcal vaccine on asthma was limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812472864">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several experimental studies evaluated the effect of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> on allergic airway disease using killed bacteria or pneumococcal vaccines. Both whole-killed <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and PCV suppressed allergic inflammation and development of allergic airway disease by inducing Treg cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812472864">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812472864">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812472864">21</xref></sup> A recent study reported that <italic>S pneumonia</italic> component-induced Treg cells suppressed the activity of natural killer T cells and allergic airway disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812472864">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>We aimed to reveal whether PPV treatment reduces allergic inflammation in an allergic rhinitis model and to elucidate the mechanisms. In particular, we used <italic>Der f</italic>, a common allergen in patients, to develop an allergic model. In the Pre-S group, the allergic symptom score, serum <italic>Der f</italic>–specific IgE, tissue eosinophil counts, IL-13 levels, and GATA-3 mRNA were decreased compared with those in the <italic>Der f</italic> group. In addition, IL-10 levels, Foxp3 mRNA levels, and the percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the Pre-S group were increased compared with those in the <italic>Der f</italic> group. However, comparisons of IFN-γ levels and T-bet mRNA expression levels among the groups showed no significances. From these results, we concluded that PPV treatment before sensitization suppresses Th2 responses and enhances induction of Treg cells. However, these results were different from a previous study that demonstrated that PPV failed to suppress allergic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812472864">11</xref></sup> This discrepancy may be caused by differences in the timing of PPV administration, the number of PPV administrations, the protocol for induction of allergic inflammation (the schedule of allergen sensitization and challenge), and exposed allergens (<italic>Der f</italic> vs ovalbumin).</p>
<p>We also explored whether differences exist concerning the effect of PPV according to the timing of its administration. In the Post-S group, the allergic symptom score, serum <italic>Der f</italic>–specific IgE, and GATA-3 mRNA expression were decreased compared with those in the <italic>Der f</italic> group. In addition, Foxp3 mRNA expression and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the Post-S group were increased compared with those in the <italic>Der f</italic> group. However, there were no significant differences between 2 groups. Therefore, we suggested that there is equal benefit irrespective of whether the PPV treatment is given before or after sensitization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study suggests that PPV administered before or after allergen sensitization effectively suppressed the allergen-specific Th2 response and enhanced induction of Treg cells in a model of allergic rhinitis. In addition, there was no significant difference between the degrees of effects in these 2 conditions. Further studies are needed regarding PPV; however, in the future, we can consider PPV to be a preventative agent in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.</p>
