<p>In the past decade there is no doubt that performance of service industries has come to the forefront of research and policy debate on Europe's comparative economic performance. The much publicised acceleration in US output and productivity growth and Europe's failure to match this performance is primarily down to developments in market service sectors, which together represent about 50 per cent of EU value added and employment. An extensive overview of this literature is provided in the recently published monograph that arose from the EU KLEMS project, ‘Economic Growth in Europe’, by Marcel Timmer, Robert Inklaar, Mary O'Mahony and Bart van Ark.</p>
<p>These developments formed the background for two EU FP7 funded projects ‘Indicators for evaluating international performance in service sectors’ (INDICSER) which started in January 2010 – <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indicser.com">www.indicser.com</ext-link> and ‘The impact of service sector innovation and internationalisation on growth and productivity’ (SERVICEGAP), which started in March 2010 – <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.servicegap.org">www.servicegap.org</ext-link>. The first project is primarily concerned with measurement, whereas the second has a more analytical focus. The four articles in this issue arise from these projects; this introduction sets the context by outlining the aims, design and preliminary project results. Prior to this is a brief discussion of recent developments in service sectors – more details can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-002795011222000111">O'Mahony (2010)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section1-002795011222000111">
<title>Outputs and labour productivity in service sectors: recent developments</title>
<p>This section considers trends in real value added growth, hours worked and output per hour (labour productivity) for the total economy and two broad aggregates, production industries and market services. It examines growth in the period 1995 to 2009, dividing into the boom period up to 2007 and the final two years. The year 1995 was chosen as the starting point as it is widely considered the point at which European performance started to diverge from the US (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-002795011222000111">O'Mahony and Van Ark, 2003</xref>). It employs data from the EU KLEMS growth and productivity accounts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euklems.net">www.euklems.net</ext-link>), updated to 2009, using a combination of data from the OECD STAN database and national accounts from EUROSTAT.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">Table 1</xref> presents annual average growth rates for the above three variables for the EU25 and a division between the EU15 and new member states, EU10. Estimates are also shown for the US as a comparator. Turning first to real output growth, over the entire period this was much higher in the new member states than in the EU15 group of countries, reflecting well-known patterns of convergence of the former to the latter following EU entry. The downturn in the final two years hit the EU15 group hardest with nearly a 2 per cent drop in output per annum. The new member states as a whole registered positive real output growth in the final two years but the deceleration over the period to 2007 was almost as pronounced as in the EU15. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">Table 1</xref> highlights that the downturn in output growth was most felt in the production industries, in the EU as a whole and in both groups of countries. The fall in real output in production industries in the final two years was much lower in percentage terms in the new member states. Nevertheless it represented a significant deceleration of −6.7 percentage points comparing 2007–9 with 1995–2007, compared to −7.8 percentage points in the EU15. Both country groupings also showed a drop in output in market services, 2007–9. Again this was not as severe in the new member states, although, interestingly, the deceleration in market services growth was slightly greater in the EU10 (–5.4) than in the EU15 (–4.8). Note, by implication, the positive real output growth in the EU10 for the total economy is due entirely to trends in the omitted non-market services, which is largely government activity.</p>

<p>The second panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">table 1</xref> shows trends in hours worked. Not surprisingly, in the total economy the change in hours worked was positive in the boom years and negative in the final two-year period. In both the EU15 and EU10, hours worked declined even in the boom years in production industries, but the decline was much larger between 2007 and 2009 in the EU15. Compared to production industries, hours worked declined by much less in market services in the EU15 and hours worked even showed a small increase in the EU10 group of countries. Note that the trends in the final two years in hours worked mostly reflect declines in numbers employed in production industries but in market services there were significant reductions in both the numbers employed and hours worked per person, suggesting a greater proportion of people working for shorter hours either through increased part-time work or greater absence.</p>
<p>It is obvious from an examination of the first two panels in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">table 1</xref> that the lower number of hours worked in the final two years was not sufficient to offset the decline in real output, so that labour productivity fell sharply during the years of the financial crisis. These declines were again stronger in production industries than in market services. These were years of global downturns and production industries are likely to be more exposed to international developments than firms located in service sectors.</p>
<p>It is useful to compare the numbers for the EU with trends in the US, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">table 1</xref>. EU KLEMS data were updated to 2009 using estimates for constant price value added from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and employment and hours from the Bureau of Labour Statistics. In the economy as a whole these estimates suggest that US real output fell by about 1 per cent per annum between 2007 and 2009, a little lower than in the EU. The major difference, however, is that hours worked in the US declined by over 3 per cent per annum, so that labour productivity growth was positive. Output and hours both declined by more in production industries than in market services, mirroring the pattern found in the EU, but labour productivity growth was positive in both sectors. Therefore the EU's poor productivity performance relative to the US continued into the era of the financial crisis. In market services, in the period 2007–9, US labour productivity growth was about equal to its trend value in the years 1995–2007 whereas, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-002795011222000111">table 1</xref>, EU labour productivity growth showed a pronounced downturn.</p>
<p>Examination of market services in more detail, reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-002795011222000111">O'Mahony (2010)</xref>, shows large variation in performance across the larger EU economies: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. This shows significant downturns in output in wholesale and retail in all six countries but in all countries bar Spain real output growth in financial services was positive during the downturn, although small in many cases. This raises some questions regarding the methods used in the national accounts to measure output of this sector. The picture for other industries is more mixed. In Germany and the Netherlands transport and communications show a large contribution to the overall decline in output, whereas in France and the UK much of the downturn in real output growth is located in business services. In wholesale and retail trade only Spain and the UK achieved positive labour productivity growth. Italy experienced the most negative growth in the period covered by the financial crisis but the turnaround (average growth 2007–9 minus 1995–2007) was most pronounced in the Netherlands. In contrast, labour productivity growth during 2007–9 was positive in all six countries in financial services, so that labour shedding more than compensated for downturns in output growth – Italy and Spain registered the weakest productivity performance in this sector. Finally labour productivity performance in Business Services showed the greatest diversity across countries, accelerating in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, decelerating in France and Germany and showing a pronounced downturn in the UK.</p>
<p>In summary, this section has highlighted the serious consequences of the recent financial crisis on output, labour input and labour productivity growth in the EU. It suggests that there are differences in its impact in production and services sectors, with the former most adversely affected. The impact also varies within market services, with the financial intermediation sector appearing least affected by the downturn, while wholesale and retail trade and business services have shown large impacts on the overall decline in some countries. However, even in the most adversely affected market services, the fall in labour productivity was generally lower than in production industries, the main exception being business services in the UK. These sectoral differences suggest significant differences in the underlying modes of production and factors affecting them. We now turn to an overview of these influences by introducing the research programme of the INDICSER and SERVICEGAP projects.</p>

<title>The INDICSER and SERVICEGAP projects</title>
<p>The estimates presented in the previous section only cover labour productivity, due to lack of sectoral data on investment beyond 2007. The variations across country and sector in real output growth and productivity noted in that section will be affected by changes in investment in physical, human and other forms of intangible capital as well as a host of institutional and environmental factors. The main objective of the INDICSER project is to develop indicators which are able to provide information on the determinants of growth in service sectors in the European Union. The focus of the project is both to derive indicators at the industry level that can be combined with data from other sources, especially EU KLEMS, and to focus particular attention on sectors where output and productivity measurement is particularly problematic.</p>
<p>In terms of indicators, the project will deliver a wide range of measures including measures of innovative activity, intangible investments focusing especially on firm-specific organisational capital such as training and management inputs, measures of the industry structures in which firms operate including indexes of firm size, concentration, entry and exit and productivity dispersions, indicators of product and labour market regulations and on international presence in markets. As much of the academic focus is on comparing performance in services with other sectors, the indicators will be constructed, where feasible, at the 2-digit NACE classification for all sectors of the economy. The indicators are based on data from a wide range of sources including the Community Innovation Surveys, European Labour Force and wage surveys and other international survey data. These indicators will be available for public dissemination in December 2012. The paper by Kang, O'Mahony and Peng in this issue presents a preliminary description of two related indicators, labour quality growth arising from general education and investments in informal training.</p>
<p>The INDICSER project in addition focuses on a number of specific services sectors where there are serious conceptual issues in measuring output; these include financial services and retail trade in market services and education, health and collective services in non-market sectors. A first objective was to consider what indicators should be measured, followed by analyses of data issues and practical importance. For non-market services such as health and education, the main emphasis is on measuring output and applying novel concepts of output measurement to a wide range of EU countries. Many ideas have been put forward in recent years (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-002795011222000111">Atkinson, 2005</xref>), but so far internationally comparable implementation has not progressed. Two papers related to specific sectors are presented in this issue, on education output by Barslund and financial services development and integration and growth by Inklaar, Fernández de Guevara and Maudos.</p>
<p>The aim of the SERVICEGAP project is to produce a comprehensive study on the impact of market services on aggregate economic growth in the EU and its comparative performance relative to competitor regions, especially the US. The project covers three main areas; Productivity and its drivers in service industries; Firm strategies in the knowledge-based economy; and Internationalisation of service markets and growth. The first theme draws on data from INDICSER to investigate the impacts of intangible investments and regulation on productivity growth. This theme also investigates the linkages between manufacturing and services through the input side, i.e. use of intermediate service inputs and employment of workers in services occupations in manufacturing. It also examines the output side, focusing on the increasing service content in manufacturing output, such as installation and training, repair and maintenance and other after sales services. The paper by Wolfmayer in this issue reports on one aspect of these linkages, namely the services content of manufacturing exports.</p>
<p>The objectives of the research on the second theme are to investigate external sources of knowledge creation at the firm level, especially the outsourcing of information technology services. This theme will also examine innovation in the service sectors, particularly distinguishing service industries with different ‘technological regimes’ and with different links to manufacturing and a focus on spillover effects from innovation in manufacturing to productivity and growth in services. The third theme is concerned with international activity. Traditionally international trade and investment have been concentrated in production industries but there is some evidence that the extent of international activity is increasing in services.</p>
<p>The first outputs from the SERVICEGAP project were designed to consider trends in service sector performance looking specifically at the impacts of the financial crisis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-002795011222000111">Eftyvoulou (2012)</xref> investigates the impacts of financial stress on productivity in previous periods, comparing production industries with market services. This controls for changes in capital services, skill composition of the workforce and other factors that impact on technical change, such as R&amp;D expenditure, openness and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Although the direct impact of financial stress is not found to be significantly different across the two broad sectors, the stress term interacted with an index of international activity is large and highly significant only for production industries. Therefore the overall impact of financial crises tends to be higher in production industries than in market services, consistent with the descriptive analysis above. A continuation of this work within SERVICEGAP will specifically investigate links between innovation and financial stress using data from the Community Innovation Survey.</p>
<p>Other outputs from the project include an overview of the direct and indirect linkages between manufacturing and services for the EU-25 countries and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-002795011222000111">Falk and Jarocinska, 2010</xref>); these authors find that direct and backward linkages between manufacturing and services increased in the past few decades. Demand for intermediate service inputs increased through direct outsourcing of functions from manufacturing to service firms as the former increasingly focused on core competencies. Furthermore, there were also changes in the production processes that resulted in a rising service intensity, often related to the diffusion of ICT, which enables the fragmentation of production. Similarly, there was an increase in service occupations in manufacturing. On the output side, manufacturing firms generate an increasing proportion of sales from services activities.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000111">O'Mahony and Peng (2010)</xref> training activities are modelled as intangible investments by firms and cumulated to stocks so their impact can be evaluated within a production function framework, including links to the use of information and communications technology (ICT). The results suggest significantly positive effects of training on productivity, both direct and interacted with ICT, and the results suggest that firm-specific intangible investments may be more important in services than in production industries, when interacted with ICT capital.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-002795011222000111">Bertschek, Engelstätter and Szczygielski (2010)</xref> present an overview of the role that information technology plays in the innovation process. Three research areas are addressed: the role of ICT as a driver of product and process innovation, ICT-based firm strategies, in particular service outsourcing allowing for flexibility, and the impacts of innovation on productivity and employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-002795011222000111">Gorg, Haller and Siedschlag (2010)</xref> review the literature on the impact of internationalisation on performance. They divide international activities into three areas: trade, investment and outsourcing. In all three, these activities have been increasing in importance in service sectors. However the authors conclude that in the past there has been a lack of solid empirical evidence on services firms' engagement in international activities and the associated effects on productivity, employment and competitiveness; these issues form the main area of current research on the internationalisation theme. This research will, in particular, address the issue of trying to establish causality using state of the art econometric techniques that try to control for characteristics of firms other than their propensity to engage in international activities.</p>
<p>In summary, the INDICSER and SERVICEGAP projects are designed to fill gaps in knowledge that specifically deals with service sector economic performance. The projects should generate new knowledge on the performance of services in the European Union and relative to competitors such as the United States. The results of this research will contribute to the strengthening of the scientific knowledge base for policies on enterprise, innovation, competition, trade and investment at national and European levels.</p>
