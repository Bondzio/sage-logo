<abstract>
<p>Highly localized stresses generated at the gauge corner of the outer rail cause fatigue cracking. The longitudinal bending stresses in the rail underhead radius position are of special interest, as tension spikes have been identified at this location during in-track measurements under high axle load conditions. The tension spike is a result of vertical and lateral head bending on the web. This effect is highly localized and is additional to the stresses generated due to vertical and lateral bending of the whole rail profile (the so-called global bending). This study examined contact and bending stresses by modelling the rail on a discrete foundation using finite elements and by considering the loading to be a fully slipping elliptical Hertzian contact patch. The analysis revealed that the tensile longitudinal stress was highly dependent on several service conditions: the contact patch offset from the rail centreline, the ratio of lateral (<italic>L</italic>) to vertical (<italic>V</italic>) loads, the direction of lateral traction, foundation stiffness and seasonal temperature variations. The tension spike increases, and the depth below the contact surface at which the stresses become tensile reduces, as the contact patch offset and/or the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio increases. Both these enhance the tendency for rolling contact fatigue cracks to turn downwards and become transverse defects. This is because an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can facilitate cracks to turn perpendicular to the tensile stresses once they reach a critical length. Shear traction towards the gauge corner was found to be the most damaging phenomenon.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711424095"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Rail maintenance, which includes the reproﬁling and repairing of rail defects, costs the European Union several hundred million Euros per annum. Recently, head check treatment was stated to alone cost theNetherlands €5000 000 per annum, at the highest occurences [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711424095">1</xref></bold>]. In the United States, the estimated total annual cost of replacing worn out and degraded track is US$ 1.25 billion [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711424095">2</xref></bold>]. For curved rail tracks, head checks and squats are the most common defect types; they often result in rail failures, the consequences of which may be a derailment that can result in fatalities. One example of this type of behaviour is the accident that occurred in 2000 at Hatfield in the UK. The gauge corner of the rail developed multiple rolling contact fatigue cracks, which caused a rail break and derailment at high speed resulting in four fatalities [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711424095">3</xref></bold>]. The so-called ‘whole life rail model’ was developed and applied in the investigation of the Hatfield incident [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711424095">4</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711424095">5</xref></bold>]; it has subsequently been used as a basis to create maintenance strategies for railway systems. All phases of crack development from initiation to growth created by contact stresses and from rail-bending stresses are modelled in this approach. The effect of global rail-bending stresses isconsidered but that of local rail bending is ignored. The work presented here is the first step towards modelling the effect of local rail bending on crack growth. In this work longitudinal stresses due to local bending are calculated for use as input to a crack growth model, which will be developed at a later stage.</p>
<p>Orringer <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711424095">6</xref></bold>] analysed the longitudinal bending stresses developed in a rail head. They found it to consist of five possible components: vertical bending, lateral bending, warping, vertical head-on-web bending, and lateral head-on-web bending. The warping due to an offset vertical load occurs only in a continuously welded rail (CWR). The field measurements presented in Orringer <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711424095">6</xref></bold>] showed that for tangent track the longitudinal stress caused by rail head-on-web bending is much smaller than that caused by vertical bending of the whole rail profile. The warping term of the longitudinal stress is similarly small. On curved track, the additional components of lateral bending and lateral head-on-web bending significantly increase the longitudinal stress.</p>
<p>Eisenmann [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711424095">7</xref></bold>] measured the tensile stresses at the underhead location (lower gauge corner of a rail) in the field and also theoretically calculated the tensile stresses at the gauge and field-side underhead location for eccentric and inclined loading. The local tensile stress on the field-side underhead location due to lateral wheel loading was measured under both laboratory conditions and in the field by Sugiyama <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711424095">8</xref></bold>]. These early studies considered the effect of lower contact loading and found the stresses developed to be within safe limits. However, the situation changes for higher contact loads. These stresses can become high and produce reverse detail fracture (i.e. transverse defects which initiate at the lower corner of the gauge face of a heavily worn rail) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711424095">Fig. 1</xref>. This observed defect type, which has been reported in North American rail systems [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711424095">9</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711424095">10</xref></bold>], occurs in poorly lubricated, heavily worn rails subjected to high axle loads. Jeong <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711424095">10</xref></bold>] studied the influence of longitudinal bending stresses at the underhead radius (lower gauge corner of a rail) on the behaviour of reverse detail fractures.

<p>Failures, which initiate at the underhead radius of the aluminothermic welds, have been found in Australia on lines subjected to heavy axle load railway operation. Mutton <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424095">11</xref></bold>] measured the longitudinal bending stresses at the underhead position at several track locations subjected to high axle load rail traffic. In that study the strain gauges were applied to the relevant position on the welds, and on the corresponding position on the rail at a distance of approximately 1200 mm away from the instrumented welds, in the direction facing the approaching loaded traffic. It was found that the tensile bending stress at the gauge-side underhead radius of the rail reached a peak value of about 100 MPa when the wheel was directly above the strain gauge position (underhead offset of measurement point 20 mm). The corresponding stresses on the field-side underhead radius of the rail reached a peak value of about 83 MPa. For different wheels of a single train the magnitude of the peak tensile stress varied considerably at both gauge and field-side underhead radius positions of the rail.</p>
<p>In this paper, the longitudinal bending stresses at the underhead radius positions of the rail were investigated as a function of vertical load, lateral load, and the contact patch position. Vehicle dynamics studies performed in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711424095">12</xref></bold>] have shown that some wheels develop inward shear traction (towards the gauge side) and some outward shear traction (towards the field side) on the rail surfaces, which reflect differences in the tracking behaviour of individual wheelsets during curving. Both these cases are considered in the present work. The effect of foundation stiffness and seasonal temperature variations are also investigated. A finite element model of the rail is developed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954409711424095">section 2</xref> and the results generated are described and discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954409711424095">section 3</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409711424095"><title>2.1 Finite element analysis model</title>
<p>A model of a rail section was constructed using the commercial finite element code ABAQUS (6.9-EF1). An elastic stress analysis was conducted for a stationary contact loading. Only one rail was modelled to reduce the computation time. Elastic foundations were used to simulate the effect of rail pad, sleepers, and ballast. They were taken to act directly under the foot (wide bottom portion) of the rail and on both sides of the rail foot area at the locations of sleepers, which were spaced at 600 mm intervals along the length of rail as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424095">Figs 2</xref>(a) and (b). In the vertical direction, foundation stiffness/area (<italic>K</italic><sub>v</sub>) was applied on a contact area of 230 × 152.4 mm underneath the rail, whereas in the lateral direction the foundation stiffness/area (<italic>K</italic><sub>L</sub>) was applied on an area of 230 × 7 mm on both sides of the rail foot.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711424095" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The model description (a) top view of single rail supported with discrete elastic foundations and (b) cross-sectional view of the rail, the measurement location, and the elastic foundations with variations of contact patch size and shape</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711424095-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The wheel load was applied on the rail assuming a fully slipping Hertzian contact patch. The wheel vertical load (<italic>V</italic>) was applied through a Hertizan pressure distribution over an elliptical contact area of 125.6 mm<sup>2</sup> (major semi-axis, <italic>a</italic> = 10 mm, minor semi- axis, <italic>b</italic> = 4 mm) at the mid-point of the rail span (in the longitudinal direction at <italic>x</italic> = 2100 mm) in-between two middle sleepers at different contact patch offsets (0, 15, and 30 mm). The lateral load (<italic>L</italic>) was caused by the steering effects on the curved track, in combination with the elevated friction levels due to the absence of any lubrication at the rail–wheel interface, which produced lateral shear traction in the contact area. The contact patch offset and the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio represent the vehicle's hunting and curving behaviour. In real life the contact patch size and shape vary as the contact moves towards the gauge corner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424095">Figure 2</xref>(b) shows a simplified representation of the contact patch shape with offset. Depending on the curvature, double contacts are possible as well as significant departures from the ideal Hertz assumption. The focus of this study is the stress state of the underhead radius, which is influenced by the contact patch offset. Therefore, to minimize the effects of the contact patch size, the contact patch size was kept unchanged at the different offsets. Also, <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratios of 0, 0.2, and 0.4 were analysed. The Hertizan pressure distribution is given by the following expression

<p>The values of all the parameters used in the model were based on typical track designs used in Australian heavy haul rail systems. Referring to the Australian Standards lead to the adoption of the following configuration: concrete sleepers at a 600 mm spacing, resilient fastenings, high-density polyethylene rail/sleeper pads, ballast with a nominal depth of 300 mm, and an axle load of 35 t [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711424095">13</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409711424095">14</xref></bold>]. The geometric model used a 68 kg/m rail section corresponding to AS 1085.1 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409711424095">15</xref></bold>]; this rail section is commonly used under the heavy haul conditions of interest. The rail height was 185.7 mm and the minimum thickness ofthe rail web was 17.5 mm. The width of rail head and the base of the rail were 74.6 and 152.4 mm, respectively. The second moment of inertia was 39.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> mm<sup>4</sup>. Details of the model parameters are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409711424095">Table 1</xref>. The position of the strain gauge used by Mutton <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424095">11</xref></bold>] for their field measurements is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424095">Fig. 2</xref>(b).

<p>The three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of the rail with a dense mesh at the contact patch is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424095">Fig. 2</xref>(b). The model used eight-node 3D solid elements with reduced integration (C3D8R). The dense mesh at the contact patch used four-node 3D tetrahedral solid elements (C3D4). In order to reduce the number of elements, the mesh refinement was updated to create a fine mesh only at the rail head around the contact patch area, at all the three offset locations, and at the underhead radius location where the stresses were being calculated. A coarse mesh was used at all other locations, for example, along the length of the rail and on the web and foot areas. The model consisted of 177 074 elements and 135 399 nodes. The maximum element size was 20 mm in the rail and the smallest element size was 0.007 mm in the contact patch region. The major semi-axis, <italic>a</italic>, was in the longitudinal direction and the minor semi-axis, <italic>b</italic>, was in the lateral direction at the mid-point of the rail span (<italic>x</italic> = 2100 mm).</p>
<p>The rail was constrained against longitudinal rotation at both ends. Additionally, one end was constrained against longitudinal translation. The vertical and lateral translations were constrained by a vertical and lateral stiffness applied at the sleeper locations. These boundary conditions provided some constraint on the rail for rotation in the lateral and vertical directions. For the 4200 mm span of rail shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424095">Fig. 2</xref>(a), the resultant stresses considered at the centre location of the cross-section were almost unchanged as a result of boundary condition changes at both ends of the rail.</p>
<p>Appropriate values of stiffness/area in the vertical and lateral directions were chosen by comparing with values obtained for deformation of a rail head in both the vertical and lateral directions in field measurements. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424095">Table 2</xref> shows some of the compared results. The finite element analysis (FEA) results indicate that, with <italic>K</italic><sub>V</sub> = 1.0 N/mm<sup>3</sup> and <italic>K</italic><sub>L</sub> = 1740 kN/mm<sup>3</sup>, the vertical deformation of the rail head is about 2–3 mm and the lateral deformation is of the order of 1 mm. These deformation values are in line with expectations created by previous field and laboratory measurements [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424095">11</xref></bold>]. The vertical stiffness was applied over an area of 35 052 mm<sup>2</sup> (230 × 152.4 mm) and the lateral stiffness over an area of 1610 mm<sup>2</sup> (7 × 230 mm). The applied vertical stiffness was 35 kN/mm and the applied lateral stiffness was 2800 MN/mm. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424095">Table 2</xref> suggests that the difference in deformation is a factor of −3, whereas the difference in stiffness is a factor of about 2000 (or 10 000 if forces are considered). This is because the lateral stiffness (<italic>K</italic><sub>L</sub>) is calculated using a small area at both sides of the rail foot to account forthe rail fastenings applied on these locations compared to vertical stiffness (<italic>K</italic><sub>V</sub>), the calculations being based on the contact area between the sleepers and the base of the rail foot.

<p>The FEA model was validated by comparing the contact stress results with those obtained for an analytical solution. A circular Hertizan contact patch with a radius of 6.8 mm, supporting a vertical load of 171.7 kN was used in the FEA model and also for the calculation of the analytical result [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711424095">16</xref></bold>]. The FEA results revealed that the longitudinal stress at the centre of the contact surface had a maximum difference of 4 per cent compared with the analytical solution. In addition, the octahedral shear stress distribution along the centreline below the contact area showed a maximum difference of 5 per cent between the analytical solution and the FEA-predicted value.</p>
<p>A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the bending and deformation behaviour using different support and boundary conditions, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424095">Table 2</xref>. Field measurements [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424095">11</xref></bold>] have shown the lateral deformation to be of the order of 1 mm and the vertical deformation to be of the order of 2–3 mm. Case 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424095">Table 2</xref> with <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.2 and 0.4 provides asufficiently good match for both and these support conditions were used in all subsequent investigations.</p>
<p>The longitudinal stresses at a 20 mm offset of the underhead measurement point are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711424095">Fig. 3</xref>, and a tension spike can be seen to occur directly under the wheel contact position. This behaviour has been observed in field measurements [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424095">11</xref></bold>]. The FEA results were compared with <italic>in situ</italic> measured stress data for loaded rail traffic with a nominal axle load of 35 t. The <italic>in situ</italic> measured data showed variability in peak tensile stress values at the measurement location which could be attributed to variability in either a single or a combination of the contact positions for individual wheels, vertical wheel loads, and the lateral traction forces which arose from the steering effects. The values of these parameters were not determined during the <italic>in situ</italic> measurements, and hence the current analysis made use of peak stress data for a sample of 21 wheel passes, which represented a portion of the total data set. The peak tensile stress at the measured location (ata 20 mm offset of the underhead measurement point) from the <italic>in situ</italic> measured data had a value of 100.6 MPa, which is 6.8 per cent smaller than for the case of an <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio of 0.2 and a 30 mm offset of the contact patch.

<p>In the case of a pure vertical load (<italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0) on the centre of the rail head, there is no tensile stress generated at the underhead in the gauge side of the rail as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711424095">Figs. 4</xref>(a) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711424095">5</xref>(a). The tensile stress at the underhead position shows an increase with movement of the contact location to the gaugecorner of the rail, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711424095">Fig. 4</xref>(b). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711424095">Figure 5</xref>(a) shows that the peak tensile stress has a value of 60 MPa for a 34 mm offset of the underhead measurment point and a 15 mm offset of the contact patch with <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0 (maximum contact pressure, <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> = 2049.5 MPa). The vertical load eccentricity will impose local bending and additional torsion of the rail head. The tensile stress at the underhead is attributed to localized bending behaviour of the rail head. When increasing the eccentric position of loading from the contact patch from 15 to 30 mm, the tensile stress consistently increases from 60 to 140 MPa.

<p>If considering the hunting and steering behaviour of the rail, assuming that <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.2 and 0.4 with the contact patch being offset by 30 mm, the tensile stress takes place at the gauge-side underhead of the rail and increases consistently with an increase of <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio. As a result of the eccentric loads <italic>L</italic> and <italic>V</italic>, the high tensile stress imposed by the vertical and lateral head bending on the web is clearly observed at the underhead region as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711424095">Fig. 4</xref>(c). The longitudinal stress at a 34 mm offset of the underhead measurment point and a 30 mm offset of the contact patch at loading ratios <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> of 0, 0.2, and 0.4, with maximum contact pressure of <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> = 2049.5 MPa is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711424095">Fig. 5</xref>(b).

The contact patches are offset by 0, 15, and 30 mm and the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratios are 0 and 0.4. It can be seen that for <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.4 the tensile stress increases with the contact patch being offset by 30 mm, and occurs at a depth of 14 mm below the contact surface, whereas at a 15 mm offset of the contact patch the depth is about 20 mm. When there is no lateral loading (<italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0), the tensile stress occurs at a depth of 34, 38, and 42 mm for contact patches offset by 0, 15, 30 mm, respectively, and thus this depth is not very sensitive to changes in the contact patch position.

By increasing theoffset of the vertical plane from the vertical centreline of the rail towards the gauge corner (<italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.4), the longitudinal tensile stress increases, however, the depth at which the stress become tensile reduces from 20 to 2 mm.

If there is no lateral loading, i.e. <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0, the longitudinal tensile stress increases, and the depth at which the stress becomes tensile reduces from 38 to 14 mm. This behaviour can be verified from the deformation of the rail as shown in case 5 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424095">Table 2</xref>. The lateral deformation on the gauge side of the rail head for a 30 mm offset contact patch increases by a factor of 3.5 as the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio changes from zero to 0.4.

<p>The contours of the longitudinal stress on the cross-section of rail head with respect to the 30 mm offset contact patch at different <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratios are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711424095">Fig. 9</xref>. The regions subjected to tensile stresses in the rail head are clearly visible at the underhead location of the gauge side. The contour plots indicate that an increase in the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio (lateral load) results in the longitudinal tensile stress being increased at the underhead and gauge corner regions. The regions that are in tension can cause a crack to grow rapidly. The depth at which the stress becomes tensile decreases as the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio increases. For <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.4, this is of the order of a few millimetres as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711424095">Fig. 8</xref>. This can result in a transition to Mode I crack growth and the formation of a transverse defect for both rolling contact fatigue-initiated cracks that extend to this region and the fatigue behaviour of the rail underhead.

<sec id="sec8-0954409711424095"><title>3.3 Effect of lateral traction direction</title>
<p>In order to understand the effect of the different directions of lateral traction, loading cases were considered with the lateral traction pointing towards the gauge side (inward) or towards the field side (outward). Simulations were performed with the contact patch 30 mm offset towards the gauge side from the rail centreline for both inward and outward traction directions with <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratios of 0, 0.2, and 0.4, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711424095">Fig. 10</xref>(a). From this figure it is clear that by increasing the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratios towards either the field or gauge side of the rail, the tensile stress at the underhead radius of the respective side increases. The peak tensile stress is about 324 MPa forthe inward traction, which is four times higher than that for the outward traction. These stresses are generated by the lateral deformation of the rail head, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711424095">Figs 10</xref>(b) and (c). It can be seen that the lateral deformation of the rail head for the inward traction is about 2.5 times higher than that for the outward traction. This is easy to understand by considering the effect of <italic>L</italic> and <italic>V</italic> on rotation and lateral deformation of the rail head on the web. A contact patch offset towards the gauge corner rotates the rail head counterclockwise in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711424095">Figs 10</xref>(b) and (c). The lateral load, <italic>L</italic>, causes further rotation and lateral deformation of the rail head. When the lateral load is towards the gauge corner (inwards), both rotations (due to <italic>L</italic> and <italic>V</italic>) are summative and provide a much larger rotation and lateral deformation, than when the lateral load is outwards. In this case, the rotation due to <italic>L</italic> partly cancels out the rotation due to <italic>V</italic>, producing significantly lower deformation and longitudinal stresses.

<sec id="sec9-0954409711424095"><title>3.4 Effect of track foundation stiffness</title>
<p>The longitudinal tensile stress levels at the underhead radius and base fillet were investigated by changing the vertical foundation stiffness underneath the two middle sleepers adjacent to the contact position. This modelling simulates the stress state at the underhead if a poor track support condition is present in a localized area. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711424095">Figures 11</xref>(a) and (b) show the results for the longitudinal stresses as the foundation stiffness value is altered. The stress increases at the underhead radius and decreases at the base fillet as the vertical foundation stiffness increases from 0 to 123 MN/m as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711424095">Fig. 11</xref>(b). Without any support of the rail from adjacent sleepers (a vertical foundation stiffness of zero), the maximum longitudinal tensile stress was found to be 200 MPa at the base fillet and 267 MPa at the underhead respectively. Under this type of support condition, ballast pumping could take place as observed in the field. The other possibility is of straight breaks at the foot region driven by repeated tensile stresses. It was noted that beyond the vertical foundation stiffness of 35 MN/m, the longitudinal tensile stress hardly changed at either of the locations.

<sec id="sec10-0954409711424095"><title>3.5 Effect of seasonal temperature</title>
<p>The effect of the seasonal temperature of the rail on longitudinal tensile stress at the underhead radius was also investigated. The US Department of Transportation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409711424095">17</xref></bold>] has proposed an approach for the evaluation of the thermal stresses in CWR that considers service temperatures different from the neutral temperature. The neutral or stress-free temperature (assuming a temperature condition at which the rail is installed) was taken as a reference temperature. The two other service temperatures were assumed to represent the mean of colder months (10°C), and the mean of warmer months (42°C), respectively. The reference temperature was taken to be 26°C and the simulation temperature was changed for the different service temperatures of the rail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711424095">Figures 12</xref>(a) and (b) show that the longitudinal tensile stress at the underhead radius increases in colder months and decreases in warmer months with a difference of about 40 MPa. The longitudinal tensile stress reached a maximum value of 365 MPa at the underhead location of the underside of the rail due to the additional tensile stress generated in colder months.

<sec id="sec11-0954409711424095"><title>3.6 Fatigue damage</title>
<p>The analyses revealed that the tension spike is strongly dependent on the contact patch location and the magnitude and direction of the lateral traction, and hence on curving and hunting behaviour of the vehicle. The tension spike at the underhead radius can cause fatigue damage and cracking. In addition, the presence of such high tensile stresses can cause a crack to turn perpendicular to these tensile stresses resulting in the formation of transverse defects. In practice, a potential reverse detail fracture could be initiated at sharper curves in the underhead region where localized stress concentration is maximized.</p>
<p>Currently, Australian heavy haul rail systems operate with axle loads of up to 35− 40 t [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409711424095">18</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954409711424095">19</xref></bold>]. The current analysis with an axle load of 35 t showed the propensity for crack initiation and propagation. With increased axle loads, these stresses will increase even further and more occurrences of transverse defect development from rolling contact fatigue damage may be expected. Rail heads which are heavily worn out are expected to exhibit even higher stress levels, as identified by Jeong <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711424095">10</xref></bold>] in their examination of reverse detail fractures. This aspect is currently under study in relation to the development of transverse defects from rolling contact fatigue at the gauge corner.</p>
<p>Dynamic (vertical) load contributions will be created by track geometry effects; for the purposes of the current study these were assumed to be zero since the intent was to establish an FEA approach that reproduced the stress history apparent from the <italic>in situ</italic> measured data. Additional (quasi-static) loads due to curving were included by means of the application of lateral loads as previously described. Increased train speed may produce an increase in the lateral forces on either the gauge side or the field side due to lateral irregularity, and subsequently an increase in the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio as well. This will lead to elevated values of the tensile stresses and ultimately an increased risk of fatigue damage at the underhead position. In addition, an increase in tensile bending stresses together with both residual and thermally induced stresses can cause a crack to turn perpendicular to these tensile stresses once they reach a critical length.</p>
<p>The underhead region of welded rail joints could be susceptible to such failure. Welds have lower material strength values, elevated residual stress levels, and complex geometries leading to stress concentration [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711424095">20</xref></bold>]. The underhead region of the weld collar in aluminothermic welds has been observed to frequently develop fatigue cracking under high axle load conditions [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711424095">20</xref></bold>]. The fatigue damage would be even more severe when the loading is applied on the gauge side. This is because the tensile stresses are increased at the gauge side and underhead region, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711424095">Fig. 9</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0954409711424095"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The finite element code ABAQUS was used to examine the stress state at the underhead radius and gauge corner of the rail. The tension spike at the underhead radius was found to be highly dependent on several factors: the extent of the offset of the contact patch, the ratio of lateral (<italic>L</italic>) to vertical (<italic>V</italic>) loads, the direction of lateral traction, the vertical foundation stiffness, and the seasonal temperature. The following conclusions were drawn from the results of the modelling studies.
<list id="list1-0954409711424095" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The tension spike at the underhead radius of a rail increased when the contact patch moved away from the rail centreline and/or the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio increased. Inward shear traction was found to be the most damaging phenomenon.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The magnitude of the longitudinal tensile stress increased at the underhead radius as the vertical foundation stiffness increased. The result suggested that the magnitude of the longitudinal tensile stress at the underhead radius increased in colder months and decreased in warmer months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The depth at which the stress became tensile decreased as the <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> ratio increased. For <italic>L</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.4, this was of the order of a few millimeters. This could result in a transition to Mode I crack growth and the formation of a transverse defect for both rolling contact fatigue-initiated cracks that extend to this region and the fatigue behaviour of the rail underhead, as was previously examined in connection with the reverse transverse defects in the US.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Further study is needed to understand the fatigue mechanism and crack initiation at the underhead location by considering factors such as worn profiles, residual stresses, and observed crack growth behaviour at the underhead location.</p>
