<p>It can be argued that lighting research and lighting practice run along parallel lines. Both seek to identify better means to deliver light to create desired effects. The means can involve light sources, luminaires, controls and design procedures. The desired effects can be related to performance, comfort, safety, health, behaviour, atmosphere and energy. Lighting research works towards these aims through physical and psychological measurements, laboratory experiments and field observations as well as statistical analysis and synthesis. Lighting practice works towards these aims largely by trial and error; insight, observation and experience being used to increase the probability of success.</p>
<p>Given that lighting research and lighting practice are moving towards the same goals along parallel lines, what is the level of interaction between them? Sadly, the answer is little. The reality is that both lighting research and lighting practice largely exist in their own worlds. Lighting research is dominated by academics. Publication is essential for academic success so publication often becomes an end in itself. As for the world of lighting practice, this is occupied by people who have to deliver lighting in reality, the merit of which is going to be judged by the reactions of those who experience their lighting.</p>
<p>With different criteria for success, it is hardly surprising that lighting research and practice rarely connect, but there is another possible reason. This is that both worlds consider the other has little to offer them. A cynic might say that practitioners consider academics unworldly while an academic might say that practitioners are not interested. These opinions are too harsh. Lighting research does influence lighting practice through the development of new technology, through the introduction of lighting criteria into standards and through new understanding of the impacts of light on people. Conversely, lighting practice does influence lighting research through the identification of unusual events or problems needing a solution. But would it not be better if there were more links between these two worlds?</p>
<p>This issue contains the first example of an attempt to provide such a link – the LRT Digest. The idea behind the LRT Digest is that every so often a field of study reaches a consensus. At this point a summary of where the field stands, written specifically for lighting practitioners, would be useful. Of course, the Digest has to be correct so it is refereed in the usual way but it is not a conventional literature review. It is a guide to the implications of research for practice. The publication of an LRT Digest is intended to be an occasional event, the timing depending on developments in research. It will also be widely available. In addition to publication in <italic>Lighting Research and Technology</italic>, the LRT Digest will be placed on the LRT website where it will be freely accessible. It is hoped that such a link will encourage the lines of lighting research and lighting practice to converge rather than continue their separate progress to infinity</p>
