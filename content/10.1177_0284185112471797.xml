               <title>Background</title>
               <p>Contrast-enhanced, fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging (CET1WI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is quite sensitive in detecting acute optic neuritis (ON), but ON remains a clinical diagnosis. MRI is indicated to evaluate demyelinating brain lesions rather than the optic nerves, while “routine” brain protocols typically include axial FLAIR and DWI.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To evaluate the accuracy of axial, fat-suppressed FLAIR and DWI sequences used for our routine brain imaging in detecting acute ON, as compared to CET1WI and the clinical diagnosis.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>The clinical data and MRI examinations were retrospectively reviewed of 60 patients presenting to a neuro-ophthalmologist for various visual symptoms. Each patient underwent dedicated neuro-ophthalmologic examination, with axial 5 mm fat-suppressed FLAIR and DWI (part of “routine” brain MRI protocol), as well as 3 mm axial and coronal fat-suppressed CET1WI (part of dedicated orbit MRI protocol). Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated FLAIR and DWI, while CET1WI was reviewed by consensus.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>Thirty-one patients were clinically positive, 29 negative for ON (total = 34 positive and 86 negative nerves). The sensitivities of FLAIR, DWI, and CET1WI for ON were 75.7–77.3%, 77.3%, and 89.5%, respectively; the specificities were 90.5–93.5%, 80.4–82.7%, and 86.0%, respectively; the accuracies were 85.7–88.2%, 79.5–81.1%, and 87.0%, respectively. Inter-observer kappa was 0.783 for FLAIR, and 0.605 for DWI; intra-observer kappa was 0.746–0.816 for FLAIR, and 0.674–0.699 for DWI (each <italic>P</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001</italic>).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>Being more specific, but not as sensitive, as dedicated CET1WI in acute ON, axial fat-suppressed FLAIR likely has additional value in evaluating for acute ON in “routine” brain MR protocols evaluating for demyelinating disease, while DWI may be hampered by artifacts.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>Optic neuritis (ON) is, to date, usually diagnosed based on its clinical features and supportive neuro-ophthalmologic examination findings alone and does not necessarily include orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a requirement to confirm the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>). However, other disease processes may mimic ON, such as compressive or inflammatory orbital lesions, where the use of MRI may be necessary to exclude alternative diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C2">2</xref>). In fact, the primary use of MRI in acute or subacute ON is to detect asymptomatic demyelinating brain lesions, predict possible risks of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and, if clinically applicable, monitor the disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>). This is particularly important as nearly 50% of patients presenting with the isolated symptom of ON develop multiple sclerosis over the following 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>). This indicates that the greatest value of MRI in the typical scenario of demyelinating ON is brain imaging instead of optic nerve imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>). Although MRI is not necessary to reach the clinical diagnosis of acute ON, patients with ON who demonstrate brain lesions suggestive of MS may enjoy some benefit from corticosteroid treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>). Thus, patients suffering from acute ON should undergo brain MRI to evaluate for MS lesions, whereas dedicated optic nerve evaluation is reserved for patients in whom etiologies other than demyelinating disease are considerations (e.g. tumor, infection, trauma, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>).</p>
         <p>Regarding imaging of acute or subacute ON, abnormal enhancement on fat-suppressed CET1WI usually detects ON and discriminates abnormal enhancement of the optic nerve sheath with high sensitivity (94%), <italic>versus</italic> chronic changes of the nerve which do not exhibit contrast enhancement; such enhancement has been shown to persist at much as 30 days or more following the onset of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C9">9</xref>). The presence of contrast enhancement may be related to contrast leakage through a disrupted blood nerve barrier around the optic nerve, which is associated with impairment of visual functions during the occurrence of the acute inflammation, but later improves once the inflammation is resolved. Therefore, this signifies that there may be an appreciable correlation between the abnormal enhancement on CET1WI and the severity of the visual impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C11">11</xref>). For these reasons, CET1WI is commonly acquired with fat suppression to remove or minimize potential confounding signal from the surrounding orbital fat.</p>
         <p>More recent MRI-based techniques to image the optic nerves have also implemented various fat-suppression techniques in combination with or part of such sequences such as: (i) STIR (to depict the optic nerve and nerve sheath edema); (ii) fast spin-echo T2-weighted images (T2WI, also to depict the optic nerve and surrounding edema); and (iii) FLAIR; in particular, 3D FLAIR images with fat-suppression have shown quite a high sensitivity in recent reports (possibly as high as 100%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C15">15</xref>). Also, there are recent reports of the utility of both DWI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting acute ON, where DWI has preliminarily been shown to be able to discriminate acute from chronic ON, although the accuracy of routine DWI in acute ON has not yet been clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C18">18</xref>). However, dedicated 3D FLAIR imaging and DTI in acute ON may be time-consuming, particularly to obtain in an isotropic manner with thin reconstructions, especially when the primary indication of MRI in this disorder is to obtain brain imaging to evaluate for concomitant white matter lesions. As the standard brain MRI work-up of suspected demyelinating disease typically includes, at a minimum, axial FLAIR, DWI, and T2WI, as well as CET1WI, the purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the accuracy of our routine brain protocol that includes axial FLAIR images (implementing fat suppression) and DWI in detecting acute ON in patients with clinically proven acute ON, and to compare those two sequences to the standard of fat-suppressed CET1WI MRI.</p>

            <title>Patient selection</title>
            <p>This retrospective study was approved by the internal review board. Over a 3-year period (March 2006 to July 2009), 61 patients exhibiting ophthalmologic symptoms that presented for MRI evaluation with suspected visual/orbital symptoms were included for this study, who both underwent evaluation for ON by a neuro-ophthalmologist, and also underwent a brain and orbit MRI that implemented non-contrast 5-mm-thick axial FLAIR and DWI, as well as 3-mm-thick gadolinium-based postcontrast T1WI (in both the axial and coronal planes). In our study cohort, the MRI studies were performed within 4 weeks of acute presentation for ON. Patients were excluded only if the MRI suffered from severe motion or was incomplete (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Hence, the remaining 60 patients who presented for MRI to rule out an ophthalmologic condition were included for this retrospective evaluation. A control population was obtained from 29 of the 60 patients; these 29 exhibited visual or ocular symptoms which precipitated their presentation to the neuro-ophthalmologist, but had no clinical history of optic neuritis, nor had positive findings of ON from dedicated neuro-ophthalmologic examination. The remaining 31 patients represented those with a clinically confirmed acute ON, according to a dedicated neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. The diagnosis of “right”, “left”, or “bilateral” ON was discerned by a neuro-ophthalmologist with at least 5 years of experience in diagnosing optic nerve pathologies. The organizational chart in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F1">1</xref> delineates the patient selection for this study. We note that while each patient was considered as positive or negative for ON based on clinical evaluation, the nerves' involvement were tabulated individually for the purpose of image review by the neuroradiologists. We did not record whether or not patients with ON eventually developed MS, which would have taken many years to confirm, and was not this study's focus.

            <title>MRI sequence parameters</title>
            <p>The MRI examinations were performed on three different scanners: two at 1.5T, and one at 3T Magnetom Avanto and Trio models (Siemens Healthcare, Malvern, PA, USA), using our standard, routine, brain MRI protocol that included axial 5-mm-thickness fat-suppressed FLAIR (“FatSat” set to “strong” for fat suppression, a chemical shift-based technique routinely available from the vendor) and DWI, while the fat-suppressed T1WI were obtained as part of our standard orbit MRI protocol. The FLAIR sequence parameters at 1.5T were in the ranges of 6500–9000/105–110/2000–2100/1–2/15–23 (TR/TE/TI/NEX/echo train length), and at 3T were in the ranges of 9000–11,000/100–120/2000–2100/1–2/10–25. We noted no difference in acquisition time when acquiring FLAIR with <italic>versus</italic> without fat suppression; the acquisition time was about 4 min on each magnet. For DWI, the parameters at 1.5T were in the ranges of 3300–4000/71–120 (TR/TE), and at 3T were 2800–3000/70–90, with a gradient strength of b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> on all DWIs; the acquisition time was typically 1–1.5 min. For both axial and coronal T1WI, the range of parameters at both field strengths were a fat-suppressed spin-echo sequence utilizing 400–690/10–17 (TR/TE), with a slice thickness of 3 mm, about 4–6 min following intravenous gadolinium-based contrast medium administration (Magnevist, Bayer Healthcare, Wayne, NJ, USA) at a dose of 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg).</p>

            <title>Image review and MRI evaluation scoring</title>
            <p>The MR images of the 60 patients who underwent MRI were reviewed separately by two staff neuroradiologists (AM, MB), with over 5 years' experience in brain and orbit MRI interpretation. Each reviewer independently reviewed the DWI and the FLAIR separate from each other (i.e. DWI separate from FLAIR) and separate from the other MR sequences. The cases and controls were randomly presented to the reviewers who were masked to both the clinical history and the presence or absence of ON. CET1W1 images were reviewed on a single occasion, jointly and by consensus of the two reviewers, while the FLAIR and DWI images were independently reviewed on two separate occasions within a minimum of a 2-week interval. The optic nerve inspections for ON on FLAIR, DWI, and CET1W1 were tabulated according to an arbitrary scoring system (“+”, “−” or “indeterminate” for ON). A “+” abnormality for ON was defined as the presence of increased signal intensity within an optic nerve on either FLAIR or DWI relative to the surrounding intraconal fat, and with greater hyperintensity than the extraocular muscles; a similar criteria was utilized for classifying an optic nerve as “+” on CET1WI (i.e. enhancement greater than the surrounding intraconal fat and extraocular musculature). Suspected artifacts obscuring the nerves or signal intensity/enhancement similar to the extraocular musculature were classified as “indeterminate”. ADC maps were available to reviewers only for the DWI review. The nerves were tabulated and recorded on a “nerve-by-nerve” basis, although the reviewer evaluated both nerves in each patient simultaneously, by necessity.</p>

         <sec id="s2d">
            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated individually for FLAIR and DWI, according to each observer, using the clinical diagnosis as the “gold standard”. For the purposes of this calculation, only nerves tabulated as “+” were counted as positive (i.e. “indeterminate” nerves were not counted as positive). Our statistical analysis was performed utilizing the SPSS 7.5 for Windows' statistical package (SPSS, Chicago, IL. USA). Both inter-observer and intra-observer reliability were assessed for FLAIR and DWI by utilizing a weighted Cohen's kappa (<italic>k</italic>) test; for this kappa evaluation, a value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C19">19</xref>).</p>

            <title>Patient demographics and numbers having ON</title>
            <p>Of the initial 62 patients, 41 were women and 21 were men, with an age range of 14–83 years (mean 43.8 ± 15.4 years). Two patients were excluded due to incomplete imaging or severe motion, resulting in a total of 60 patients included for review (39 women, 21 men). The age range of the 31 patients with clinically confirmed ON was 14–68 years (mean 38.3 ± 13.4 years), while the age range of the 29 control patients was 20–83 years (mean 49.7 ± 15.6 years). The range of time between the clinical presentation for acute ON and the presentation to MRI was 1–30 days (mean 12.7 ± 10.1 days). There was a total of 34 clinically-positive optic nerves (“true-positives”), and a total of 86 clinically-negative optic nerves (“true-negatives”); this breakdown of patients is shown in the organizational chart in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F1">1</xref>, and examples of “true-negative” and “true-positive” nerves on both FLAIR and DWI are demonstrated in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F4">4</xref>.

            <p>Of the 86 optic nerves that were clinically negative, the reviewers found “false-positives” in 6–9/86 (7.0–10.5%) of the optic nerves on FLAIR, 18–21 (20.9–24.4%) on DWI, and 15 (17.4%) on CET1WI. Of the 34 optic nerves clinically positive for ON, the reviewers found “false-negatives” in 10–11/34 (29.4–32.4%) of the optic nerves on FLAIR, in 10/34 (29.4%) on DWI, and in 4/34 (11.76%) on CET1WI (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475444F6">6</xref>). Of the 120 total optic nerves, those tabulated as “indeterminate” for ON were 10–12 (8.3–10.0%) on DWI, 7–8 (5.8–6.7%) on FLAIR, and 12 (10.0%) on CET1WI. Thus, the reviewers reported the least numbers of “indeterminate” nerves on FLAIR, as compared to DWI and CET1WI.

The two reviewers initially questioned enhancement (arrows) near both orbital apices along the inner aspect of the anterior clinoid processes on axial CET1WI (c). However, the left optic nerve appeared to exhibit asymmetric avid enhancement (arrow), relative to the right, on coronal CET1WI (d); the reviewers reached agreement and called only the left side as positive for acute ON (a false-positive). This is an example of the most common cause of false-positive on both DWI and CET1WI, where the apparent enhancement was presumed to arise from susceptibility artifact present at the skull base just above the sphenoid sinus (an “air-bone” interface), being worst just posterior to the orbital apices</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>ON is occasionally a debilitating disease, particularly if occurring in conjunction with MS, which eventually develops in about 50% of patients with ON, and an even higher percentage if female (up to 75%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C22">22</xref>). Most of our current understanding of the natural history and course of the disease arises from the long-term Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial, as well as subsequent related longitudinal studies that have compiled characteristic clinical findings with diagnostic criteria for acute ON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C27">27</xref>). Interestingly, although the healing of an episode of acute ON may take 6 months to 1 year, the maximal recovery of vision that patients experience is typically within the first few months following ON onset; about two-thirds of patients nearly completely recover their vision after the ON subsides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C27">27</xref>). Thus, although the acute symptoms can be quite alarming to the patient, the necessity of imaging, which sequences, and the anatomy to be covered in acute ON should be clearly defined, particularly in this era of increased attention to cost efficiency and imaging appropriateness. According to both the Optic Neuritis Study Group and the Longitudinal Optic Neuritis Study, the recommendation is to limit MRI to brain imaging in typical acute ON, which is indicated to determine the extent of concomitant brain lesions, as the presence of &gt; 1 brain lesions in acute ON entails at least a 56% risk of developing MS over 10+ years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>). These studies advocate that dedicated orbital MRI in acute ON is recommended for diagnostic purposes when the clinical findings do not fit a typical clinical profile. Hence, our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of routine sequences such as FLAIR and DWI, which can be obtained as a part of standard whole brain MRI during a demyelinating disease examination. We compared those two sequences to both the clinical diagnosis of acute ON, as well as to the sequence that up to this point has shown the greatest ability in detecting acute ON, which is fat-suppressed CET1WI.</p>
         <p>Our study found that, as expected, the sensitivity of fat-suppressed CET1WI was highest for detecting acute ON. The utility of fat-suppressed CET1WI in diagnosing ON has been shown in multiple previous studies, while also being shown as superior to CET1WI lacking fat suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C28">28</xref>). However, there is much less literature discussing the ability of fat-suppressed FLAIR images in diagnosing acute ON. A seminal study by Jackson <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that utilizing selective presaturation inversion recovery (SPIR) fat suppression with FLAIR was superior to both fat-suppressed T2WI (also implementing SPIR suppression) and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) in detecting ON, while fat-suppressed FLAIR also had the highest interobserver reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C12">12</xref>). We note that the slice thickness in that study for the dedicated coronal SPIR-FLAIR imaging of the orbits was 3 mm, while the slice thickness of our axial FLAIR images was 5 mm (per our “routine” brain protocol). More recent studies have also demonstrated the utility of fat-suppressed FLAIR in diagnosing ON, with ON detected in up to 100% of patients on the correct side using dedicated 3D acquisitions of the optic nerves, such as FLAIR combined with selective partial attenuation/adiabatic inversion recovery (SPAIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C29">29</xref>). In this regard, we found a higher specificity regarding fat-suppressed FLAIR in detecting acute ON compared to CET1WI, with accuracy similar to CET1WI. We interpret these findings to mean that the accuracy could be even higher with dedicated orbital thin-section FLAIR, based on prior studies, and since volume averaging is also the most likely cause of our lower sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C14">14</xref>). Future studies could even implement postcontrast FLAIR images to the clinical diagnosis, as postcontrast FLAIR can be as sensitive as or more sensitive than CET1WI in detecting meningeal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C30">30</xref>).</p>
         <p>Regarding the utility of DWI for detecting acute ON, we found that DWI had the lowest accuracy of the three techniques in detecting acute ON, largely due to artifacts that are most prominent in the posterior orbit near the sphenoid sinus and bony sella. In this regard, there is a relative paucity of literature concerning the use of DWI for optic neuritis, possibly due to the known technical difficulties related to susceptibility artifacts at that anatomical location near air-bone interfaces (such as the sphenoid sinus-clivus, which was at times problematic in our study), as well as other artifacts (e.g. partial volume effects, phase unwrapping, motion, N/2 ghosting, and under-sampling of k-space) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C18">18</xref>). Techniques that have been suggested to enhance DWI or other diffusion-based techniques (such as DTI) include zonal oblique echoplanar imaging (so-called “ZOOM-EPI”), gating, motion correction, and improved suppression of fat and CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C31">31</xref>). In this study, we did not implement such experimental image acquisition methods for DWI, but solely relied on the DWI sequence and parameters that were used in daily practice as part of our “routine” brain MRI protocols, which are also considered a standard part of our initial work-up of demyelinating disease. Thus, we acknowledge that the lower sensitivity and specificity of DWI relative to both FLAIR and postcontrast T1WI could be improved by the use of newer techniques.</p>
         <p>Given the retrospective nature of this study, we acknowledge that there are a number of inherent limitations, including selection bias (i.e. all patients included in this study presented with visual or ocular symptoms, whether patients or negative controls), the lack of true age and gender-matched controls, and the lack of longitudinal follow-up imaging with clinical correlation for the development of MS (which would have taken many years). Additionally, the implication of clinically negative nerves with positive MRI findings, as found in our study on CET1WI, can be difficult to explain. The most likely explanation would be that some imaging features (such as enhancing perineurium, venous plexus, or dura surrounding the optic nerve on CET1WI) are normal variations, but simulate enhancement on CET1WI; alternatively artifacts such as failed fat suppression can simulate abnormalities on such fat suppressed sequences. There are also various potential technical limitations, most importantly that 5 mm routine whole-brain FLAIR and DWI were reviewed, rather than the 3-mm-thin sections that are typically utilized in the coronal plane for dedicated orbital evaluation. In this regard, we emphasize that our intent was not to evaluate the accuracy of optimized FLAIR or DWI in detecting ON based on a dedicated orbital protocol, but rather to evaluate the accuracy of both sequences in detecting acute ON when performed as part of a typical, routine brain MR protocol. We performed it in this fashion to simulate the situation in which FLAIR and DWI are commonly utilized in the initial work-up of demyelinating disease, as a dedicated brain (not necessarily orbital) MRI is clearly indicated in the initial work-up of acute ON. Thus, although the certainty of diagnosis of acute ON is of value to the referring physician and patient, dedicated orbital MRI is not essential, according to the aforementioned literature, and the time of imaging in the MRI magnet could be spent to a greater degree on dedicated whole brain imaging to detect subtle demyelinating lesions; notably, the presence of even one cerebral lesion in a patient with acute MS markedly increases their chance of developing MS over the next 10–15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C22">22</xref>). Other technical limitations include the lack of fat-suppressed FLAIR imaging in another imaging plane for confirmation, and that the fat suppression on FLAIR may be affected by inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, whether due to nearby gas (such as from the adjacent paranasal sinuses), metal/hardware (such as from dental amalgam inferior to the orbits), or potentially even motion. Also, regarding our inter-observer comparisons, it could be said that CET1WI should have been reviewed independently by the two reviewers. Our reason for this was to optimize the accuracy of CET1WI (the imaging “standard” for detecting acute ON), since our intent was to evaluate the accuracy of FLAIR and DWI in detecting acute ON (not CET1WI); it was unexpected that FLAIR would outperform CET1WI regarding the specificity. Optimally, future studies could directly compare CET1WI to FLAIR using a similar slice thickness and planes.</p>
         <p>It has been noted that both the high signal intensity of orbital fat and chemical shift artifacts can limit the fat suppression obtained by the STIR, SPIR, and SPAIR methods, particularly on T2WI, where increasing the T2-weighting to visualize nerve edema may lead to more artifacts from volume averaging CSF within the nerve sheath with the nerve itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C14">14</xref>). This can be mitigated by the use of FLAIR (suppresses CSF) and higher spatial resolution, such as using a 3D acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C14">14</xref>). However, certain methods of fat suppression may increase the acquisition time on FLAIR images. In this regard, our fat-suppressed FLAIR images implemented the vendor's routine chemical shift-based technique, which added no additional time when comparing non-suppressed to fat-suppressed acquisitions, while we note that utilizing SPAIR-FLAIR suppression results in a 1–1.5 min longer acquisition time on each magnet as compared to the standard “Fatsat” mode of fat suppression. As previous studies have utilized SPIR or SPAIR for fat suppression on FLAIR, both of which are thought to provide better signal-to-noise ratio and more homogeneous fat suppression, the use of SPIR or SPAIR with FLAIR may be better to implement in future studies, even if obtained in the axial plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475444C14">14</xref>). Therefore, our results with FLAIR may not have been optimized regarding the fat suppression technique, although the acquisition time was rather quick.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, while fat-suppressed CET1WI has the highest sensitivity in detecting acute ON, fat-suppressed FLAIR has a higher specificity and nearly equivalent accuracy, even if obtained as part of a “routine” brain MRI protocol, which is indicated in evaluating for demyelinating disease in acute ON. DWI is less accurate due to artifacts. However, the accuracy of both FLAIR and DWI should be reassessed by future studies using newer techniques, particularly SPAIR and postcontrast FLAIR.</p>
