<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this extended commentary article is to frame the set of studies in the first of two issues and recommend areas of inquiry for future research. This special series issue features studies examining the technical qualities of formative assessment procedures that were developed to inform intervention. This article intends to emphasize issues in the current set of studies that do not appear central to early numeracy curriculum-based measurement (EN-CBM) research. To the extent possible, we expect that this two-volume series will result in scientific and practical advances. Despite this lofty intention, this series can neither represent all issues important to stakeholders nor characterize the full body of applied and basic research in early numeracy assessment. As such, we focus on a set of theoretical frameworks to guide the current and future development of EN-CBM.</p>

<p>In the first commentary article introducing this special series, we argued that early numeracy assessment must assist educators as they make instructionally relevant and data-based decisions on behalf of young mathematics learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411431256">Methe et al., 2011</xref>). It was also proposed that theory about the bases of number sense must also drive the development of future measures. An overarching theme cutting across the theoretical bases of number sense emphasizes the vast difference between abstract number symbols (numerals) and their meanings. According to the Number Sense Access view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411431256">Wilson, Dehaene, Dubois, &amp; Fayol, 2009</xref>), a critical development in early number sense is the linking of nonsymbolic knowledge with symbolic knowledge. According to this view, nonsymbolic knowledge appears in both a perceptual and language-based form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431256">Dehaene, Piazze, Pinel, &amp; Cohen, 2005</xref>). For those versed in early literacy assessment, this is very much like the critical transition that occurs when a child develops knowledge of the alphabetic principle. This key period in early numeracy learning could also be referred to as development of the numeric principle, and assessment tools must be developed to model this transition in knowledge. This is especially true for curriculum-based measures (CBMs). In this brief commentary, I want to emphasize both the content and the decision-making capabilities of the assessments under development.</p>
<p>First, the article by Polignano and Hojnoksi details the development and validation of a set of new measures for preschool children. Informal (nonsymbolic) and formal (symbolic) knowledge interface in school settings and are most likely to be introduced on kindergarten entry. Children lacking informal knowledge are most likely to struggle in acquiring even basic knowledge such as symbol names and struggle to fluently produce even the simplest of basic facts (see the Stickney, Sharp, &amp; Kenyon article, this volume). Polignano and Hojnoski sought to develop measures to model important transitions in knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411431256">Baroody, 2004</xref>), such as when children learn that the last number counted in a set equals one unit, and also identifies the set size (i.e., cardinality). Other studies that continue to examine the Tests of Early Numeracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411431256">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>) allow examination of not only counting words and cardinality, but also symbol naming, thus providing a more complete look at the numeric code (see Missall, Mercer, Martinez, &amp; Casebeer, this volume). Polignano and Hojnoski also sought to widen the availability of measures that can assist educators in learning about a child’s grasp of key early numeracy concepts, and also geometric knowledge. Although it was argued in the previous commentary that the construct of number sense (as analogous to early numeracy) has been perhaps overrepresented in the curriculum-based development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534508411431256">Methe et al., 2011</xref>) and the literature in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534508411431256">Berch, 2005</xref>), it was also proposed that this fledgling field of development can greatly benefit from a wide diversity of measures from which to draw, and ultimately find those that best capture informal and formal knowledge through ongoing validation and later-stage CBM research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411431256">Fuchs, 2004</xref>). Further organizing this development of measures is the “big idea” view proposed by numerous researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534508411431256">Carnine, Dixon, &amp; Silbert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534508411431256">Harniss, Stein, &amp; Carnine, 2002</xref>). In early number sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411431256">Clements (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411431256">Sarama and Clements (2009)</xref> identify a set of key topics that organize a variety of skills and knowledge forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431256">Methe and VanDerHeyden (in press)</xref> used this framework to organize both policy-based recommendations and sets of available measures in early numeracy for a response-to-intervention framework.</p>
<p>Original conceptions of CBM require tests that have high levels of criterion-related validity, reliability, and are sensitive to growth. Although the field has identified a small set of “workhorse” measures that have withstood substantial empirical scrutiny (TEN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534508411431256">Clarke &amp; Shinn, 2004</xref>), general outcome measures like these struggle to capture more exact knowledge deficits and simply indicate the likelihood of a problem and need for further assessment and instructional support. However, the predictive utility and strength of this indication appears strong and is investigated by Missall et al. (this volume) as well as Lee et al. (this volume). Specifically, the MN and QD measures appear to represent the construct of early numeracy well and have substantial long-term predictive validity.</p>
<p>In the editorial prefacing this two-part special series on early numeracy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534508411431256">Hosp (2011)</xref> indicated that research into early numeracy assessment appears to model the development of reading research. With regard to the idea that both alphabetics and numeric are symbol-based systems, this trace generally makes sense. The downward extension of research into the oral reading measure led to two key waves of study into the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills: (a) the DIBELS themselves and (b) the further development of diagnostic measures known as DIBELS DEEP. This course of study and development of early numeracy measures is strongly recommended to complete examinations of the decision-making utility of the TENs as well as the dozens of other available measures, and extend research to higher stages such as examining which measures are sensitive to short-term intervention effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534508411431256">Fuchs, 2004</xref>). Although the Tests of Early Numeracy remain the most well researched measures, the National Center for Response to Intervention recognizes that these measures do not model growth well, which is addressed by Hampton et al. (this volume). The problem in growth modeling appears to lie in the units of growth per unit of time. Sensitive measures reflect changes in student knowledge at anywhere between 1 and 3 whole units (e.g., digits correct, words read correctly) per week (depending on student skill level). Looking closely at the measures, as well as widened stimulus sets and item-level statistics (see Lee et al., this volume), there is promise for working a wider stimulus set into a measure such as missing number (e.g., missing numbers to 20 have greater discrimination indices than more restricted sets).</p>
<p>With regard to a measure that acts like a general outcome in mathematics (i.e., continued sensitivity to improvement and strong criterion-related validity), the field may be restricted to those that sit atop the hierarchy of early number sense. Considering the “big ideas” framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534508411431256">Clements, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534508411431256">Sarama &amp; Clements, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534508411431256">Methe &amp; VanDerHeyden, in press</xref>), it is notable that number combinations such as adding and subtracting with numerals sits atop a hierarchy of prior knowledge, skill, and prior knowledge form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534508411431256">Howell &amp; Nolet, 2000</xref>). For example, fluent performance in basic skills, especially addition with regrouping around a base-10 unit (e.g., 8 + 7), appears to be associated with low-levels of risk and more success and forward movement through a curriculum. A constraint-based view of learning (i.e., that lower-level skill deficits impact further learning) can be used to understand how basic facts can be an indicator of number sense. Stickney, Sharp, and Kenyon (this volume) discuss this issue in their introduction and offer a wide variety of descriptive statistics across skill areas demonstrating learning trajectories. Adding to their work is the latent cluster analysis of Missall et al. (this volume), which reminds readers that early trajectories of risk appear to be stable over time, and therefore early screening measures with strong reliability and predictive validity can be critical in preventing early failure and enhancing success.</p>
<p>As a final note, it is important to emphasize the long-term goal inherent in each study in this special series: the prevention of early numeracy problems and the enhancement of later success outside of school. Robust and convincing data continue to emphasize the need to focus on early numeracy in the curriculum. From its earliest onset, language development in the home appears to predict mathematics achievement more robustly than later reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534508411431256">Oxford &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>), consistent with the informal to formal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534508411431256">Baroody, 2004</xref>), triple code theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534508411431256">Dehaene et al., 2005</xref>), and the number sense access view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534508411431256">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). With regard to ongoing school success, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534508411431256">Duncan et al. (2007)</xref> used longitudinal data to demonstrate how early mathematics is uniquely predictive of later success in both reading and mathematics and plays a critical role in later school success (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534508411431256">Claessens, Duncan, &amp; Engel, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534508411431256">Borman and Overman (2004)</xref>, writing for a policy-making audience, indicate how mathematics skill is uniquely linked to the construct of resilience. In the previous commentary article, research examining health and health numeracy, financial literacy, and work-related satisfaction suggest predictable outcomes that follow from mathematics success.</p>
<p>When examining research linking school mathematics success to later outcomes, it becomes obvious that the inclination to use mathematics to address problems that present themselves in nonclassroom contexts, akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534508411431256">Ma (1999)</xref> refers to as “lie shi” (formulating a mathematical expression to represent a problem), best defines mathematics success. Therefore, a key task for future research would be to examine how to assess this ability as it develops in early elementary school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534508411431256">Newcombe et al. (2009)</xref> argue that psychological inquiry, such as the kind advanced in these two volumes on early numeracy assessment, will play a vital role in strengthening future mathematics intervention and instruction.</p>
