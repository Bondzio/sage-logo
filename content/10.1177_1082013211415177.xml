<abstract>
<p>Fish curry, a traditional Indian dish was prepared from farmed fish Cobia (<italic>Rachycentron canadum</italic>), packaged by two different cook-chill processes namely, sous vide cook chilled and hot filled technology and held at 2 °C. Biochemical composition revealed that fish curry contained 5% protein and 6% fat. Omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) retained 55.44% while docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) retained 29% during cook-chilling process. The major fatty acids in fish curry were C18:2, C12:0, C16:0 and C18:1. Shelf-life of sous vide cook chilled and hot filled technology processed fish curry were 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. Total bacterial counts were detected after 4 weeks and 12 weeks in sous vide cook chilled and hot filled technology processes, respectively. Total staphylococci were detected in sous vide cook chilled and hot filled technology processed cobia fish curry after 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Total bacilli, anaerobic sulfite reducing clostridia, <italic>Salmonella,</italic> and lactic acid bacteria were absent. Hot filled technology process was more efficient and could be applied for chilled fish curry preservation for 12 weeks without any safety problems.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211415177" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cobia (<italic>Rachycentron canadum</italic>), the only member of the family Rachycentridae, is a widely distributed species of pelagic fish found worldwide, except the Eastern Pacific, in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1082013211415177">Shaffer and Nakamura, 1989</xref>). It is a sturdy cigar-shaped fish that can grow to a maximum size of 75 kg by weight and 1.80 m by length. Black kingfish is the most common in the Cobia species while others being ling, crab eater, sergeant fish or lemon fish. Cobia has recently gained importance as a ‘new’ species for aquaculture. It started probably a decade ago in Taiwan in seawater ponds and in small sea cages, and now it has become the main farmed marine fish in Taiwan, occupying 80% of the sea cages and with an estimated production of 1500 tonnes in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211415177">Su et al., 2000</xref>). The farming is now being carried out in other regions of the Far East such as Hainan (China), Okinawa (Japan) and Vietnam and will presumably become an emerging aquaculture industry in the near future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211415177">Lopez et al., 2002</xref>). The reason for the success in farming is due to its fast growth rate. It normally weighs about 5–6 kg up to 1 year and 8–10 kg in 16 months. Another reason for its growing demand is its excellent flavor. Their scattered occurrence on the fish markets leaves many people unfamiliar to the qualities of cobia. The meat of the different parts of cobia shows very distinctive qualities as for fat and moisture contents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211415177">Sidwell (1981)</xref> reported the chemical composition of raw cobia having 74.9% moisture, 18.9% protein, 5.4% fat and 1.3% ash contents. Cobia has also been found to have versatile use, as sashimi, steamed, fried or broiled and boiled for soups. This property together with its pan-tropical/subtropical distribution opens up for a very big market potential.</p>
<p>Fish curry is one of the important delicacies in Asian restaurants and is a formulated product prepared using spices, tamarind and coconut paste. This product has a very short shelf-life of 12 h at ambient temperature and 3 days at refrigerated condition. Application of preservation techniques that give extended shelf-life with nutrient and odor retention will have more consumer acceptance. Sous vide cook chilled (SVCC) technology is one such technique that has an increasing consumer demand in recent years because of their convenience, closer to fresh characteristics with extended shelf-life and keeping quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211415177">Smith et al., 1990</xref>). It consists of preparation of product, packaging in heat stable, air impermeable bags under vacuum, sealing, cooking to a specific time and temperature, cooling and storage under refrigeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211415177">Light et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The Meat and Poultry Working Group of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods have defined the SVCC products into nine general process types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211415177">ICMSF, 1988</xref>). Under this, for the liquid products such as stews, sauces and soups, the process described include formulation of product from raw ingredients, cooking, filling while hot, sealing, and chilling. This type of cook-chill foods with extended shelf-life are termed as ‘hot filled’’ foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211415177">Rybka, 2000</xref>). In concise, hot fill technology (HFT) involves aseptic packaging of pasteurized, hot or boiling liquid foods in high barrier heat stable bags, quick immediate cooling in crushed ice (0 °C) and subsequent refrigerated storage (3 °C). Advantages of this technology are that it kills all vegetative pathogenic bacteria, and preserves the original flavor/texture and nutritional qualities. It also prevents post process contamination of foods. Vacuum created by immediate chilling prevents the growth of aerobic microorganisms as well as kills the surviving thermophilic bacteria. The aerobic spore formers that survive pasteurization are further controlled by refrigerated storage (3 °C). This technology is particularly utilized by large-scale commercial food services to produce in house premium quality stocks, sauces, salad dressing, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415177">Rybka et al., 2001</xref>). Owing to the importance of the SVCC and HFT technology in the preservation of liquid products with extended shelf-life, this study is undertaken to examine the quality and safety of fish curry prepared by SVCC and HFT processes under refrigerated storage.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1082013211415177"><title>Raw material</title>
<p>Farmed cobia fish (<italic>Rachycentron canadum</italic>) were procured from the mariculture farm of the Maritech Research Centre, Tharuvaikulam in Tuticorin District Tamil Nadu, India and brought to the laboratory in iced condition in insulated container. The length and weight of the fish were 107 cm and 7.16 kg, respectively. It was beheaded, eviscerated and washed in chlorinated water. The yield after dressing was calculated. It was cut into steaks of 25–30 g size and used for the preparation of fish curry.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1082013211415177"><title>Preparation of fish curry</title>
<p>The ingredients used for the preparation of fish curry were obtained from the local supermarket. Fish steaks were flash fried for 30 s in hot sunflower oil and kept aside. Chopped onions were then seasoned in the oil until golden brown. Chopped tomatoes were then added followed by chilli, coriander, cumin, turmeric and pepper powders. Tamarind water and coconut paste were finally added to make the curry mix along with required quantity of water. In another shallow pan, mustard seed, green chillies and curry leaves were seasoned in sunflower oil and then added to the fish curry mix. The flash-fried fish steaks were then added and allowed to boil. The fish curry was then divided into two portions for packaging by SVCC and HFC processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211415177"><title>Packaging by sous vide cook chilled process</title>
<p>One portion of fish curry was cooled and filled aseptically in laminated pouches (Cryovac, 200 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup>, 3-ply PE-Nylon-PE copolymer) obtained from Sealed Air India Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore, India. The pack weight was 250 g. The pouches used had a thickness of 100 µm with oxygen transmission rate 30 cc/m<sup>2</sup>/day/20 °C/50%RH, seal strength 2.5 kg/25 mm and global migration rate below 60 ppm. The pouches were then sealed in the vacuum packaging machine (Sevana’s QUICK SEAL VAC, India) and then placed in the water bath set at 95 °C for 20 min. They were then immediately chilled in crushed flake ice (ZIEGRA Maschinen, ZBE 150 Nr 94006, Germany) for 1 h. The pouches were labeled and stored in chill cabinet (Servo, Salem, India) set at 2 °C without ice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211415177"><title>Packaging by hot filled chilled process</title>
<p>Another portion of fish curry was allowed to boil continuously for 20 min and filled aseptically in the laminated pouches used above in a boiling condition. The pack weight was 250 g. The pouches were then immediately sealed in Teflon lined hot bar sealer under aseptic condition and chilled as done with SVCC process. The pouches were then labeled and stored in a chill cabinet (Servo, Salem, India) set at 2 ± 1 °C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211415177"><title>Biochemical composition</title>
<p>Biochemical composition of the raw fish and cook-chilled fish curry were determined based on standard AOAC methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211415177">AOAC, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211415177"><title>Fatty acid composition</title>
<p>The fish lipids from the raw fish and cook-chilled fish curry after SVCC and HFT processes were extracted following the procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211415177">Folch et al., (1957)</xref>. Sample (10 g) was homogenized with 30 mL of chloroform: methanol (1:2) and filtered. The impurities were removed by the addition of 0.74% KCl followed by separation in a separating funnel. The lower chloroform layer was removed and evaporated to dryness in a rotary flash evaporator (Superfit, Mumbai, India) under the steam of nitrogen. The extracted lipid (100 mg) was used for methylation by BF3-methanol method (AOAC, 1990). The lipid (50 mg) was taken in a screw capped tube to which 2 mL of 0.5 M methanolic NaOH was added and refluxed for 5 min. Five mL of BF3-methanol was then added and refluxed for another 2 min. Saturated sodium chloride was added to separate the saponified fraction. Methyl esters were then separated out by adding 2 × 5 mL of hexane. The upper hexane layer was carefully removed and concentrated to dryness under the steam of nitrogen to 1 mL.</p>
<p>The fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography technique following the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211415177">Candela et al. (1996)</xref> with slight modification. Perkin-Elmer Autosystem XL Gas Chromatography fitted with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a fused silica capillary column (PE −225, 0.25 mm ID, 30 m length) was used for the separation. The operating conditions were injector temperature 250 °C and detector temperature 300 °C. A temperature gradient programme was followed with initial oven temperature set at 70 °C for 1 min, which was then increased to 180 °C at the rate of 3 °C/min and then to 220 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min. The carrier gas used was nitrogen at 20 psi pressure. Peaks were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic fatty acid standard mixtures (Sigma Chemicals Co., Product No. 189-19, St. Louis, USA, 99% purity specific for Gas Chromatography) and expressed as peak area percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211415177"><title>Quality analysis</title>
<p>Samples were analyzed periodically for the changes in pH, total acidity, TBA-RS values microbiological and sensory changes during the refrigerated storage. Three pouches of SVCC and HFT fish curry, each weighing 250 g were taken and each analysis was carried out in triplicate and their mean values were expressed with standard deviation. The whole experiment was repeated twice for concurrent results.</p>
<p>Total acidity was measured by titration method. Sample (10 g) was homogenized with 100 mL distilled water and filtered. The filtrate (10 mL) was titrated with 0.1 N NaOH using 1% phenolphthalein as indicator and expressed as oleic acid in grams per 100 g sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211415177">Salfield, 1975</xref>). Measurement of pH was done using a previously calibrated pH meter (ELICO, Hyderabad, India). Sample (10 g) was homogenized with 50 mL distilled water and filtered, the filtrate was used to measure the pH.</p>
<p>Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS) were determined by spectrophotometric method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211415177">Ke et al., 1984</xref>). For which, sample (10 g) was homogenized with 47.5 mL of distilled water and transferred into a distillation flask along with 50 mg of propyl gallate and 50 mg of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). To this, 50 mL of distilled water and 25 mL of 4 N hydrochloric acid were added. Distillation was carried out and 50 mL of distillate was collected. Then 5 mL of distillate was taken in a screw cap test tube, to which, 5 mL of thiobarbituric acid (0.288%) was added, mixed vigorously and kept in a boiling water bath for 45 min and the absorbance of colored fraction was measured at 538 nm against a blank in an UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Jasco V 530, Japan). A blank was setup with 5 mL of distilled water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211415177"><title>Microbiological analysis</title>
<p>Total aerobic bacterial count, total staphylococci, total bacilli, total lactic acid bacteria and anaerobic sulphite reducing bacteria were enumerated following the standard protocols. For the enumeration of bacteria, 25 g samples was homogenized using 225 mL physiological saline (0.85% NaCl) and serial decimal dilutions were carried out with the same diluent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211415177">APHA, 2001</xref>). Appropriate dilutions were spread plated onto plate count agar (PCA) for the enumeration of total bacterial count, deMan Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) lactobacillus agar for the enumeration of total lactic acid bacteria, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211415177">Surendran et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> agar for the enumeration of total bacilli and Baird Parker agar (BP) for the enumeration of total staphylococci. All plates were examined visually for morphological characteristics of typical colony types on each growth medium and recorded as log cfu/g. Differential reinforced clostridial medium (DRCM) for the determination of anaerobic sulphite-reducing clostridia by MPN technique after incubation in a water bath set at 37 °C for 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211415177">Jeyasekaran et al., 2004</xref>). Tubes with black discoloration indicated the presence of anaerobic sulphite-reducing clostridia. Presence/absence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. was also recorded after primary enrichment in lactose broth, secondary enrichment in selenite cystine broth and selective plating on bismuth sulphite agar (BSA). All media and chemicals for microbiological analysis were obtained from Hi-Media, Mumbai, India.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211415177"><title>Sensory analysis</title>
<p>Sensory analysis was performed by the ten member trained taste panel using eight point scale. Samples were monitored on opening the pouches for the changes in the external appearance, odor, texture and taste in a random sequence and assigned a score between 0 and 8, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211415177">Church and Parsons (2000)</xref> for SVCC chicken with slight modification. For each attribute, the acceptable break point score was set at 3.0. The average scores for each attribute were determined from the scores given by the panelists. The overall sensory score was then determined by the summation of the average scores of the total attributes by the number of attributes. Scale employed for evaluating sensory quality of cook chilled fish curry is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211415177">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec16-1082013211415177"><title>Biochemical composition of raw cobia and cook-chilled fish curry</title>
<p>Moisture content of farmed cobia was 82%, which is quite high compared to other food fishes. The protein content was 16.5% and the fat content was very low (∼1%). In the cook-chilled fish curry, the moisture content increased slightly, 83.12% being a liquid product. There was an increase in fat content, 6.14% due to the addition of oil during their preparation. A decrease in the moisture content and an increase in the fat content in cooked fish fillets have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211415177">Garcia-Arias et al., 2003</xref>). The protein content had reduced three folds, 5.05% in the cook-chilled fish curry which could be due to limited quantity of fish steaks in the curry homogenate. The ash content had increased by 1% due to addition of other spice ingredients. An increase in the ash content in the trout cooked by sous vide method has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211415177">Garcia-Linares et al. (2004)</xref> as noticed in this study. Carbohydrates were present at low levels in the fish curry because of the addition of tomatoes and onions during the preparation of curry.</p>

<p>The major fatty acids present in raw cobia were palmitic acid, C16:0 (31%), stearic acid, C18:0 (15.94%), oleic acid, C18:1 (15.80%), and arachidonic acid, C20:4 (10.99%). The C16:0 has been reported as the major fatty acid in marine fish followed by C18:0 by many authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211415177">Bandarra et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415177">Nimish et al., 2010</xref>). In raw cobia also, the major fatty acids were C16:0 and C18:0. The proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) was 55.44%, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) was 19.48% and poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was 19.58% in raw cobia. The major MUFA noticed were C18:1(n − 9 c). High level of C18:1 was reported in marine fish by many workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211415177">Bandarra et al., 1997</xref>). The ω − 3 PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5 (EPA) was 4.45% in raw cobia, while docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6 (DHA) was found in trace amounts. Higher proportions (19%) of ω − 3 fatty acids were reported in fish species of pacific coast by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415177">Nimish et al. (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>In the cook-chilled fish curry, the fatty acid composition was entirely different from that of raw cobia. The major fatty acids were linoleic acid, C18:2 (18.66%), lauric acid, C12:0 (11.53%), palmitic acid, C16:0 (10%), oleic acid, C18:1 (8.77%). The SFA proportion (33%), reduced by half the proportion of raw cobia. Similar loss in SFA was also reported by few authors in fried fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211415177">Candela et al., 1996</xref>). The major SFA’s were C16:0 and C12:0 in cook-chilled fish curry, of which C12:0 was not detected in the raw cobia. There were significant losses (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of C16:0, C17:0 and C18:0. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415177">Nimish et al. (2010)</xref> also observed significant losses in C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 and C22:0 fatty acids in tuna cooked for 30 min and a very slight reduction in MUFA content. The PUFA content increased due to the increase of C18:2 fatty acid in the fish curry and this might have been due to the addition of vegetable oil or other ingredients during the preparation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211415177">Aubourg et al. (1990)</xref> also indicated an increase in C18:2 and C18:3 fatty acids in canned fish. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211415177">Medina et al. (1997)</xref> also observed a high content of PUPA in canned tuna. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211415177">Nimish et al. (2010)</xref> reported that the increase in PUFA content was to a maximum of 69.4% in canned tuna, while it was only 26.47% in cook-chilled cobia fish curry. However, there was a reduction in the ω − 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which was partially due to effect of heat during the cooking process and partially due to replacement of fatty acid from the ingredients as well as cooking oil. The reduction in ω − 3 fatty acids had already been reported in the conventionally heated (at 100 °C for 20 min) seal meat product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211415177">Ghazala et al., 1996</xref>). The ω − 3 to ω − 6 fatty acid ratios of the raw cobia and cobia curry were estimated to be 0.36 and 0.34, respectively. The multiple ingredient addition has totally altered the fatty acid profile causing total unbalance from nutritional point of view, although, ω − 3 to ω − 6 ratios were similar.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1082013211415177"><title>Changes in TBA value</title>
<p>TBA-RS value was used as an indicator to determine the level of oxidative deterioration of foods containing fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211415177">Gray, 1978</xref>).

The TBA-RS value was initially 1.51 µmol malonaldehyde/kg fat, which gradually increased (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) on storage. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211415177">Wang et al.

Similarly, the TBA-RS values did not reach beyond 2.2 µmol malonaldehyde/kg fat in the cook-chilled fish curry during 12 weeks of storage. The changes in the TBA-RS values of fish curry processed by SVCC and HFT processes during storage were not significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) similar to that observed with the pH and the acidity. The fish although previously fried and heated in SVCC or HFT processes, the TBA-RS values seemed to be low due to good storage conditions, absence of oxygen and anti-oxidative effects of some food spices.</p>

<p>The presence of staphylococci on fish is an indication of post harvest contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211415177">Graczyk and Schwab, 2000</xref>).

In yet another study, total staphylococci were detected after 11<sup>th</sup> week of storage in the SVCC processed fish cakes (Shakila et al., 2010), which continued to be present until 16<sup>th</sup> week. Although total staphylococci were detectable in cook-chilled fish curry, they were below 100.</p>
<p><italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> is often referred to as a psychrotrophic organism because many strains are able to grow at mildly abusive refrigeration temperatures with the lower growth temperature of 7 °C. It is also considered as a pathogen of significance in SVCC products which relies on storage temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415177">Rybka et al., 2001</xref>). Temperature close to 4 °C was identified as a controlling factor for <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211415177">Carlin et al., 1999</xref>). In the fish curry processed by SVCC and HFT processes, <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. were totally absent till the end of storage period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211415177">Carlin et al.

<p>Lactic acid bacteria are capable of growing in microaerophilic/anaerobia environments and could be associated with the spoilage of sous vide products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211415177">Carlin et al., 1999</xref>). They survived sous vide processing in a number of products such as spaghetti and meat sauce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211415177">Simpson et al., 1994</xref>), chicken breast meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211415177">Shamsuzzaman et al., 1992</xref>), chicken mousse and chicken chasseur, fish banding and meatballs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211415177">Nyati, 2000</xref>). The decrease in pH might have attributed to the increase in lactic acid bacteria. However, in the fish curry processed by SVCC and HFT processes, no lactic acid bacteria were detected during the storage period. The same was also evidenced in fish cake processed by SVCC process (Shakila et al., 2010). Coincidence to the above findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415177">Rybka et al. (2001)</xref> has also reported that there was no evidence for the survival of lactic acid bacteria in sous vide products. Fish curry being a product with acidic pH did not allow the survival of lactic acid bacteria probably because of the presence of other spicy ingredients, which had retarded their growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1082013211415177"><title>Changes in sensory quality</title>
<p>The changes in the overall sensory scores of SVCC and HFT fish curry held 2 °C are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211415177">Table 3</xref>. The SVCC and HFT fish curry attained the acceptable break point on 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week of storage, respectively. SVCC fish curry failed to retain the original flavor and turned slightly putrid on the day of acceptable break point; while the HFT fish curry showed loss of original color and flavor beyond the acceptable break point and never turned putrid. The SVCC chicken prepared under good manufacturing products are reported to have a shelf-life of 20–30 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1082013211415177">Young et al., 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211415177">Rhodehamel (1992)</xref> reported that <italic>sous vide </italic>processed foods in general can retain their freshness and flavor even after several weeks of refrigerated storage. The <italic>sous vide</italic> packaging technology can give some degree of storage stability and sensory quality because of the pasteurization process and vacuum condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1082013211415177">Werlin, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211415177">Church and Parsons (2000)</xref> stated that vacuum packaging prevents evaporative losses of flavor volatiles and moisture during cooking and inhibits off-flavors from oxidation. The SVCC spaghetti and meat sauce were reported fresh at day 35 as in 0 day by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1082013211415177">Simpson et al. (1994)</xref>. The SVCC fish was a stable product at 3 °C and the limiting factor for its shelf-life was reported to be the pronounced increase in toughness by the 42nd day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415177">Rybka et al., 2001</xref>). The SVCC and HFT processed curry had significantly higher shelf-life of 8–12 weeks at 3 °C, compared to that reported by other authors. The variability in the shelf-life of SVCC products is also due to the differences in the composition and degree of heat treatment during processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211415177">Rybka et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The important consideration in the retention of sensory quality is the inclusion of herbs and spices in meat products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211415177">Rybka, 2000</xref>). In the fish curry processed by SVCC and HFT processes, the shelf-life extension was partially due to cook-chill processes, lower pH and acidity and partially due to the addition of spices and tamarind, which are reported to have additional antimicrobial effects.</p>
<p>It can be therefore be inferred that fish curry processed by HFT process have long shelf-life than that processed by SVCC process. There were not much difference in the biochemical qualities among these products; however, microbiologically significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were noticed in terms of total bacterial count and total staphylococci. For the products processed by SVCC method, microbiological quality coincided well with the sensory changes. Lower acidity and pH of the product also did not support the growth of lactic acid bacteria and other pathogens probably because of the addition of spice ingredients in the fish curry preparation. In terms of nutritional quality, the cook chilled process did not totally destroy the health beneficial fatty acids ω − 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.</p>
