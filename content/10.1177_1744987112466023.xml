<p>The <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> is recognised as an international peer-reviewed journal that explicitly seeks to contribute knowledge to health and social care policy as well as nursing practice. Whilst we recognise the complexity of the research-policy interface, and the need for active collaboration between researchers and policy-makers throughout the research process for research to impact on policy, we welcome papers that demonstrate an explicit connection with both practice and policy, whether the policy connection be at an organisational, national or international level. In addition we purposefully invite contributions from policymakers and policy commentators, usually in the form of guest editorials or overarching commentaries of editions that include commissioned papers. We work behind the scenes to keep policymakers connected with the work of JRN and have introduced podcasts which will increasingly be used as a means of drawing out key messages for policy, practice and further research. To make these connections even more explicit, we have tweaked our contributor guidelines and henceforth will ensure that the ‘key points’, listed at the end of each paper, state explicitly the papers' implications for policy (local, national or international) as well as implications for practice and future research.</p>
<p>In 2012 JRN published six editions in print which included 34 papers with 34 reviews. As well as the six Board Editorials, JRN published a further seven editorials from leaders in their field. We published an additional 20 papers and reviews ‘online first’ (http://jrn.sagepub.com/content/early/recent), the majority of which will be published in print this year. We take this opportunity to thank our 2012 authors, reviewers and guest editors and advise of new developments at JRN as well as introduce this edition.</p>
<p>Each paper published by JRN is double blind peer reviewed and, when a paper is accepted for publication, one of these reviewers is invited to write a review for publication alongside the accepted paper. We publicly thank all of our 2012 reviewers and their employers by listing them on pages 82 to 86 to formally acknowledge their contribution<italic>.</italic></p>
<p>All JRN reviewers are offered 30 days complimentary online access to over 600 journals published by SAGE when they return a review. This includes content from 1999 to the present day for all SAGE titles, including new issues published during the period. In addition to this, reviewers also receive a code which offers a 25% discount on all SAGE books ordered online. If you do not currently review for JRN you can register your interest online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jrn">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jrn</ext-link></p>
<p>JRN welcomed two guest editors last year, Dr Cheryll Adams and Professor Annie Topping, who, in partnership with Editorial Board members, made a significant contribution to the journal through their respective expertise in research and policy in child and family public health, and the impact of science and technology on nursing practice. We are indebted to them both for bringing their expertise to the table and enhancing the contribution and impact of JRN in 2012.</p>
<p>All papers accepted for publication by JRN are published online first. <italic>SAGE Choice</italic> provides an ‘author pays’ open access option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112466023">Finch, 2012</xref>) should authors or their funders require this facility.</p>
<p>The close of 2012 also brings changes to the JRN Editorial Board. Professor Andrée le May joined the editorial team as we increase our output to eight editions per annum (see below), Mary McClarey stepped down from the Board and we wish Mary a healthy and fulfilled retirement. Professor Eloise Carr moved from the Journal Editorial Board to join our panel of International Associate Board members now that she is established at the University of Calgary in Canada. We say goodbye to Professor Linda McGillis Hall, University of Toronto, Canada who stood down as an Associate Board member. We thank Professor McGillis Hall for her tremendous support for JRN, most notably in co-editing and commissioning papers for our most recent focus edition on workforce with Professor Sean Clarke. In addition we extend a very warm welcome to Professor Sek Ying Chair, University of Hong Kong, who we very much look forward to working with.</p>
<p>These changes reflect our commitment to keep our Editorial Boards fresh. New appointments to the Board and Associate Board will be announced soon and calls for new members will be raised in due course. So, how, we hear you say, can you keep connected with JRN developments and opportunities in between print editions?</p>
<p>In 2012 JRN launched a Facebook page and Twitter account enabling the editorial team to communicate with a wide range of people through these social media outlets and raise awareness of JRN content to an increasingly diverse audience. We look forward to our current readers supporting us in these new social media endeavours. We can be found on Twitter: @JRN_latest <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/JRN_latest">https://twitter.com/JRN_latest</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Journal-of-Research-in-Nursing/179644432169468">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Journal-of-Research-in-Nursing/179644432169468</ext-link>. Through Twitter and Facebook we share details of when new print editions are published, ‘hot off the press’ papers and reviews are published online first, links to our email alerts and free access to selected content. We look forward to open dialogue with our readership through social media in due course.</p>
<p>If social media is not for you, subscribing to our email alerts is another way to keep informed with the latest JRN developments. These can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jrn.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts">http://jrn.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts</ext-link></p>
<p>This, the first edition of 2013, heralds the eighteenth volume of <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> (JRN). In response to demand, from this year onwards, JRN will appear in print eight times per annum. As in previous years, three editions will include commissioned papers and all other editions will present unsolicited papers. Wherever possible, editions will be packaged as themed editions with a specific focus and the contribution to the contemporary policy context will be highlighted. This edition, for example, brings together a collection of papers that contribute to our understanding of the nursing workforce and its development. In the first paper, Marsden and colleagues compare the development of advanced practitioners in ophthalmic nursing in New Zealand and in the UK, and compare and contrast the impact of the health policy contexts and regulatory frameworks on the role development and its status within the healthcare system. The paper highlights how the absence of regulation can serve as an enabler of innovation in nursing practice in response to patient need and policy drivers. However, in her review of this paper Needham argues for regulation to assure patient safety and avoid the exploitation of nurses who may appear to be functioning at an advanced level without having received education and training to an appropriate level and without being remunerated fairly for the contribution they make within the healthcare system, as illustrated, for example, in the UK Agenda for Change policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112466023">Department of Health, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second paper, Norrie and colleagues examine the published literature on the evaluation of interdisciplinary (post registration) learning (IPL). Policymakers should note that these researchers conclude that whilst the evidence suggests that IPL increases interdisciplinary knowledge, trust and skills, this evidence is weak, and there is no evidence that IPL improves patient outcomes. Indeed, Barr echoes this finding in his review suggesting that policy promoting IPL may be ideologically driven rather than evidence based. Evidence would indicate that any further investment in IPL should be supported by investment in robust, multi-methods evaluation.</p>
<p>The third paper in this edition highlights the importance of computer literacy in 21st century nursing and acknowledges that this importance was not recognised amongst undergraduate nurses in Jordon at the time this research was undertaken. Akhu-Zaheya et al. identified low levels of computer literacy amongst a convenience sample of undergraduate nursing students and a clear relationship between computer-related anxiety and literacy. The authors recommend local policy initiatives to overcome this skills deficit and the associated anxiety it harbours. In his review Anthony draws parallels with the UK and European experience and on the basis of the exponential growth of computer use and literacy in Europe recommends that this study is repeated in Jordan this year to benchmark progress against the paper’s recommendations.</p>
<p>The development of integrated clinical academic career pathways (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112466023">Department of Health, 2012</xref>) is a policy initiative that seeks to ensure that investment in nursing research capability is sustained and achieves its maximum potential in terms of patient benefit and health gain. In the third paper in this edition, Girot and colleagues argue that educationalists have a key role to play in nurturing and encouraging practitioners to engage in research and pursue a research career. Having built a research culture in academia, Butterworth, in his review, describes nurse educators as the ‘culture carriers’ for the development of clinical academics within the nursing and allied health professions. Girot et al. also acknowledge the role nurse educators play in talent spotting the brightest and the best and encouraging them to experience research first hand. The current wave of research internship opportunities, in England, shows a strong policy commitment to support these endeavours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112466023">Department of Health, 2012</xref>). There is a growing consensus in the UK that the sustainability of investment to build research capacity and capability might most effectively be realised through the establishment of clearly defined clinical–academic career pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112466023">Carrick-Sen, 2012</xref>) that overcome the current contractual challenges in the UK highlighted here by Girot, and by the UK Academy of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting Research: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.researchacademy.co.uk/issues_relating_to_the_employment_of_clinical_academics">http://www.researchacademy.co.uk/issues_relating_to_the_employment_of_clinical_academics</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Commentators in this journal have argued that the success of the drive for robust clinical academic careers in nursing lies, in part, on the achievement of a shared vision between the higher education and service sectors (see, e.g., issue 14:2), and the execution of a strategy, drawn up by both parties that aims to make that vision a reality. In contrast to the enthusiastic contribution nurse educators can bring to this agenda, set out by Girot in this edition, Udod and Care lay bare the challenges and stressors faced by 21st century nurse managers in Canada, exacerbated by competing demands and nurse shortages. What chance has any policy innovation of succeeding in an environment where there is a 30% nurse manager turnover rate, if the nurse manager is seen as pivotal to the implementation of the policy? And more importantly, what impact does this level of turnover have on patient experience and health outcomes?</p>
<p>The solution, it is agued here, lies elsewhere in the system. Udod and Care, in their paper, and Shirey in her review, call for senior leadership action to address the concerns raised. However, executive nurse turnover is also recognised as a significant problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112466023">Duffield et al., 2011</xref>), so should we not collectively seek a more sustainable solution? If the politically driven constant revisionism of health care systems threatens the quality of patient care and the potential of nursing to enhance that quality, is it not time for the collective, global power of nursing to be mobilised and a period of consolidation to be realised?</p>
