<p>For the past decade or so, new research has revived the field of Catholic studies, which had been somewhat out of fashion since the magisterial works published in the 1980s by the likes of John Bossy or Christopher Haigh. Frances Dolan, Arthur Marotti and Alison Shell, to name but three, have produced enlightening studies of the literary productions by and about Catholics, while historians such as Anne Dillon, Eamon Duffy, Peter Lake, Michael Questier and Alexandra Walsham have contributed much to the building of an increasingly nuanced picture of English Catholicism. Whilst many of these studies focus on English Catholics at home, the history of Catholic exiles on the Continent has also been rejuvenated by the recent work undertaken by Caroline Bowden, Nicky Hallett, Claire Walker and Heather Wolfe, and by the AHRC project <italic>Who Were the Nuns? A Prosopographical Study of English Convents in Exile</italic>, which offers an unprecedented insight into the history of early modern English convents. However, since Peter Guilday’s seminal work in 1914, English lay Catholics in exile had received relatively little attention, and Katy Gibbons’s book is a timely correction of this oversight. Derived from her doctoral dissertation, this monograph offers an alternative to the traditionally Anglo-centric view of English Catholicism abroad by including both the English and the French perspectives on the roles played by lay exiles in the Counter Reformation, and it addresses issues relating to the clergy and enclosed orders only when they offer relevant light on the secular context.</p>
<p>The book is a little brief, but well focused and organized in five main chapters, followed by an extensive bibliography and a very useful index. It begins with an examination of the factors which prompted English Catholics to leave their native soil. The author offers a dual perspective, as she evokes the circumstances of English politics, but also the incentives offered by the Parisian context of the time. She argues that Paris offered a distinctive experience of exile (as opposed to the Low Countries), in which refugees were accorded a significant place in local polemics and in League propaganda. Chapter 2 documents how English exiles lived, learned and worshipped in Paris, and how they interacted with their Parisian hosts in a city which, in the 1580s, became the headquarters of international initiatives to undermine, or even overthrow, the Elizabethan regime. The involvement of exiles in the propagation of radical Catholicism, through news, print and polemical activity, is studied further in Chapter 3. Here, Gibbons demonstrates convincingly that exiles were perceived as a dangerous group by the English government, and as key allies by the Parisian League, which was increasingly hostile to Henri III and openly antagonistic to Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 tackles both the concept of exile, and its representations. Catholic publications often pictured a religious exodus prompted by government’s persecution of innocent and loyal subjects, and in one of the most revealing passages of the book, Gibbons shows how, by the late 1580s, exile had come to be construed by some Catholic writers as a form of martyrdom. However, government officials read exile in terms of wilful political agitation, withdrawal of loyalty and treason. On the fascinating yet thorny question of the relationship between Catholicism and loyalty, Gibbons argues that the debate not only fuelled Protestant polemics, but also divided Catholic opinion.</p>
<p>Finally, the fifth chapter examines the influence of the Parisian exiles of the 1580s on the subsequent developments in Catholicism both in England and France. As opinions became increasingly divided on a number of important matters, the tensions which were clearly revealed in polemical works also became perceptible at the more private level of family relations. Gibbons argues that exiles had become somewhat alienated from the reality of the ever-evolving situation in England, whilst conversely, recusants in England often stressed their difference from their exiled co-religionists in an effort to distance themselves from any perceived foreign-led conspiracies. Thus, there appeared to be a growing rift between Catholics at home and their relations abroad.</p>
<p>This book is particularly successful at illustrating the immense diversity of the phenomenon known generically as Catholic exile. Through her mastery of problematic, fragmentary primary sources, Katy Gibbons shows that reasons for leaving were steeped in each person’s individual circumstances and that, once abroad, English Catholics experienced a wide variety of situations which make it impossible to come to any general conclusion or make any blanket statement about their lives in Paris. This diversity represents the book’s main strength: by piecing together the fragmentary evidence gathered from scattered notarial records, reports from ambassadors and personal correspondence, Gibbons manages to paint a rich, nuanced picture of Elizabethan Catholic life.</p>
