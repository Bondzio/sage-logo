<p>Daniel Hood, in <italic>Addiction Treatment</italic>, uses participatory observations, life history interviews, and informal conversations with residents and staff members to compare and contrast two residential drug treatment programs. The author describes their treatment programs—one faith-based and one secular—and takes the reader inside these programs and provides a feel for the culture of each. As an outsider, Hood initially perceived the two programs as different and distinct, but in the course of his ethnographic research he found that the two types are fundamentally similar.</p>
<p>The author contextualizes the book by providing the temperance movement as a backdrop: a social movement aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, resulting ultimately in abstinence through recovery via the acceptance of religious dogma. Treatment programs emerge as a result from this movement and the religion is part of the two programs discussed. The faith-based program aims to change the heart and mind of the addict through exposure to the Gospel message of salvation in Jesus Christ. The goal of the program is to get the addict to heaven, stopping their drug use and other associated sinful activities as a byproduct of the addict’s journey to salvation. The secular program, in contrast, takes behavioral approaches where the goal is to challenge the addict to “act as if” they have recovered. The secular program aimed to change behavior in hopes that hearts and mind will follow, yet it too has religious undertones.</p>
<p>The merits of this book are several. Weber, Durkheim, and Goffman, just to name a few, guide the phenomenology of addiction and recovery. The rich detail gives the reader an insider view of the two drug treatment programs, their structure, their culture, and process to “recovery,” via the life histories and observations of the key players: staff and residents. The author discusses how “recovery” often involves discipline training, awareness training, and an authoritarian structure with a push for moral correction.</p>
<p>Although this book does an excellent job describing the treatment programs in terms of how meaning is constructed by the residence and treatment approach, there is a void in discussion about the disease of addiction when the title, “<italic>Addition Treatment: Comparing Religion and Science in Application</italic>,” suggests that “science” is part of the mix. As a result, this reviewer anticipated a broader literature review with incorporation of, albeit brief, the history of the science of addiction and recovery. Further, it lacks an acknowledgement of current science that has recognized addiction as a medical problem with genetic and biological components which alter the brain. Changes to the brain can affect reward seeking, motivation, and inhibitory control which in turn shapes the observed behaviors, construction of meaning, and recovery.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is unclear if the drug treatment approaches discussed are dynamic and adaptive to advances in treatment science. Have the decision makers of the two programs discussed in the book incorporated a contemporary understanding of addiction? If so, how do these inform treatment approach? How did this impact recovery? How would this impact construction of meaning for the residents? If not, why not? Would the incorporation of state-of-the-art science change the day-to-day operation of the treatment program? If so, how?</p>
<p>In sum, this book is incredibly interesting, useful, and insightful. Access to quality addition treatments remains an important public health concern, and effective treatments require incorporating scientific research and multiple therapies and modalities in approaches. When possible, leveraging the science that informs our understanding of the brain with what is known about health behaviors can perhaps enhance treatment and potential insight to the construction of meaning.</p>
