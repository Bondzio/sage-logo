<p>Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) is characterized pathologically with infiltrates of benign-appearing histiocytes, which are phagocytosing blood cells, in multiple organs including subcutaneous adipose tissues. CHP frequently follows a fatal course when manifesting systemic features of hemophagocytic syndrome including fever, pancytopenia, liver failure and coaulopathy.<sup>1,2</sup> CHP is associated mostly with viral infections or malignant lymphoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476355">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref></sup> and is associated occasionally with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476355">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476355">5</xref></sup> We report a case of SLE with CHP, which was treated successfully with high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A, with a discussion on the prognosis of SLE-associated CHP.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0961203313476355" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 37-year-old Japanese male was admitted following a three-month history of painful subcutaneous indurations spreading on the back and a two-month history of continuous high fever.</p>
<p>At the age of 16, the patient developed fever, arthralgia, facial rashes, and multiple discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) lesions on the face, scalp and arms. He was diagnosed with SLE and was treated successfully with 25 mg/day of prednisolone. He continued to be asymptomatic with prednisolone tapering to 5 mg/day until he developed the present symptoms. He had no recent vaccination history such as influenza vaccine prior to the present symptoms.</p>
<p>On admission, he had fever of 38.4 degrees. On physical examination, bilateral cervical and axillar lymphadenopathies, which were 1 cm in size and soft with tenderness, were noticed. Annular erythemas, which were 15–20 cm in diameter, with painful subcutaneous indurations were observed on the back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313476355">Figure 1</xref>). Significant laboratory findings were slight anemia (hemoglobin 13.3 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (platelet 10.1×10<sup>4</sup>/μl), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST 69 U/l), alanine aminotransferase (ALT 75 U/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 501 U/l), hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride 573 mg/dl) and hyperferritinemia (ferritin 1960 ng/dl). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated slightly to 23 mm/hour. C-reactive protein was not elevated. Coagulation system was normal. Except for a slightly elevated titer of antinuclear antibody of 1:40 (speckled pattern) and an elevated level of anti-single stranded DNA antibodies (81.4 AU/ml), levels of anti-double stranded DNA antibody, anti-Sm antibody, complements and C1q binding immune complex were within normal limits. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor was mildly elevated up to 1110 U/ml. Blood cultures yielded no microbes. Viral infections of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, parvovirus-B19, human immunodeficiency virus and human T-lymphotrophic virus-1 were excluded serologically. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the whole body showed bilateral cervical and axillar lymphadenopathies without hepatosplenomegaly. Densities of the adipose tissues were increased in subcutaneous areas of the bilateral axillar and back, and in retroperitoneum.

</fig></p>
<p>Skin biopsy from the induration on the back was performed. Infiltrates of benign-appearing histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells without cytological atypia were observed in the subcutaneous adipose tissues. Centrilobular fat necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammatory cellular infiltration of vessel walls were also observed. Hyaline necrosis and rimming were not observed. Some histiocytes phagocytosed leukocytes and platelets, and appeared as “bean bag cells” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313476355">Figure 2(a)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313476355">2(c)</xref>). Lymphocytes were composed of CD3+ and CD5+ T cells and CD20+ B cells. T cells were in equal proportion of CD4+ and CD8+. Staining of granzyme B, T cell internal antigen-1 and CD56 were negative. In situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA was negative. Bone marrow biopsy revealed massive infiltration of macrophages with hemophagocytic appearance, and no atypical lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313476355">Figure 2(d)</xref>). From these histological features, malignant lymphoma was denied. He was diagnosed with CHP as a manifestation of relapsed SLE associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).

<p>The dose of prednisolone was increased to 65 mg/day (1 mg/kg/day). He became afebrile the next day. The skin lesions and the abnormal laboratory findings improved in five weeks. Although he continued to be asymptomatic, AST, ALT, LDH and ferritin re-elevated up to 491 U/l, 1184 U/l, 769 U/l and 10,210 ng/ml, respectively, after tapering prednisolone to 35 mg/day. Treatment was intensified with methylprednisolone 500 mg/day pulse therapy and with addition of 200 mg/day of cyclosporine A. This treatment enabled prednisolone re-tapering. The liver enzymes, LDH and ferritin decreased to the normal limits after six months. Although his serum creatinine was mildly elevated from 0.7 mg/dl to 1.1–1.3 mg/dl, cyclosporine A was able to continue for maintenance therapy. Prednisolone was tapered to 8 mg/day without relapse of the disease during the following two years.</p>

<p>CHP has been known to be fatal with an approximately 70% mortality rate even when treated aggressively with immunosuppressants or with cytotoxic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476355">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476355">6</xref></sup> While cyclosporine A administration was reported to be an effective treatment for life-threatening CHP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476355">6</xref></sup> CHP resistant to cyclosporine A is reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476355">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476355">7</xref></sup> Thus, CHP still remains a fatal disorder.</p>
<p>Clinical symptoms and findings indicating a fatal outcome in CHP are fever, systemic symptoms and organ abnormalities, hemophagocytosis in extracutaneous organs, evidence of EBV infection and atypical lymphocytes in the subcutaneous lesions. Benign CHP accompanies mostly no systemic signs or significant laboratory abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476355">8</xref></sup> The present case of SLE with CHP manifested with several factors of poor prognosis including fever, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, hepatic and retroperitoneal abnormalities, and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow. However, intensive immunosuppression with high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A induced remission of SLE and CHP. Additionally, all four previously reported cases of SLE and DLE with CHP accompanying poor prognostic factors were treated successfully with immunosuppressants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476355">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476355">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476355">7</xref></sup> In contrast to cases of malignant lymphoma, EBV infection and unknown causes, CHP can be treated successfully by intensive immunosuppression when it is associated with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476355">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the pathogenesis of CHP is still unclear, it is assumed that cytokines secreted from aberrantly immunoregulated T cells activate macrophages to become cytophagic histiocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476355">6</xref></sup> Controlling the aberrant T cells will be the therapeutic strategy for CHP. Generally, the aberrant T cell immune regulation in SLE can be controlled by immunosuppressive treatment while it is difficult to control in malignant lymphoma and EBV infection. Aberrant T cell responses in malignant lymphoma and EBV infection are both based on genetic abnormalities. Lymphoma cells survive as neoplastic T cells producing cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476355">9</xref></sup> When T cells are infected by EBV, they become activated and escape from apoptosis because of EBV-encoded proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476355">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313476355">11</xref></sup> Thus, extent of macrophage activation might differ in each disease condition. This might account for the fact of SLE with CHP responding to the treatment without a fatal outcome.</p>
<p>To diagnose CHP definitely, skin biopsy is essential. Generally, panniculitis is classified as septal and lobular panniculitis. CHP is a mostly lobular panniculitis including two different processes. One is a malignant lymphoma with clinical appearance of panniculitis, otherwise known as <italic>subcutaneous panniculitic lymphoma</italic>, and the other is a non-lymphoma-associated panniculitis such as SLE-associated CHP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476355">12</xref></sup> The former was histologically denied in the present case. Additionally, lupus panniculitis (LP), which involves the adipose tissues with tender subcutaneous indurations and is a mostly lobular panniculitis, mimics CHP. It is another important differential diagnosis in a patient with SLE. While LP presents lymphocyte dominant infiltrates without hemophagocytic cells, CHP presents hemophagocytic histiocyte infiltration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476355">12</xref></sup> Unlike CHP, LP does not generally require aggressive immunosuppressive treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476355">12</xref></sup> It is important to differentiate the two diseases.</p>
<p>Since the assumed pathogenesis of CHP is similar to that of MAS related to rheumatic diseases, following the treatments for MAS is warranted for CHP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref></sup> Combination of glucocorticoid and cyclosporine A is widely used as the first line therapy for MAS. Cyclosporine A and tacrolimus are clacineurin inhibitors that suppress T cell activation and cytokine production. Actually, multiple cases of life-threatening CHP successfully treated with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus are reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476355">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476355">7</xref></sup> Single cases of CHP controlled with azathioprine, anakinra or cyclophosphamide with intravenous immunogloblins are reported as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476355">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476355">5</xref></sup> These agents could be considered as a salvage therapy for CHP resistant to cyclosporine A or tacrolimus.</p>
<p>Although CHP, which occurs as a skin manifestation of SLE, can be potentially life-threatening, we believe that CHP can be treated successfully with intensive immunosuppression.</p>
