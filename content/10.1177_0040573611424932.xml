<abstract>
<p>This essay maintains that women within the Pentecostal tradition are being socialized to languish rather than flourish. Through an examination of the parallel stories of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Catherine Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, the study explores the “call narrative” of the Pentecostal female minister and the accompanying need for affirmation from the community. The essay explores this narrative within the context of the ecclesial community and its failure to create an environment where women may flourish. This failure on the Church’s part has contributed to its own languishing.</p>

<p><italic>Recently, one of my seminary students set up an appointment with me. Let’s call her Miriam. She had emailed to say that she wanted to talk about her program at the seminary. Miriam attends seminary part-time, is a wife and mother and is pastor of a church of about 70 people. Before being appointed as pastor she served as an evangelist for her denomination in the state of Tennessee. Her father, a long-term pastor, has been very affirming of her ministry. Having the necessary years of experience in ministry and having completed a couple of years of undergraduate work, she was able to be admitted to seminary as a “Special Student,” a category allowed by accrediting agencies for up to 10 percent of any program offered at the master’s level. In a classical Pentecostal denomination, a seminary has no trouble meeting that percentage! In fact, there is often a waiting list of male ministers who’ve not completed an undergraduate degree. We had talked on several occasions and she had taken my “Women in Pentecostalism” seminar. In that class, I had been impressed with her curiosity, her preparedness for class, breadth of knowledge of material even beyond that discussed in class and with her academic work. She had preached in our chapel in the spring semester and had led worship there, even before entering seminary last year. After about 14 hours of coursework, her GPA was around a B+/A−. I had thought of Miriam as a confident young woman. But now the woman sitting before me was quiet, almost timid. She finally asked, “Do you think I can handle this work? I mean, I know I’m here without an undergraduate degree, as a special student. I wouldn’t want there to be any exceptions made for me just because I’m a woman. I’ve prayed, ‘Lord, I don’t want to take scholarship money from someone else if I’m not able to do this work.’”</italic></p>
<p><italic>I was shaken. My first response was to exclaim: “I’ve never had this conversation with a male student in over ten years of teaching here! In fact, some of them come in here with a sense of entitlement!”</italic></p>
<p><italic>My next response was, like the Apostle Paul, to want to ask, “Who has bewitched you?” I inquired as to whether there had been anyone at the seminary who had said anything and yes, a student, had made a remark about things being “dumbed down” for some. But it wasn’t this experience alone that had so affected her. It was clear to me that Miriam was the product, even the victim, of a socialization process that made her feel that, really, in the final analysis, she wasn’t as worthy or as valuable as a minister who was male. Years of not being recognized for her accomplishments in ministry, of not being able to participate in ministerial or official functions because of her gender, of being overlooked for promotions, has deeply affected Miriam and so many others who’ve hit the “stained glass ceiling”—even though they’ve been obedient to the call on their life and worked, most of the time, at least twice as hard!</italic></p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573611424932"><title>Socialized to Languish</title>
<p>In Pentecostal churches and denominations, women ministers are told they will be “hard to place” and are given little or no encouragement. Even in colleges and seminaries they are often officially or unofficially encouraged to go into a “safer zone” such as counseling. Many young women are still discouraged from missions situations because of their status as single women.</p>
<p>After preaching under a heavy or prophetic anointing, unlike their male-counterparts who are lauded and applauded, Pentecostal women preachers are often chastised for not being feminine enough, for trying to act like a man, for being bossy or haughty. Male ministers who have charisma, are decisive and outgoing are called “anointed leaders;” women with the same traits and gifts are rebuked for having a “Jezebel spirit”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424932">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>These subtle and not-so-subtle messages have taken their toll on women but also on the Body of Christ. Some would say it is enough that women are called and empowered by the Spirit, encouraging women just to rely on those assurances. But that assumption betrays a misunderstanding of our humanity and what it means to be created in the image of God: we are made for both communion with God and with each other. It really is not possible to discern one’s vocation outside of community. We need the affirmation of God, but we also need the affirmation of the Body of Christ in order to be whole and in order for the Church to be whole.</p>
<p>A look at the “call narratives” of two women in whom the burden of the Lord was conceived and who received both the empowerment to do so and affirmation from their families and church serves to illustrate this. One is an example from Scripture; the other from more recent history.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424932"><title>Chosen for Significance</title>
<p>In Luke 1:26, 27 we are told that the angel Gabriel is sent by God to a young woman who is engaged to a man named Joseph. Significantly, this young woman is named. Her name is Mary.</p>
<p>History is often written as though there were no women present, much less involved. Part of the reason for this is that much of history is the history of military conflict. Much of church history is also written about wars: ecclesiastical ones. But those Church Councils (from which women were excluded) were not the only formational pieces in church history. We know from more careful readings of that history that women were actively involved in the shaping of Christian thought, not only through their mystical experiences but also through their writing and teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424932">2</xref></sup> Early records of the Pentecostal revival, as well as Pentecostal historiography, often fail to name the women whose preaching and testifying helped to shape the spirituality of the movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424932">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Scripture is careful to show that <italic>this</italic> woman is significant to salvation history and to the carrying of the gospel. In this narrative we see or hear Mary’s call: “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” Mary, like many, is perplexed by this greeting but the messenger of God quickly offers reassurance: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.” And her mission is then outlined: she will conceive the Word of the Lord in her womb as a result of the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit. To reassure her further, the messenger tells her of the once-barren Elizabeth’s conception of John. Mary accepts the call: “Here am I, the servant [minister] of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.”</p>
<p>Mary’s call and affirmation by the Lord is followed by affirmation by her family. Elizabeth, her older cousin, exclaims: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb… And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.” We don’t know how the rest of Mary’s family received her call to carry the gospel, but a cousin who had received a similar call and miracle was able to encourage and nurture the young minister of the Lord.</p>
<p>Even before the delivery of the Word made flesh, Mary erupts in public prophetic praise: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant… He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly” (1:46b–48a, 52).</p>
<p><italic>In 1859, after years of thought and some letter writing on the subject of women’s equality with men, Catherine Mumford Booth heard a call to publicly address the subject. The occasion of this call was the public challenge to Phoebe Palmer’s preaching issued by an Independent minister. These public statements were put in pamphlet form and Catherine heard the call to defend Palmer and other women’s rights to preach the gospel. She published her own pamphlet titled</italic> Female Teaching: or the Rev. A. A. Rees versus Mrs. Palmer, Being a Reply to a Pamphlet by the above Named Gentleman on the Sunderland Revival. <italic>Catherine’s arguments went beyond even Palmer’s, maintaining that Scripture justified the ministry of women and “envisioned women as well as men proclaiming the gospel as a sure sign of the breaking in of God’s kingdom, inaugurated with the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of the Christ.” <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424932">4</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p><italic>Though Catherine taught classes for girls and lectured on the temperance circuit, it would be a few more years before she herself delivered this Word.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Catherine’s earlier correspondence with her mother reveals her uncertainty. She wrote, “I addressed the band of hope on Monday evening and got on far better than I expected. I felt quite at home on the</italic> <bold><italic>Platform</italic></bold>—<italic>far more so than I do in the</italic> <bold><italic>Kitchen</italic></bold><italic>!!” And: “Had I been fortunate enough to have been brought up among the Primitives, I believe I should have been preaching now.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424932">5</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p><italic>In later reflection, Catherine wrote, “I had long had a controversy on this question in my soul. In fact, from the time I was converted, the Spirit of God had constantly been urging me into paths of usefulness and labor, which seemed to me impossible.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424932">6</xref></sup></italic></p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424932"><title>Delivering the Word Conceived</title>
<p>When the Word of the Lord is first conceived in the prophet, often it is met with uncertainty. This is particularly true for women who very often cannot imagine a platform for their ministry as they’ve seen so few models of women as ministers. The Word often comes forth first in the form of a testimony or exhortation to family or friends or even in a defense of others.</p>
<p>Luke tells us in ch. 2 that Mary is “expecting a child” and “the time came for her to deliver her child.” But there was seemingly no place to deliver the Word. Her Word had to be delivered, if even in a seemingly inappropriate and out-of-the-way place.</p>
<p><italic>For Catherine Booth, the time for delivery of the Word of the Lord, already conceived in her, came after several months of this private anxiety and after several months of illness following the birth of her daughter, Emma. Appropriately, on Pentecost Sunday, at the conclusion of her husband’s sermon, Catherine felt compelled to speak. She walked to the front of the chapel at Gateshead where about 1,000 were present. William (her husband) thinking something was wrong stepped down to ask what was the matter. She replied, “I want to say a word.” William told the congregation, “My dear wife wants to say a word” and took his seat. Catherine began to confess her disobedience at not obeying the call of God before and vowed, “I have come to tell you this, and to promise the Lord that I will be obedient to the heavenly vision.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>That night, Catherine preached her first sermon, “Be Filled with the Spirit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424932">7</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p>Like Mary, for Catherine Booth there was nothing to do but deliver the Word given her! Her time had come! The Spirit had overshadowed her, placed the Word in her and that Word had to be delivered.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424932"><title>Affirmed for Flourishing</title>
<p>For Mary there is more affirmation, this time from outsiders to her own community: shepherds in the field who told her of their angelic visitation. Mary, wisely, kept these words in her heart and treasured them, pondered them.</p>
<p><italic>Immediately following her first sermon, Catherine began a preaching ministry that lasted for the next three decades, until her death in 1890. A year following the first sermon she wrote, “I am just in my element in the work. I only regret that I did not commence</italic> <italic>years ago</italic>.<italic>”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424932">8</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p>Ken Robinson, in his best-seller, <italic>The Element</italic>: <italic>How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</italic>, defines “the Element” as “the meeting point between natural aptitude and personal passion.” He writes that those who are in their Element “find that time passes differently and that they are more alive, more centered, and more vibrant than at any other times.” “When people are in their Element,” Robinson says, “they connect with something fundamental to their sense of identity, purpose, and well-being. Being there provides a sense of self-revelation, of defining who they really are and what they’re really meant to be doing with their lives.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424932">9</xref></sup> How much more is this need for a sense of purpose and fulfillment met when one is able to fulfill the passion given by the Spirit of God?</p>
<p>Recent scholarship by Linda M. Wagener and Richard Beaton, of the Max De Pree Center for Leadership, has studied the concept of human flourishing from the perspective of Christian theology. Their work has concluded that humans flourish “when they routinely experience optimism, hope, and gratitude, and when they make a positive impact on others through their work and legacy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424932">10</xref></sup> In the words of Irenaeus, “The glory of God is a human being fully alive.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424932">11</xref></sup> Meaning and purpose are derived from “the awareness that the individual life is part of a larger story…we are connected to humanity and creation in fundamental ways.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424932">12</xref></sup> They go on and describe the conditions necessary for individuals to flourish: “People flourish when they have the opportunity to engage in meaningful work, have the freedom to express themselves, can engage in personal growth, have healthy reciprocal relationships, and can contribute to the well-being of others.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424932">13</xref></sup> Women, in particular, who often find themselves in a kind of role conflict because of the expectations of society and even the Church, often fail to flourish and find themselves, instead, in a state of languishment: lacking positive emotion, feeling empty or hollow, lacking confidence and hope. This state, though not considered mental illness, is considered “the absence of mental health.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424932">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573611424932"><title>Exalted for a Larger Destiny</title>
<p>As stated earlier, it is not enough for women to know that they are called and empowered by the Spirit. In order to flourish, women must find meaning and purpose and must feel that they are part of a larger story. For fulfillment, they must have the kind of affirmation that Catherine received in the Church, first by her pastor-husband, William, and then by the larger Christian community throughout England, and even by Phoebe Palmer.</p>
<p>For Mary, this came when she, with Joseph, took the child to the temple for their purification. Here, in the house of the Lord, a devout and forward-looking elder named Simeon, under the anointing of the Spirit, confirmed for both Mary and Joseph prophetic words each had received before Jesus’ birth. He spoke directly to Mary, affirming her and preparing her for the difficulty ahead. And the affirmation didn’t stop: Anna, a prophet, who “never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day,” also prophesied and preached about the child to all those in the Temple who were looking for redemption.</p>
<p>Women who minister to and for the Lord vitally need affirming words and deeds from the Church, from its elders, both male and female. For Catherine Booth, this affirmation came through William, other ministers and congregations who called upon her, and through her spiritual elder, Phoebe Palmer. For Mary, it came through Simeon and Anna.</p>
<p>But for women like Miriam, the woman pastor and seminary student, though the affirmation has come from family and certainly from the Lord, there is still a need for affirmation from the Church. Leaders in the Church are accountable to God for the well-being of those in their care. If women in their care are languishing (the absence of mental health), then church leaders must find ways to reverse this state of entropy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424932">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the experience of women in the ecclesiastical world too often resembles that of women in the corporate world or in academe. They have no one to advocate for them, to “pull them up” into positions of leadership. A report in the <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> in September 2010 made the case for the corporate arena with an article titled “Why Men Still Get More Promotions Than Women.” The authors (Herminia Ibarra, Nancy M. Carter, and Christine Silva) based their report on the findings of the Catalyst (2008) global survey of women in corporate leadership. Succinctly, they state, “Although women are mentored, they’re not being promoted. A Catalyst study of more than 4000 high potentials shows that more women than men have mentors—yet women are <italic>less</italic> likely to advance in their careers. That’s because they’re not actively sponsored the way the men are.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424932">16</xref></sup> Sponsors, as opposed to mentors, must be persons of influence at the senior level; they must expose their protégés to others with influence; they must ensure that those they sponsor are “considered for promising opportunities and challenging assignments”; the sponsor must “fight” or advocate for the protégé’s promotion; and, importantly, they must serve to “protect” the protégé from harmful contact with those at the top or from “negative publicity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424932">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>How might such sponsorship work in the ecclesiastical setting? Clearly, denominational leaders or ministers of influence must intentionally sponsor those women who show promise and have potential as a result of the gifting of the Holy Spirit evident in their lives. Because the majority of these leaders and influential ministers are male, they must take risks. These risks involve going against the <italic>status quo</italic> and advocating for changes in polity and practice; this is likely to put them at odds with their friends and colleagues. Beyond this, they must promote gifted women, placing them in positions of influence and in leadership of churches with real potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424932">18</xref></sup> What will be required of these sponsors is boldness to speak and act.</p>
<p>What may first be required, however, is an assessment of the hermeneutic utilized by Pentecostals. This hermeneutic, to be true to its Pentecostal orientation, must include a preference for narrative and must be historically and contextually shaped. It cannot be bound by literalistic, doctrinaire, and fundamentalist presuppositions. Second, what is required is anthropology that takes seriously the issues of gender equality and the attending views of sexuality. Finally, the issues of egalitarianism, diversity, and gender equality must be seen as <italic>primary</italic> and not as non-essentials. For Pentecostals, heirs of the Wesleyan tradition, the essential link between Holiness and human rights, including gender equality, must be placed at the center of what it means to identify as a Pentecostal. Those wearing the “full gospel” badge must be true to their identity as those who believe the fullness of the Spirit has as its goal a restoration of the <italic>imago Dei</italic>, a restoration that includes healing of all that was damaged in the Fall.</p>
<p>Without women in positions of leadership, fulfilling the Spirit’s call and their vocation, younger women have no models of how they can fulfill their own call. It is vital that young women can imagine themselves in the role of minister and leader. Without such an image, there is an ever-present sense of a lack of self. Like Miriam, women second guess their abilities and their own identity when there are no models who look like them. While male mentors or sponsors may inspire or even empower, full ownership of their call and vocation is not realized without female role models to whom they may look in order to see themselves and their future.</p>
<p>For the Pentecostal Church (and global movement) to be whole and to flourish, both women and men must fulfill their Spirit-empowered vocations. The Church can only be all that she is called to be and can only accomplish all she is called to do, when all the members are “joined and held together by every supporting ligament,” growing and building “itself up in love, as each part does its work” (Eph 4:16). Together we rise “to become a holy temple” (Eph 2:21).</p>
<p>Our mission and task is formidable: to <italic>be</italic> a witness, to show the world, through our love one for another, that Jesus is the Son of God. This destiny, this high calling, of both the church and the individual, of both men and women, is achieved when <italic>all</italic> those on whom the Spirit is poured out find purpose and meaning and voice.</p>
<p>Mary, who had pondered all that she’d been called to and all that had been prophesied to her, found that purpose and affirmation. Confidently, she tells the servants at the wedding, “Whatever he tells you to do, do it!” (John 2:5). Her destiny took her through the pain of the cross but also to the joy of the Upper Room.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040573611424932"><title>My Testimony</title>
<p>In my own journey, I’ve often struggled to find the affirmation I needed; while I’ve had the affirmation of my family and colleagues, in my own church it has not been an easy road. But I have found acknowledgement outside of my tradition, especially in the world of Academia. It is my own experience that when I don’t feel affirmed, I find myself in a state of languishment. In those times, I know that I must make decisions that will put me in a position to better fulfill my call, places where I can make lasting contributions in an affirming community. This is being true to who God has created me to be and to who he has called me to be.</p>
<p>A plaque on my wall, with a quote by Catherine Booth, has often spurred me on when I feel the approach of that lack of mental health that comes with no affirmation. Catherine Booth, fulfilled and affirmed, passed along this charge to her children: <italic>“We are made for ends larger than earth can compass. O let us be true to our exalted destiny!”</italic></p></sec>
