<p>This volume is an anthology of excerpts from books on the theory of war written by Europeans between the mid sixteenth and the early nineteenth centuries. The use of the term ‘strategy makers’ for those who wrote about strategy in theoretical terms, as opposed to those who formulated actual strategy, follows the convention established in 1941 by Edward Mead Earle’s <italic>Makers of Modern Strategy</italic> and continued by Peter Paret’s updated volume of 1986 with the same title. The sub-title, however, is misleading, for the anthologized authors do not include Machiavelli or Clausewitz.</p>
<p>What Heuser does provide are between nine- and 20-page excerpts from the works of Barond de Fourquevau (<italic>Instructions on the Conduct of Wars</italic>, 1548), Bertrand de Loque (<italic>Discourse of War and Single Combat</italic>, 1589), Matthew Sutcliffe (<italic>The Practice, Proceedings and Laws of Arms</italic>, 1593), Don Bernadino de Mendoza (<italic>Theory and Practice of War</italic>, 1595), Paul Hay du Chastelet (<italic>Treatise on War</italic>, 1668), Santa Cruz de Marcenado/Friedrich Wilhelm von Zanthier (<italic>Military Reflections</italic>, 1724–30/1775), Count de Guibert (<italic>General Essay on Tactics</italic>, 1772/<italic>On the Public Force</italic>, 1790), and August Rühle (<italic>On War</italic>, 1816). Apart from Guibert, whose writing was significant enough to earn consideration in both editions of <italic>The Makers of Modern Strategy</italic>, and Rühle, who attracted some attention from Paret in his <italic>Clausewitz and the State</italic> (1976, new edition 2007), most of the subjects (six out of eight) are generally unfamiliar if not unknown (readers of Garrett Mattingly’s classic <italic>Armada</italic> will recognize de Mendoza the diplomat, though not his identity as a theorist of war). Each chapter of historical texts is preceded by a biographical introduction. The first chapter is a general introduction entitled ‘Themes and Context of Literature on Strategy’ covering the following topics: ‘Strategy before the Word’, ‘Genres of Writing on War and Strategy’, ‘The Changing Lead Culture on Military Matters’, ‘Modern Time Frame, Antique Points of Reference’, ‘The Historical Context ca. 1500–1815’, and ‘Themes in the Literature’ (1–31).</p>
<p>The purposes of this anthology, according to Heuser, are threefold. First, the excerpts were ‘selected primarily because of their enduring relevance’ (ix). Second, the selected texts were chosen to provide instruction ‘about the strategic thinking of the period, that is, for what political purposes and with what aims the authors thought war could and should be waged’ (ix). And third, the emphasis on non-English language texts was intended to introduce English-speaking readers to works that would otherwise be inaccessible, an objective that also justified exclusion of Machiavelli, Clausewitz, and others whose writing is easily available in translation (ix–x). It should be noted, however, that published English language texts served as the basis of the chapters on the writings of de Loque, de Mendoza, and Guibert, while Sutcliffe of course wrote in English, albeit in an archaic form.</p>
<p>As Heuser explains in her general introduction, the chosen authors constitute a small sample of the many writers on warfare in the period covered, with such important figures as Montecuccoli and de Saxe excluded presumably because like Machiavelli and Clausewitz their work is readily available in translation. Moreover, the abridgment of the selected texts is severe, a total of some 1500 pages having been reduced to 130. The material presented by this book thus cannot claim to be representative of the literature on war from the mid-sixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries, and leaves out nine-tenths of the text of those works it does present.</p>
<p>The selections do constitute a venue for exploring early modern and pre-industrial modern thinking about significant problems in major armed conflict, which include the nature of war practice, the causes of war, war justification, the purpose of war, war outcomes, occupation, insurgency, strategy, war economics, coalition warfare, naval war and army format. Much of what is presented, however, is concerned with conditions that are no longer in play, put forward little more than generalized observation, and state commonplace propositions. These criticisms are less applicable to the excerpted writings of Guibert and Rühle, which contain theoretically original and important material that influenced aspects of Clausewitz’s thinking, and for these and other reasons are worthy of attention. That said, Heuser engages in extravagant speculation about the possible effect of Rühle’s ideas had they been more widely known (20), and her evaluation of Rühle as an equal of Clausewitz exaggerates the magnitude of his theoretical achievement (174). <italic>The Strategy Makers</italic> usefully extends familiarity with the texts of six obscure and two better-known authors, whose works are otherwise inaccessible, and thus provides theoretical perspectives of the distant past on pre-industrial European war. However, this volume contributes relatively little to the serious consideration of the strategic problems of the present.</p>
