<abstract>
<p>The actuation behavior of soft silicone-based magnetorheological elastomers in magnetic fields of variable strength was investigated. An inhomogeneous magnetic field gives rise to a reversible actuation effect, which is the result of the competition between magnetic and elastic forces in the material. Magnetorheological elastomers are capable of performing more pronounced deformations than known rigid actuator materials. In this article, the actuation behavior of magnetorheological elastomer ring-shaped bodies in a valve-type device for the control of an air flow is demonstrated. For this purpose, magnetorheological elastomer rings with different Shore hardness were prepared and used in the valve. In addition to the common isotropic magnetorheological elastomer samples, rings with an anisotropic arrangement of the magnetic particles were also prepared. The actuation of these anisotropic magnetorheological elastomers was compared with that of the isotropic samples. Based on simulations, the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the magnetorheological elastomer material which is required for the actuation could be strongly affected by the shape in the design of the magnetic yoke. In this study, the closing characteristics of the valve with different yoke shapes and magnetorheological elastomer materials were evaluated by measuring the dependence of the air flow rate on the magnetic field strength. It is demonstrated that the air flow through the valve can be controlled by the current in the field-generating coil, which yields the base for a new type of magnetic valve.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) represent a relatively new class of magnetically controllable materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X11433498">Jolly et al., 1996</xref>). They are composites of magnetic particles that are embedded in an elastomeric matrix. By applying a magnetic field, the material can strongly and reversibly change its mechanical properties such as the Young’s and the shear moduli. This magnetorheological effect is reversible and occurs within milliseconds, in analogy to the behavior of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). The magnetic control of the mechanical properties of MREs has attracted increasing attention in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X11433498">Böse and Röder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X11433498">Lokander and Stenberg, 2003</xref>). This interest is stimulated by a multitude of potential applications in various technological branches, like adaptive vibration damping, tunable vibration absorption, and haptics. A review on materials and applications of MREs is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X11433498">Li and Zhang (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>However, only very few studies have been devoted to the actuation capabilities of MREs up till now. Von Lockette et al. used MRE samples as a tunable vibration absorber (TVA) and investigated the change of the shear stiffness in a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X11433498">Von Lockette et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, this is not a real actuator generating the motion of a body, because the use of the MRE concerns the change of a passive property of the material. Zhou and Wang described an actuator containing a piezoelectric layer bonded cantilever, whose free end is attached by a MRE layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X11433498">Zhou and Wang, 2005</xref>). In this case, the MRE also does not generate an active motion. In a patent application, a MRE actuator for the control of a fluid flow is described, but experimental studies do not seem to have been performed and no results of its performance are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X11433498">Heier and Schubert, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>If the elastomer matrix of the composite is sufficiently soft and the applied magnetic field is strong enough and inhomogeneous, the MRE material shows a pronounced actuation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X11433498">Böse, 2007</xref>). In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the material is deformed or stretched and changes its shape or geometrical dimensions. When the magnetic field is removed, the MRE relaxes to its original shape, behaving as a magnetically driven shape-memory polymer.</p>
<p>The degree of actuation depends on the relative strengths of the magnetic forces acting on the particles in the magnetic field and the elastic polymer forces. On one hand, the magnetic forces displace the particles from their original positions, which leads to an elongation of the MRE. On the other hand, the elastic forces of the elastomer network try to restore the particles to their original positions. MRE composites which reveal such an actuation effect could also be called magnetoactive polymers (MAPs), in analogy to the known electroactive polymers (EAPs) which actuate in electric fields.</p>
<p>Soft MRE actuators are capable of performing more sophisticated motions in a magnetic field than it is possible with rigid bodies. In comparison with a voice coil, in which a magnetic body moves with respect to the coil, driven by a magnetic force, a MRE body can even be deformed two-dimensionally in the field. In contrast to hard actuator materials, the expansion of MREs is very strong. It was demonstrated before that deformations of approximately 10% can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X11433498">Böse, 2007</xref>). This magnetomechanical effect could be exploited in a magnetic valve for the control of gas flows. The basic function of a MRE valve was recently shown with a laboratory device containing a MRE ring in the space between two concentric yoke parts of the magnetic circuit leaving an inner air gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X11433498">Böse et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11433498">Figure 1</xref> depicts this laboratory device and the closing of the air gap by the magnetic field.</p>

<p>In this article, a more detailed study of the performance of MRE materials in a model valve was conducted. For this purpose, an experimental setup for a MAP valve with a magnetic circuit having a variable yoke shape was used. The magnetic circuit was modularly designed and simulated. Furthermore, MRE rings with different hardness as well as isotropic and anisotropic particle arrangements were manufactured and investigated in the experimental setup. The objective of this basic study was to evaluate the actuation performance of MRE materials in the valve and to investigate the influence of various materials and technical parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1045389X11433498" sec-type="materials">
<title>MRE materials</title>
<p>The MREs used as actuator materials in the valve consisted of carbonyl iron particles with a mean size of about 5 μm dispersed in a silicone elastomer matrix. The concentration of the iron particles in polydimethylsiloxane was 30 vol.%. All MRE composite samples were manufactured in a ring-shaped molding tool by a thermal Pt-catalyzed curing process, in which the vinyl end groups of the silicone polymer react with the silane groups of the corresponding crosslinker.</p>
<p>The mechanical hardness of the silicone elastomer can be controlled by the crosslinking density. This crosslinking density was systematically varied in order to study the influence of the MAP hardness on the characteristics of the valve. As a result, MRE actuator rings with hardness values between 55 and 70 on the soft Shore 000 scale were prepared for the investigations in the valve. A second series of MRE samples was prepared by curing them in the presence of a magnetic field. For this purpose, a special mold with an integrated electromagnet was constructed which allows the application of a radially oriented magnetic field during the curing process. With this mold, anisotropic ring-shaped MRE samples could be prepared, the anisotropy resulting from iron particles arranged in radially oriented chains.</p>

<sec id="section3-1045389X11433498">
<title>Design of the MRE valve</title>
<p>The design of the experimental setup of the valve with the magnetic circuit and the MRE ring is revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11433498">Figure 2</xref>. In the magnetic field, the ring-shaped MRE body expands radially and closes the gap around the ring. This expansion blocks the air flow through the gap. Moreover, if the expansion of the ring can be controlled to intermediate positions, the MRE may also be used as a proportional valve.</p>

</fig>
<p>The force on the magnetic particles in the MRE composite is determined by the gradient of the magnetic field strength in the gap. Therefore, the outer yoke around the MRE ring was made exchangeable between different surface shapes in order to modify the magnetic field distribution in the gap. The field distribution was calculated using finite element method (FEM) simulations. In the first configuration of the circuit, the yoke parts on both sides of the gap containing the MRE ring were designed as magnetic steel rings with flat surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11433498">Figure 3</xref>, top). The other configuration had an outer yoke ring with a sharp edge at its inner surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11433498">Figure 3</xref>, bottom). The radial distance between the yoke parts is 10 mm. The inner part of 9 mm is occupied by the MRE ring and the remaining 1 mm forms the air gap of the open valve (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11433498">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The different shapes of the yoke have a tremendous influence on the magnetic field distribution. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11433498">Figure 4</xref>, the quantitative results of the simulation of the magnetic field strength along the radial line between the inner and outer yoke pieces in both configurations at three coil currents (1, 5, and 10 A) are depicted. It is clearly visible that the field strength continuously decreases along the line from the inner yoke to the outer end of the MAP ring at 9 mm. Outside of the MAP ring, an abrupt rise of the field strength due to the different magnetic permeabilities of the MAP material and air occurs in both configurations. However, the magnetic field strength in the air gap in both configurations is strongly different. It slightly decreases in case of the flat outer yoke, but strongly increases with the edged yoke. The sharp edge on the outer yoke provides a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field in the air gap and a more than doubled field strength.</p>

<p>Detailed experiments were performed to study the performance of the various MRE materials in the valve. Starting in the opened state, the current in the coil was increased stepwise and the air flow rate was measured in order to evaluate the closing characteristics of the MRE valve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1045389X11433498" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>At first, the air flow characteristics of the valve were evaluated with MRE rings of different Shore 000 hardness. Initially, the air flow through the open valve was tuned to a defined value of 0.36 m<sup>3</sup>/h and then the coil current was increased stepwise. With increasing current, the air flow decreases continuously due to the reduction of the opening width of the valve. The measurement was finished when the air flow was below the detection limit of the used flow meter.</p>
<p>The measurements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X11433498">Figure 6</xref> were performed with the flat outer yoke in the circuit. The increase of the Shore 000 hardness from 55 to 70 tentatively shifts the required current to higher values. However, the softest MRE material with a Shore 000 hardness of 55 is relatively sensitive, but can be more easily deformed by the air pressure and does not completely close the valve.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the next step, the actuation characteristics of MRE samples with isotropic and anisotropic particle arrangements were compared with each other. It becomes apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X11433498">Figure 7</xref> that the anisotropic MRE ring causes a steeper closing characteristic than the isotropic ring. From this behavior, it is concluded that the isotropic MRE material having the same hardness without an applied magnetic field gives a wider range of control by the coil current.</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X11433498">Figure 8</xref>, a remarkable difference between the data for the valve with the flat and with the edged outer yoke shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11433498">Figure 3</xref> is apparent. The air flow reduction with the edged outer yoke exhibits a steep characteristic, that is, the valve closes within a relatively narrow range of the coil current. In contrast to this behavior, the use of the flat outer yoke leads to a more gradual air flow decrease, when the coil current is increased. The gradual decrease of the air flow is more suitable for a precise tuning of the valve. The flat and edged yoke shapes represent only extreme configurations, and many intermediate or other yoke shapes are possible to tune the closing characteristics of the valve.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, the characteristics of subsequent closing and opening of the MRE valve was investigated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X11433498">Figure 9</xref> shows the behavior of the valve during two cycles, in which the coil current is increased and decreased twice. In this operation, a pronounced hysteresis was observed, which has to be controlled in real applications. The hysteresis is attributed to the plasticity of the MRE material in the magnetic field. Except at the start of the first cycle, the repeatability of the flow rate is quite high.</p>

</fig>
<p>Additional investigations concerning the air pressure, which the valve can withstand in the closed state, were carried out with isotropic MRE rings. For this purpose, the applied pressure was increased stepwise at a constant coil current of 8 A up to the maximum pressure before breakthrough occurs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X11433498">Figure 10</xref> depicts the results of these measurements on the valve with the edged outer yoke in terms of the maximum pressure versus the coil current. The maximum hold pressure increases up to 0.8 bar. This limit is nearly independent from the hardness of the MRE material, except for Shore 55. In contrast, with the use of the flat outer yoke, much higher hold pressures were achieved (not shown). In these measurements, the pressure increase was stopped at 1.5 bar in order to avoid any damage to the MRE rings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The actuation performance of soft MRE materials prepared with variable properties was investigated. For this purpose, an experimental setup for an annular valve was used. The measurements on this MRE valve show that it can be closed by the magnetic field which forces the MRE material to expand. Furthermore, the air flow through the valve can be controlled by the coil current of the electromagnet.</p>
<p>The results of this study give evidence that the characteristics of the MRE valve can be influenced by both material and technical parameters. The valve performance depends on the composition and properties of the MRE material, that is, the hardness of the elastomer matrix of the composite. The hardness can be tuned by the crosslinking density and the use of plasticizers. Another influence on the valve performance is given by the shape of the yoke pieces between which the MRE material expands, because it determines the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>In conclusion, MREs as a novel class of actuator materials offer a huge potential for new valves, in which more sophisticated motions are able to control the flow of the medium. The described results give first evidence on the behavior of the MRE valve, but more detailed studies and optimization steps are necessary in order to fully exploit the benefit of this new valve technology.</p>
