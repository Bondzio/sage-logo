<abstract>
<p>In an online survey study (<italic>n</italic> = 275), several demographic and personality variables were used to predict scores on the Rudeness Scale, a new measure of the propensity to verbally abuse strangers. The results of multiple regression analyses revealed a number of significant main effects. These effects revealed that the people in the authors’ sample who reported the greatest propensity to verbally abuse strangers were Hispanic/Latino or Black individuals who scored low in adherence to the standards of conventional morality but high in ego defensiveness (unwillingness to accept criticism or correction from others) and affect intensity for anger and frustration. The authors’ interpretation of the findings combines insights derived from Swann’s self-verification theory, contrasting views of ego defensiveness, and Larsen et al.’s work on affect intensity with a dispositional view of verbal rudeness that emphasizes its use as a weapon in interpersonal struggles for power, status, and “face.”</p>

<p>Rudeness is a disturbing fact of human life―a fact to which virtually no one is immune. Even Prince Charles and Camilla were the targets of rude behavior when a group of student protesters, angry at a proposed tuition increase, attacked the royal couple’s car “with sticks, fists and bottles and chanted ‘Off with their heads’ before the vehicle pushed its way through the crowd and drove off” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X11425036">Lawless, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, such acts of intentional and targeted rudeness appear to be relatively infrequent. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith, Phillips, and King’s (2010)</xref> study of more than 500 rudeness incidents reported by an equally large sample of Australian respondents, most incidents of rudeness are the accidental consequence of a large flow of people trying to pass through the same area at the same time, whether in cars or on foot. For example, “People who pushed in front of me” made up fully 25% of all reported events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al., 2010</xref>, p. 24), and related categories such as “blocked my way,” “bumped into me,” “invaded my personal space,” “swerved in front of me,” and so on, collectively accounted for another 36%―for a total of 61% altogether (p. 25). In general, these events “did not seem to be deliberate, but rather to result from crowding, insensitivity and mixed trajectories and speeds” (p. 196).</p>
<p>In contrast, acts of verbal rudeness, though much less frequent by comparison, are typically both intentional and personally directed. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> study, four categories of verbal rudeness accounted for a total of 20% of all events reported: <italic>swearing</italic> (11.3%), <italic>screaming, screeching, or shouting</italic> (5.6%), <italic>prejudicial comments</italic> (2.2%), and <italic>sexual remarks</italic> (0.9%). It is the more intentional and personally directed act of verbal rudeness, also known as verbal abuse, that is the topic of the present article.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0261927X11425036">
<title>How Serious a Problem Is Verbal Rudeness?</title>
<p>The data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al. (2010)</xref> suggest that people who are the targets of another person’s verbal abuse often feel angry and disgusted, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the encounter. In nearly all cases, however, these feelings quickly fade.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Interactions with the rude stranger tended to be brief. Efforts to remonstrate . . . were uncommon. Very few events escalated into ongoing conflicts. For the most part people just wanted to leave the situation or to let it drop. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al., 2010</xref>, p. 197)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, if the rude stranger represents a specific company or place of business, one’s negative reactions to that person might also translate into a decision to stop doing business with the establishment in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X11425036">Johnson &amp; Indvik, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X11425036">2001b</xref>). This decision, when made by an increasingly large number of customers, can have a pronounced impact on the company’s or vendor’s bottom line. And if verbal abuse becomes a regular occurrence in established work relationships, such as those between managers and employees, male and female coworkers, and so on, it can eventually lead to more serious acts, such as open conflict, workplace violence, and sexual harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X11425036">Johnson &amp; Indvik, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X11425036">2001b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261927X11425036">1</xref></sup> Similarly, recurring acts of verbal abuse in the context of personal relationships have the potential to destroy a child’s self-esteem, poison a friendship, and wreck a marriage.</p>

<title>How Can We Account for Acts of Verbal Rudeness?</title>
<sec id="section4-0261927X11425036">
<title>Verbal rudeness as accidental</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al. (2010)</xref> have argued that most acts of physical rudeness (pushing, bumping, blocking, etc.) are both accidental and situational, being the unintended consequence of “crowding, insensitivity and mixed trajectories and speeds” (p. 196). At least some incidents of (perceived) verbal rudeness are accidental as well. These would be described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425036">Goffman (1974)</xref> as <italic>incidental misframings</italic>―cases in which one person is offended by a second person’s apparently rude (but, in regard to the first person, not intentionally rude) choice of words. For example, many international students are offended when they are referred to by Americans as “Orientals,” a term they regard as both pejorative and rude. This so-called offense is often accidental and unintended, however, because many American speakers simply do not know that the term <italic>Orientals</italic> has this negative connotation and that they should use the term <italic>Asians</italic> instead. A different type of incidental misframing occurs when an individual takes personally an insult that was intended for someone else. For example, when a person in a passing car shouts “Hey, asshole!” one should take the time to rule out other potential targets of this epithet before concluding that it was directed at oneself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261927X11425036">
<title>Verbal rudeness as dispositional</title>
<p>As we have noted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> data suggest that most cases of verbal rudeness are <italic>not</italic> accidental; they are intentional and personally directed instead. Many of these intentional instances of verbal abuse probably have more to do with the perpetrator than with the victim. The prototypic example is provided by people who routinely use verbal abuse as a way to bully and intimidate others. For individuals in this category, the propensity to bully others has acquired the status of an enduring disposition. Verbal bullying may either be their preferred mode of expressing this disposition or it may serve to augment the physical bullying that these individuals often perpetrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425036">Lowenstein, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425036">1994</xref>). In either case, the verbal bully may require little or no provocation. Even innocent bystanders may be the target of the verbal bully’s attacks, particularly if they are negatively stigmatized (e.g., as gay, obese, clumsy, learning-disabled, or having minority group status) and if they appear to be weak, easily intimidated, and unlikely to retaliate (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X11425036">Fox &amp; Farrow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261927X11425036">Swearer, Turner, Givens, &amp; Pollack, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261927X11425036">Tharinger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261927X11425036">Warwick, Aggleton, &amp; Douglas, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The issue of provocation is a tricky one, however, because the perception of provocation as a justified “cause” of verbal bullying exists primarily in the mind of the perpetrator. Inveterate bullies appear to be biased to perceive provocation even in situations in which other people do not. Indeed, a “thin-skinned” hypersensitivity to perceived slights, criticisms, challenges, and provocations has been observed both in child bullies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X11425036">Dodge &amp; Coie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261927X11425036">Schwartz &amp; Dodge, 1998</xref>) and in maritally aggressive/abusive husbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261927X11425036">Robillard &amp; Noller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261927X11425036">Schweinle &amp; Ickes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261927X11425036">Schweinle, Ickes, &amp; Bernstein, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0261927X11425036">
<title>Verbal rudeness as a weapon in interpersonal struggles for power and “face.”</title>
<p>Since the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425036">Brown and Levinson’s (1987)</xref> theory of politeness/impoliteness in language use, it has been increasingly recognized (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425036">Bousfield &amp; Locher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425036">Limberg, 2009</xref>) that verbal rudeness, when used intentionally and strategically, can be a powerful weapon in interpersonal struggles for power, status, and “face.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261927X11425036">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of particular interest to us are cases in which Person A challenges, and thereby threatens, the “face”―and, implicitly, the status and power―of Person B (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425036">Limberg, 2009</xref>). This act in itself is inherently rude, or at least impolite, in that its goal is to criticize, correct, or otherwise humble Person B by pressuring Person B to yield ground, to apologize, to stand corrected, to acknowledge fault or weakness, and so on. If Person B succumbs to this pressure, Person A stands to achieve a status gain (get “one-up”), whereas Person B stands to experience a status loss (get “one-down”). However, because this act may well be perceived by Person B as an attack on B’s power, status, and “face,” Person A may be careful to reserve this act only for occasions in which B can be “justifiably” criticized because B’s current behavior fails to meet a conventional standard of correct or appropriate behavior.</p>
<p>Some examples of this type of interpersonal encounter are provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261927X11425036">Appendix A</xref>; these incidents are used as the item content of the present authors’ Rudeness Scale (RS). As the reader can see, the threat to Person B’s status is oblique, rather than direct, in most of these incidents. At the surface level, A’s communication to B is presented as a seemingly well-intentioned bid to get B to respond in a way that simultaneously (a) acknowledges fault, (b) makes a gesture toward “repairing” it, and (c) respects Person A (i.e., preserves Person A’s “face”) for issuing the challenge. There is always the risk, however, that Person B will not accept Person A’s challenge as a well-intentioned opportunity to repair the situation while permitting the mutual preservation of “face,” but will instead view it as A’s attempt to get one-up by putting B in his or her place, that is, one-down.</p>
<p>From B’s perspective, the choice is to accept A’s bid at face value, along with the humbling―or worse yet, the humiliation―that goes with it, or to reject A’s bid and assert B’s claim to unimpugned status. This counterresponse by B of rejecting A’s bid can vary greatly along a dimension of diplomacy. At one extreme, A’s bid can be deflected by B in such a subtle and politely phrased way that A is left nonplussed. At the other extreme, A’s bid can be rejected by B in such a rude and “in-your-face” way that A is forced to confront B’s naked hostility and obvious willingness to escalate the unpleasantness of the encounter.</p>
<p>Thus, verbal rudeness is, for B, a tool (or, more bluntly, a weapon) that B can use to strip away the veneer of social politeness from the encounter and re-present it to A as a starkly defined contest for status, power, and “face.” More specifically, verbal rudeness is a countermove that simultaneously lays bare what B perceives to be an underlying status conflict with A and escalates that conflict dramatically. Stated in its crudest terms, B’s countermove of in-your-face rudeness communicates to A: “You want <italic>me</italic> to eat shit? No, <italic>you</italic> eat shit instead!” Indeed, B’s rude attack on A’s “face” is so crude, immediate, intense, and uncompromising that A’s options are either to back off and retreat from the encounter or to remain engaged and risk experiencing an even more hostile response from B. Given these two unpleasant options, it is noteworthy that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> Australian data, most people in the role of Person A choose to withdraw from the encounter as quickly as possible (a move in which they clearly lose some “face”), rather than to escalate it further and risk an even greater loss of “face.”</p>

<sec id="section7-0261927X11425036">
<title>Who Is Most Likely to Display Verbal Rudeness?</title>
<p>In the present investigation, we combined a focus on rudeness as dispositional with a focus on rudeness as instrumental in the struggle for power and “face.” More specifically, we designed this study to explore individual differences in the propensity to verbally abuse hypothetical strangers who adopt the role of Person A in regard to oneself (Person B).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0261927X11425036">3</xref></sup> Because these kinds of encounters tend to precipitate widely varying reactions in individuals who occupy the Person B role (be polite, cede some “face,” and de-escalate the unpleasantness, <italic>or</italic> be rude, cede nothing, and dramatically escalate the unpleasantness), it should be possible to capture these widely varying reactions in respondents’ scores on the RS that we developed (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261927X11425036">Appendix A</xref>).</p>
<p>Our goal in the present study was to begin to explore the personal characteristics of individuals who report a propensity to verbally abuse strangers in the kinds of situations just described. In the service of this goal, we conducted an online survey study in which our respondents were asked to provide some basic demographic information and then complete six personality measures that we thought might predict their scores on our RS (the last measure to appear on the online survey).</p>
<sec id="section8-0261927X11425036">
<title>Potential demographic predictors</title>
<p>The demographic predictors we included in the survey were age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Despite the stereotypic image that holds that rude people are likely to be young, working class, minority males, only gender (i.e., being male vs. female) emerged as a consistent predictor of rude behavior in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> study of a large Australian sample. Age, race/ethnicity, and SES did not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261927X11425036">
<title>Potential personality predictors</title>
<p>The personality predictors we included in the survey were social desirability, aggression/hostility, impulsivity, adherence to conventional morality, ego defensiveness (i.e., unwillingness to accept criticism), and affect intensity for aggression and frustration (AIAF). The specific measures used to assess each of these constructs are described in the “Method” section.</p>
<p>Why did we choose this set of personality predictors? Two of them were suggested by Lynne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261927X11425036">Truss’s (2005)</xref> mostly satirical but also somewhat speculative book about rudeness, <italic>Talk to the Hand</italic>. In this book, Truss characterized rude people as those who have little or no respect for conventional morality and manners (i.e., those who should score low in adherence to conventional morality) and “who simply will not stand to be corrected in any way” (i.e., those who should score high in thin-skinned ego defensiveness). Our own theoretical speculations further suggested that rude people are easily and intensely angered by even small challenges and presumed “provocations,” so we included measures of aggression/hostility, impulsivity, and AIAF as well. Finally, because admitting to rude behavior is a socially undesirable thing to do, we decided to include a brief measure of social desirability as a final possible predictor or covariate.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0261927X11425036">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 275 undergraduate students who were enrolled in introductory psychology courses at the University of Texas–Arlington. The sample included 210 females, 64 males, and 1 student who declined to answer the question involving gender. The participants’ ages ranged from 17 to 50 years (median age = 20 years), and their racial/ethnic composition was 38.9% White/Anglo-American, 21.1% Hispanic/Latino, 17.3% Black/African American, 16% Asian, 0.4% Native American/Alaskan Native, 5.5% Other/Multicultural, and 1.1% who declined to answer the question on race/ethnicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261927X11425036">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All the participants were recruited via the internet through the Psychology Department’s experiment tracking software system, SONA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425036">Fidler, 1997</xref>). Those participants who chose to participate in the present study were directed to our survey on the SurveyMonkey website. They began by reading an online consent document and clicking the “YES” response to acknowledge their informed consent to its terms.</p>
<p>All respondents received experimental participation credit for completing the online survey. The survey was programmed so that all measures had to be answered in the order presented; the respondents were unable to view upcoming measures or to return to change their answers to previous ones. The respondents were free to decline to answer any question and could discontinue their participation at any time. All procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas–Arlington.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0261927X11425036">
<title>Online Survey Measures</title>
<p>After they had responded to the online informed consent and agreed to continue, the respondents were then asked to complete the subsequent sections of the online survey. The second section of the survey contained seven demographic items. These items were used to collect data about each respondent’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, and SES (defined in terms of both parents’ education levels and total family income).</p>
<p>The next six sections of the survey contained the six personality measures (social desirability, impulsivity, aggression, conventional morality, ego defensiveness, and AIAF) that we used to predict the respondents’ scores on the RS, which appeared in the final (ninth) section of the online survey. A detailed description of each of these measures is provided below. All these measures were presented consecutively in a single session. The entire online survey consisted of 135 items, and this item count included the 10 RS items and the 7 demographic questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0261927X11425036">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conventional Morality Scale (CM)</title>
<p>The Conventional Morality Scale was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X11425036">Tooke and Ickes (1988)</xref> to measure the extent to which a person adheres to the conventional moral values of the Judeo-Christian religious tradition. The item content for this scale was drawn from the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins (for sample items, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0261927X11425036">Appendix B</xref>). However, to disguise the intent of the measure, all items were written as if they reflected individual lifestyle preferences, and the scale appeared on the survey under the label <italic>Lifestyle Preference Questionnaire</italic> (for more details about the scale’s construction and format, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261927X11425036">Tooke &amp; Ickes, 1988</xref>).

<title>Ego Defensiveness Scale (ED)</title>
<p>The Ego Defensiveness Scale was developed by William Ickes and Anna Park. It assesses ego defensiveness by identifying the extent to which the respondents are “thin-skinned” individuals who refuse to accept criticism or correction from others (for sample items, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0261927X11425036">Appendix B</xref>). The 10 items on this measure were each rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (<italic>completely disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely agree</italic>).

<title>Affect Intensity for Anger and Frustration (AIAF)</title>

<title>Rudeness Scale (RS)</title>
<p>The RS was developed by William Ickes to measure individual differences in the propensity to verbally abuse hypothetical strangers who threaten one’s status, power, or “face.” This measure includes 10 hypothetical situation items, each with four alternative responses that vary in their “rudeness points” (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261927X11425036">Appendix A</xref>). The reliability of the RS in the current sample was .76. The present study is the first to use the RS; for that reason, it reports the only validity evidence to be obtained for this measure so far.</p>
<p>Because it was difficult to create plausible-sounding alternatives for each of the RS items that resulted in a clear-cut assignment of 1, 2, 3, or 4 “rudeness points,” data were collected from 12 graduate and undergraduate research assistants who rated the four alternatives for each RS item on a scale of 1 (<italic>least rude</italic>) to 4 (<italic>most rude</italic>). The intraclass correlation for the ratings made by these 12 judges was .94. The ratings indicated strong agreement regarding the alternatives that were assigned the “rudeness point” values of 1 and 4 for all 10 items. On the other hand, the ratings suggested that “rudeness point” values other than 2 and 3 should be assigned to the intermediate alternatives for items 3, 7, and 9. See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0261927X11425036">Appendix A</xref> for the recommended “rudeness points” to assign when scoring each of the items on the RS.</p>

<title>Intercorrelations of the Personality Measures and the Rudeness Measure</title>
<p>The zero-order intercorrelations of the personality measures and the rudeness measures are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X11425036">Table 1</xref>, along with those for the sociodemographic variables of gender and race. Because gender and race were categorical variables, it was necessary to recode them into a format suitable for correlation and regression. Weighted effects codes were used for both variables because this type of coding is optimal when, as in the current data set, there were unequal numbers of cases for each group. For gender, the simple bivariate correlations were examined for each personality variable. To obtain the zero-order correlations for race, however, required a more complex procedure that would account for each of the different racial groups. Four separate weighted effects codes were created for race and entered into a regression. The overall <italic>R</italic> for the model represented the zero-order correlation between the race variable as a whole and the outcome variable.</p>

<p>For this series of correlational analyses, all six personality predictors were significantly correlated with the respondents’ total rudeness scores. The propensity for verbal rudeness was positively related to self-reported impulsivity (.25), aggression (.37), ego defensiveness (.38), and AIAF (.34). On the other hand, rudeness was negatively correlated with conventional morality (−.52) and social desirability (−.33). Finally, rudeness was related to being male as opposed to female (.14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0261927X11425036">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Assessing the Unique Contribution of the Predictors in Multiple Regression Analyses</title>
<sec id="section24-0261927X11425036">
<title>Initial test of main effects</title>
<p>Because the six personality predictors were themselves intercorrelated to a substantial degree (the significant zero-order correlations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X11425036">Table 1</xref> range from −.32 to .61), a multiple regression analysis was needed to assess each predictor’s unique contribution to scores on the rudeness measure when all other predictors were held constant. We also wanted to see if any of the demographic variables (gender, age, race, and SES) were unique predictors of rudeness. We therefore tested an initial “main effects only” regression model, which included each of the personality and demographic variables as potential predictors.</p>
<p>Once again, weighted effects codes were used for both the race and gender variables because they provide an estimate of the difference between each group and the overall weighted grand mean. This type of coding is optimal when, as in the current data set, there were unequal numbers of cases for each group. Following procedures suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425036">Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003)</xref>, race/ethnicity was entered into the second “block” of the regression model as four weighted effects codes. All other variables were included in the first block of the regression model. It was necessary to place the four race codes in the second block of the model so that the change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> could be assessed. A significant change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> would indicate that there was a main effect for the race/ethnicity variable after controlling for the various personality effects.</p>
<p>The results of this initial “main effects only” model revealed that social desirability, impulsivity, and aggression were <italic>not</italic> significant as unique predictors of the respondents’ rudeness scores; nor were the demographic variables of gender, age, and SES. There were, however, significant effects for ego defensiveness, <italic>b</italic> = .18, <italic>t</italic>(262) = 3.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>sr</italic><sup>2</sup> = .02, conventional morality, <italic>b</italic> = −.39, <italic>t</italic>(262) = −5.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>sr</italic><sup>2</sup> = .09, and AIAF, <italic>b</italic> = .10, <italic>t</italic>(262) = 2.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>sr</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01, as well as a slight but statistically significant effect for race/ethnicity, Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .03, Δ<italic>F</italic>(4, 261) = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<sec id="section25-0261927X11425036">
<title>Test of interactions</title>
<p>The results of the “main effects only” model suggested that we could delete many of the potential predictors (in particular, gender, age, SES, impulsivity, and aggression) from the regression model. However, to make sure that none of these candidate-for-deletion variables were implicated in significant higher order interaction effects, we conducted a second multiple regression analysis that included all of the first-order terms as well as all possible two-way and three-way interaction terms. The results of this analysis revealed <italic>no</italic> significant two- or three-way interaction effects, an outcome that enabled us to test the final, “main effects only” model that we describe below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0261927X11425036">
<title>Final test of main effects</title>
<p>In our final regression analysis, we obtained the parameter estimates for a model that included only those predictors that were significant in the initial main effects model. Social desirability was also included in this model, however, even though it was not a significant predictor in the preliminary regression analysis, because it is widely considered to be an important control variable (i.e., covariate). As before, we used a sequential regression analysis to test the effect of the race/ethnicity variable in the second block of the model, with the four personality variables tested in the model’s first block of predictors.</p>
<p>This simplified main effects model accounted for a combined 35% of the total variance in the participants’ rudeness scores. With regard to the personality predictors, conventional morality was the strongest predictor of rudeness. It accounted for more than twice as much unique variance as either of the other significant predictors: ego-defensiveness and AIAF. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X11425036">Table 2</xref> displays the parameter estimates for these effects.</p>

<p>In summary, the present findings revealed that the people who are most likely to verbally abuse strangers are those who are Latino or Black and who score low on the measures of conventional morality but high on ego defensiveness and AIAF.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In an online survey study (<italic>n</italic> = 275), we used several demographic and personality variables to predict scores on the RS, a new measure of the propensity to verbally abuse strangers. The results of a series of multiple regression analyses revealed a number of additive main effects. These effects indicated that the persons in our sample who reported the greatest propensity to verbally abuse strangers were Hispanic/Latino or Black individuals who scored low in their adherence to the standards of conventional morality but high in ego defensiveness (unwillingness to accept criticism or correction from others) and AIAF. Once the effects of these defining variables were accounted for, there were no significant residual effects for the variables of gender, age, SES, social desirability, impulsivity, or aggression/hostility.</p>

<p>We suggest that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261927X11425036">Swann and Read (1981)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261927X11425036">Swann (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261927X11425036">1999)</xref> self-verification motive is the one that accounts for the strong link in the present study between the respondents’ (low) scores on the Conventional Morality Scale and their (high) scores on the RS. For people who reject the standards of conventional morality (i.e., those who ignore many or all the Ten Commandments and indulge in many or all of the Seven Deadly Sins), it is a rude affront to their own self-image to be accosted by a total stranger and informed that their current behavior fails to measure up to one or more of those standards. When low–conventional morality individuals respond to such a challenge by saying “I think you’re confusing me with someone who gives a shit about your bullshit rules,” they undoubtedly mean what they say. In their view, the challenger has criticized them without knowing who they are or what they stand for. Because they <italic>don’t</italic> accept the standards of conventional morality, they may feel perfectly justified in viewing the other person as the rude offender, rather than themselves, and in countering his or her rude act with a blast of verbal rudeness that is intended to send a loud and clear message: “I’m not who you seem to think I am. So fuck off!”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0261927X11425036">
<title>(High) ego defensiveness</title>
<p>A factor that further elevates the low–conventional morality person’s tendency to verbally abuse strangers in response to a perceived challenge or criticism is a high level of ego defensiveness, which we define as a “thin-skinned” refusal to accept criticism or correction from others. Our interpersonal definition of ego defensiveness differs from Carl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X11425036">Rogers’s (1961)</xref> more intrapersonal one. As a practicing psychotherapist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261927X11425036">Rogers (1961)</xref> was primarily interested in how people defend their egos <italic>internally</italic>, by using defense mechanisms such as denial, distortion, and subception (“tuning out”) as a way of avoiding, ignoring, or minimizing threatening feedback from others. In contrast, our Ego Defensiveness Scale places a primary emphasis on how people defend their egos <italic>externally</italic>, by immediately and forcefully rejecting any actual or implied criticism from others. When this tendency (high ego defensiveness) is combined with a personal rejection of the standards of conventional morality (low conventional morality), the result is a personality that is especially likely to take offense at being criticized for ignoring moral or ethical standards that he or she does not even endorse—including the one about not directing verbal abuse at a stranger.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0261927X11425036">
<title>(High) AIAF</title>
<p>A second factor that further elevates the low–conventional morality person’s tendency to verbally abuse strangers is a high level of AIAF. The desire to verbally abuse others is often checked by considerations of self-interest (e.g., fear of retaliation, being perceived by others as unable to “keep your cool”). However, when one is temperamentally predisposed to overreact to situations that elicit feelings of anger and frustration, “keeping your cool” may simply not be an option. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X11425036">Larsen et al. (1986)</xref> have noted, affect intensity may be the crucial variable that separates people who restrain themselves in such situations from those who lash out at others instead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0261927X11425036">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section32-0261927X11425036">
<title>The dispositionally rude person</title>
<p>These three factors—low adherence to conventional morality, high ego defensiveness in the form of rejecting any criticism or correction from others, and high AIAF—may prove to be key elements in the personality of the dispositionally rude person. For rudeness to become dispositional, however, it has to become both habitual and frequently reinforced. And on this point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> Australian data are highly relevant, because they indicate that when people are verbally abused by someone whose manners they hoped to correct, their typical reaction is to just “leave the situation or to let it drop” (p. 197).</p>
<p>Whenever this happens, the verbally abusive person gets rewarded in at least two ways. First, by using in-your-face rudeness to reject the other person’s challenge or criticism, the verbally abusive person successfully defends his or her self-image as someone who “doesn’t give a shit” about the social conventions on which the challenger has based his or her claim. Second, by using in-your-face rudeness to catch the other person off guard, the verbally abusive person can escalate the tension in the encounter so dramatically and unexpectedly that the other person typically shuts up, backs down, and slinks away, thereby allowing the verbally abusive person to win the implicit competition for power, status, and “face.” Given such immediate, reliable, and powerful reinforcement for individual acts of verbal rudeness, it is easy to see how verbal abusiveness becomes first a habit and then a firmly entrenched disposition. The result is one more dispositionally rude person for the rest of the world to have to deal with.</p>

<sec id="section33-0261927X11425036">
<title>Is race/ethnicity important?</title>
<p>Is race/ethnicity an important variable in the study of social rudeness? Although it did not emerge as important in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al.’s (2010)</xref> Australian study, there was evidence in the present study that Latinos and Blacks (of both genders) may have a greater propensity for verbal rudeness than Whites and Asians. We have two observations to make in this regard. First, Asians tend to represent cultural traditions in which harmony is emphasized and a premium is placed on being (at least outwardly) polite and respectful of others. Second, Latinos and Blacks, as members of the two largest racial minority groups in the United States, have a history of being regarded as “second-class citizens” who may have learned to counter this stereotype by being vocal and assertive rather than polite and circumspect, as most Asians seem to be. Although our study appears to provide the first direct evidence that race/ethnicity may be an important variable in the study of rudeness, future researchers would be well advised to test for the effects of this variable as well.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0261927X11425036">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Present Investigation</title>
<p>Although the present study appears to shed some light on the propensity to verbally abuse others, its strengths are qualified by some noteworthy limitations. The study’s strengths include its substantial sample size, its investigation of both demographic and personality predictors, and the reasonably clear-cut main effect findings that emerged. In addition, the study controlled for social desirability response bias in identifying three predictors (low conventional morality, high ego defensiveness, and high AIAF) that seem to capture essential aspects of the personality of the dispositionally rude person, while at the same time identifying two other predictors (impulsivity, anger/hostility) that appear to contribute nothing else that is essential in this regard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the study’s college student sample, though relatively large, is not sufficiently heterogeneous with regard to the age and SES variables—a limitation that might account for the lack of significant effects for these demographic predictors in the present investigation. In addition, our sample lacks geographical diversity as well. Finally, although we had some success predicting the self-reported propensity to verbally abuse strangers, we cannot simply assume that our predictors will predict actual acts of verbal rudeness in addition to hypothetical ones. Still, given the formidable difficulties of studying rudeness <italic>in situ</italic> that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261927X11425036">Smith et al. (2010)</xref> have noted, the present study makes a useful contribution by providing an alternative methodology and a new set of findings that may help to inform our understanding of this interesting but understudied phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0261927X11425036">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>There are a number of interesting directions for future research. First, the present study focused on personality variables that might facilitate verbal rudeness; future research should also examine personality variables (such as scores on inhibition and self-control measures) that could inhibit or restrain verbal rudeness. Second, future research should be conducted with more diverse and heterogeneous samples, as noted above. Third, future research should change the role of the RS from an outcome variable to a predictor variable, and test to see whether scores on the RS can successfully predict actual rude behavior, both in the laboratory and in real-world settings. For example, are new telemarketers who score higher on the RS more likely to give offense and be hung up on by potential customers than are their lower scoring counterparts? These are just a few of the many directions that researchers could pursue in their attempts to dissect the fascinating phenomenon of verbal rudeness in everyday life.</p>

<p>In correlations not involving the rudeness measure, gender was also associated with aggression and adherence to conventional morality, such that females scored lower on aggression but higher on conventional morality than males. Race was significantly associated with aggression and affect intensity. Probing these last two correlations involved using dummy codes and running separate regression models so that each racial group could be treated as the comparison against which all other races were compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X11425036">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425036">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>).
