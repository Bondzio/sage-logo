<p>The last several decades have witnessed the proliferation and popularity of volunteering both as a means for individuals to connect with social issues and as a way of sustaining nonprofit organizations; indeed, it dominates contemporary discussions about civic engagement. Whereas some social theorists have promoted volunteering as a benchmark to assess democratic participation, civic-mindedness, social capital, and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318911423762">Putnam, 2000</xref>), others have questioned the uncomplicated associations among volunteering, civic engagement, and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423762">Ganesh &amp; McAllum, 2009</xref>). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318911423762">Snyder (2001)</xref>, we position volunteering as a “hybrid strain of helping” (p. 16309) that falls between spontaneous bystander intervention and highly obligated caregiving. Specifically, we propose that volunteering involves sustained identity investments by volunteers performed and realized in organizational settings.</p>
<p>The organizational production of volunteering is particularly salient given the nonprofit sector’s historical dependence on both corporate and state actors. In the last two decades, this dependency has been articulated in terms of “partnerships” between civil society organizations and businesses or government agencies. In turn, these have led to greater demands for transparency, efficiency, and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911423762">Eisenberg &amp; Eschenfelder, 2009</xref>). Such moves have been accompanied by an increasing emphasis on professionalism as a discursive and normative referent in the organization of volunteers’ practices and identities. Accordingly, this essay will examine relationships between volunteering and professionalization, positing that scholars need to simultaneously hold the two in tension while also studying how discourses of professionalization transform the performance of volunteering. Doing so enables scholars to understand the communicative and organizational production of both volunteering and professionalism, shedding light on the gendered, discursive, and contingent performance of both phenomena.</p>
<p>Despite critical attention by organizational communication scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423762">Cheney &amp; Ashcraft, 2007</xref>), the terms <italic>professionalization</italic> and <italic>professionalism</italic> remain ambiguous and multidimensional. The two constructs are obviously highly connected, yet differ inasmuch as professionalization emphasizes structure and process and professionalism highlights practice and identity. We note at least four domains of concern on the subject in organizational communication studies. First, scholars have been concerned with professionalization in the context of research on organizational form, paying attention to such issues as bureaucratization and rationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423762">Ganesh, 2005</xref>). Second, they have addressed the impact of professionalization on organizational strategy and changes in core values. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318911423762">Simpson and Cheney (2007)</xref> examined how marketization influenced both practical and value shifts in a retirement village community. Third, one can understand professionalism as a particular kind of occupational identity position produced in conditions of late capitalist modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423762">Cheney &amp; Ashcraft, 2007</xref>) that is negotiated and resisted in a myriad ways by a range of occupations. Finally, professionalism is also associated with the construction of specific discursive work norms such as impersonality, fairness, or promptness that split public and private codes of conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911423762">Cheney, Ritz, Lair, &amp; Kendall, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>When volunteering and <italic>professionalism</italic> are held in tension, the very practices that constitute volunteering can be understood as forms of unpaid, amateur, and low-status labor. Most analyses have assumed that volunteers are not professional because, unlike élite occupational groups, volunteers receive limited training, possess no disciplinary knowledge, and have little power even if their work has significant social consequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318911423762">Merrell’s (2000)</xref> study of volunteers at a women’s clinic, for instance, argues that volunteer roles precluded offering advice to clients because of their nonprofessional status vis-à-vis paid staff.</p>
<p>So, the ambiguous notion of professionalism can become usefully specific when contrasted with volunteering, inasmuch as the tension reveals particular status dynamics, and forms of material, emotional, and embodied labor that constitute both terms. Several current understandings of volunteering do not resonate with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911423762">Fournier’s (1999)</xref> list of “professional” competencies such as responsibility for actions and emotional neutrality. If, as some scholars have recommended, organizations assume volunteers are neither reliable nor accountable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318911423762">Wilson &amp; Pimm, 1996</xref>), only tasks peripheral to an organization’s core mission become suitable for volunteers. Such tasks tend to be monotonous, trivial, or unskilled, unlike higher status and implicitly professional functions such as board membership, which, although unpaid, is usually not understood as volunteering but is categorized as a specialized form of nonprofit management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423762">Brown &amp; Iverson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, dichotomizing volunteering and professionalism highlights the gendered nature of professionalism, constructing volunteering as inferior. That is, volunteering can be understood as a feminized form of labor characterized by emotional and caring behaviors, whereas masculine, “professional” work emphasizes efficiency and getting things done. So, even when men “volunteer,” they tend to select leadership positions or public, political roles that are “complementary to their <italic>real</italic> work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318911423762">Wilson, 2000</xref>, p. 228, emphasis added), and women’s contributions to the community are downgraded to “non-professional . . . pseudo-work [or] occupational therapy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318911423762">Pearce, 1993</xref>, p. 31).</p>
<p>However, as indicated at the outset, we need to not only consider tensions in the professionalism-volunteering relationship but also examine how <italic>professionalization</italic> is profoundly reshaping what counts as volunteering. Such colonization is evident in terms of profound shifts in the nonprofit sector, volunteer praxis, and volunteer identity itself. The formalization of nonprofit practice as a result of institutional pressures in the form of monitoring and reporting requirements, legal prescriptions, and management trends has professionalized all organizational members, including volunteers. This new operational discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423762">Frumkin &amp; Andre-Clark, 2000</xref>) in nonprofit practice is particularly evident in contemporary funding environments.</p>
<p>To attract and retain external funding, many nonprofits have used market-based criteria to measure the costs and benefits of interventions, evolving into bureaucracies that are increasingly disconnected from community concerns and geared toward meeting statutorily mandated government requirements. The need to quantify success can direct organizational mission away from the communities that nonprofits were set up to serve, and this merits vigorous study by communication scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318911423762">Lewis, 2005</xref>). Indeed, scholars have noted that a focus on compliance paradoxically results in the identification of groups that are relatively easy to serve and the abandonment of service delivery to groups that are more needy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318911423762">Weisbrod, 2004</xref>). Eventually, professionalization as a colonizing logic may <italic>bifurcate</italic> the nonprofit sector, creating a two-tiered distinction between professionalized and businesslike organizations on one hand and grass-roots, advocacy-oriented groups with strong community connections on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318911423762">Milligan &amp; Fyfe, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The examination of such processes as the marketization, routinization, formalization, and rationalization of volunteer practice enhances our ability to assess the bifurcating effect that discourses of professionalization have on the nonprofit sector. Studies have shown routinization reduces volunteers’ sense of autonomy and, consequently, their organizational commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318911423762">Kreutzer &amp; Jäger, 2010</xref>). Professionalization, from this perspective, vitiates the ability of volunteers to passionately connect to broader social issues that matter.</p>
<p>Professionalism as an operational discipline or a series of behavioral prescriptions has also transformed volunteer practice and, hence, identity. Volunteers tend to spend less time engaging directly with issues and causes because of professional restrictions placed around service delivery. Instead, their time and efforts are often taken up by administrative tasks such as grant applications. The discursive tendency to characterize communities as “clients” is part of this transformation. Even when volunteers do connect with the people they serve, larger pressures to professionalize nonprofit practice affect how interpersonal interaction with community “clients” unfolds, sometimes with problematic and even antidemocratic consequences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911423762">Alexander, Nank, and Stivers’s (1999)</xref> study of Ohio-based nonprofits concluded that notions of technical expertise dominated organizational views of service, resulting in dismissing the lived experience of community residents and sidelining “participatory deliberation as a waste of time because the professional answer to problems [was] already clear” (p. 462).</p>
<p>Thus, it is critical to examine professionalization and professionalism as comprising “techniques and procedures for directing human behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911423762">Foucault, 1997</xref>, p. 73) that govern volunteers at a distance by encouraging them to adopt prescriptive practices drawn from the for-profit world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318911423762">Rose, O’Malley, and Valverde (2006)</xref> further suggested the subjects created by professionalized strategies and technologies would “produce the ends of government by fulfilling themselves rather than being merely obedient” (p. 89). That is, professionalism itself can represent a particular kind of volunteer empowerment. For instance, some have argued that volunteer identity should be molded by a “professional spirit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911423762">Hodgson, 2002</xref>, p. 805). In general, however, the literature on volunteer commitment and responsibility seldom explains what drives individuals to construct identities as professional, empowered volunteers.</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis of the professionalization of volunteer practice could yield important insights into the ongoing evolution and transformation of what counts as professionalism itself. Much academic research about, and popular social criticism of, the volunteering–professionalism relationship continues to rely on understandings of professionalism drawn from full-time, paid work contexts. Rather than categorically assert that volunteers simply cannot “do” professionalism, it is possible that the construct of “professionalism” in third spaces may itself require wider interpretation. While scholars have recognized professionalism is not a set of codes that individuals simply receive and with which they passively identify, we need to further assess whether “professional volunteers” identify as such and how they contest these identity positions. Future research would therefore do well to focus on the fractured nature of professionalism in volunteering contexts. We look forward to such work.</p>
