<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates the combustion and emission characteristics of dual-fuel compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion. n-heptane and oxygen-containing alcohols were chosen as the port-injection fuel and the in-cylinder direct-injection fuel, respectively. It is found that compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion with n-heptane port injection and alcohol direct injection exhibits a three-stage combustion process containing n-heptane low-temperature reactions, high-temperature reactions and alcohol combustion. The crank angle position at which 10% of the mass fraction is burned is mainly dominated by the fuel heat value per cycle of premixed fuel, and is advanced with increasing the fuel heat value per cycle of premixed fuel and premixed ratio. The crank angle position at which 50% of the mass fraction is burned shows remarkable sensitivity to the premixed ratio, and is advanced considerably as the premixed ratio and the fuel heat value per cycle of premixed fuel increase. Burn duration increases with increasing total fuel heat value per cycle and fuel heat value per cycle of directly injected fuel. The results show that compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion could successfully reach the full load of the prototype engine. The indicated thermal efficiency is very close to the prototype engine. However, their CO and hydrocarbon emissions are relatively higher. It is worth noting that compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion with alcohol direct injection can reduce nitrogen oxide and soot emissions simultaneously. Nitrogen oxide emissions can be reduced below 100 ppm, and smoke opacity is below 15% at the full-load ranges. Moreover, with increasing oxygen content of directly injected fuels, soot emission of compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion decreases. Ethanol direct injection could make compound homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion nearly smoke free at the full-load ranges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a promising alternative combustion technology to the current spark-ignition (SI) engines and direct-injection compression ignition (DICI) engines, homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion has attracted great attention in recent years, owing to its capability of achieving both high thermal efficiency and low nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) and particulate matter emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412440908">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412440908"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412440908"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412440908"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412440908">5</xref></sup> HCCI combustion is accomplished by compression ignition of a premixed lean fuel/air mixture. This mixture preparation and ignition methods determine that HCCI combustion is able to simultaneously incorporate the advantages of SI engines and DICI engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412440908">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412440908"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412440908">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, HCCI combustion suffers from poor controllability of the combustion phase because it lacks a direct combustion control method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412440908">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412440908">10</xref></sup> such as a spark plug in SI engines or a direct fuel injection in DICI engines. Another challenge of the HCCI mode is the high hydrocarbon (HC) and CO emissions at light loads,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412440908">11</xref></sup> and the significant engine noise and rapid combustion rate at high loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412440908">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most important parameters impacting the HCCI combustion phase is the fuel ignitability. HCCI operation has been demonstrated for a variety of fuels with different molecule structure and ignitability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412440908">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412440908"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412440908"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412440908">16</xref></sup> including single-stage ignition fuels, usually with high octane number, such as gasoline and iso-octane, and two-stage ignition fuels, usually with high cetane number, such as diesel and n-heptane. Recent work by Sjöberg and Dec<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412440908">17</xref></sup> has shown that two-stage ignition fuels offer some significant advantages for combustion phase control and high-load extension. However, fuels with single-stage ignition benefit from a rapid transient response, simplifying the control of HCCI engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412440908">18</xref></sup> As a result, it seems that all current hurdles for single-fuel HCCI combustion are difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>On the basis of fuel property modulation, a novel fuel design concept has been proposed to realize combustion control and low emissions in HCCI engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412440908">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087412440908">20</xref></sup> Lu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087412440908">21</xref></sup> examined physico-chemical properties and combustion characteristics of mixed and reformulated fuels, and proved that an extended operating range of HCCI combustion and reduced CO and HC emissions could be achieved.</p>
<p>In addition to simply blending fuels with different physico-chemical properties or mixing basic fuels with various additives, the fuel design concept can be extended to a wider operation range. Ogawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087412440908">22</xref></sup> directly injected water and low-ignitability fuels early in the compression stroke to suppress HCCI combustion of premixed light naphtha, and investigated the chemical effects of these ignition inhibitors on HCCI reactions. Hou et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087412440908">23</xref></sup> Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087412440908">24</xref></sup> and Wilhelmsson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468087412440908">25</xref></sup> adopted two independent port fuel supply systems to attain real-time adjustment of the injection amount of two different fuels, named the active fuel design method, to control ignition timing and combustion phasing of HCCI. These active fuel design methods allow flexible fuel-property adjustment in HCCI engines and a real-time response could be made according to the operation conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fuel injection management is another effective way to control the combustion phase and extend the operation range of HCCI combustion, while maintaining low emissions. Hashizume et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468087412440908">26</xref></sup> proposed a concept of multiple stage diesel combustion (MULDIC), which contained two-stage injection and combined premixed lean combustion (first-stage combustion) with diffusion combustion (second-stage combustion). With MULDIC operation, NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions could be reduced simultaneously, but fuel consumption was higher compared to conventional operation. Huang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087412440908">24</xref></sup> developed a novel combustion technology by combining the concepts of fuel design and injection management. This combustion technology focused on fuel physico-chemical property adjustment and fuel injection strategy development, and incorporated the advantages of traditional DICI, HCCI and SI combustion strategies. Therefore, the fuel design concept combined with fuel injection management was considered to be a viable technology for the future, and in this paper, it is named the compound HCCI combustion mode.</p>
<p>In this study, dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion was realized through fuel port injection (PI) combined with in-cylinder direct injection (DI). The fuels n-heptane and alcohol were selected as the PI fuel and the DI fuels, respectively. The selection of such a combination of fuels aims to create a sequential in-cylinder combustion process, in which the pressure rise rate is reduced by avoiding the single-stage combustion and the engine operation range is extended, according to our previous research work using n-heptane and iso-octane as the PI fuel and the DI fuel, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468087412440908">27</xref></sup> Instead of iso-octane fuel, alcohols are used as DI fuels in this study, mainly because of the potential of alcohols in emission reduction. It is supposed that the cooling effect of alcohol fuels, which originates from their high latent heat of vaporization, is beneficial for NO<sub>x</sub> suppression by reducing the in-cylinder temperature, and the oxygenated alcohol fuels also contribute to inhibiting the soot generation. The major objective of this work is to find the combustion and emissions characteristics of this dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion with varied influencing factors and investigate the potential to realize high efficiency and clean combustion at the full-load range.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412440908">Figure 1</xref> shows a schematic of the experimental setup. An electrical port injector with 5 MPa injection pressure was mounted 0.35m upstream from the intake valve. n-heptane was injected by this injector and a homogeneous fuel/air mixture can be formed during the intake and compression stroke. The PI timing was 285° crank angle (CA) before top dead center (BTDC). The injector for alcohol DI has a cone angle of 154°, and the DI timing does not serve as a variable in this study, which enables better analysis of the influences of other operation parameters (premixed ratio, DI fuels and cycle heat value) on combustion and emissions. By maintaining the fuel supply angle at 9° CA BTDC, the DI timing is held constant.</p>

<title>Combustion characteristics of compound HCCI combustion with n-heptane PI and ethanol DI</title>
<p>The heat-release rate of compound HCCI combustion with n-heptane PI and ethanol DI is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412440908">Figure 2</xref>. From the heat-release curves, three peaks are observed in spite of the changed premixed ratio and total heat value per cycle, indicating that a staged combustion process, containing n-heptane low-temperature reactions (LTRs), high-temperature reactions (HTRs) and DI fuel combustion, is realized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412440908">Figure 2(a)</xref> displays the influence of premixed ratio on the heat-release rate of compound HCCI combustion, where the total heat value per cycle is held constant at 0.96 kJ/cycle. It can be found that as <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> decreases, the maximum cylinder pressure decreases and the peak value of heat-release rate of n-heptane HTRs decreases. Moreover, decreased <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> can significantly retard the start of n-heptane HTRs and slightly increase the peak value of heat-release rate of ethanol combustion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412440908">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows the effect of total heat value per cycle on the heat-release rate of compound HCCI combustion, where the premixed ratio is held constant at 0.62. It can be seen that decreased <italic>Q</italic> and <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic> lead to similar effects on the maximum cylinder pressure, the peak value of heat-release rate of n-heptane HTRs and the start of n-heptane HTRs. However, smaller <italic>Q</italic> can cause an earlier end of ethanol combustion, which is just the opposite to the effect of lower <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412440908">Figure 3</xref> shows the effects of total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio on compound HCCI combustion parameters, including the maximum pressure rising rate, IMEP, the maximum cylinder pressure and maximum mass-averaged temperature. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412440908">Figure 3(a)</xref>, the maximum pressure rising rate increases with increasing <italic>Q</italic> and <italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic>. According to our previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468087412440908">29</xref></sup> the maximum pressure rising rate of compound HCCI combustion is mainly determined by the equivalence ratio of the premixed fuel.

<p>Effects of total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio on indicated thermal efficiency of compound HCCI combustion are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412440908">Figure 7</xref>. It can be observed that the shaded region indicates the most efficient area, where the indicated thermal efficiency is higher than 0.43. With increased <italic>Q</italic>, the highest efficiency area approaches the medial premixed ratio conditions, which could be explained by changes in CA50 and burn duration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412440908">Figures 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412440908">Figure 6(a)</xref>. It can be seen that in the highest efficiency regions, CA50s are located between −4° CA after top dead center (ATDC) and 12° CA ATDC, while the burn durations are in the range 30–75° CA. For the test points whose premixed ratios are above 0.75 in the shaded region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412440908">Figure 5(a)</xref>, CA50s are achieved before TDC, which is not beneficial for the indicated thermal efficiency improvement. However, the burn durations of these test points are shorter than 60° CA, as shown in the shaded region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412440908">Figure 6(a)</xref>, overwhelming the disadvantages of earlier combustion phases. On the other hand, longer burn duration is caused as premixed ratios are below 0.75, which is disadvantageous for engine efficiency. However, as long as the CA50s are around TDC, indicated thermal efficiency is not obviously deteriorated. Therefore, to guarantee high indicated thermal efficiency for this compound HCCI combustion, premixed ratio and total fuel heat value per cycle should be in a suitable combination.</p>

<title>Emissions characteristics of compound HCCI combustion with n-heptane PI and ethanol DI</title>
<p>The effects of total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio on emission characteristics of compound HCCI combustion are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412440908">Figure 8</xref>. CO emissions decrease with increased total fuel heat value per cycle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412440908">Figure 8(a)</xref>. Compared to the total fuel heat value per cycle, the effect of premixed ratio on CO emissions is a little more complex. At lower total fuel heat value per cycle (<italic>Q</italic> &lt; 1.0 kJ/cycle), the increased premixed ratio first leads to increased CO emissions, and then reduces the CO emissions. When the total fuel heat value per cycle exceeds 1.0 kJ/cycle, CO emissions decrease monotonically as the premixed ratio increases. CO emissions mainly stem from incomplete fuel oxidation and are dominated by combustion temperature. Therefore, both higher total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio can prevent CO emissions as higher mean gas temperatures are produced. HC emissions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412440908">Figure 8(b)</xref>, decrease substantially with increasing total fuel heat value per cycle. In addition, the reduced premixed ratio also contributes to the HC reduction. This is because a lower premixed ratio allows less n-heptane to be retained in the crevice volume, which is a major source of HC emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468087412440908">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>NO<sub>x</sub> emissions decrease with decreasing total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412440908">Figure 8(c)</xref>. This is reasonable since the maximum mass-averaged temperature is reduced when the total fuel heat value per cycle and premixed ratio decrease. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412440908">Figure 8(d)</xref> exhibits that soot emissions of this compound HCCI combustion are rather low, with the smoke opacity less than 2% over wide operating ranges. It is generally accepted that soot emissions of compound HCCI combustion mainly originate from the third-stage combustion. The first and second stages of combustion (i.e. HCCI combustion of premixed fuel) produce very low soot emissions, but elevate the thermal atmosphere and reduce the oxygen concentration in the cylinder, which contributes to soot formation in the third combustion stage. However, ethanol is directly injected into the cylinder, whose self-carried oxygen increases the in-cylinder oxygen concentration and high latent vaporization heat value reduces combustion temperature.</p>

<title>Optimization on dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion</title>
<p>This section further discusses the potential to realize clean and high efficiency combustion of dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion with alcohol fuel DI, through optimization of the premixed ratio. The three different alcohols chosen for DI are ethanol, iso-propanol and iso-butanol. In addition, in order to show the effect of oxygen content on emissions clearly, our previous experimental results of compound HCCI combustion with n-heptane PI and iso-octane DI are used to make a comparison with the results of alcohols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468087412440908">31</xref></sup> Iso-octane, a primary reference fuel (PRF), has a high octane number similar to alcohol fuels, but no oxygen content in the molecule.</p>
<p>The variations of maximum pressure rising rate, indicated thermal efficiency, CO and HC emissions of this compound HCCI combustion with four different directly injected fuels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9</xref>. For a given IMEP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9</xref>, among many combinations of PI and DI fuel amounts, the one with a premixed ratio to minimize NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is selected, and this premixed ratio is named the optimal premixed ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9</xref> also gives the results of n-heptane HCCI combustion as well as diesel DICI combustion of the prototype engine for comparison. It is apparent that n-heptane HCCI combustion reaches the knocking limit (1.2 MPa/° CA defined in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412440908">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468087412440908">26</xref></sup>) at relatively low loads, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(a)</xref>. However, it is worth noting that compound HCCI combustion by using alcohol fuel DI and n-heptane PI is very effective to extend the operation range to higher loads. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(a)</xref> indicates that although the maximum pressure rising rate of compound HCCI combustion increases with IMEP, it is maintained under 1.2 MPa/° CA at high loads. This means that the dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion could avoid knock and successfully achieve full-load operation of the prototype engine. The curves for compound HCCI combustion are seen to shift horizontally to right against the curve for n-heptane HCCI combustion in IMEP. This phenomenon indicates that in order to expand the load to higher than 0.55 MPa, the equivalence ratio of the premixed fuel in compound HCCI combustion mode has to be increased. At this condition, the maximum pressure rising rate of compound HCCI combustion is dominated by the second-stage combustion process of compound HCCI combustion (i.e. n-heptane HTRs) which are mainly determined by the equivalence ratio of premixed fuel. Therefore, similar trends with HCCI combustion in the pressure rising rate could be seen at high loads of compound HCCI combustion.</p>

<p>Variation of indicated thermal efficiency (η) of compound HCCI combustion under the optimal premixed ratios is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(b)</xref>. It is obvious that the indicated thermal efficiency of dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion is always above 0.4, very close to the level of the prototype engine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(d)</xref> indicate that both CO and HC emissions of n-heptane HCCI combustion and dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion are relatively higher than those of the prototype engine. CO emissions of dual-fuel compound HCCI combustion significantly decrease with increasing engine load, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(c)</xref>, while HC emissions vary slightly with loads, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412440908">Figure 9(d)</xref>.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the combustion phasing of CA50 is an important factor on influencing the maximum pressure rising rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412440908">Figure 10</xref> shows the relationship between CA50 and the maximum pressure rising rate of compound HCCI combustion.

<p>Comparison of NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions among compound HCCI combustion, n-heptane HCCI combustion and diesel DICI combustion of the prototype engine was further investigated, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412440908">Figure 11</xref>. Compared to diesel DICI combustion of the prototype engine, HCCI exhibits great advantages in NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions reduction at low and medium loads. After optimization of the premixed ratios, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of compound HCCI combustion with iso-octane DI are significantly lower than the prototype DICI engine, less than 100 ppm, but soot emissions are higher than the prototype engine in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412440908">Figure 11</xref>. This means that the trade-off relationship between the NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions for compound HCCI combustion still exists. When alcohol fuels are used for DI, the low NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of compound HCCI combustion can be maintained, similar to iso-octane compound HCCI combustion. Meanwhile, the smoke opacity is less than 15%, much lower than both the prototype engine and iso-octane compound HCCI combustion. That is to say, compound HCCI combustion with alcohol fuel DI can reduce NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions simultaneously and successfully eliminate the trade-off relationship between NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions. It should be mentioned that, with increasing oxygen content of directly injected fuels, soot emissions of compound HCCI combustion are improved. Compound HCCI combustion fueled with ethanol, which has the highest oxygen content among the four directly injected fuels, is nearly smoke free at the full-load ranges, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412440908">Figure 11</xref>.This indicates that oxygen content in fuel molecules plays a vital role in improving soot emissions of compound HCCI combustion.</p>
