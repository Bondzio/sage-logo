<abstract>
<p>The innovative structure of an undergraduate course on communication and decision making in small groups, based on the framework of Kolb’s experiential learning theory, is described. The course involves doing in-class exercises that replicate published research about a given topic. Exercises involve completion of a group task, the manipulation of variables, and collection and analysis of data. Following each exercise, the students read the original research and other relevant materials. In the subsequent class, the students are debriefed through an examination of the class data and a discussion of the reading materials and potential practical applications. This sequence of experiment replication and discussion is repeated with a different exercise each week. The in-class activities are supplemented with written analysis assignments. Variations on the basic course module and other course components are described, and factors guiding design choices are discussed. Evidence of student learning relevant to course objectives is presented.</p>

<body>
<p>Since 2005, I have taught an undergraduate course called <italic>Communication and Decision Making in Groups</italic>. By all conceivable measures, the course has been successful—it consistently gets high ratings across all dimensions in end-of-the-semester course evaluations, students recommend the course to others, the course was largely responsible for my winning college- and university-wide teaching awards, and I love teaching the course. But most important, students learn a lot from the course. The course is based on an innovative design that students say is like no other. The qualitative comments on the course evaluations always contain exhortations for more classes based on similar principles.</p>
<p>The heart of the course is replication as in-class exercises of some published experiments about communication and decision making in small groups. Following each exercise, we reflect on the experience in a debriefing that includes a discussion of the published research, the data generated by our class, and additional conceptual materials. This forms a two-class sequence (exercise and debriefing) that is repeated weekly with different topics. I designed the course using the theoretical framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413488217">David Kolb’s (1984)</xref> experiential learning theory, whose central premise is that effective learning requires holistic mastery of a cycle of activities wherein knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. The course achieves several objectives. The most important is that students really learn the connection between theory and application—an objective that goes beyond the specific course content of communication and decision making in groups. Second, the course gets students interested in reading original social science research, gives them an appreciation for how knowledge generated from research ends up in textbooks, and reveals how that knowledge applies to life outside of the research setting. Third, the exercises provide students with some specific experiences from which they can gain important insights (such as how majority influence can sometimes lead to faulty decision making). Finally, the course teaches students a great deal about small groups. I will discuss the central elements of experiential learning theory (ELT) and then describe the corresponding elements of my course.</p>

<title>Experiential Learning Theory</title>
<p>Experiential approaches to learning have become increasingly popular over the last few decades, especially in management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413488217">Argyris &amp; Schon, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046496413488217">Dixon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046496413488217">Frontczak, &amp; Kelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046496413488217">Revans, 1980</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046496413488217">Reynolds, 1999</xref>, for a critique). Examples can be found in other disciplines too, within both natural sciences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046496413488217">Healey, &amp; Jenkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046496413488217">Maudsley &amp; Strivens, 2000</xref>) and social sciences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413488217">Clements, 1995</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413488217">Kolb (1984)</xref> model of experiential learning is perhaps the most widely known in the organizational behavior and small group literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496413488217">Kayes, 2002</xref>). Kolb’s model is built on the following six propositions: (a) learning is a process rather than an outcome; (b) learning is “grounded in experience” (p. 27); (c) learning involves adaptation to the world; (d) learning requires resolution of conflict between two dialectically opposed adaptation processes; (e) learning occurs through interactions between people and their environments, and (f) learning is the creation of knowledge. From these propositions, Kolb derives a definition of learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (p. 38).</p>
<p>Kolb defines two major types of transactions between people and their environments. People must first grasp information. This process of <italic>prehension</italic> occurs in two dialectically opposed ways. People can acquire information by <italic>concrete experience</italic>, when information is apprehended through direct sensory experience, or they can acquire information through <italic>abstract conceptualization</italic>, when information is comprehended through logical analysis and model creation. Second, people must somehow transform the acquired information. At one end of the transformation dialectic is <italic>reflective observation</italic>, when intentions shape inwardly focused reflection. At the other end of the dialectic is <italic>active experimentation</italic>, when the desire for exploration leads to externally focused actions. Kolb’s propositions imply that effective learning requires mastery of both the concrete-abstract and the reflective-active dialectics. In fact, he argues that “learning is by its very nature a tension- and conflict-filled process” (p. 30). Holistic learning, therefore, involves a cycle of activities related to Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1046496413488217">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>My decision to develop an experientially based course on communication in small groups was motivated by feedback obtained from a survey of our undergraduate majors indicating that they wanted greater emphasis on practical applications in the curriculum. This survey led to some revisions in the curriculum, such as the introduction of case analyses and increased Internet-based activities. At the same time, the faculty wanted to retain a strong emphasis on conceptual and theoretically driven instruction. I was intimately familiar with the Kolb model, having taught it in an MBA program for 8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046496413488217">Wheeler &amp; McLeod, 2002</xref>), and I knew there was extensive evidence for the model’s effectiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046496413488217">Felder &amp; Silverman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496413488217">Kayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046496413488217">Kayes, Kayes, &amp; Kolb, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496413488217">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046496413488217">Kolb, Boyatzis, &amp; Mainemelis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496413488217">Petkus, 2000</xref>). The theoretical principles of the model seemed to offer an ideal basis for developing a course that would achieve the objectives of providing students with both practical application and sound conceptual knowledge.</p>

<title>Course Overview</title>
<p>The course meets for two 75-min class periods per week over a 14-week semester. Each week, the following sequence occurs. In Class No. 1, (a) we conduct an exercise relevant to a given topic that replicates published research; (b) data associated with that exercise are collected; and (c) preparation carried out between classes involves analysis and review of the collected data and reading of the original research and accompanying material. In Class No. 2, (d) we hold debriefing discussions and I lecture about the conceptual topic and the exercise experience; and (e) a written analysis of the experience is assigned and evaluated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046496413488217">Table 1</xref> illustrates the sequence for a replication of the famous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin, Lippit, and White (1939)</xref> study on autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire leadership styles, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1046496413488217">Table 2</xref> presents a representative list of the research studies that we replicate over the course of a semester.</p>

<title>Class No. 1: Active Experimentation to Reflective Observation</title>
<p>The experiential learning cycle begins prior to students’ arrival to the classroom through the assignment of key readings. Students are instructed that these materials are not to be read until <italic>after</italic> the Class No. 1 activity. The syllabus states, and I reinforce in class on the first day, that students <italic>should not read ahead</italic>. The point of this is to replicate, as much as possible, the experience of being a naïve research participant and to encourage students to come to class with curiosity, anticipation, and open minds. I believe this state of receptivity facilitates full immersion in the Concrete Experience phase. In their course evaluations, students often note that this timing helps them to learn the conceptual material. The following comment is representative: <italic>I absolutely love having the readings assigned for after the exercise. . . Some of the readings are complicated and this helps me understand them so much better . . .</italic> Everyone <italic>does the readings for this class!</italic> The general pattern of events in the class involves introducing the activity, assigning students to teams, giving instructions to students, running the activity, asking students to complete postactivity questionnaires, giving an initial debriefing, and discussing the preparation assignment.</p>
<sec id="section5-1046496413488217">
<title>Activity introduction and team formation</title>
<p>The introduction plays an important role in facilitating the Concrete Experience phase. I generally let students know (in very broad terms) the topic we are covering (e.g., how groups make decisions), and then I offer an agenda or schedule. How much information I include in my opening remarks varies depending on the exercise and my pedagogical purposes. For example, in a replication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin et al. (1939)</xref> study, I maximize the influence of the leaders by telling the class only that we are doing an activity that involves the hotel industry (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046496413488217">Table 1</xref>). All further instructions are given only to individual leaders. The leaders are instructed to enact their assigned leadership styles throughout the ensuing activity (building a hotel from sundry materials). In other cases, I might introduce an activity with a brief discussion where I ask students questions designed to expose assumptions they may have about the topic (e.g., that interacting groups are more productive in brainstorming than are individuals) and then tell them that the activity will test their assumptions. However I introduce an exercise, the objective is for students to start in a state of curiosity and openness to the experience.</p>
<p>The memberships of the classroom groups rotate weekly, and I usually assign students to groups through a randomization process. This is more for the pedagogical reason of having students work with as many different classmates as possible, rather than for maximizing experimental control. Variability in group membership helps to maintain student interest and curiosity from week to week. In cases where group composition itself is one of the variables, I use a process suited to that activity. An example is a class on the effects of the personality variable of need for closure (NFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046496413488217">Pierro, Mannetti, DeGrada, Livi, &amp; Kruglanski, 2003</xref>). For that class, groups are assembled based on students’ scores on the NFC instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496413488217">Webster &amp; Kruglanski, 1994</xref>). Some activities may require students to take on certain roles such as, for example, assigning students with high vs. low NFC scores to be team leaders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1046496413488217">
<title>Instructions, running the exercise, and collecting data</title>
<p>A main objective in the conduct of each activity is to replicate the experimental conditions of the original research project, at least to the extent possible within the constraints of the class setting (e.g., time period, physical space, materials required). I glean as much detail as I can from the relevant publications and when possible request information directly from authors about how to instruct participants and manipulate independent variables, and what the physical arrangements, experimental materials, and timing should be.</p>
<p>In most of the exercises, the independent variables are manipulated through instructions or materials given to the groups. For example, different leadership style instructions are given to team leaders in the replication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin et al. (1939)</xref> research (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046496413488217">Table 1</xref>). I also take advantage of having a classroom with easily moveable furniture, which allows me to use the spatial configuration of the room to help manipulate the variables in some cases. This can enhance the Concrete Experience in dramatic ways. For example, in a prisoner’s dilemma exercise, I manipulate game strength (the cost or payoff for defecting) and place the groups in the classroom from front to back in order of increasing game strength. During the initial debriefing, we can then see how competitiveness changes from the front to the back of the room.</p>
<p>The data we collect focus on the experimental variables and the students’ experiences. Again, consider the exercise that replicates the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin et al. (1939)</xref> leadership style study. At the end of that exercise, all students (including group members and team leaders) complete questionnaires measuring their perceptions of and satisfaction with the leadership style and their team’s performance of the task. We also have objective measures of the quality of hotel that each group builds. Finally, we collect qualitative data for this exercise by photographing the groups while they work on their hotels.</p>
<p>I started taking the photographs when I noticed some characteristic patterns of nonverbal behavior that seemed to differ across groups operating under the three leadership styles. Students assigned to enact laissez-faire leadership often exhibit dejection, despondency, or boredom in their facial expressions and postures. They usually slump in their chairs and are physically separated from other members. Autocratic leaders, in contrast, usually display more active behavior, such as standing over other members and pointing their fingers as they give directions to the group. These leaders also tend to be physically separated from other group members. In sharp contrast, no special nonverbal behaviors or postures are generally apparent in the photographs of the democratic leaders. For example, if anyone is standing in these groups, then it is no more likely to be the leader than any other member. Indeed, it is often difficult to tell which member is the leader in many photographs of the democratic groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1046496413488217">
<title>Initial debriefing and preparation assignment</title>
<p>The initial debriefing never lasts more than about 10 min; my main objective is simply to trigger the start of the Reflective Observation process. I typically start the discussion in the same way that an experimental debriefing often starts, by asking people what they think the exercise is about. This is reasonable because it follows students’ natural curiosity. I usually reveal the variable manipulation during this initial discussion, but sometimes I ask the students to discover that manipulation for themselves through the reading assignment.</p>
<p>A secondary objective for the initial debriefing is to discharge any emotional energy that built up during the exercise. For example a competitive obstacle course exercise designed to illustrate the effects of transactive memory generates a great deal of excitement and often leaves the students in a state that borders on mania. I therefore usually begin the debriefing by just letting students brag or lament about how they did in the different parts of the obstacle course. As they calm down, I eventually direct their attention to the conceptual material related to transactive memory, explain the variables we manipulated, and end the class with a series of questions for them to answer in preparation for the next class meeting.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1046496413488217">
<title>Interim Preparation: Reflective Observation to Abstract Conceptualization</title>
<p>I have designed the course with an interval of 5 days between the first and second class in each module. During this time, students are given a reading assignment that includes the original research associated with our in-class replication, along with other materials meant to give a broader view of the topic, such as chapters in the textbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496413488217">Brown, 2000</xref>). During this interval, I also analyze the data that were collected and post the results (in graphical form) of that analysis on the class website. The preparation assignment includes questions about the readings and the data that stimulate students to reflect on their classroom experience and introduce relevant theoretical concepts.</p>
<sec id="section9-1046496413488217">
<title>Data analysis and presentation</title>
<p>Because the class is usually small and the classroom setting does not allow very strict experimental control, I do not expect to see statistically strong results. My focus instead is on trends in the data. Nevertheless, I always do some simple statistical analyses (e.g., <italic>t</italic> tests, correlations, one-way ANOVA) and try to organize any qualitative data into themes relevant to the topic of the exercise.</p>
<p>In some instances, I do not distribute all the data in advance for two main reasons. First, I may want to stimulate further curiosity and engagement among the students with the reading. This practice also serves to move the students toward Active Experimentation. The replication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin et al. (1939)</xref> leadership study provides a good illustration of this. Two learning objectives in that course module are to let students see the destructiveness of laissez-faire leadership and to sharpen their ability to distinguish this leadership style from a democratic style. Accordingly, much of the preparation assignment focuses on laissez-faire leadership, including a reading about the destructiveness of this style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046496413488217">Skogstad, Einarsen, Torsheim, Aasland, &amp; Hetland, 2007</xref>). I omit the laissez-faire data from the graphs posted on the website and ask the students in the preparation assignment to predict what those data would look like, based on their understanding of the Lewin et al. and Skogstad et al. readings. The full data set is later presented in class.</p>
<p>The second reason for omitting some of the data in advance is when those data might be sensitive or harmful. For example, students are not above engaging in a little name-calling in their open-ended responses to questions following the prisoner’s dilemma exercise. Posting such comments outside the setting of a supportive debriefing session runs the risk of hurt feelings. At the same time, I try to avoid censorship because I believe the integrity of the experiential learning model requires acknowledgement of the full range of students’ experiences and reactions. Accordingly I look for ways of presenting the students’ data that also avoid giving offense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1046496413488217">
<title>Student preparation assignment</title>
<p>I ask students to bring to class written responses to the preparation questions (generally 1 to 2 pages) and to use these notes during class discussions. Questions might ask students to define in their own words a central concept such as transactive memory or psychological entrapment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496413488217">Kameda &amp; Sugimori, 1993</xref>), based on their understanding of the reading, and to describe any evidence of that concept that they observed during the class exercise. Questions focused on the data typically ask students to compare the class data to the findings reported in the research paper. I often ask students to think of examples from their own experiences of the phenomenon we study. Specific choices about preparation questions are always tied to the learning objectives for the class module and to the larger goal of guiding students to extract abstract concepts from their concrete experiences during an exercise.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1046496413488217">
<title>Class No. 2: Abstract Conceptualization to Active Experimentation</title>
<p>The two main objectives in this discussion are to reinforce the relevant conceptual content, and to stimulate students’ thinking about practical applications of the concepts. I structure this class around the questions posed in the preparation assignment. The format of the class is a combination of lecture, small-group discussions, and whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>I might begin the discussion in the mode of Reflective Observation by asking the students to describe their experiences during the exercise. The amount of time I spend on this would depend on how far the initial debriefing in the previous class had progressed. As an example of how I typically run this class, for the leadership style exercise I start by asking members of groups in the different conditions to describe the behavior of their leaders and the effects of that behavior on their group. I also ask the leaders to describe how they felt. I begin to move the discussion in a more conceptual direction by offering some context about the seminal role of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413488217">Lewin et al. (1939)</xref> study in the literature on leadership. We review the key findings from that study and begin to compare them to our class data. I usually ask students to sit with their exercise groups and then, throughout the class period, ask them to discuss specific questions about the data, followed by sharing their conclusions with the whole class.</p>
<p>As the class goes on, I begin to focus on practical applications to stimulate Active Experimentation. Continuing the leadership exercise, for example, I ask students to reflect on their own experiences with different leadership styles. Because of my interest in teaching students about the destructiveness of laissez-faire leadership, I especially encourage students to tell stories of their own attempts at exercising democratic leadership, with an aim toward testing the extent to which the class module has sharpened the ability of students to distinguish between laissez-faire and democratic leadership styles. I have found that an effective variation on the structure of the debriefing class is occasionally to begin with a discussion of practical applications.</p>
<sec id="section12-1046496413488217">
<title>Null (and dull) results</title>
<p>Every semester, one or two of the exercises do not <italic>work</italic>. That is, no differences are found among the conditions, the findings are inconsistent with expectations, or the findings simply make no sense. I anticipate this problem by setting expectations on the first day of the course. I explain to students that a number of factors can produce such results. The students who take my course typically have a strong research methods background, so they can understand the data analytic problems associated with small sample sizes and other threats to validity, threats that are inevitable because a classroom setting cannot provide the same rigorous control as a laboratory.</p>
<p>When failures occur, I am frank about the results and do not make any apologies. Instead, I use the class discussion to speculate about the reasons for the failure, which can include idiosyncrasies of that semester’s class, students not following the directions, faulty operationalizations of the variables, or even the possibility that the theory is flawed. Often, in their written analyses, students offer remarkably thoughtful and insightful explanations for some of these failures. For example, in the leadership styles exercise one semester satisfaction levels within the laissez-faire groups were significantly higher than those in the democratic groups. One of the laissez-faire groups suggested in their paper that this happened because of the “accelerated motivation of group members to unite to reduce the overwhelming degree of ambiguity,” which may have led them to be “united to succeed in the task and, eventually [to develop] a great sense of pride in [their] work.”</p>
<p>One benefit of having collected data for several years is that I can share data from past semesters to illustrate the robustness of a particular phenomenon, such as the destructiveness of laissez-faire leadership. This is especially useful when an exercise has failed or has produced anomalous results. The practice of having students hypothesize about the reasons for unexpected results also represents the learning mode of Active Experimentation. It encourages students to test the boundaries of their knowledge, reinforces their understanding of context and contingencies, and strengthens their ability to apply concepts.</p>

<sec id="section13-1046496413488217">
<title>Additional Course Components</title>
<p>The basic course module concludes with a paper, written with the exercise groups, analyzing the experience through the use of the class data and the assigned readings, and discussing practical applications that can be extracted from the concepts and the experience. These papers reinforce the Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation segments of the learning cycle. Because the assignment asks students to include a description of the experience within their groups, the Concrete Experience mode is also stimulated, but to a lesser degree. Two other paper assignments that students complete individually, rather than in groups, ask them to discuss practical applications of course materials to either current events or from their personal experiences. These papers also follow the experiential learning cycle by asking students to start with a concrete experience, then reflect on what happened, and finally extract conceptual principles. The assignment stops short of asking students to engage in active experimentation. I also administer midterm and final examinations. The format of these examinations is a combination of multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions, and the content places a heavy emphasis on application of the concepts.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section14-1046496413488217">
<title>Evidence of Student Learning</title>
<p>The primary learning objective in this course is to improve students’ ability to connect theory and practice. Although the course is taught using an experiential format, it is not designed to be a skills course that would teach, for example, how to use specific decision-making techniques. Instead, the course is designed to help students master conceptual knowledge related to communication and decision making in groups. I believe learning how theory guides practice and how practice informs theory development will help student to learn how to develop their skills. I intend for this course to present students with a model of learning through experience.</p>
<p>The evidence of how well the course meets these objectives comes from several sources. One source is the written paper assignments, and another source is the students’ performance on the course examinations (especially responses to an essay question on the final examination asking students to discuss the most important things they learned in the class). A third source of evidence is students’ open-ended responses on the formal course evaluations. Finally, evidence for the long-term value of the course comes from an informal survey of students who took the course several years ago. These students were asked to share with me any lessons from the course that they have found helpful in their work lives. Across these different sources, evidence for student learning seems to embody three themes, namely, immediate impact, surprising insights, and enduring lessons.</p>
<sec id="section15-1046496413488217">
<title>Immediate Impacts</title>
<p>The qualitative comments on the semester course evaluations consistently indicate how much students say they have learned from the class. One theme is that the experiential and fun nature of the course makes it easy to learn the conceptual materials. I believe this is a key factor in the course’s high ratings each semester (range from 4.5 to 5.0 on a 5-point scale). Representative comments indicate that the course helped students to “follow complex material,” that it “makes it so much easier to retain the material,” that “it allows you to put the concepts into practice,” and that students “really understand how groups work.” Despite the fun, the class demands a great deal from students—the readings from the primary literature are challenging, and students must meet very high standards in their written papers. Students’ comments nevertheless suggest that the class structure motivates them to meet these challenges. For example, one student said, “This course was so well-structured. The professor made sure that students knew what they had to do to be successful.” Students, in fact, are largely successful in the class. The average semester grade for the course tends to be around A–, with a range of B– to A+.</p>
<p>The student paper assignments and exam question responses yield numerous anecdotes of how students have put into immediate practice the ideas that they learned in the class. Most commonly, students describe something they did in a meeting of one of their campus groups. A fraternity president, for example, said in one of his papers that
<disp-quote>
<p>The murder mystery exercise really opened my eyes. I realized that the way we selected our pledges last year was exactly what we talked about in class . . . This time, instead of letting the guys pick their top choices at the beginning of the meeting, I told them we were going to talk about each one . . .I think we have our strongest pledge class ever.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another example is a story from a student’s paper that described how the materials on intergroup relations helped her to understand a conflict that had developed within her high school swim team: “The whole thing degenerated to ingroups and outgroups. I wish I had known about superordinate goals. We should have concentrated on winning the meet!”</p>
<p>I often receive spontaneous e-mail messages from students who are excited about being able to draw an immediate lesson from the course. Consider for example, the following message, which a student sent to me during his first week in medical school (a semester after he took the course):
<disp-quote>
<p>Last Thursday our class engaged in its first small-group exercise, one in which groups of . . . students were tasked with deciding which disciplinary measures to impose on a hypothetical physician who made a life-threatening error . . . I was struck by how many aspects of the decision-making process were reminiscent of the material we covered in class, and I was able to help guide my team through our discussion by drawing on some of the concepts you taught . . . If our success in this exercise was any indication, I have no doubt that the tools you provided and the skills you helped cultivate will continue to aid me (and my colleagues) throughout our educations and future careers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1046496413488217">
<title>Surprising Insights</title>
<p>In their responses to the examination question about the most important things they learned from the course, students often mention surprises. They describe how these surprises constitute new information that has led them to revise their assumptions about groups. For example, students often enter the class convinced of the absolute importance and effectiveness of communication for group decision making. But their responses on the examination indicate that they have acquired a more nuanced view of communication, a view that includes an awareness that communication can retard productivity in face-to-face brainstorming (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496413488217">Diehl &amp; Stroebe, 1987</xref>), or that discussion sometimes is an ineffective means of information exchange (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046496413488217">Stasser &amp; Titus, 1985</xref>). As one student remarked, “The class on the hidden profile really shocked me. I will never approach a meeting in the same way now.”</p>
<p>Students are also surprised by the power in several of our exercises. They often express dismay over how easily students in a class can be made to conform to the majority viewpoint, and they say that the course made them more sensitive to this issue. Similarly, students are often impressed to learn how easily intergroup bias can be produced in the minimal group paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496413488217">Tajfel, Billig, &amp; Bundy, 1971</xref>). One student wrote on his exam that “The stuff we did on ingroups and outgroups reinforced my belief in the importance of communication. Our readings show that when people have a chance to talk to each other, they are not so biased.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1046496413488217">
<title>Enduring Lessons</title>
<p>Several years after taking the course, students often report experiencing further insights. Apparently, the course has provided them with lessons that they can continue to draw on in their work lives. For example, 3 years after taking the course, one student (in reference to the material on majority and minority influence) commented that “I am better equipped to understand the experience of members within different factions (i.e., those sharing a majority opinion and those supporting a minority stance) . . . as well as the consequences of those factions’ formation.” Another student, who took the course the first time it was offered, remembered what she learned about the information sharing and hidden profile material: “I . . . remember being surprised learning about the shared information bias . . . and find still that in many meetings, a lot of energy is focused on common information, instead of unshared information.” Three years after taking the course, yet another student was similarly affected by learning about information sharing and recognizing expertise in groups: “knowing where specialized knowledge lies within your organization is absolutely key. Throughout my experience I have seen projects fail and succeed based on the degree to which internal information was shared.” And the leadership material led another student to comment that
<disp-quote>
<p>We gained comprehensive insight into the phenomena that many of us experience everyday, but understand very little. Particularly now . . . I am exposed to different leadership styles and the nuances of groups—the good, the great, and the just plain aggravating; being able to draw from an understanding of their inner workings has proven hugely beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two years after taking the course another student made the following comments that illustrate his ability to integrate lessons drawn from multiple course modules:
<disp-quote>
<p>As I worked at [____] I always kept in mind how drastically the management style of immediate leaders can impact the direction, stability, and internal morale of a group. . . . Furthermore, I came to understand the power of transactive memory . . . I saw firsthand how my manager’s knowledge of the strengths of individual team members helped substantially during delegation, division of labor, training, etc. . . .One of the key takeaways from the class was an understanding of the value of unique and credible arguments in shifting the behavior of a group, and how to best apply that in a work environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, alumni of the course have also given examples of how the course materials affected not only their specific job performance but also their own personal development. Consider, for example, one person’s reflections 6 years after taking the course:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have been better able to: recognize implicit assumptions about how I operate in groups; realize several of my own personal strengths and weaknesses in group decision making; and also better recognize the types of group roles that are best suited for myself and other teammates. This has helped me act more efficiently and effectively in group settings, both in the workplace and organizing events and large get-togethers with friends. . . . Being more fully aware of the group decision making process has allowed me to develop a better idea of my own management strengths and weaknesses, which I believe in turn is molding me into a better leader.</p>

<title>Implementation Advice and Ideas for Future Development</title>
<p>If you are thinking about teaching a similar course, then the first and probably most important issue to consider is the fit of such a course with the overall curriculum at your school. By this, I mean your department’s general pedagogical objectives, how the course would be placed within the curriculum structure in your department, whether the course is consistent with your department’s underlying values, and so on. As described earlier, I began with a very clear vision for the fit of my course. The second, though equally important, issue is to have a clear set of principles that guide the design and conduct of the course. The principles underlying the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413488217">Kolb (1984)</xref> ELT framework were compatible with the culture of my department, but the rich literature on learning theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496413488217">Quay, 2003</xref>) may offer others with values that better suit your own environment. Third, a consistent and conscientious adherence to a clear set of principles is fundamental for maintaining the integrity of such a course and can help to protect it from being viewed as trivial. In the early days of my course, this issue arose in the form of remarks from colleagues about students “playing games” every week in my class. One look at the reading list (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1046496413488217">Table 2</xref>) quickly eliminated any such concerns, and my students’ enthusiasm spreads the reputation of the course as something substantive and challenging.</p>
<sec id="section19-1046496413488217">
<title>Practical Considerations</title>
<p>In addition to these broad issues, some pragmatic factors to be considered revolve around the topics to cover in a course like mine. The topics both determine and are determined by the required resources in terms of space, materials, time, and assistance. Consistent with my point about maintaining the integrity of the class, I think the substantive topics should be the primary consideration and that specific experiments that fit within resource constraints should then be chosen.</p>
<p>The order of the topics will be partly guided by the underlying course structure, and a further consideration should be the development of the class as a whole. I am careful to place toward the end of the semester those exercises that require a certain degree of trust, or that may produce negative emotions. In the prisoner’s dilemma exercise, for example, tempers can flare, feelings can get hurt, and feelings of betrayal can arise among students as a result of classmates’ defections. Having a healthy open discussion of this exercise is only possible after a certain rapport has been established within the classroom.</p>
<p>The choice of experiments to replicate will also depend on material and human resources. A budget for supplies certainly broadens the scope of activities that could be included in the course. Similarly, the availability of teaching assistants greatly increases not only the range of possible activities but also in some cases the amount of data that can be collected during a given activity. I am fortunate to have the help of two undergraduate teaching assistants (who have already taken the class). These TAs work closely with me on every aspect of the class, including setting up the classroom, entering the data, and working with the students on the preparation assignments. This class could be taught effectively even without teaching assistants, however, if less labor-intensive activities were chosen.</p>
<p>The method of assessing student performance should also be guided by the course’s underlying model, in terms of both the evaluation components and the content of those components. In my course, the evaluation components are the group exercise analysis papers, individual application papers, two examinations, and class participation. The content in all these cases focuses on how well the students have applied theory and concepts to the in-class experience and to real world examples. My primary consideration in choosing and designing these evaluation components is to stimulate Abstract Conceptualization and Active Experimentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1046496413488217">
<title>New Directions</title>
<p>I believe the greatest area of weakness in the course is in the implementation of the Active Experimentation phase of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413488217">Kolb (1984)</xref> learning cycle. Although it might be argued that the very act of doing actual experiments in the class strongly stimulates this learning activity, because the students are not fully aware of all the variables involved when they are immersed in the activity, they have not yet grasped the requisite knowledge for the process of transformation. Currently, Active Experimentation is addressed through the components of the course devoted to raising awareness of practical implications, specifically the in-class debriefing, and asking students to write about practical implications in their papers and on the exams. I believe this learning mode could be more effectively stimulated by activities involving informed practice, followed by a reflection on that practice. For example, I plan to try substituting for one of the individual application papers an assignment requiring students to experiment with a chosen behavior or technique.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>This article has focused on student learning, but I would like to conclude by sharing what students in the course have taught me over the past 7 years. First, I have learned to trust in the students’ natural curiosity. Without it, the course would never have gotten off the ground, let alone inspired me to experience more creativity in teaching than I ever thought possible. I have also come to realize that students will reciprocate my trust. Second, I have learned to be courageous. Some of the exercises involve high risks, but then can also create powerful learning experiences when they are successful. Having students’ trust helps me take such risks with confidence. Finally, students have taught me that it is okay to have fun in the classroom. In fact it is more than okay, as suggested by writings on the benefits of positive emotions in higher education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046496413488217">Clayton, Beard, Humerstone, &amp; Wolstenholme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046496413488217">Moore &amp; Nyiel, 2007</xref>). The students have affirmed for me that the struggle and tensions necessary for learning do not preclude experiencing joy.</p>
