<p>Family and household religious practices have largely been overlooked by Old Testament scholarship. The few forays into this field of study are often divided by methodology and focus. The present volume represents the culmination of over ten years of collaborative work by two exceptional biblical scholars in an attempt to unite the insights of religious-historical, gender oriented, and archeologically based investigations into Iron Age Israelite family religion. The overlapping, yet distinct specialties of Albertz and Schmitt combine to create an impressive achievement in the study of family and household religion in ancient Israel and the Levant.</p>
<p>Albertz opens the volume with the history of research (2–15), and methodological discussion orienting the study (21–56). Albertz surveys a myriad of evidence and conflicting scholarly voices concerning the size and boundaries of the Iron Age family in the ancient Levant before proposing that there were actually six types of households (41–45). The religion of the ancient Levant is then divided between the family, local, and state levels to account for internal religious pluralism (55).</p>
<p>Schmitt begins the exploration of the domestic cult in the third chapter by surveying 80 instances of cultic items discovered in 110 Iron Age domestic structures (74–172). Artefacts are classified according to religious or utilitarian functions (60–74), allowing Schmitt to identify clusters of cultic objects within the home. This strategy reveals that ritual objects were often clustered in designated kitchen facilities, thus indicating a relationship between early Israelite household religion and food preparation (172–175). The results are then compared with an equally extensive survey of archeological findings from Israel’s neighbors, revealing a strong religious continuity at the familial level in the West Semitic world (176–219). Schmitt expands his study in chapter four to include cultic places beyond the domestic realm. Schmitt delineates eight types of cultic places encountered in Iron Age Israel (224–239). The presence of common ritual and utilitarian artefacts in all types of cultic installations indicates the interdependence between the family, local, and state levels of religion (240). Permanent cultic fixtures were only found at the village, regional and state sanctuaries, which also evinced animal sacrifice and the possible presence of a priesthood (239–241).</p>
<p>Albertz next conducts an equally extensive study of theophoric personal names, in chapter five. He proposes that epigraphic evidence represents personal experience with the divine, which is typically associated with the birthing process (284–293, 335). He compares 2,922 occurrences of 675 Hebrew names with 1,397 occurrences of 895 names from neighboring nations, concluding that the names are functionally the same but reference different dominant deities (356–359). Schmitt ends the chapter by surveying evidence from iconographic stamp seals, identifying the presence of state religious symbols on personal items, further supporting the fluidity between family and state religion (386).</p>
<p>Schmitt then turns to the rites and rituals practiced in family religion. This includes rituals associated with the human life cycle such as marriage, birth and circumcision (388–399) as well as what calendar observances such as Passover, and the Sabbath, would look like at the familial level (399–403). In the seventh chapter Schmitt addresses the status of the dead in ancient Israelite thought (431), including mourning, burial (433–455), and commemoration practices (455–469). Albertz and Schmitt close the volume by concluding that “up to the 7th century B.C.E., the Israelite family and household religion … was quite similar to other family and household religions of the Levant” (495). They effectively link family religion with food preparation and consumption, and demonstrate a fluid interdependence between the family, local and state manifestations of religion.</p>
<p>Albertz and Schmitt combine an impressive amount of archeological data and scholarly research into this volume. More impressive still, is the transparency with which they present the information. The volume includes over 100 pages of tables, charts and appendixes enabling the reader to review the extensive evidence drawn upon by the authors. They openly acknowledge currently debated issues (16), and provide informative caveats of the complexities facing their study (59–60). The impressive research informs the reader of the current issues surrounding family and household religion in ancient Israel, but the transparency empowers the reader to arrive at informed conclusions, even if she should choose to disagree with the authors. I found places with which I disagreed with the volume, such as their reliance upon Biblical naming accounts without much consideration of the literary function names played in the biblical text (246), yet their inclusion of extensive names lists enabled me to clearly identify the ways in which I agreed and disagreed with their findings. The combination of the extensive research with the admirable transparency makes this a commendable textbook for the classroom. It will inevitably be a significant part of the conversation to come regarding family and household religion in ancient Israel and the Levant.</p>
