<p>One of the major components of the implicit contract between psychiatrists and society is assessment and management of risk in psychiatric patients. It is inevitable that this skill will be reviewed and questioned from time to time. Assessment of risk to self and to others not only raises questions of ethics and whether there is a single way of conducting these risk assessments. Inevitably, there will be variations in what patients choose to convey and what they choose to withhold. The balance between legal responsibilities and clinical management is important as far as clinicians are concerned. This volume has 13 chapters: following two chapters on violence risk assessment tools and use of measures of psychopathy, the book is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on child and juvenile risk and Part II on adult risk. The first chapter highlights the context in which risk assessments of violence is being conducted; it is important whether these contexts are legal, clinical or school/workplace. Three approaches to risk assessment are actuarial, structured professional judgement and anamnestic. The actuarial method uses quantifiable variables and can predict risk of violence with a high degree of reliability. Structured professional judgement involves the presentation of specified risk factors which are arrived at from a broad review of the literature. The anamnestic approach is seen as a process tool and focuses on applied behaviour analytic strategies. The goal of this process seems to identify risk factors and protective factors that recur across violent acts. Each of these approaches can answer key questions in risk assessment. Use of Psychopathy Checklist (PCL) measures is described at length in the following chapter. Three chapters on children and adolescents provide an overview of gender-specific childhood risk assessment tools – which have items for the family and children. Other structured professional tools are described, which take into account historical, social and individual risk factors and also protective factors. For adults, various tools are described with descriptions, the development of these tools and their limitations, with illustrations from case histories. The practising clinical psychiatrist will find enough material here to improve their practice. However, it would have been helpful if the editors had expanded further on racial/cultural/ethnic differences and the context of these factors in the social context.</p>
