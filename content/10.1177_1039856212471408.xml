<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>People with schizophrenia who are receiving long-term neuroleptic treatment are at a significant risk of gaining body weight, which subsequently leads to development of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212471408">1</xref></sup> This case report describes the recognition and treatment of OSA in a long-term rehabilitation patient suffering from schizophrenia, and the particular impact that OSA treatment has on memory.</p>
<p>Patient A is a 39 year old male diagnosed with schizophrenia and OSA. He was admitted for stabilisation of positive symptoms and rehabilitation of living skills (HONOS score 13). Upon admission, Patient A weighed 137 kg, with a blood pressure of 119/64 mmHg and pulse of 118/minute. Because Patient A was diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus, he commenced taking oral hypoglycaemics and eventually also required insulin therapy. Baseline neurocognitive assessment included a Brief Cognitive Status Exam (BCSE) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV). Six of the WMS-IV subtests were used to derive the following index scores: auditory memory, visual memory, visual working memory, immediate memory and delayed memory. Patient A was noted to snore loudly and suffer daytime sleepiness. His Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) was 19 out of a possible 24, indicating severe sleepiness that warranted a specialist’s attention. Although initially reluctant, he agreed to participate in sleep studies, after which he was diagnosed with OSA and commenced Continuous Positive Airway Treatment (CPAP). Patient A was started on clozapine (titrated to 425mg), following his failure to respond to other atypical antipsychotic drugs.</p>
<p>Patient A was referred to a specialist sleep centre. A diagnostic sleep study found he had severe sleep apnoea, with a nadir oxygen saturation of 59%, severe sleep fragmentation, and a respiratory disturbance index of 108 (the latter is the average number of apnoeas, hypopnea and other respiratory event-related arousals per hour, although normal is less than 5). CPAP was titrated to 20cm of water pressure, to achieve control of the patient’s OSA. Patient A was supported by staff during the introduction of CPAP; he commenced treatment readily. Compliance with ongoing treatment was more problematic, including maintenance of the CPAP machine. His return to daytime sleepiness was obvious after any shortfall in CPAP, often due to mask leaks. Rehabilitation staff engaged Patient A with motivational counselling and programmed activities. The test battery was repeated at three and six months after commencing his treatment. Patient A was regularly reviewed by the clinical team, he adhered to the clozapine-monitoring regimen and had appropriate diabetic-integrated care (medical review, podiatry review and eye review).</p>
<p>There was an immediate benefit in the patient’s level of daytime alertness, with an increased participation in rehabilitation activities (including sports). This was reflected in an ESS that improved to 7/24. Patient A’s positive symptoms were less distressing, but remained relatively constant throughout (HONOS 9). His ability to engage improved. Six months post treatment, his weight was 149.5 kg, blood pressure was 105/73 mmHg, and pulse was 117/min. No significant change in BCSE was observed between the three intervals, suggesting that the patient’s symptoms that are associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia remained constant. After controlling for practice effects, we found there was no significant improvement between the memory indices measured at intervals one and two; however, there was a significant improvement in the patient’s visual memory between intervals two and three, and intervals one and three (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). Also, there was a marginal improvement in the patient’s delayed memory, between intervals one and three. Patient A is now in transition into independent living. Particular effort has focused on transferring the patient’s CPAP skills into the community, with training of the support staff to assist him in CPAP use.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we often encounter patients with morbid obesity and consequently, OSA. This case is a reminder that it is worth considering an effective intervention of OSA, despite the presence of significant psychiatric disability in the patient. CPAP treatment of this patient led to a clinically-significant improvement in his ability to recall designs from memory and then draw them replicating the placement of the designs in the grid. Similarly, treatment led to a marginal improvement in the patient’s ability to recall information after a 20–30 minute delay. Increased patient alertness has assisted us in the rehabilitation process. It remains to be seen if these gains can translate to community care.</p>
