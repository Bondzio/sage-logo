<p>Selection of the correct resin – filler combination is important in achieving materials which have a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). A study of nanosilica-modified resin, in combination with silica fillers, allows low levels of CTE to be achieved. In this study, a novel curing agent, ytterbium triflate, is reported. This curing agent provides a stable catalyst system which can be used to create the viscous composite mixtures but has the facility of effective cure over a relatively narrow temperature range from 70 °C to 100 °C. A series of formulations were examined based on incorporation of fillers with nanoscale silica particles into either the pure resin or a resin which contained nanoscale functionalized silica particles. The filler incorporation leads to a significant increase in the glass transition temperature as determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The CTE was observed to be lower below <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> than above it. Changing the nanosilica particle size and distribution produced significant changes in the values. However, the CTE scaled according to the total silica content; and the values were in general lower than those calculated theoretically. The use of a highly functional o-cresol epoxy novolac demonstrated how increasing functionality raised the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and lowered the CTE, but the use of too high a post-cure temperature reversed this trend. Very good results were achieved using 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl, 3,4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate, which has a low viscosity and allowed high levels of silica to be readily achieved. This article indicates how the adjustment of the epoxy selected to be used as the base material and the type of silica particles used allows the values of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and CTE to be modified in a composite material.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464420711424003" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In a number of applications, it is desirable to have thermoset materials which have a low coefficient of thermal expansion coefficients (CTE). A composite, by its very nature, will have a CTE which reflects the proportions of the resin and filler in the material [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711424003">1</xref></bold>]. Studies of a range of composites have shown that the CTE can be predicted to lie between the upper and lower limits of the Schapery theory, which is based on the simple rule of mixing
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1464420711424003"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711424003-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>α<sub>c</sub></italic>, <italic>α<sub>f</sub></italic>, and <italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> are, respectively, the CTEs of the composite, filler, and matrix, respectively, and <italic>ϕ</italic> the volume fraction of the filler [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420711424003">2</xref></bold>]. The limits are dictated by the CTE of the filler, which has a value of 8.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> per °C for glass, and that of a typical thermoset resin which has a value of ~90 × 10<sup>−6</sup> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420711424003">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420711424003">4</xref></bold>]. In practice, the values observed depend on a series of complex factors which relate to the density of the polymer matrix and the volume fraction of low-CTE fillers which can be incorporated into the material. With the advent of nanoscale materials, the possibility arises in exploring the way in which small particle fillers may be used to achieve low values of CTE in composite structures. Deviations from the simple additivity relation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711424003">equation (1)</xref> have long been recognized [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420711424003">5</xref></bold>] and this article explores the effects of processing conditions on the observed values of CTE obtained with some novel nanocomposites.</p>
<p>In previous papers, the effects of clay nanoparticles on the rheological and thermal mechanical properties of various epoxy resin composites have been reported [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420711424003">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711424003">11</xref></bold>]. The addition of low levels of clay platelets is found to have a significant effect both on the rheology and thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>). The platelets are able to interact and significant increase of the viscosity is observed with levels as low as a few weight percents. Similarly, the glass transition increased in certain cases by several tens of degrees. However, in a number of cases, no enhancement was observed and this was attributed to the clay platelets inhibiting the formation of a dense matrix. In a recent paper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711424003">11</xref></bold>], we report the use of a novel curing system, ytterbium triflate, which introduces the possibility of a pseudo-latent type of cure for epoxy resins. The object of this article is to explore how it is possible to achieve materials with low CTE values by using various combinations of nanofillers and cure regimes.</p></sec>

<p>The characteristics of the resin and the fillers are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420711424003">Table 1</xref>. The catalyst, ytterbium triflate, was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich, UK. The materials were used as received. The epoxy resins were thoroughly degassed prior to mixing and after being mixed with the appropriate quantity of filler. The mixtures were in general stored overnight in a desiccator before catalysts were added and cure carried out. The cure was undertaken in an aluminium mould of dimensions; 10 × 10 × 2 cm<sup>3</sup>, which had been treated with a release agent and carried out in a vacuum oven which had been preheated to the required temperature. In order to avoid exotherms, certain materials were first cured at a lower temperature and then post-cured at a higher temperature. The cured films were then subjected to a series of thermal tests.

<sec id="sec4-1464420711424003"><title>2.2 Coefficient of thermal expansion</title>
<p>Measurements of CTE were carried out using a Mettler TMA 40 (Mettler-Toledo Limited, Leicester. A sample of dimension 1 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup> was heated from 30 °C to 250 °C at 20 °C/min, then cooled from 250 °C to 30 °C at 20 °C/min, and then held at 30 °C for 20 min, before being heated from 30 °C to 250 °C at 4 °C/min. The first and second runs were to relax the sample and erase any thermal history. The final run involves slowly increasing the temperature and allows determination of the glass transition temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and the expansion coefficients above and below it. Before the sample was inserted in the instrument, the quartz probe was zeroed. The sample was placed on the sample stage and the probe lowered to sit on top of the sample. The thickness of the sample was recorded for future calculations. The supporting software allows analysis of the gradient at a given temperature. Where the graphs indicated a linear CTE, an average value was calculated below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. Where the plots showed a marked curvature, the values are quoted at a specific temperature. The temperature calibration of the equipment was checked using indium and lead. The unit of CTE is ppm/ °C. The data reported are an average of a minimum of three experiments. Values were repeated until the deviation between individual measurements were less than ±2 ppm/ °C.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464420711424003"><title>2.3 Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis</title>
<p>The method used has been previously described. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) measurements were made using MKIII DMTA instrument (Polymer Laboratories, Church Stretton, UK). The samples were of dimensions 5 × 6 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> and cut from the original plaques using a diamond saw. Temperature scans were performed over a temperature range from −100 °C to +230 °C, at frequency 1 Hz, strain ×4, and scanning rate 4 °C/min. The samples were clamped with a torque of 40 Nm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1464420711424003"><title>2.4 Strathclyde curometer</title>
<p>The change in viscosity was measured as a function of time using the Strathclyde curometer [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420711424003">12</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711424003">13</xref></bold>]. A small glass vial containing the sample was held in an oil bath. The temperatures of the oil bath and the sample were adjusted and maintained isothermally during the period of the cure. The paddle probe was lowered into the sample and operated at a frequency of 2 Hz and amplitude ~500 mm. The sensor output is the amplitude and phase of the probe motion, which is directly related to the viscosity changes occurring in the sample. The amplitude of the motion of the probe which is coupled to the driver by a spring is damped due to viscosity. If <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are the instantaneous displacements of the oscillatory driver and the response of the system damped by the curing liquid, then

where <italic>k</italic> is the spring constant coupling the driver to the probe, <italic>η</italic> the shear viscosity of the fluid, and <italic>A</italic> the geometric factor related to the probe contact area. Separating real and imaginary parts of the complex probe motion, one obtains

</p>
<p>Using the above equations, it is possible to calculate the shear viscosity from the in-phase and quadrature coefficients. The data were recorded using Picolog software package. The gelation was taken as the point at which the viscosity of the material reaches a value of 10<sup>4</sup> Pa s.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1464420711424003" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this article, cure of the epoxy resins was achieved using a cationic catalysed cure system based on ytterbium (Yb) triflate (11). This cure system is very efficient at high temperatures, while at low temperatures, the activated mixture can be stable for many hours/months. A catalysed sample was stored in a refrigerator for a period of 6 months and it was found that there was no increase in its viscosity or loss of its reactivity. A preliminary study of the effects of temperature and catalyst concentration on the cure characteristics of one of the epoxy – EEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711424003">Fig. 1</xref>). The in-phase displacement reflects the motion of the probe as this is directly coupled to the spring. The out-of-phase displacement measures the phase shift of the driver against the probe and is a reflection of the energy dissipation in the spring which is itself a measure of the energy dissipation in the fluid.
<fig id="fig1-1464420711424003" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Plot of the in phase {left axis} and out of phase displacement {right axis} as a function of time for cure reactions carried out at: (▪) −100 °C, (•) −110 °C, (▴) −120 °C, and (▾) −130 °C. The units are arbitrary as they related to the spring used</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711424003-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Increase in the temperature of the cure produces a shift of the peak in the out-of-phase displacement and a coincidental drop in the in-phase displacement at shorter times. The drop in the in-phase displacement is a reflection of the increase in the viscosity of the media and the peak in the out-of-phase displacement a consequence of the growing viscoelastic nature of the media. Gelation of the material corresponds to a point close to the peak in the out-of-phase displacement and this can be used to assess the effect of temperature on the cure. The point at which the in-phase displacement approaches the baseline coincides with vitrification of the material. The breadth of the peak reflects the time taken to transform from a gel to a glassy state. A plot of the variation of the gelation time against reciprocal temperature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711424003">Fig. 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-1464420711424003" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Plot of gelation time against reciprocal temperature (K<sup>−1</sup>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711424003-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The plot demonstrates a simple Arrhenius type of behaviour and the activation energy was calculated from the slope of the curve and found to be 101 ± 3 kJ/mol. A study was undertaken in which the concentration of the Yb triflate was varied from 0.08 to 0.15 phr and it was found that the activation energy remained essentially constant.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1464420711424003"><title>3.1 Incorporation of platelet fillers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711424003">Equation (1)</xref> is purely based on volume fraction and it may be argued that nanoscale platelet fillers may in principle be able to reduce the CTE to a greater extent that would be predicted on the basis of their volume fractions. Two types of platelet fillers were studied: organically modified clay – Cloisite 30B and glass flakes with nanoscale thickness. The primary concern addressed in this study was whether the filler has any effect on the cure of the resin.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1464420711424003"><title>3.2 Organically modified clay-containing material</title>
<p>For this study, Cloisite 30B was selected as this has been found in previous studies [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420711424003">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711424003">11</xref></bold>] to be one of the most easily dispersed organically modified clays. Cloisite 30B contains methyltallow dihydroxyethyl ammonium ion and has platelets which are ~1 nm thick and 1000 nm long. The epoxy EEC was selected for study and a mixture containing 3 wt% of Cloisite 30B was prepared and sonicated for a period of ~30 min to achieve optimum exfoliation of the clay platelets. The sample was then allowed to equilibrate overnight. To this dispersion 0.10-phr Yb triflate dissolved in ethanol was added and the mixture stirred at 80 °C and degassed. A sample was then analysed in the curometer and it was observed that no significant reaction had occurred after 22 h at 100 °C. Attempts to achieve cure were carried out at higher temperatures but were unsuccessful and the system showed evidence of degradation occurring and the emission of acrid fumes. The clay is modified with a quaternary ammonium salt. The degradation temperature of Cloisite 30B is ~174 °C, which would imply that under the conditions used for the cure, no loss of the quaternary ammonium slat would be expected. Thermal degradation of these organic modifiers has been shown to produce aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and amine-containing residues, and evolve ammonia and carbon dioxide. A study of the degradation products was not undertaken but it was clear that the presence of the Yb triflate was able to catalyse the degradation at temperatures of the order of 130 °C over a period of time. Increasing the catalyst level to 0.20 phr allowed partial cure to be achieved in 23 h. Cure was also attempted using nanomodified resins and while some degree was achieved in all cases, significantly longer gelation times were observed compared with the pure resins. It was concluded that the clay was effectively inhibiting the cure. Since the Yb salt has to dissociate for the active site to initiate polymerization, adsorption at anionic sites on the clay would effectively inhibit polymerization. To test this hypothesis, the catalyst level was increased to 0.3 phr and the gelation time reduced to ~4.6 h, but only after the temperature had been successively raised to 140 °C and then 160 °C, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711424003">Fig. 3</xref>). The in-phase displacement is the top curve, which falls with increase in time and the out-of-phase displacement increases and then falls with increasing time.

<sec id="sec10-1464420711424003"><title>3.3 Vermiculite</title>
<p>A sample of 2.0 wt% of vermiculite (Phyllosilicate) in EEC was prepared and stirred with a high-speed mixer (Ultra Turrax) for 1 h. Vermiculite is known to be easily exfoliated and interestingly satisfactory cure was achieved. This implies that the inhibition effects observed are peculiar to the Cloisite clays.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1464420711424003"><title>3.4 Nano-glass fake</title>
<p>In principle, glass will not have the same ability to bind cations as clay and hence nano-glass flakes should not exhibit the problems encountered with Cloisite. A mixture of 6.4 wt% glass flake was stirred at 100 °C and allowed to stand overnight. The suspension was unstable and it was clear that precipitation of the glass was slowly occurring. The Yb catalyst was added but the mixture rapidly became viscous; but cure was only achieved after 6 h. It is apparent that if the mixture has a high initial viscosity as a consequence of the filler addition, this inhibits the subsequent cure. This effect can be attributed to the nature of the polymerization process in which diffusion of the oxirane to the active site is required for propagation of the polymerization. If the platelets interact with the catalyst, then the polymerization will be inhibited.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1464420711424003"><title>3.5 Samples containing silica 0.5 µm</title>
<p>To achieve the loading levels required by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711424003">equation (1)</xref> to reduce the CTE to a low level, it will be necessary to increase the filler level significantly above those used above. To maintain a low viscosity for processing, the filler must be in a near-spherical form. A mixture was prepared which contained 20 g EEC and 10 g of silica 0.5 µm. The large silica particles in the low-viscosity resin tend to separate out. To prevent sedimentation, 2 g Aerosil 90 was added. This significantly increases the viscosity, suppresses sedimentation, and increases the total silica content to 37.8 wt%. This mixture has a gelation time of 7.3 min. Addition of silica does not lead to the inhibition effects observed with the platelet materials. Examination of the curometer curves for the cure of materials which contained silica 0.5 µm and with added nanosize silica, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711424003">Fig. 4</xref>, indicates that the cure is influenced by the viscosity of the media. The initial rise in the out-of-phase displacement is similar to that for the simple resin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711424003">Fig. 1</xref>; however, after the peak, it drops rapidly, indicating a rapid rise in viscosity after gelation and the system is rapidly transformed to a glass state. The glassy state is indicated as the point at which the in-phase displacement becomes close to zero.

<sec id="sec13-1464420711424003"><title>3.6 Addition of nanosilica</title>
<p>Two possible routes are available for the incorporation of nanosilica, either as <italic>in situ</italic> created nanodispersion and available as a modified resin or as preformed particles which may then be dispersed in a normal resin.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1464420711424003"><title>3.7 Modified resins</title>
<p>Ranges of modified resins are now available which contain up to 60 wt% of nanosilica particles which have been created <italic>in situ</italic> and have viscosities comparable to the unmodified resins. Since these modified resins contain up to 60 wt% of nanosilica, they provide a route for the increase of silica fillers and hence lowering of the CTE. A study of Nanopox A610, which is the EEC modified with 20 nm silica particles was undertaken. As with the study with the pure resin, measurements were made at various temperatures between 100 °C and 160 °C and a linear plot similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711424003">Fig. 2</xref> was obtained. The activation energy was also investigated as a function of the catalysts loading between 0.08 and 0.15 phr and found to be independent of loading. A value of the activation energy of 76 ± 4 kJ/mol was obtained, which is significantly lower than the that of the pure resin 101 ± 3 kJ/mol. Clearly, the Nanopox catalyses the reaction. The <italic>in situ</italic> creation of the nanoparticles involves growth using a sol–gel process. The size of the particles is controlled by the incorporation of an organically modified silane and this allows the introduction of functional groups into the surface of the particles. Aiding the development of the interface with the resin incorporation of oxirane functionalities is desirable and these may in part account for the higher reactivity of these modified resins compared with their normal counterparts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1464420711424003"><title>3.8 Addition of nanosilica</title>
<p>A range of nanosilica fillers are available and can be added to the resin to further increase the silica loading. The silica investigated in this study was Aerosil OX50. The silica in this form has nominally the same size as that in the particle-modified resin but will require to be dispersed. The cure curves obtained were however markedly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711424003">Fig. 5</xref>). Whereas in the case of the <italic>in situ</italic> generated nanosilica particles, the out-of-phase displacement drops rapidly after passing through the peak, in the case of the Aerosil OX50, there is a much slower drop, implying that gelation is followed by a slow transition to a vitrified form. The functionality of <italic>in situ</italic> grown nanoparticle surface can generate a rigid matrix by further reaction with the resin; in the case of the Aerosil OX50 particles, no such reactions appear to be possible and the matrix slowly moves to a completely cured form. It was however noted that increasing the Aerosil OX50 content significantly decreases the time to gelation, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420711424003">Table 2</xref>.

<p>Increasing the temperature from 100 °C to 130 °C leads to the decrease in the cure time from 170 to 8 min. Increasing the volume of Aerosil OX50 in the blend, while reducing the volume of Nanopox A610 leads to a decrease in the gelation time. While the Nanopox A610 would be expected to promote the transition from gelation to vitrification, the Aerosil OX50 raises the base viscosity, which will enhance the exothermic effects of the reaction leading to a shortening of the gelation time. A surprising result was the observation of a reduction in the gelation time with a decrease in the Yb triflate level. The cationic cure of epoxy resins involves a chain-like process and as such lowering the catalyst level will decrease the initiation level, but by analogy with free radical propagation process can lead to an increase in the chain length of the species created, which will raise the rate at which the viscosity increases. The increase in viscosity will increase the exotherm and hence shorten the gelation time. These observations emphasize the different ways in which the nanosilica particles interact with resin and are involved in the total cure process. The addition of the Yb triflate in ethanol required the mixture to be degassed; however, when the Yb catalyst is added using methyoxymethanol, the viscosity was lowered and did not require degassing and the gelation time changes was approximately halved by changing to methoxymethanol, which is a better solvent for the catalyst.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1464420711424003"><title>3.10 Influence of the resin matrix</title>
<p>The thermal expansion of the resin makes a significant contribution to the total CTE. A series of different resin systems were investigated, which included o-cresol novolac epoxy, bisphenol A, and <italic>N,N</italic> diglycidyl-4-glycidylaniline; the latter being used to influence the cross-link density of the matrix. As with EEC, the addition of Aerosil OX50 leads to a reduction of the cure time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464420711424003">Table 4</xref>). The o-cresol novolac has a functionality of ~2.7 and in principle is capable of forming a highly cross-linked matrix. While this system showed normal gelation and vitrification behaviour, it was found that the degree of cure was low and that post-cure was required in most cases. This observation is consistent with the idea that the highly branched epoxy resin can form a gel relatively easily but that completion of the reaction may be a relatively slow process and require additional energy. The Aerosil OX50 produced the expected acceleration of the gelation as did the use of Nanopox A610. The latter being a low molecular weight bifunctional epoxy acts a little like a reactive diluent, lowers the viscosity and aids the reaction and achieves a higher degree of cure. The Nanopox A410 which has a bisphenol A base resin was blended with the novolac as a 50/50 wt% mixture to reduce the viscosity and reduce the requirement for post-cure. The data obtained are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464420711424003">Table 4</xref>.

<p>When the Aerosil OX50 is added to a 50/50 mixture of the novolac and Nanopox A410 – bisphenol A resin, the cure is inhibited and the gel time increases dramatically. However, increase in the level of catalysts from 0.12 to 0.3 phr reduces the cure time to values, which are comparable to those found in the blend without the Aerosil OX50. This inhibition effect is particularly marked since addition of the Aerosil OX50 significantly reduces the total amount of resin present in the mixture.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1464420711424003"><title>4 SUMMARY OF CURE DATA</title>
<p>The above study indicates how changes in the initiator level can be used to change the gelation and vitrification times in a controlled manner. The other feature emerging from the study is the impact which the surface modification incorporated in the <italic>in situ</italic> growth of the silica particles in the Nanopox resins has on the cure process. The particles are able to catalyse the reaction, lower the activation energy, and shorten the gelation time. These particles also significantly shorten the time between gelation and vitrification and lead to asymmetric out-of-phase displacement curves. The functionalized nanosilica particles are sufficiently well dispersed to add an insignificant amount to the viscosity of the base resin. In contrast, the similarly sized nanosilica particles interact sufficiently in a strong manner during the dispersions leading to a very significant increase in the viscosity. The enhancement in the viscosity arises from the formation of chains of particles at a nanolevel. The increased viscosity slows the propagation reaction and increases the time between gelation and vitrification. The use of a small amount of methyoxymethanol as a dispersion solvent for the catalyst aids the reaction but also helps dispersion of the nanosilica and lowers the viscosity. The incorporation of platelet-type fillers effectively inhibits the cure of this system. A mixture of 1005 Nanopox A610 with Aerosil OX50 which had a total silica content of 44.44 wt% was observed to undergo cure without the addition of Yb triflate, which implies that there is the possibility of surface-activated catalyst of the epoxy auto-catalytic process. The initiation of the auto-catalytic process suggests that the surface contains active hydroxyl groups. The reduced activation for cure is consistent with this observation.</p></sec>

<p>The observed CTE below the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> for the Nanopox A610 is lower than that predicted on the basis of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711424003">equation (1)</xref>. The Nanopox A610 consists of sol–gel particles which are surface functionalized and hence it would be expected that during the cure reaction, the silica particles will be able to act as cross-links in the matrix. The incorporation of the functionalized silica increases <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> from a value of 162 °C for the base EEC resin to a value of 200 °C for the combined resin with a total loading of 40 wt% silica. Aerosil OX50 contains 40 nm hydrophilic silica particles, has a low surface area of 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and does not readily form agglomerates. The Aerosil OX50 was incorporated into both the Nanopox A610 and the EEC in an attempt to increase the total silica loading, and the data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1464420711424003">Table 6</xref>. Number of formulations were repeated and the cure conditions varied slightly. At the 57 wt% total silica loading, the CTE below <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> is 31 ppm/ °C, which is significantly lower than the calculated values. Increasing the total silica content has decreased the CTE to a value which is 0.35 of that of the resin. The Aerosil OX50 is produced by an aqueous sol–gel process and will have OH surface functionality, but this will be different from the functionalities on the particles in the Nanopox A610.

<p>However, the Aerosil OX50 appears to be achieving reductions in the CTE of the resin which are comparable to the <italic>in situ</italic> dispersed Nanopox A610 resin. A number of formulations were prepared in which the EEC and the Nanopox A610 were combined in various proportions. A series of samples with a total silica content of 57.12 wt% were prepared and slightly different processing conditions used. While there are variations in the values observed, an averaged value of 35 ppm/ °C is lower than the theoretical prediction; however, the values of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> were low. The sample with the highest silica content, 62.48 wt%, showed the lowest value of CTE at 31 ppm/ °C, but surprisingly <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> was not as high as that observed with lower levels of silica. It is possible that at the highest loadings, the ability for the matrix to be completely cross-linked will become limited and this will be reflected in lower values of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. Two alternative hydrophilic Aerosil samples were studied; Aerosil 200, which has a particle size of 12 nm but a surface area of 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, is a grade used for controlling the rheology of fluids and Aerosil 90 which has a particle size of 20 nm and a surface area of 90 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The Aerosil 200 has a tight particle distribution size similar to that of Aerosil OX50 but with a slightly larger mean diameter, whereas Aerosil 90 has both a large mean diameter and a broader particle size distribution. The data obtained are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1464420711424003">Table 7</xref>. The Aerosil 200 with the Nanopox A610 gives a value which is close to the theoretically predicted value, while with pure EEC, it gives a significant lowering of the CTE. The high surface area and the hydrophilic functionality of the surface may allow favourable packing to be achieved. While Aerosil 200 showed a significant enhancement of the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> at 45 wt% loading, the CTE was not significantly lower than the theoretically predicted value. Using the large size and broad particle distribution, Aerosil 90 gives little enhancement of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and relatively high values of the CTE. This implies that the particles are not forming a significantly improved network or packing together effectively to enhance the composite structure.

<p>If the cross-link density in the resin matrix is a controlling factor, then the use of a highly functional epoxy, <italic>N,N</italic> diglycidyl-4-glydylaniline, has the potential of increasing the cross-link density. An addition of 0.36 wt% of this tri-functional epoxy to the resin formed from Nanopox A610 and Aerosil OX50 produced CTE values 33 ppm/ °C below <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and 99 ppm/ °C above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and a <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of 208 °C at a total silica loading of 56.98 wt%.

<p>The value of the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> for the o-cresol epoxy novolac varied significantly with cure conditions. Post curing the pure resin at 130 °C causes an increase from an initial low value of 86 °C to a value of 146 °C and on further increasing the post-cure temperature, a value of 185 °C was achieved. Increasing <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> causes a corresponding decrease in the CTE below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>, except that the final post-cure appears to have increased the CTE. It has previously been observed that heating epoxy resins above 150 °C can lead to ether bond scission, and in this case, a reduction in the degree of cross-linking with a commensurate increase in the CTE [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464420711424003">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711424003">15</xref></bold>]. A sample with Aerosil OX50 having a total silica content of 23.06 wt% had a <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of 184 °C, and CTE values 53 and 152 ppm/ °C, respectively, below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. This material was very viscous and it was difficult to achieve higher silica loadings. To reduce the viscosity and increase the silica content, Nanopox A510 was blended as a 10 wt% component with the novolac and this increased the silica level to 33.31 wt%. The <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of this blend was 174 °C but there was a slight reduction in the CTE values 45 and 130 ppm/ °C, respectively, below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. Addition of Aerosil OX50 increases the silica content to 50.72 wt%, leading to a reduction of the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> to 117 °C but did achieve a reduction of the CTE values to 37 and 121 ppm/ °C, respectively, below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. Addition of Nanopox A610 to the novolac produced a <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> value of 184 °C at 29.98 wt% loading and CTE values of 54 and 138 ppm/ °C below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. A 50/50 wt% blend of novolac and Nanopox A510, which is the bisphenol matrix with added Aerosil OX50, gave CTE values CTE 50 and 160 ppm/ °C below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> at 20 wt% silica loading and 34 and 123 ppm/ °C below and above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> at 46.5 wt% silica. The <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of the latter material was 175 °C. Surprisingly, the novolac resin did not produce significantly lower values of CTE than those obtained using the EEC cure system.</p></sec></sec>

<p>The study of a range of different polymer systems containing a combination of <italic>in situ</italic> dispersed nanoparticles and added nanofillers indicates that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711424003">equation (1)</xref> is broadly followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420711424003">Fig. 6</xref>). While the values for Aerosil 90, which is the broad distribution material, are above the theoretical line, the narrow distributions of nanofillers Aerosil OX50 and Aerosil 200 produce values which are below the theoretical line. The best results are obtained when the low surface area Aerosil OX50 is combined with the nanofilled resin, Nanopox A610. This blend of nanoparticles and reactive functionality produces the highest values of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and the lowest values of CTE. This material is relatively easy to mix and cure and has the potential of being used as a composite material for applications that require low CTE. The o-cresol epoxy novolac, although in principle able to achieve a higher cross-link density and by implication a lower CTE above <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>, showed that improvements were only obtained by careful selection of the filler size and also post-cure temperature.
