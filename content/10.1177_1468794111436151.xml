<p>Pranee Liamputtong is a professor in a School of Public Health, and has published a number of other methods books and studies about health in Southeast Asia. Nowhere does it state that the readership for this book is health policy researches, but the publication of this book only makes sense if this is assumed to be the case.</p>
<p>The opening chapter introduces the notion of cross-cultural research, emphasizing researchers having diverse cultural identities. The author positions herself in this category, and contrasts her vision of cross-cultural research with ‘exploitative’ anthropological research. Instead she advocates that research should be founded on ‘healing methodologies’ and ‘relational ethics’. She claims that qualitative methods books have neglected to pay enough attention to cultural sensitivity, and that this book will rectify the problem. Other chapters cover topics that one might expect in a book about qualitative research: moral and ethical responsibilities, research subjects, cultural sensitivity, insider-outsider perspectives, cross-cultural communication and language, testimony, action research and, also, writing and dissemination. The writing is very clear, and presents standard ideas in an accessible way for someone who has never thought about cultural difference. Occasionally this produces starkly self-evident statements, such as ‘Language barriers tend to be the main problem for most people who do not speak English’ (p. 60). This is a textbook and includes exercises and reading lists for each chapter. It is occasionally unclear how relational the research it advocates will be in practice. For example, in the exercise for the chapter entitled ‘Local knowledge. Local power and collective action’, the participant in the tutorial is instructed to carry out research on malaria and tuberculosis in one local area: ‘You want them to change their living situations as you know that living conditions contribute to these illnesses’(p. 209). Where the participatory local knowledge is in this researcher-driven exercise is unclear. This is one among a number of instances where stark intervention trumps ‘caring ethics’, and belies a more conventional approach to applied research than the rhetoric would suggest.</p>
<p>There are two general problems with this book, which obstructed my appreciation of this work. First, the book claims to be breaking epistemological ground by dismissing anthropology as an outmoded discipline that has left the field open for a new definition of cross-cultural research, although the author’s critique is minimal and unsubstantiated. Any anthopologist who reads this book will marvel at its silences: on anthropology’s self-critique of its colonial past since the early 1970s, the concept of reflexivity, the debates about ‘anthropology at home’ in the 1980s and, for the target audience of this book, developments in medical anthropology. These are well-established fields of debate and enquiry that now extend beyond anthropology across the field of qualitative research in social science, and that invalidate the claim of this book to be presenting a new idea of cross-cultural research.</p>
<p>The second problem is the title. It will be clear from my comments that I have a background in anthropology, not applied social studies or social policy. Why was I asked to review this book? Because the title indicates that it is about <italic>performing</italic> cross-cultural research. I had hoped to learn something new about performativity in the research process, but it very quickly became clear that ‘performing’ is used as a synonym for ‘doing’ or ‘conducting’ research. At one point the author speaks of performing rituals during her search to establish her credentials and not endanger the subjects (p. 40). While this is interesting, it is nothing more unusual than what anthropologists do using participant-observation. Otherwise, performance is addressed specifically in the sections about disseminating research findings through the use of theatrical performance, applied theatre, and photovoice exhibitions in the closing chapter; again at a very general and introductory level.</p>
<p>Had this book been titled <italic>Cross-Cultural Research for Health Researchers</italic>, it would have been reviewed by someone with an interest in a quick and extremely simple fix for readers with no background in social research or cultural awareness. This is who the book is for, and it needs to be marketed as such, and the publishers could be criticized for using an extremely misleading title and for not identifying the target readership clearly on the back cover.</p>
<p>What differentiates this book are the many examples drawn almost uniquely from research into health care across a range of regions. It also provides a useful bibliography of 21st century applied health research. This is why I make the assumption that the future health care researchers with an absence of any prior training in social science, so basic is the level of discussion. This book provides a starting point, but its projected readers will need to travel much further intellectually before being let loose in the community to conduct research. Any student who wishes to understand the subtleties and complexities both of qualitative research and its methodological ramifications is advised to read a recent medical anthropology monograph to understand the complexity of cultural variations in the sphere of health. We need to beware of throwing the baby out with the bath water as we enter the post-discipline era and, in the UK, the end of funding for the teaching of social sciences in higher education.</p>
