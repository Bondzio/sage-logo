<p>The book is primarily aimed at students and those training to be probation officers however it is the link between everyday probation practice and a debate about values in probation that makes the book of interest to a wider audience. The author is a well known academic in this field who is a former probation officer. He is currently Professor and Head of Research into Community and Criminal Justice at De Montfort University in Leicester. </p>
<p>Throughout the book the author returns to the following key statement as a touchstone:
<disp-quote>
<p>It will be argued throughout that the value of probation consists above all of what it represents and stands for – especially the values of social inclusion and a belief in the possibility of personal change (p. 4).</p>
</disp-quote>The book is broken down into sixteen chapters. The majority look at the key areas of probation work such as the supervision of offenders, public protection, probation history, probation values, punishment and sentencing and the governance of probation. Additionally there are welcome sections on community service, work with victims, work in prison, and a section on international perspectives. Each chapter charts the history and state of development of the subject area and concludes with an assessment by the author. The chapters conclude with a series of questions for further discussion and a short section highlighting further reading.</p>
<p>For me the heart of the book was the chapter entitled ‘Probation Values, Justice and Diversity’. The author starts by defining values and then looking at probation and social work values. He considers the emergence of community justice, anti-discriminatory practice, diversity approaches and power relations. He finishes by outlining a rights based statement for the values of probation in which fourteen areas of ethical concern are values. These are grouped into four areas. The first is human rights, for example, believing in the possibility of human change, self determination, consent and consultation; the second effective practice, for example, constructive and not punitive interventions, regard to the rights and interests of the offender even when interests of others take priority and the use of lawful punishment. The third area is social inclusion and he outlines the importance of fair access to services and the importance of partnership working with key agencies. The fourth theme links the values to those in a wider society and includes respecting the rights and interests of victims, being open and transparent with the wider community and the importance of evidence led practice. The author argues that some of these values are deeply held by probation staff and have enabled them to survive various attacks on the practice of probation. </p>
<p>I found three further chapters of interest as the author explored areas rarely discussed in academic literature. The section on community service starts by exposing the contradictory demands of the sentence: is it punishment or rehabilitation or reparation or re-integration? He charts how these four factors are continually played out in the policy and delivery of community service leading to confusion for front-line staff and courts. He suggests that as the language to describe community service has changed, the focus has been on the punishment aspect but the actual task that is carried out in communities, remains both reparative and rehabilitative. The fourth element of re-integration is sadly not to the fore in current policy making. The author suggests that the original intention of community service to be an alternative to custody has not taken place as the sentence is now one of the key sentences for those whose offence puts them in the community sentence band.</p>
<p>The section on probation and prison explores the role of probation staff in prison. He outlines that the presence of probation staff in prison has done little to reduce the growth of the prison population and that the focus of prison probation work has moved away from rehabilitation and resettlement towards risk management with offenders. He argues that probation needs to look at its ethical base for working in prison with a shift to a focus on the prisoners’ rights to rehabilitation as well as risk management.</p>
<p>The chapter on work with victims sets out the history of victim engagement with the criminal justice system, takes the reader through ‘what does society owe the victim’, and looks at the work of probation with the crimes of victims. He chronicles the work many probation staff undertook in the early days of Victim Support and looks at the rise of the victim liaison role. The chapter then looks at restorative justice approaches and is a timely examination of offenders as victims. The author concludes by highlighting, as others have done, that probation’s work with victims sits uneasily with the mainly offender focused remit of the staff. </p>
<p>The book is an interesting read. It balances the need to give some basic information to the student audience with a wider debate that has probation values at its heart. The book is thorough in its examination of the equality and diversity agenda. This analysis provides a strong argument for why probation practice in England and Wales will survive despite budget cuts and the commissioning and managerialist agenda. </p>
