<p>Kaixiangong, the Chinese village about which Fei Xiaotong published <italic>Peasant Life in China</italic>, the first indigenous ethnography by a Chinese researcher later trained in the West, has always been the target of scholarly traffic since China launched her reforms. The book by Xiangqun Chang is an analytical report about a follow-up research which is explicitly put into the context of Fei’s seminal work. A student of Fei herself, she pursues a related aim: to develop a synthesis between indigenous and ‘Western’ aka international or mainstream research conceptualizations of Chinese social structure. For this, both scholars rely on Chinese terms: Fei coined a Chinese neologism, <italic>chaxugeju</italic>, in order to describe a particular pattern of graded personal relationships with universalistic scope, while Chang uses a Confucian expression from the Book of Rites, <italic>li shang wanglai</italic>, common also in indigenous usage, which she transforms into <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> and then uses as an analytical term. The book title puts this new term in contrast with the (in)famous term <italic>guanxi</italic>, which plays a certain, for some researchers central role in conceptualizations of Chinese social interaction. However, as such, the book title seems partly misleading because the book is a full-scale ethnography of Kaixiangong, centred around the concept of <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic>. In her book <italic>guanxi</italic> has been treated as one type of interactions (<italic>wanglai</italic>). The question whether <italic>guanxi</italic> is an alternative concept with equal analytical power or not plays only a marginal role; and it is relatively straightforward to decide. This is because the villagers themselves use it in a way that is also supported by many views in research: <italic>guanxi</italic> is often seen as being limited to a more narrow domain of instrumentalist exchange, especially in urban contexts, and is therefore often viewed in a negative light, with a grey range overlapping to corruption. Even though there are also claims that the underlying pattern also reflects certain cultural specifics of social networks in China, it is thus doubtful whether the indigenous term deserves its use as a concept in comparative sociological analysis of China. Therefore, Chang’s attempt at defining an alternative concept that covers social interactions in general certainly should heed attention.</p>
<p>The voluminous book is divided into three main parts plus introduction, conclusion, Chinese glossary (without translation, unfortunately) and references. The first part is mainly a survey of local customs during the different cycles of family formation, the seasons and individual life. This is a very valuable collection of facts and observations which shows the continuity of many traditional patterns of behaviour in a place which is close to Shanghai, in one of the most developed rural areas of China, Southern Jiangsu. The rich collection of pictures taken from daily life is very helpful in making these reports accessible also to readers who are not familiar with the Chinese countryside. The second part deepens these observations by means of applying the <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> concept to different kinds of social interactions. Thus the author postpones theory formation after the application: this is mainly justified by the fact that the <italic>li shang wanglai</italic> expression is not just a term taken from Confucian classics, but finds numerous applications by the villagers themselves. Thus the specific sequence of the chapters manifests the aim of the researcher to develop her theoretical notion from the indigenous point of view. The third part presents the model and puts it in the context of more general theories of reciprocity in sociology and anthropology, and compares it with other analyses of Chinese social interaction that rely on indigenous concepts. These include <italic>guanxi</italic>, but also many others, such as the specific notions of ‘face’ (<italic>mianzi</italic>) or ‘human feelings’ (<italic>renqing</italic>), which also have played an important role in other research, as in classics as the work of Lien Sheng-yang or recent studies by Andrew Kipnis or Yan Yunxiang. Chang takes a very pronounced view on the issue of indigenization, because she also argues that the <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> model is a methodology of field research in the context of China. This is because data and information can be seen as benefits (even ‘gifts’) that the researcher wishes to receive from the subjects of her study, and therefore relations of reciprocity and exchange need to be developed also in the social interactions between the two. The researcher has to become part and parcel of social exchange following the model of <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic>.</p>
<p>What is the gist of this model? The two parts of the concept, <italic>lishang</italic> and <italic>wanglai</italic>, refer to two dimensions of social interaction. <italic>Wanglai</italic>, which could be most simply translated as ‘traffic’, refers to the different kinds of interactions; <italic>lishang</italic> refers to the rules or criteria that govern these interactions. In the original Confucian understanding, the rules have a normative status, in the sense of ‘proper’ behaviour. A central question for practice, but also for research, is to define the contexts of propriety. The meaning of the term clearly shows why <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> goes far beyond the notion of <italic>guanxi</italic>. For example, interactions also include interactions with ancestors in the context of popular religion. Thus, Chang claims that <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> defines the essence of Chinese culture, as reflected in social relationships.</p>
<p>Chang distinguishes between four types of <italic>wanglai</italic>: ‘generous’, ‘expressive’, ‘instrumental’ and ‘negative’. The first does not imply expectations of reciprocity; the second is the most complex one where reciprocity is governed by a rich set of social norms; the third is the domain of the classical <italic>guanxi</italic> relations which focus on a narrow exchange of material benefits; and the last refers to negative interactions such as retaliation. These different types of interactions follow rules of propriety summarized under the heading of <italic>lishang</italic>; the criteria are ‘moral judgement’, ‘human feelings’, ‘rational calculation’ and ‘spiritual beliefs’. It is important to notice that types of social interaction also determine which criteria are the proper ones, such as relating instrumental <italic>wanglai</italic> to rational calculation. In this context, Chang puts strong emphasis on ‘social creativity’, which therefore also features in the title of the book. This is important: the villagers in Kaixiangong do not take social structure and established patterns of relationships as a given, but they continuously create relationships and their contexts.</p>
<p>The book is rich in examples. For instance, against the cliché of the patriarchal Chinese tradition, Chang describe in meticulous detail the ways how villagers activate non-agnatic kin relationships and construct fictitious kinship relationships in order to create sustainable social structures of cooperation and shared lives. Simple generalizations regarding gender roles often defy this complexity of Chinese grassroots society. Further, <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> patterns are also much more encompassing than such concepts as ‘traditional family’; for example, interactions between local people and government institutions can be interpreted in these terms.</p>
<p>The book is an important contribution to the ethnography of a rapidly changing modern China. It broadens the scope of previous attempts at understanding Chinese social structure on its own terms: compared with the notion of <italic>chaxugeju</italic> proposed by the great forerunner of Chinese social anthropology, Fei Xiaotong, the concept of <italic>lishang-wanglai</italic> seems more dynamic and corrects widespread views of traditional Chinese behaviour as being hierarchical, collectivist and static. To the contrary, Chang shows how the traditional categories of social structure are always used in a creative way, thereby constructing social relations, with the individual as the prime mover. This is extremely interesting, as we know that these terms have been a defining feature of Chinese society over centuries, if not millennia. So, anyone who is interested in comparative studies in culture and society will benefit from this book.</p>
<p>Certainly, claims for introducing indigenous terms into general theory will often meet with suspicion: the author herself mentions debates about the alternative use of ‘social capital’ as a framework. However, this reviewer believes that even if these generic frameworks are used, the question remains how certain universal patterns of social action are interpreted in local communities. Ultimately, these interpretations interfere with supposed universalistic patterns of causation. Thus it seems illuminating that Chang uses the traditional (and today, certainly globally known) symbol of <italic>Yin</italic> and <italic>Yang</italic>☯ to describe the interaction between particularism and universalism in Chinese <italic>li shang wanglai</italic> practice. The two halves of <italic>Yin</italic> and <italic>Yang</italic> normally carry a dot inside; these dots refer to the respective opposite, implying that every half of the circle contains the seed of the other.</p>
