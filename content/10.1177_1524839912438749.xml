<abstract>
<p>Implementing evidence-based programming in diverse community settings is an essential translational research step to make effective programs widely accepted and accessible and thereby improve public health. This process is challenging and complex, yet there are few examples to guide the efforts. The authors present their experience as an example of using a university–community partnership approach to aid in translating an evidence-based program (EBP) into a small community setting as a resource for researchers and community partners wishing to implement evidence-based programming in community settings. The authors review the steps of systematic planning and client needs assessment to decide on an EBP: adapting the EBP to appeal to the community while maintaining program fidelity, building staff and organizational capacity, arranging for implementation and family engagement, and carrying out program evaluation. The study focuses on research-to-practice links and highlights each partner’s role and activities in facilitating successful translation of an EBP to this community setting. The lessons learned and recommendations are also presented. Using partnerships to prepare community-based organizations to implement EBPs is a vital mechanism for bridging the discovery–delivery gap and moving toward real-world applications of research discoveries.</p>

<p>Implementing evidence-based programs (EBPs) in community settings is challenging yet vital for improving public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912438749">Burgio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912438749">Kerner, Rimer, &amp; Emmons, 2005</xref>). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap urges evaluating basic research applications in real-world settings as the goal of Phase 4 translational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912438749">NIH, 2010</xref>). Addressing this challenge requires a complex balancing act of matching EBPs to communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912438749">Brownson, Gurney, &amp; Land, 1999</xref>) and readying communities to implement EBPs across settings, including community-based organizations (CBOs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912438749">Simpson &amp; Flynn, 2007</xref>). We used a community–university partnership to facilitate this translational process. We implemented an evidence-based behavioral intervention, the Strengthening Families Program (SFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912438749">Kumpfer, DeMarsh, &amp; Child, 1989</xref>), in a grassroots CBO serving children of incarcerated parent(s) and their families in Flint, Michigan. Drawing on organizational readiness to change, interactive systems, and university–community partnerships frameworks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912438749">Simpson &amp; Flynn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912438749">Spoth, Greenberg, Bierman, &amp; Redmond, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912438749">Wandersman et al., 2008</xref>, for theoretical discussions of these), we present steps taken by university and CBO partners to prepare this small organization to implement an EBP: client needs assessment, program selection/adaptation, capacity building/sustainability, delivery, and evaluation. We describe experiences and lessons learned to illustrate how our university–community partnership helped bridge the discovery–delivery gap.</p>
<p>This article is a joint product of a university partner and Motherly Intercession (MIC), a small CBO (~6 staff, ~20 volunteers). MIC’s mission is to create a community support system for children with incarcerated parents. It historically focused on addressing children’s academic needs and jail visitation but sought additional programming for families. The director contacted university partners at a community forum on children’s health. We jointly obtained NIH funding to implement an EBP to address family needs. Goals were to draw on local expertise to tailor the program and evaluate our efforts. We seek to inform research-to-practice links for researchers looking to translate EBPs to community settings and CBOs considering implementing an EBP. We use MIC as a case example to illustrate our steps, focusing on each partner’s role and joint activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912438749">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Background: Partnering to Bring Evidence-Based Programs to Communities</title>
<p>EBPs are theory driven, empirically based programs with demonstrated intervention trial efficacy. EBPs are often <italic>manualized</italic>, aiding fidelity of replication. It remains challenging for some children and families to overcome participation barriers and benefit from EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912438749">Spoth, Redmond, Hockaday, &amp; Shin, 1996</xref>). Thus, implementing EBPs in small CBOs that serve families, such as MIC, is an essential translational research step to make EPB’s more widely accepted and accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912438749">Kerner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912438749">NIH, 2010</xref>). A CBO can become the central hub of a community in need, but it often does not have the expertise or resources to implement an EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912438749">Saul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 2004</xref>). CBOs may be interested in EBPs for many reasons, including a desire for programs with proven track records, securing future funding by showing program evaluation results, and augmenting staff skills through training. Implementation is a significant undertaking for a small CBO, however, and may require organizational change and support to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912438749">Simpson &amp; Flynn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912438749">Sobeck &amp; Agius, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912438749">Wandersman et al., 2008</xref>). Partnering with universities to provide resources can be useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912438749">Spoth, Clair, Greenberg, Redmond, &amp; Shin, 2007</xref>). We focus on the role of partnership when implementing an EBP in a small CBO setting.</p>
<p>Successful partnerships require deep understanding and respect of each partner’s goals and skills, resource-sharing, and commitment to the project on behalf of each partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912438749">Green, Daniel, &amp; Novick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912438749">Seifer &amp; Vaughn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 2004</xref>). Working together on a focused goal, while each contributing unique expertise, community and university partners can develop efficient ways to deliver services and evaluate their effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912438749">Green et al., 2001</xref>). A goal of our partnership was to capitalize on each partner’s strengths to prepare MIC for implementing this program. To facilitate this, we communicated explicitly about expectations for each partner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912438749">Table 1</xref> presents examples of CBO-led, university-led, and jointly-led partnership activities, and time involved at each phase. Our project budget was approximately equally divided between university (57%) and community partners (43%), an important aspect of resource sharing that enabled equal partner participation. Partner roles were determined by expertise. MIC’s extensive experience working with children of incarcerated parents, for example, was essential in engaging families and making program adaptations. University partners developed systems to track research data and address other CBO needs (e.g., reporting number of clients served). Thus, community and university partners each brought skills to the partnership that enabled effective translation of the EBP to this setting. Developing respect for both partners’ priorities and skill sets was important; CBO partners learned to appreciate research issues (e.g., control groups; institutional review board requirements), and university partners learned to value CBO concerns (e.g., limited staffing, space, funding). Understanding each other’s priorities and challenges was helpful when planning implementation and evaluation activities, because each partner could grasp why issues that may not affect their primary agenda were significant for the partner (e.g., needing flexible time lines because of institutional review board constraints; limited staff). We describe each partner’s role at each phase of readying MIC to implement an EBP to inform future partnership for translation efforts.</p>

<sec id="section3-1524839912438749">
<title>Phase 1: Client Needs Assessment</title>
<p>CBOs have a general sense of the needs of the communities and clients that they serve. MIC defined their community of clients as children of incarcerated parents, and their caregivers, in the county. MIC sought an EBP that would address client needs, be a good use of resources, and be consistent with their mission. Thus, our first step was to assess client needs. University and community partners worked together to assess needs using complementary approaches. MIC staff built on ongoing relationships with families and one-on-one conversations to assess caregiver and child needs. Importantly, prior to this work, MIC had not provided programming specifically for caregivers. However, caregivers informally expressed needs for services. To gather more explicit information, the university partner facilitated focus groups with caregivers to discuss concerns and desired services. Participants spoke favorably of existing MIC programs for children (e.g., tutoring) and noted that they trusted MIC as a safe place where they were not judged based on their circumstance. They also mentioned unmet needs, including stress management, little peer support, strained family relationships (e.g., with incarcerated parents), and worry about child behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912438749">Brown, Ramsay, Cochran, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>). MIC staff observations and focus-group responses together revealed needs for family-level programming to provide support for parenting (caregiving) and child social–emotional functioning. Providing caregiver-focused programming, which had not occurred before at MIC, would enable MIC to meet these needs and reach more people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839912438749">
<title>Phase 2: Evidence-Based Program Adoption and Adaptation</title>
<p>CBOs must be able to evaluate EBPs that address identified client needs. Selecting an EBP to adopt is a complex task, requiring review of relevant programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912438749">Brownson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912438749">Wandersman et al., 2008</xref>) and appraisal of CBO capacity to implement programming. Although data are available online, it takes time and expertise to synthesize information and match programs to client and agency needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912438749">Brownson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912438749">Saul et al., 2008</xref>). University partners can be helpful in evaluating options and implementation strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912438749">Campbell &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912438749">Prevention Research Center of Michigan, 2000-2009</xref>). MIC’s director worked closely with the university principal investigator (PI) to define criteria for an EBP to meet CBO and client needs. Elements considered in our selection process included the following: family focused; developmentally appropriate; evidence based; addressed alcohol/drug use; provided support for training, implementation, and evaluation; and reasonable cost of training, materials, and implementation.</p>
<p>We also sought a program that we could adapt to local needs. Many programs addressed parenting, but MIC’s mission required adapting materials for children’s caregivers while the parent was incarcerated and addressing transitions if the parent was released. Balancing adaptation of a program with fidelity can stretch limited resources, but if original materials do not appeal to the focal population, an EBP may not be effective in promoting behavior change in the new context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912438749">Bernal, Jimenez-Chafey, &amp; Domenech Rodriguez, 2009</xref>). In contrast, tailoring materials may promote family and CBO engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912438749">Aktan, 1999</xref>). When making adaptations, it is important that the original program structure, components, and timings remain intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912438749">August, Gewirtz, &amp; Realmuto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912438749">Kumpfer, Alvarado, Smith, &amp; Bellamy, 2002</xref>). Researchers can work with CBOs on modifying EBPs to maintain integrity, while adding local relevance.</p>
<p>We selected the SFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912438749">Kumpfer et al., 1989</xref>) because it met all the above criteria. SFP is group-based EBP shown to enhance family-level communication, parenting, and child problem-solving skills among high-risk families (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912438749">Aktan, Kumpfer, &amp; Turner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912438749">Kumpfer &amp; Alvarado, 1995</xref>). SFP has been adapted to suit local needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912438749">Kumpfer et al., 2002</xref>), and program developers encourage this. SFP also includes training resources and comprehensive manuals supporting implementation, fidelity assessment, and evaluation. We thus had models and materials (e.g., images of different ethnicities) for adaptation while maintaining basic principles of the intervention to deliver our adapted version with fidelity. During the grant-writing and planning phases, the university PI and MIC director reviewed adaptation ideas with SFP developers (e.g., involving incarcerated parents) to ensure that our strategies would not violate the program structure. In our adaptation process, which extended through our first implementation round, MIC staff kept notes on topics, activities, and materials that worked (or not) during each session. University partners created color-coded manuals summarizing the changes and containing materials. These manuals have become part of MIC’s library and “required reading” for all SFP staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912438749">
<title>Phase 3: Capacity Building and Sustainability</title>
<p>Agency capacity and readiness for change can drive EBP implementation success and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912438749">Simpson &amp; Flynn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 2004</xref>). Devoting resources to supporting staff during implementation and long-term commitment to a program can increase the likelihood of successful implementation and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912438749">Klein &amp; Knight, 2005</xref>). Although we did not explicitly assess organizational readiness, MIC’s director identified several factors that could affect current and future implementation of the new EBP (e.g., cost of hiring/training staff). We thus directed resources toward building capacity in multiple ways, including finding additional staff; developing a database to prepare reports and provide data for future funding proposals; articulating the functions and roles of existing staff members; and developing EBP training and implementation protocols.</p>
<p>We sought to involve existing staff without additional burden. Challenges included staff anxiety about increased workload and delineating new roles and responsibilities. We developed flow charts and logic models diagramming program needs and activities to streamline existing workloads (e.g., using database to generate reports automatically). We also created procedure manuals and cross-trained staff members to perform critical functions. Partners agreed that additional staffing was necessary for leading SFP sessions. SFP developers advised hiring interns as group leaders. University partners helped create internships for health education and social work students. We developed job descriptions ensuring that opportunities met requirements for different training experiences and recruited interns from local universities and community colleges. Interns implemented child or caregiver SFP groups and cofacilitated family sessions. Hiring interns increased MIC’s capacity, and likelihood of SFP sustainability, by strengthening connections with local university partners. Interns have also spread the word about their positive training experiences with MIC.</p>
<p>We also sought to enhance both intervention-specific and general organizational capacity by developing personnel skills through training. Initial intervention training was a 2-day workshop for all MIC and university partners, facilitated by SFP program trainers. During this time, group leaders worked with SFP professionals to learn methods and discuss adaptations for MIC’s service population. All staff also completed human subjects training, which provided opportunities to educate about research ethics and program evaluation. Discussions covered maintaining confidentiality in a small CBO setting and adapting recruitment and consent processes (e.g., oral vs. written informed consent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912438749">May, Craig, &amp; Spellecy, 2007</xref>). By involving everyone from the project in these trainings, we sought to foster connections among MIC staff, interns, and university partners; to facilitate program buy-in; and to promote sustainability. Our SFP resource manuals address training and implementing SFP at MIC and provide the groundwork to sustain the program through a training framework for new staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912438749">
<title>Phase 4: Implementation and Family Engagement</title>
<p>During implementation, we provided ongoing supervision for staff/interns working with families to maintain enthusiasm and to avoid burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912438749">Aarons, Fettes, Flores, &amp; Sommerfeld, 2009</xref>). We partnered with a social worker who met weekly with group leaders to consult and debrief about the process of each session, including crisis management. All staff members were trained in working with high-risk children and families, including when and how to report clinical concerns (e.g., child abuse). To sustain enthusiasm, we held staff retreats and appreciation days to honor their hard work and celebrate their vital role in implementation.</p>
<p>Successful intervention implementation also hinges on engaging participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 1996</xref>). MIC had a dedicated recruiter who visited the jail every week to promote the SFP with inmates and caregivers who brought children to see their parents. The recruiter’s knowledge of local gathering places and traditions was helpful in enrolling and maintaining contact with these hard-to-reach families (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 2007</xref>). Although it was ideal to have one person in this role from the participant’s perspective, it presented a challenge when she became ill. The fact that we had developed systems to track families, and cross-trained staff members in SFP activities was helpful because it was possible for others to step in to share her duties.</p>
<p>Encouraging continued family involvement after recruitment can be difficult given barriers to participation, including scheduling, lack of transportation, and child care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912438749">Spoth et al., 1996</xref>). Addressing these issues was critical for the overburdened families with whom we worked. We held meetings in the evening and provided transportation, culturally appropriate meals, and care for children too young to participate. We also asked local businesses to donate small gifts for weekly door prizes. Every session, families arrived to a hot meal and had time to socialize with others caring for children of incarcerated parents. Participants told us they found this time to connect with each other to be extremely valuable and rewarding because they shared a common experience of being stigmatized and socially isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912438749">Hagen &amp; Myers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912438749">Severance, 2004</xref>). These relationships with other families may have helped sustain participation.</p>
<p>CBOs may engage hard-to-reach families because they may be perceived as more personal and less intimidating than hospitals, guidance clinics, or schools. CBOs typically arise from a need or interest within the community. Thus, they are likely to be responsive to such needs and may have reputations and relationships developed over time that are more trusted than larger institutions that typically deliver EBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912438749">Kramer, 1999</xref>). Participants also tend to establish trust at interpersonal rather than organizational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839912438749">White-Cooper, Dawkins, Kamin, &amp; Anderson, 2009</xref>), so small CBOs like MIC may be more likely to establish personal connections compared with larger institutions. MIC’s intimate setting allowed us to host family engagement activities (e.g., icebreaker games, taking family photos to give as gifts in frames decorated by the children) and celebrations (e.g., awards ceremonies). Participants offered testimonials reflecting how appreciative and grateful they were for the new program. Families who attended SFP have since enrolled their children in additional MIC programs, and they shared their enthusiasm about the program with friends. Thus, MIC expanded their community outreach through a network of personal connections.</p>

<sec id="section7-1524839912438749">
<title>Phase 5: Program Evaluation</title>
<p>Finally, evaluation is necessary to sustain an intervention and improve practice. Extensive outcome evaluation may be beyond a CBO’s capacity, but efforts to document activities, collect participant feedback, and obtain information for program improvement and future funding are vital organizational management issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912438749">Stevenson, Florin, Mills, &amp; Andrade, 2002</xref>). Process evaluation can help a CBO manage resources wisely and obtain support for high-quality programs that address community needs. We documented program adaptation and implementation through group leader notes from weekly sessions and postsession debriefings, using the notes to revise manuals for the next round and developing a template and examples to structure future notes and fidelity observations.</p>
<p>We also gathered participant outcome and satisfaction surveys, conducted fidelity observations, and recorded attendance. Outcome surveys were developed with the goal of creating an internal evaluation resource that MIC could use to assess caregiver and child functioning at intake. Surveys included standard SFP questionnaires (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912438749">Kumpfer et al., 1989</xref>) covering caregiving attitudes, family relationship dynamics, and child behaviors. We also assessed social support, mental health, and caregiving stress because these were identified in the client needs assessment as salient issues for caregivers. MIC’s director and the university PI reviewed surveys to ensure that all items would be appropriate and understood by participants. We administered surveys using a group format to maximize efficiency and participation, reading items aloud to reduce literacy concerns. Although it is beyond the scope of this article to report on outcomes (currently being collected), we have thus far observed high implementation fidelity and received high client satisfaction ratings (e.g., 90% of families said they would recommend SFP). Data have also been used to improve practice by providing information for client referrals (e.g., depression symptoms).</p>
<p>University and community partners also worked together to develop a system to manage process and outcome evaluation data. We assessed MIC’s need for different program reports, what data to collect, and how best to organize data for reports. Matching CBO reporting needs to the format of the data collected was a significant undertaking, but it resulted in a flexible and comprehensive database that was manualized so that CBO and university partners could use it to extract information. Resulting data could be used to secure funds for sustainability, future programming, and ongoing capacity building. Such implementation and evaluation procedures enabled MIC to show that they could implement an EBP with fidelity and evaluate outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion: Partnering for Translation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912438749">Table 2</xref> illustrates some concerns and lessons learned regarding partnership and translation. Partnership lessons included building trust, participation, role definition, and support. University and community partners met frequently to discuss project goals, to clarify the role of each partner organization, and to facilitate MIC’s readiness for EBP implementation. Specialized experiences that MIC and university partners each provided were also important both to increase staff members’ skill sets and build respect for each other’s priorities. Specifying unique contributions of each partner and assigning responsibilities (e.g., interpreting client needs assessment results) appeared to enhance each partner’s investment in the project and build trust. To support staff as they took on new responsibilities, the university PI and MIC director met with them to describe project goals and rationale and to define roles for each staff member. We also held celebrations for staff to acknowledge their contributions.</p>

<p>Translation lessons concerned organizational capacity for implementation and evaluation. Agency directors are influential in setting the stage for EPB translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912438749">Proctor et al., 2007</xref>); MIC’s small staff was dedicated to the director and the agency, and anecdotally, enthusiasm for this program was high. MIC’s director also acknowledged feeling anxious about being able to deliver on research goals (e.g., recruiting participants) and whether EBP implementation efforts, particularly staffing, would overwhelm her need to provide other services. To address these concerns, we tried to enhance functions of MIC that would aid in EBP implementation and also other programming (e.g., training staff, establishing internships, developing database, adapting intake questionnaires). Connecting with other local university partners to find interns was particularly helpful. Similarly, university partners had concerns about data collection procedures being burdensome. By communicating directly and frequently about such issues throughout the implementation process, we proactively addressed many concerns (e.g., using group questionnaire administration). MIC’s director and the university PI maintained frequent phone contact and sent group e-mail updates to keep everyone connected. In these ways, a strong partnership helped us address concerns about translation.</p>
<p>Finally, certain elements of MIC may have uniquely contributed to our ability to translate the EBP to this setting. MIC had a strong director who appreciated the need for evaluation data to secure funding and devoted resources to this by getting client files into the database and involving student interns to help with grant writing. NIH funding for the 2 years of this project provided more resources than were typically available for MIC, but our investment in capacity building and focus on sustainability helped secure continuation of the program once NIH funding ended. Finally, the director and university PI worked together on proposals prior to and after this project was funded. This helped them appreciate each other’s strengths, goals, and interests, which facilitated program implementation.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
<p>In sum, we learned several lessons for partnering to translate EBPs to a community setting. Understanding each other’s concerns and priorities, supporting staff, and defining unique roles for each partner built trust between partners and a focus on achieving mutual goals. Considering organizational capacity helped define project scope and feasibility; enhancing capacity was a goal of our work. Developing protocols for EBP implementation and evaluation that built on existing organizational strengths were also important for sustainability. We recommend that researchers and CBOs who are preparing to partner to translate EBPs to community settings attend to these issues. Effective partnerships can foster research-to-practice links, help bridge the discovery–delivery gap, and ultimately improve health outcomes for underresourced children and families.</p>
