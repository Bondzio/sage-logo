<abstract>
<p>Critical pedagogy, combined with partnerships with adults at school, enabled the Gay–Straight Alliance (GSA) advisor to create the foundation for reflective, activist-oriented learning at one Midwestern high school. Underreported in current literature, the use of critical pedagogy in school clubs and/or organizations has broad implications for teachers and teacher educators. Informed by the tenets of critical multiculturalism, this study draws on ethnographic fieldwork from one school year and in-depth interviews with students and the GSA advisor. Data reveal that the GSA advisor’s unique conception of critical pedagogy is characterized by expanding students’ knowledge, facilitating students’ activism, and encouraging students’ reflection on significant interactions with peers and family. The author concludes that these pedagogical practices play a key role in creating a long-term GSA, where engaged student learning combined with activism promote a “third space” in teacher development.</p>

<p>The Gay–Straight Alliance (GSA) is an extracurricular, student-centered club where lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013189X13491977">1</xref></sup> (LGBTQ) students, along with their heterosexual and questioning allies, gather for conversation, learning activities, and mutual support. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s when GSAs became more commonplace in high schools across the United States, their registered numbers have grown to more than 4,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X13491977">Kosciw, Greytak, Diaz, &amp; Bartkiewicz, 2010</xref>), but they vary widely in student makeup. The GSA at Freedom High School, officially started in 2000, began as an LGBTQ-only club, but the majority of its current members identify as straight allies. Regardless of its demographic makeup, however, its founding represented an example of how this predominantly White school demonstrated support for gay rights. Located in a large Midwestern city, Freedom High is an Independent School that sent representatives to witness the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Washington, D.C., in 1999. According to one faculty member who later became the advisor of the GSA, Freedom High’s official school policies “were always ahead” of other similar schools in the area, recalling that “Freedom High had a non-discrimination clause when [she] arrived [in 1999] that included sexual orientation and gender identity” (interview, J.J., May 28, 2009). She also stated that Freedom guaranteed legal benefits to domestic partners long before other nearby educational institutions and those across the state.</p>
<p>This is a study about the experiences of a select group of students in the GSA at Freedom High School that centers important perspectives on how critical pedagogy can be developed at a site of privilege. In this context, critical pedagogy allows students to become more aware of their privileged positionality; it opens students’ eyes to injustices around them in new ways; and it changes their orientation to “activist,” which leads them to take action at school and in the larger community. Further, the advisor’s unique interpretation/execution of critical pedagogy combined with its impact on students creates a potential “third space” where preservice teachers may become school-ready. In this article, I argue that the GSA advisor at Freedom High School utilized pedagogy that is <italic>critical</italic> at its core and led to effective, transformative learning outcomes for student GSA members. This pedagogy is characterized by students’ (a) access to information and issues that are important to queer youth, (b) participation in schoolwide and community-focused activities, and (c) reflections upon significant incidents in their lives when they encountered and responded to homophobia. Multiple adult allies, teachers, and staff members from Freedom High School, both heterosexual and queer-identified, became pillars of support for GSA student members. The students perceived these adults as allies, rather than as chaperones or curious voyeurs: they offered students reinforcement of the lessons learned in the GSA and transformed their classrooms into supportive spaces.</p>

<title>Gay–Straight Alliances</title>
<p>As noted in previous studies, membership in GSAs positively impacts school climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X13491977">Griffin, Lee, Waugh, &amp; Beyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X13491977">MacGillivray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X13491977">Mayberry, Chenneville, &amp; Currie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X13491977">Mayo, 2004</xref>) and the lives of their members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X13491977">Cosier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X13491977">Grace &amp; Wells, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13491977">Kosciw, Diaz, &amp; Greytak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X13491977">Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X13491977">MacGillivray, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13491977">Mayo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X13491977">Walls, Kane, &amp; Wisneski, 2010</xref>). These studies indicate that schools with GSAs are more welcoming of many different forms of diversity, including religious, racial, and ethnic as well as difference centered on gender and sexual orientation. As a result, LGBTQ-identified students and their families feel safer and experience a deeper sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X13491977">Meyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X13491977">Sadowski, 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, the most recent National School Climate Survey conducted by the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) found that less than half (45.7%) of the students surveyed attended a school with an active GSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X13491977">Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, &amp; Palmer, 2012</xref>). Even in schools where GSAs are established, barriers exist that keep many students from seeking membership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X13491977">Watson, Varjas, Meyers, and Graybill (2010)</xref> found that parents were a “barrier to advocacy by restricting their children from joining the GSA” (p. 107). More generally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X13491977">Watson et al. (2010)</xref> reported that GSA advisors were affected by sociocultural factors, school-based factors, and individual factors as they related to their ability (or inability) to advocate for LGBTQ youth.</p>
<p>Another barrier to membership is the perception by some students that the GSA is under surveillance by heterosexual peers who do not approve of the club. This is particularly true for students of color, who found it difficult to fit in with the predominately White GSA membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X13491977">McCready, 2004</xref>) and for whom the GSA was generally inadequate given its tendency, in some contexts, to normalize Whiteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13491977">Blackburn &amp; McCready, 2009</xref>). Critiques of GSAs detail how they are often sites where white privilege obfuscates the social justice mission and where queer students of color, poor students, and gender-nonconforming students are marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13491977">Mayo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X13491977">McCready, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X13491977">2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013189X13491977">Quinn (2007)</xref> reports how a group of queer girls of color attempted to complicate this notion by starting a GSA at an all-girls, public charter school in Chicago that was a combined middle and high school. The group, however, came under fire when parents objected to the club because they perceived it as having negative effects on the younger middle school members. Although these girls effectively troubled the notion that GSAs are only for White girls and “rejected conformity to norms of leadership valued in the school and society when they acted assertively and collectively to start the GSA” (p. 42), the group was disbanded for a year given all the controversy surrounding it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13491977">Blackburn &amp; McCready, 2009</xref>). Despite these critiques, examples that complicate the usual pattern of GSA formation and GSA members’ activism, advocacy, and vigilance at many secondary schools legitimize nonheterosexual students, improving the schools’ atmospheres. In fact, the mere presence of a GSA acknowledges a queer existence at school, which sends supportive messages to those students too fearful or simply not yet ready to attend meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X13491977">Mayo, 2009</xref>). Some have characterized the emergence of Gay–Straight Alliances as “one of the most visible manifestations of the contemporary movement for social justice” in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013189X13491977">Russell, Muraco, Subramaniam, &amp; Laub, 2009</xref>, p. 892). The GSA at Freedom High School is certainly part of a larger, uneven movement toward social justice, but the unique brand of critical pedagogy employed by its advisor moves this group beyond support, safety, and social justice. The impact of this pedagogy creates the possibility of a “third space” emerging in school clubs/organizations, which has broad implications for teacher education research.</p>

<title>“Third Spaces” in Teacher Development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X13491977">Zeichner (2010)</xref> uses the concept “third space” as a way of viewing “various kinds of boundary crossing between [college] campus and [K–12] schools” that are currently in use within teacher education programs across the United States (p. 92). Accordingly, this idea of “third space” is based upon hybridity theory and recognizes that individuals employ a variety of means to make sense of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X13491977">Bhabba, 1990</xref>). Third space calls for the rejection of binaries such as curricular versus extracurricular learning spaces and “involves the integration of what are often seen as competing discourses in new ways—an either/or perspective is transformed into a both/also point of view” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X13491977">Zeichner, 2010</xref>, p. 92). For Zeichner, “third spaces bring practitioner and academic knowledge together in less hierarchical ways to create new learning opportunities for prospective teachers” (ibid). This conceptualization views practitioner knowledge emanating from a traditional classroom spaces only, but the GSA—and by extension, other school clubs and organizations—can also be viewed as a site of knowledge creation, particularly when its members engage critical pedagogy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X13491977">Gutiérrez (2008)</xref> has argued, “third space is a transformative space where the potential for an expanded form of learning and the development of new knowledge are heightened” (p. 152). I argue that GSA members at Freedom High School experienced expanded learning and obtained new knowledge as a result of the critical pedagogy engaged by the GSA advisor.</p>

<title>Critical Pedagogy as a Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Despite the homogeneous makeup of the GSA members at Freedom High School—White and upper-middle class—the advisor encouraged students to use a critical lens as they wrestled to understand current events and issues that centered on queer themes. This critical perspective shaped the discussions that occurred during GSA meetings and the activities its members participated in outside of the meeting space. When the advisor asked students to reflect upon their privilege as they struggled to comprehend the experiences of others, she utilized a form of <italic>critical pedagogy</italic> that moved students toward taking action. Given the critiques of GSAs found in the literature and the context of this research site, I was interested in seeking answers to the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0013189X13491977" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What does it look like when a mostly White, heterosexual group of student activists at a site of privilege engage LGBTQ-centered topics on a critical level?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the impact of GSA advisors’ use of pedagogy that is critical in nature?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent does the Gay–Straight Alliance exemplify a “third space” for the development of future teachers?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Critical pedagogy includes, but is not limited to, classroom practices that work against the idea that “citizens in a capitalist society need both to know their ‘rightful’ place in the order of things and to be reconciled to that destiny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13491977">Burbules &amp; Berk, 1999</xref>, p. 50). Its primary focus is “social injustice and how to transform inequitable, undemocratic, or oppressive institutions and social relations” (p. 47). Burbules and Berk explain further,
<disp-quote>
<p>[Critical pedagogy] is an effort to work within educational institutions and other media to raise questions about inequalities of power, about the false myths of opportunity and merit for many students, and about the way belief systems become internalized to the point where individuals and groups abandon the very aspiration to question or change their lot in life. (p. 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Members of Freedom High School’s GSA became consciously aware of the power differential between their heterosexual peers and those who were LGBTQ or perceived as being so, and they understood this scenario as one that was unjust and that spread far beyond the space within their school. Allies within the group realized that they could use their power (identified as straight privilege) to support their queer classmates and enact changes at school given the lessons learned from the pedagogy practiced by their advisor. Significantly, these heterosexual students understood that power/privilege can be used to support fairness and equity rather than the status quo and their role in maintaining it. This realization gave them strong incentive to remain active GSA members and to expand their alliance with queer classmates beyond the meeting space at school. Meanwhile, queer-identified members of the GSA learned that any negative feedback they received from students or adults in their lives did not have to constitute the norm; any current negative scenario in life was temporary and open to change. These understandings exemplify <italic>phronesis</italic>, defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13491977">McLaren (2009)</xref> as “the dispositions to act truly and rightly” (p. 74). The students’ GSA advisor certainly encouraged <italic>praxis</italic> (informed actions) among the students, but without these dispositions in place or burgeoning from within, no elimination of pain, oppression, or inequality or the promotion of justice and freedom would be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13491977">McLaren, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Critical multiculturalism, a major focus of which is antiracist practices in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X13491977">McLaren, 1994</xref>), complements the pedagogy practiced in Freedom High School’s GSA. Not only does it recognize that all people have multiple, and often conflicting, identities, but it also reveals how class, gender, and <italic>sexuality</italic> intersect with the sociohistorical construct of race. At the same time, it creates pedagogical conditions that help students and teachers better understand “otherness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X13491977">Nylund, 2006</xref>). Like all adolescents, students in the GSA grappled with a variety of issues centered on identity. In this particular space, however, the advisor created an atmosphere that was safe for students to focus more narrowly on their sexual identity and on the larger societal implications of <italic>living queerly</italic> or being perceived as queer. For the straight allies, this meant addressing how to support LGBTQ peers, while defending their potentially unpopular decision to do so. The knowledge they gained from discussions on issues like bullying, gay marriage, and <italic>Don’t Ask Don’t Tell</italic> legislation helped them to better understand how this particular identity marker would (possibly) impact their lives. Citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13491977">McLaren (2009)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge is relevant only when it begins with the experiences students bring with them from the surrounding culture (in this case bullying and confronting homophobia); it is critical only when these experiences are sometimes shown to be problematic; and it is transformative only when students begin to use the knowledge to help empower others, including individuals in the surrounding community (p. 80).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While obtaining knowledge about current events that centered LGBTQ issues, these students also reflected on their interactions with peers and adults perceived as “others” (or who perceived them as “others”) and concluded that they were better equipped to confront and educate their peers about the damage caused by homophobia as a result of these interactions and reflections.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X13491977">Kellner (1998)</xref> reminds us that more critical versions of multiculturalism affirm the value of diversity and the need for oppressed groups to struggle against institutionalized forms of hierarchy and domination. In this study, participants actively engaged in activities that equipped them to “talk back” to peers at school who used homophobic language or who openly displayed intolerance toward queer classmates. Openly gay students and their allies in the GSA pushed back against the common theme of “victimized gay teenager” by participating in all aspects of school life, including academic engagement in classes, sports, and clubs other than the GSA, and by being visible during the unstructured times between classes and during the lunch hour. In these ways, students and adults in the GSA confronted and helped lessen the effects of institutionalized homophobia found at school.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-0013189X13491977">
<title>Rationale for Case Study</title>
<p>In order to capture the particular experiences of the students within the context of the GSA at Freedom High School, while simultaneously observing activities, behaviors, and dispositions that may be employed by others more generally, I framed this investigation as a case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13491977">Hamel, Dufour, &amp; Fortin, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013189X13491977">Yin (2009)</xref> defines the case study as “an empirical inquiry about a contemporary phenomenon, set within its real-world context—especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (p. 18). Case study methodology was useful because my goals for this study were to investigate what critical pedagogy looks like in a particular school setting that was a site of privilege and to explain how the weekly meetings of this GSA differed from others. Further, this methodology allowed me to focus on specific pedagogical strategies taken by the advisor and relate how students’ responses to those strategies facilitated self-reflection, increased knowledge, and desire to take action—the building blocks for the growth and longevity of Freedom High’s GSA. These specific actions and students’ responses observed over a span of one year during weekly meetings compose the bounded case of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013189X13491977">Tellis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X13491977">Yin, 2012</xref>). GSA members’ reporting of their knowledge gained, their self-reflections, and actions taken may be episodic in nature, but it represents an attempt at a more holistic understanding of their overall experience.</p>

<sec id="section7-0013189X13491977">
<title>Site Discovery and Earning Trust</title>
<p>The exploration of the GSA at Freedom High School began in September 2008. During the previous spring semester, a colleague of mine and I worked with several social studies teachers, helping them create authentic assessments for their students. Over that 4-month period, I noticed that several of the teachers’ classroom doors were adorned with multicolored rainbow stickers, the sign of a safe space for students of all sexual orientations and gender expressions. Upon further inquiry, I learned that the school had an active GSA and that the stickers represented part of the advocacy work performed by GSA members and their long-time advisor, J.J., an out lesbian Spanish instructor and veteran teacher of 25 years. After some lengthy conversation with her, including sharing my surprise over seeing all the rainbow stickers, she invited me to attend a GSA meeting the following week. I eagerly accepted the invitation and discovered a group of students and teachers that met weekly to discuss various topics and plan a host of activities that took place throughout the year. I was excited to discover this group, but saddened that the school year was wrapping up. Sensing both my excitement and disappointment, J.J. invited me to return on a regular, weekly basis to GSA meetings the following year.</p>
<p>Given the relationships I had formed while working with Freedom High faculty members the previous school term, obtaining administrative permission to attend the weekly GSA meetings—with clear understanding that I would also take field notes—was simplified and granted. For the first several weeks, I simply attended the meetings without saying much, while listening to students’ stories and observing their interactions. Identified simply as “J.J.’s friend from the university,” I attained a level of trust from the participating members, who clearly respected J.J.’s judgment. My presence, in fact, was not unusual because several teachers and staff members from Freedom High also attended meetings: having adults in the room other than J.J. was an established norm. In time, I began to share my story as a former middle school teacher, openly gay professor, and one with a keen interest in students’ experiences within various GSAs. I shared with J.J. and the students that I had attended GSA meetings in Florida and Virginia schools, but that I had never seen such a large GSA or one that engaged in such high levels of conversation. Having already gained the trust of the deeply respected advisor, I soon sensed that the GSA student and adult members began to trust me as well. Thus, I began making observations and collecting field notes without fear that my presence was drastically changing the normal flow of the meetings and members’ conversations. I attended GSA meetings for the entire school year, collecting my last field notes in May 2009 at the end of the school term.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013189X13491977">
<title>The Participants</title>
<p>From a convenient sample of 30–40 GSA members, I conducted semi-structured interviews with eight GSA members and the advisor and captured the insights and reflections of other members while observing meetings and collecting field notes. Though it may have proven beneficial to hear from more individual students, several were unable to obtain permission from their parents or guardians for a one-on-one interview with me. The requirement of obtaining parental consent for an interview may have thwarted potential interviewees for a number of reasons: Some students simply forgot to return permission slips; some may have identified as queer or questioning at school, while living a “straight life” at home; and some were deeply closeted both at home and at school and only attended GSA meetings because they claimed “ally status” for the causes the GSA supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X13491977">Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013189X13491977">Whittaker, 2009</xref>). These students accepted the support offered by GSA membership as they struggled to understand various aspects of their identity. One participant, for example, shared the following sentiments, “It has been challenging for me to explain my affiliation with the group to those whom I love; it has likewise been extremely difficult to have related conversations with those individuals, despite the preparation GSA has given me” (personal communication, Melissa, June 23, 2009). Melissa later commented that part of the difficulty explaining her “affiliation” with the GSA centered on the assumptions made by outsiders about the sexual orientation of GSA members. Another student addressed this stereotype directly saying, “Of course there is always the unspoken stereotype that all GSA members are gay” (personal communication, Mary, August 1, 2009). Even as some students used the GSA as a space to wrestle with unconfirmed identities, outsiders unwittingly made their journey more difficult by making blanket assumptions about <italic>all</italic> the members who participated in GSA, effectively keeping some members of the Freedom student body away.</p>
<p>All of the interviews took place on campus either during or after school when students were free from academic responsibilities, lasted from 60–90 minutes, and were audio-taped. All of the students identified as White, were ages 14–18, were evenly split along perceived gender lines, and were actively involved in the GSA. Five of the participants were members of the senior class, two participants were juniors, and one participant was a freshman. Most came from privileged homes where one or both parents were college-educated and held white-collar, professional jobs. Karen, the lone freshman in the group, was the only participant who had not been a member of the GSA for multiple years, but her older sister had been an active member before her, allowing her a perspective about the GSA that other freshmen could not offer. Although participants were never asked to reveal their sexual orientation, all of them self-identified at some point during the interview process: Karen is a 14-year-old freshman who identifies as heterosexual ally, Aaron and Jake are both 16-year-old juniors who identify as out gay males, whereas Laura and Evan (age 17), and Chuck, Mary, and Melissa (age 18) are all seniors who identify as heterosexual allies.</p>
<p>J.J., the GSA advisor at Freedom High School, teaches Spanish and has been on the faculty at Freedom High for 11 of her 25 years of teaching. Of those 11 years, she has been the advisor of the GSA for 10 of them, and out as a lesbian for most of those years. J.J. is described by her students as “cool, chill with her students, a cheerleader, and her students’ biggest ally.” Throughout the school, J.J. is known for her passion, activism, and commitment to social justice causes in the hopes of making Freedom High School a better place for teachers and students.</p>

<title>Methods of Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis of the data began during the process of transcribing the audio-taped interviews. As I transcribed the interviews, I noted key ideas, words, and phrases the participants shared in common across all the interviews. These shared ideas became the foundation for themes that solidified over time. This exploratory and constant comparative procedure continued until all interviews were transcribed, converted into Word format, and sent to the participants via electronic mail for member checking purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X13491977">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). All member checks were completed simultaneously with multiple readings and analysis of the data between July and November 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13491977">Constas, 1992</xref>). The categories that were ultimately created were initially specified in no particular order because new information from the participants continuously caused them to be modified throughout the procedure. Only after the categories became more solidified did I place them in their current order. As a means of developing both the categories and the contents of those categories, I produced a series of analytic notes while reading the data as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X13491977">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>. Once I completed the process of creating analytic notes, I employed a coding scheme using various colors and Word functions to identify recurring phrases and themes. The analysis phase allowed time to scrutinize both the categories and the data placed in them and served as an additional check for confirmation bias, the assumption that data have been placed in the proper category before all data are considered. At the point of data saturation, the final categories were identified by my authority as researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13491977">Constas, 1992</xref>). Continuous member checking with the informants further justified the existence of the categories and transformed them into the final themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X13491977">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). The most salient themes are found below.</p>

<sec id="section10-0013189X13491977">
<title>Knowledge, Activism, Reflection, and Adult Support</title>
<p>In this section, I detail the key elements of the pedagogy enacted in Freedom High School’s Gay–Straight Alliance—knowledge, activism, and reflection. Alongside other adults at school, the GSA advisor utilized her personal relationships with students and years of teaching experience to engage GSA members on a critical level, helping students to confront issues of power and privilege as the group collectively battled homophobia and other injustices at school. Though she never identified as a critical pedagogue, her engagement style with students, willingness to confront difficult issues, and desire for structural changes indicated movement in that direction.</p>
<sec id="section11-0013189X13491977">
<title>Knowledge: Students’ Access to Queer Issues and Information</title>
<p>Exposure to information that promoted knowledge of queer issues was the first phase of the critical pedagogy employed by the GSA advisor. When students stroll into weekly, GSA lunchtime meetings at Freedom High School, the advisor presents a topic of the day or a relevant website to critique. On other days, students provide materials of interest found on YouTube: Video clips of shows hosted by Rachel Maddow, Wanda Sykes, and Ellen DeGeneres initiated many conversations. Significantly, students chose queer topics of interest, indicating their desire to learn more about issues with direct relevance to their lives. Discussions about <italic>Proposition 8</italic> and other gay marriage-centered themes occurred on a regular basis during meetings as well. In addition, students engaged in conversations about queer figures in history, like Harvey Milk, historical events, like Stonewall, and specific incidents that occurred at school. These activities led the GSA advisor to conclude, “We have lots of students who are kind of plugged in to what’s going on politically, historically, and in pop culture” (interview, J.J., May 28, 2009).</p>
<p>At the GSA meeting following the 2009 Academy Awards Show, J.J. showed the acceptance speeches of actor Sean Penn and screen writer Dustin Lance Black following their Oscar wins for Best Actor and Best Screenplay. She then encouraged students to reflect upon the speeches and the messages sent by the speakers. Black’s words, in particular, elicited several comments from students. Karen, a 14-year-old freshman ally, reflected on the conversations following her viewing of Black’s commentary and commented, “I think it’s important to take those first initial steps to bring some education into the [Freedom High] community about LGBTQ issues” (interview, Karen, May 29, 2009). Jake, an openly gay junior, also reflected on the importance of these conversations, indicating how rarely this opportunity presented itself: “It’s hard to bring up homosexuality in everyday life, but if you go into a place where you know that’s what you’re going to talk about, it’s easier to just start talking without going through that awkward [silent] phase” (interview, Jake, May 28, 2009). During several meetings over the following weeks, the students viewed clips from <italic>Milk</italic> and discussed the historical significance of Harvey Milk as the first openly gay man to win public office. Having access to various queer issues and topics coupled with time and permission for reflection promoted conversations that GSA students did not have otherwise. It helped students avoid the “awkward phase” responsible for shutting down potential queer-focused discussions in other contexts, while simultaneously empowering students to recognize injustice, both current and historic. These opportunities to discuss queer issues signaled to students that the GSA was an inclusive space where it was safe to explore knowledge that was unavailable or off-limits to them in other school settings. Acquisition of LGBTQ-focused information from history and current events signaled to students that a different kind of pedagogy was taking place at GSA meetings, one that tapped into their realm of interest and, for some, their lived experience as Other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0013189X13491977">
<title>Activism: Students’ Participation in Schoolwide and Community-Focused Activities</title>
<p>Alongside the exploration of knowledge focused on queer topics, the GSA cultivated students’ identity as school and community activist, a role essential to critical pedagogy. The critical person not only recognizes injustice but also feels compelled to change it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13491977">Burbules &amp; Berk, 1999</xref>). Each school term, GSA members at Freedom High School participate in a wide range of school and community events to raise awareness about local and societal injustices in the hopes of helping peers decrease their participation in unjust actions. The school events included the “Think Before You Speak” Campaign, The National Day of Silence, and Coming OUT Day. Each year at Freedom High, the entering ninth-grade students must attend a mandatory series of presentations during homeroom to help them acclimate to their new school environment. The <italic>Think Before You Speak Campaign</italic> is a nationally recognized program designed to help students avoid derogatory phrases like “that’s so gay” and help them make word choices that more clearly express what they truly mean to say (ThinkB4YouSpeak, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thinkb4youspeak.com/">http://www.thinkb4youspeak.com/</ext-link>). GSA members led many of these sessions in support of this campaign during freshman homeroom as part of their awareness-raising and service-to-school activities. In addition, GSA members successfully recruited nearly one-third of Freedom High School’s student body to participate in the National Day of Silence. This nationwide, student-led movement recognizes “the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their allies in schools caused by name-calling, bullying, and harassment” (Day of Silence, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dayofsilence.org/">http://www.dayofsilence.org/</ext-link>). Finally, GSA members participated in Coming OUT Day, a day set aside to celebrate the lives of gay and lesbian students and faculty who choose to live their lives openly at school. When students witness members of the LGBTQ community living openly in this manner, it becomes simply another way of being, rather than fodder for stigma and fear. Given that the majority of GSA members identified as straight allies, this day gave them an opportunity to support openly gay and lesbian friends outside of GSA meetings in a larger school context.</p>
<p>In addition to these examples of activism at the school level, GSA members also participated in a number of awareness-raising activities in the surrounding community. Six members of the GSA participated in a panel discussion at a local university, fielding questions from graduate-level education students. The panel enlightened these future classroom teachers about the importance of supporting or starting Gay–Straight Alliances at their future schools. They also stressed the importance of teachers realizing that not all of their future students will identify as heterosexual and that many will have LGBTQ family members and friends. The pre-service teachers in attendance were deeply attentive to the GSA students’ stories and perspectives and left the session with an expanded view of some critical issues they will face in the secondary classroom. Finally, a small busload of GSA students attended Lobby Day at the State Capitol in support of gay rights. There, students spoke with local government officials about several issues important to the LGBTQ community, including extending the right to marry for <italic>all</italic> people. According to the GSA advisor, participation in these events allows students to “take action for social change, trying to achieve some kind of social justice” at school and in the surrounding community (interview, J.J., May 28, 2009).</p>
<p>In all these examples of activism, the participating GSA members examined and challenged the behaviors and attitudes of area adults and their schoolmates, noting that ignorance rather than malice informed many of their homophobic views. These activities also afforded students time for self-reflection, interrogation of personal beliefs, and presented them with opportunities to transform beliefs into action. The purpose-filled act of staying silent for an entire school day, educating future teachers about the benefits of GSAs, carrying pro-LGBTQ banners and participating in public rallies covered by local media at Lobby Day, and speaking to public officials about LGBTQ rights constitutes direct, intentional movement toward an activist identity, one that flourished in the GSA space back at Freedom High. Many students who had previously been casual supporters of social justice issues were transformed into “gung ho allies,” students willing to speak loudly and clearly about their beliefs (interview, Karen, May 28, 2009). Quoting one male ally, “It has equipped me with confidence to convey my message about sexual orientation and gender issues. I can now converse openly, with intelligence. Before [attending GSA], I got sucked into society’s homophobia, but I will no longer be a bystander” (Field notes, May 14, 2009). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X13491977">McLaren (2009)</xref> wrote that “<italic>empowerment</italic> means not only helping students to understand and engage the world around them, but also enabling them to exercise the kind of courage needed to change the social order where necessary” (p. 74). Opportunities for participation in events that directly related to the topics and issues discussed during GSA meetings gave formerly complacent students the courage to critique their personal ways of thinking about issues and the courage to then take action, evidence of the critical pedagogy enacted by their GSA advisor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0013189X13491977">
<title>Reflection: Students’ Thinking About Big Gay Moments</title>
<p>Having access to and processing information about queer topics and issues and taking action in various school/community projects pushed students to reflect upon and critique those moments in their lives when they have responded to homophobia. GSA members at Freedom High School call these specific incidents “big gay moments” or BGMs. When students share their BGMs, they reveal the passion of their convictions and the simultaneous struggles endured while negotiating their identity as GSA members in non-GSA spaces. Students confronting homophobia outside of the safe confines of the GSA meeting room and without the support of their fellow GSA members were truly tested. The conflict felt by students is exemplified by one self-identified ally and active GSA member who shared the following experience from Lobby Day.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was at a rally at the Capitol and I was holding this big rainbow-striped American flag and a reporter approached me and asked me for my name, school, and hometown. I stopped, and for a moment, I didn’t want to identify myself at a rally for [gay] rights. This impulse runs completely contrary to my beliefs, but it showed me how afraid I really was to come out as an ally to those outside the [Freedom High] community. It showed me that I still have work to do in gaining my courage on the subject. (interview, Melissa, June 1, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another GSA member described the challenge and triumph of dealing with homophobic family members who used gay slurs in her presence and then teased her for asking them to find more appropriate ways to express themselves.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think my biggest “gay moment” was that unfortunate experience with my cousins. It is not necessarily the most pleasant memory, but it is the thing from my life that I’ve most wanted to discuss with my fellow GSA members. Since that experience I’ve actually had redeeming experiences with my cousins. Originally when they teased me about my strong reactions to hate-language, I had struggled to describe to them what offended me about it. This summer I was actually able to find the right words. When the usual teasing started up again, I explained to them that I have several close, openly gay friends, and that when my cousins used that language, they were demeaning real people, people that are close to me. And one of my cousins stepped up and told me she was part of a GSA. I had not expected that at all, but it felt so good to know I wasn’t the only one among my cousins who feels this way. (interview, Mary, June 1, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Initially, Laura, a 17-year-old ally and member of the senior class, found it difficult to isolate one BGM that was most significant to her, but in the end settled on an incident that allowed her to meet someone she considers a lifelong friend.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He came out as being bisexual and as having tried to kill himself. I gave him a hug at the end of the GSA meeting after never having met him before, and then I saw him more often at GSA. To this day, he is still one of my closest friends even though he’s off at college now. He needed a friend, and GSA gave me the ability to meet him and be what he needed. (interview, Laura, June 1, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the wide variety of big gay moments described by the students, the BGMs share an important trait. Each one provided a snapshot of the students’ contradictory and tension-filled feelings about exposing an aspect of their identity often reserved for GSA meetings only. Even staunch allies were sometimes unable to profess their sincere support for queer friends and topics in public spaces. Consequently, some of them sought refuge in the “straight ally closet,” taking full advantage of the perceived straight privilege found there. Meanwhile, others found it much more comfortable exhibiting their ally status with strangers than with loved ones because strangers’ assumptions about their sexual orientation carried fewer potential consequences. Even when new best friends are found and some family members reveal their unexpected support, GSA members felt the tensions created when they attempted to enact a critical dimension of their identity outside of the protected space found at Freedom High School. Societal pressures from family members and peers weighed heavily on these well-informed adolescents, including those with the best intentions.</p>
<p>The impact of critical pedagogy on young people is not a forward line of progression; instead, it is often accompanied by moments of uncertainty and retreat. But it is the struggle endured by allies that creates space and opportunity for students’ personal growth. This is what the GSA advisor’s use of critical pedagogy accomplished for her mostly White and privileged group of students. The GSA advisor explained the significance of these difficult interactions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think this is so important for them, even if straight allies have as many stories to tell as anybody [else]. In fact, they’re the ones who usually have the most stories because they walk around with that straight privilege and other people assume that they’re homophobic as well. It’s in those situations when it’s either uncomfortable for them or it’s a victory for them because maybe they made somebody think twice about something they may have said. And so [sharing BGMs] gives students an opportunity to air what’s on their mind, given that they may not have another place to open up. (interview, J.J., May 28, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Student GSA members responded to difficult moments they encountered outside of the GSA with varying degrees of confidence, clearly indicating that they were in a period of fluctuation in their growth. The challenges students faced outside of the safe environs of Freedom High School served as reminders of the importance of the adult support they received at school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0013189X13491977">
<title>Presence of Supportive Adults</title>
<p>In addition to the students’ knowledge, activism, and reflection revealed in the GSA at Freedom High School, one critical component requires further exploration. The final element that made this GSA stand out was the presence of multiple adults who supported the critical pedagogy enacted by the advisor. There was no question in students’ minds that their advisor supported their development as young adults. What <italic>was</italic> surprising to the GSA members was that so many other adults at school shared J.J.’s desire to see them grow, question norms, evolve, and learn to live as authentically as possible. For Jake, an openly gay junior, the presence of other adults indicated to him that J.J.’s classroom was not the only safe space at school. He commented, “Once you get to know them, it’s completely cool. You know they support [LGBTQ] issues; so having them discuss what they feel is helpful because now I know that I can go into many classrooms and be safe there” (interview, Jake, May 28, 2009).</p>
<p>Karen did not stress a need for safety, but revealed that her overall comfort level increased after the initial shock of seeing a large number of adults at GSA meetings.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t know there would be SO many adults when I first started coming! But when I saw that, I think it was a really good thing because I think it goes back to that aspect that everyone is on the same level at GSA. So, it didn’t feel like, “Oh, there’s teacher supervision!” It feels more like, “Oh, there are more allies who want to come and talk about this and actually care about this.” And it did show me some people in the [school] community who I might not have necessarily guessed would be supportive. The more people you know are supportive, the more comfortable you feel. (interview, Karen, May 29, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>J.J. also commented on the importance of having supportive colleagues at Freedom High School and, like the students, expressed a degree of surprise and gratitude. When she told me about a student who revealed his or her sexual orientation at school last year, she remembered that the student was able to consult several teachers during that process.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I had a student who came out this year, and in the course of coming out had conversations with six teachers and five of them . . . <italic>five of them</italic> [J.J.’s emphasis] where the student was convinced [to act] after hearing something the teachers said or seeing something that the teachers had in the room. To me, it is almost <italic>miraculous</italic> that so many adults could be that supportive and show that outwardly in a way so that a student would [feel] safe enough to approach them and say who they are and what they are going through. (interview, J.J., May 28, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The presence of multiple adults at GSA meetings sent a clear signal to the students in attendance. It indicated that they, too, support queer issues, queer spaces, and the queer students who occupy those spaces. Even though J.J. has worked over many years to make the GSA a safe, supportive space for all students, if hers was the only perceived safe space, then students would remain on-guard and positive effects of the critical pedagogy enacted during GSA meetings would be severely limited.</p>
<p>Just as students’ access to queer issues/knowledge signaled inclusivity and openness at GSA meetings, the adult presence at GSA meetings indicated widespread support, giving students permission to seek out queer knowledge in other spaces at school. One student completed a project in his Gender Studies class that was completely queer-focused, whereas another student adorned his self-portrait in Art class with queer symbols, in part because the instructors for both courses had attended GSA meetings throughout the school year. The presence of many adults also reminded students that they had understanding allies, even when they felt vulnerable or frustrated following a negative Big Gay Moment centered on a trusted adult family member or community institution such as a place of worship. One student commented, “It took me a long time to [participate in GSA] because my church is so strict.” Referring to comments heard at her church, this student said, “I don’t like to hear the negative comments about gay people thrown around so casually, therefore, I will seek a more open [church] community in college” (field notes, May 14, 2009). Supportive adults at GSA meetings helped this student look beyond the limitations of her current [church] community and offered hope that she would find a more open community at some time in her future.</p>

<title>Discussion and Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>The data reveal that critical pedagogy plays a significant role in the learning experiences of GSA members at Freedom High School. Students there are consistently exposed to knowledge centered on queer themes and practice deep reflection on various lived experiences at school that have led them to take specific actions. Some actions have promoted social justice and personal transformation, whereas others have resulted in confusion, disappointment, and retreat. Moreover, there is evidence that the GSA has become a site where its focus on engaged learning and activism have moved the group beyond safe space and toward an orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X13491977">Zeichner (2010)</xref> labels a hybrid or “third” space. In this case, the third space was located <italic>within</italic> the school building, denoting a school club as a site of practitioner knowledge creation, rather than the regular classroom space or the university setting only. The potential for teacher development was revealed in this “third space” as evidenced by the activities promoted within the GSA. Specifically, when GSA members served on a panel as part of a student-teacher seminar at a local university and shared their insights, the pre-service teachers in attendance gained new perspectives on how their future classes would look and who would occupy those classroom spaces. Similarly, the practicing teachers who participated in GSA meetings were best equipped to support students during the “coming out” process based upon what they learned during the GSA meetings. In both scenarios, teachers (either pre-service or in-service) gained valuable knowledge from their connections with the GSA and (the in-service teachers) modified their classroom practices as a result.</p>
<p>Although the data point toward these favorable outcomes, one must also consider a few significant questions: (a) What factors beyond the advisor’s pedagogy may have resulted in the “success” enjoyed by Freedom High School’s GSA? (b) Why was the group so heavily dominated by students who identified as allies? (c) Why were so few people of color in attendance at GSA meetings?</p>
<p>This case study reveals that GSAs function best when existing support structures are already in place at school. At Freedom High School, nondiscrimination policies that protected LGBTQ-identified teachers were established before the GSA came into existence. Moreover, the Head of School supported the inclusion of LGBTQ-focused curriculum and publicly denounced the homophobic actions taken by the Boy Scouts of America, indicating a willingness to support the existence of a Gay–Straight Alliance at school. This scenario supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X13491977">Watson et al. (2010)</xref> that “advisors in more affirming schools may experience greater ease and comfort when advocating [for students], perhaps resulting in more active GSAs” (p. 121). Although there were challenges to overcome before the GSA at Freedom began to flourish, a top–down support structure was in place. But top–down support alone could not sustain the GSA: The advisor uncovered a formula that resulted in buy-in from the students, encouraging them to take ownership within the GSA. The explicit pedagogy she enacted facilitated support from students and adults alike, helping the GSA evolve into a long-standing site of justice that became normalized and part of the fabric in Freedom’s community. With a sense of institutional memory that comes from longevity in her position as advisor, J.J. stemmed the tide of seeing students come and go, helping the group to build on past accomplishments without a significant amount of time lost training new student leadership within the group.</p>
<p>The large numbers of White, ally-identified students who participated in Freedom High’s GSA and the lack of participation from students of color are related. Privilege and power position students to take risks or to perceive no risk at all. Some students who identified as allies may secretly question their sexual orientation or they may actively hide a queer identity because they are consistently perceived as heterosexual. In either case, these allies maintained their straight privilege, while taking advantage of what the GSA offered them. Students of color who identified as allies—in this context African American, Latino/a, and Somali students—also enjoyed straight privilege, but they, unlike their White classmates, had no adult role models at GSA meetings and only a few at Freedom High more generally. Consequently, more of them gravitated to other support structures and focused on their personhood of color or other cultural identities, while (possibly) ignoring their hidden queer identity because they feared surveillance as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X13491977">McCready (2004)</xref> and possibly having their secret revealed. Because no other faculty of color attended Freedom’s GSA meetings, a strong message was sent to these students, particularly given the noteworthy presence of minority faculty members in other diversity-centered organizations at school. The majority students at GSA were aware of their Whiteness on some level, but this awareness alone was not enough to help them combat the perception GSA had among Freedom’s students of color. Despite the presence of caring White adults at GSA meetings, their attendance at meetings was not enough to entice students of color to “come out” to the GSA meetings. Similarly, a separate group that includes a counseling focus has formed at Freedom that is open only to queer students. This indicates that some needs of queer students not yet ready to reveal their sexual orientation or have it questioned publicly are not fully being met by the GSA. Although the learning activities and reflection practiced in Freedom’s GSA demonstrate positive growth and movement in the direction envisioned by the advisor, <italic>success</italic> has yet to be attained. The membership of Freedom’s GSA indicates that White, straight-identified allies still feel more comfortable engaging in the form of critical work done at Freedom High School. Meanwhile, the transformative possibilities that critical pedagogy demands for all students, including queer and students of color, continue to be a goal and not a reality at Freedom’s GSA.</p>
<p>Despite these areas of concern, many GSA members at Freedom High School <italic>are</italic> empowered by the pedagogy enacted by their advisor to engage in the fight for social justice at their school and in their community. Their growing knowledge, deep reflection, and activism have enabled them to not only explore their dynamic identity markers, but also larger issues like privilege and heterosexism within and outside of school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013189X13491977">Robinson and Espelage (2011)</xref> presented some “important groundwork for new research in the development, implementation, and effectiveness of programs and policies aimed at improving the educational experiences and outcomes of LGBTQ youth” (p. 328). The GSA at Freedom High School and the pedagogy employed by its advisor exemplify the kind of work that will improve the educational and social outcomes for queer youth and their allies. GSA members’ ongoing inquiry, reflection, and action have changed many of their peers’ attitudes toward the LGBTQ community and helped teachers more fully comprehend the issues faced by queer students in their classrooms. In addition, this work has given students the language and the confidence to fight heterosexism and homophobia inside and outside of school. They realize that occasional setbacks will occur and that there is no <italic>straight</italic> line of progression in the fight for social justice, the struggle for self-discovery, and the battle against fear and ignorance. Rather, it is a curving, uneven path with road blocks along the way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X13491977">Robinson and Espelage (2012)</xref> conclude that in addition to bully-prevention programs, “there are a number of ways schools could try to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for LGBTQ youth” (p. 316). The <italic>process</italic> GSA members at Freedom High School engage in—knowledge acquisition, reflection, and action—represents one example of how such an inclusive and supportive learning environment may be created. But the work is far from complete and must be expanded beyond the weekly meetings of one particular school club/organization. Critical pedagogy must be practiced across multiple club and disciplinary settings in schools, disrupting some of the boundaries found between curricular and extracurricular activities. In this new space, future (and current) teachers will be better equipped to meet the needs of <italic>all</italic> their students, queer and straight alike.</p>
