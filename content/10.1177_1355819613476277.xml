<sec id="sec22-1355819613476277"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>To explore current arrangements for identifying and managing performance concerns in community pharmacists in the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1355819613476277"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 20 senior managers from community pharmacies and locum agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1355819613476277"><title>Results</title>
<p>A strong emphasis was placed on business performance alongside other aspects of professional performance in the identification of performance concerns in pharmacists. The majority of concerns were identified reactively, through customer complaints, peer- or self-referral, or following a dispensing error. Community pharmacies sought to manage performance concerns internally where possible, but only the larger organizations had the infrastructure to provide their own training or other remedial support. Several challenges to identifying and managing performance concerns were identified. There were few mechanisms for identifying and supporting locum pharmacists with performance issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1355819613476277"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Being ‘for-profit’ organizations, community pharmacies may prioritize business performance over ensuring the professional performance of pharmacists, the responsibility for which would be left to the individual pharmacist. This may be detrimental to the quality of care provided. With the growth of independent sector providers more widely, these findings may have implications for the regulation of other health care professionals’ performance.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1355819613476277" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health care systems worldwide are increasingly developing systems to ensure the fitness-to-practise of practitioners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1355819613476277">1</xref></sup> Following a number of high profile cases of catastrophic failures in the performance of doctors in the UK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1355819613476277">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1355819613476277">3</xref></sup> all health care professional regulatory bodies were tasked with reviewing their fitness-to-practise procedures to ensure their members do not pose a risk to patients and to maintain public confidence and trust.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1355819613476277">4</xref></sup> Legislative changes subsequently endowed the regulatory body for pharmacists in the UK, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC), with powers to investigate allegations of poor performance. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms currently used by employers of pharmacists for identifying and managing concerns with an individual pharmacist's performance.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1355819613476277"><title>The role and organization of community pharmacy in the UK</title>
<p>Community (retail) pharmacists play a central role in the safe and effective supply of medicines to the general population. Over the years, their role has extended from the preparation and supply of pharmaceuticals to encompass a more clinical focus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1355819613476277">5</xref></sup> including assisting patients with the management of prescribed medicines, providing advice and treatment for minor ailments, supporting self-management of long-term conditions, providing public health services and as a source of specialist knowledge about medicines for other health professionals.</p>
<p>The organization of community pharmacy differs between countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1355819613476277">6</xref></sup> In the UK, services are delivered under contract to the publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) by for-profit organizations ranging from those owned by pharmacists to national chains (‘multiples’) and supermarkets with a ‘superintendent pharmacist’ responsible for the pharmaceutical aspects of the business. Only about 12% of community pharmacists are pharmacy owners, almost half are employed as pharmacy managers or second/relief pharmacists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1355819613476277">7</xref></sup> and the rest work as locums, mostly self-employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1355819613476277">7</xref></sup> Community pharmacies also offer other products, including over-the-counter medicines and non-medicinal products such as toiletries, cosmetics and groceries.</p>
<p>Recent health care policy has sought to increase patient choice and access to services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1355819613476277">8</xref></sup> so as to increase the range and diversity of practitioners and providers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1355819613476277">9</xref></sup> raising concerns over the quality of care delivered in particular in the large multiples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1355819613476277">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1355819613476277"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1355819613476277">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1355819613476277"><title>Performance concerns in health care professionals</title>
<p>There is no generally agreed definition of ‘poor’ professional performance in the health care literature. Terms such as ‘seriously deficient performance’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1355819613476277">13</xref></sup> ‘underperformance’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1355819613476277">14</xref></sup> and ‘dyscompetence’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1355819613476277">15</xref></sup> are variously adopted, often without clear definitions. Moreover, the terms ‘competence’ and ‘performance’ are sometimes used interchangeably.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1355819613476277">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1355819613476277">17</xref></sup> We have adopted the term ‘performance concerns’ to represent occasions where the actions of a health care professional indicate an underlying deficiency in their knowledge or competence.</p>
<p>The identification of performance concerns may be either proactive or reactive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1355819613476277">18</xref></sup> Proactive mechanisms apply to all health care professionals and seek to demonstrate acceptable levels of performance through, for example, the collection of performance indicator data or employee appraisals. Reactive mechanisms apply only to the small proportion of professionals suspected of underlying performance concerns (e.g. customer complaints, peer reporting). Once identified, the management and remediation of performance concerns depend on the nature and severity of the problem(s), systems and resources within, or accessible by, the employing organization, and the involvement or otherwise of the regulatory body or other external organizations.</p>
<p>The National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS) was established in 2001 to help resolve concerns about the performance of doctors, dentists and, since 2009, pharmacists in the UK. To inform the development of its services to pharmacists, NCAS commissioned a predeployment study which aimed to determine how performance concerns about pharmacists were currently identified and managed, what challenges potential referring bodies faced in this respect and the types of help and support they needed. Our aim was to explore performance concerns among community pharmacists and how they are identified and managed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1355819613476277" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Twenty semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with senior managers of community pharmacy organizations (10 from multiples and supermarkets; seven from independents/small chains; three from locum agencies). Organizations were purposively selected to cover a range of locations (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) and organizational sizes. The identification of smaller chains and independent pharmacies was facilitated through schools of pharmacy. Locum agencies were included to provide information on pharmacists whose performance management may not come under the jurisdiction of pharmacy employers. Interviewees were selected on the basis of their role within these organizations: independent owners and superintendent pharmacists were either interviewed themselves or asked to nominate someone else in a senior position with overall responsibility for managing pharmacists’ performance; locum agencies were approached through publicized contacts and asked to provide the name of someone in a senior position who would be willing to be interviewed. We interviewed six superintendent pharmacists, three training/professional development managers, one employer's pharmacist representative, seven independent pharmacy owner/managers and three locum agency recruitment managers.</p>
<p>Topic guides were developed from existing research evidence and the study objectives. Interviews explored how pharmacists’ performance concerns were identified, how such concerns were managed and the availability of education, training or other support. Interviews further explored whether any specific issues existed in relation to the identification and management of performance concerns in locum pharmacists. The interviews asked about challenges faced in identifying and managing performance concerns, and what further support might be beneficial. Interviews lasted approximately 30 min, were audio recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were thematically analysed, aided by NVivo software, using a coding frame developed initially around the topic guides but later modified using themes derived from the data.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1355819613476277" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec6-1355819613476277"><title>Performance concerns in community pharmacy</title>
<p>Interviewees described a range of concerns about pharmacists’ performance relating to behaviour and professional attitudes (timekeeping, appearance and teamworking), communication (poor communication skills and language difficulties), clinical and dispensing skills (dispensing errors, inaccurate advice and non-compliance with standard operating procedures) and legal issues (theft and misuse of controlled drugs register). They were also aware of the possible range of underlying causes, particularly in relation to health and wellbeing (stress and other mental health issues, alcohol and substance misuse).</p>
<p>For the large multiples, dispensing errors were a commonly cited example of a performance concern. However, it was also apparent that a key concern was business targets, and pharmacists were seen to be underperforming when those targets were not being met:<disp-quote>
<p>‘We have targets and goals to achieve, and with electronic reports … the information is quickly there to see who is performing and who’s not. These are basically business targets and also development objectives etcetera but primarily business targets across the whole range of business, professional, operational, commercial, people leadership’. (Multiple 7)</p></disp-quote>The issues raised by independent and small chain owners were more often about poor customer service, attitude to work (motivation and timekeeping), dispensing errors and theft:<disp-quote>
<p>‘I don’t know … how far reaching you go with performance … I would think well really dispensing and actually doing the job that needs to be done to get, you know, have the prescriptions done. But I suppose if you’re including performance in how they deal with other people, it kind of widens it out a bit’. (Independent 2)</p></disp-quote>Representatives from the locum agencies, in contrast, had a tendency to emphasize ‘personality clashes’, slow work pace and language and communication difficulties in relation to concerns about locum pharmacists’ performance:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Sometimes it’s personality clashes; sometimes it’s appearance, might be scruffy or it might be a hygiene problem. Or there may be more serious things like they make a mistake, a dispensing error or you know they’re not always … sometimes the locums don’t always perform what they’re supposed to do in the shop’. (Locum agency 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1355819613476277"><title>Identifying performance concerns</title>
<p>A number of different mechanisms were used to identify performance concerns in pharmacists. These involved predominantly reactive rather than proactive processes. The most common mechanisms were customer complaints and peer reporting, although self-report and error reporting systems were also used:<disp-quote>
<p>‘The people that would identify [a performance concern] on the whole would be either the practitioners themselves for self-referral – that, I have to say, is very, very rare – or it would be principally picked up, presumably, either through a complaint or it could be a dispensing error or incident which would be picked up through our reporting system or ultimately I guess it could be that somebody would ring me and say “I’ve got concerns through an observation” or whatever’. (Multiple 6)</p></disp-quote>For many of the smaller organizations, these were the only mechanisms available. For the large multiples, however, a number of mechanisms were also available which had the potential for identifying performance concerns more proactively, including audit and regular monitoring of error reporting systems. Moreover, all of the larger organizations had well-established systems of appraisal for pharmacist employees (these were rarely found in the small chain or independent pharmacies). However, whilst elements of professional and clinical performance were considered in some systems of appraisal, their focus was more often on business competencies and targets. Moreover, some respondents were concerned that recording systems were not adequate to monitor patterns of performance concerns; others that problems only came to light when they had escalated out of control. This was a particular concern if employers were relying on the appraisal system to identify performance concerns, since it could mean issues were left too long and dealt with too late:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Appraisals happen on an annual basis with an interim review and we couldn’t possibly leave it for an appraisal to identify poor performance and bring it to the attention of the individual. So they’re a great tool for bringing stuff together and documenting but ultimately, poor performance, as a business, we very much encourage that those conversations are had at the time’. (Multiple 9)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1355819613476277"><title>Managing pharmacists with performance concerns</title>
<p>The majority of performance concerns, once identified, appeared to be managed internally by employers unless they were so serious that they warranted referral to the pharmacy regulator. Within the larger organizations, a variety of strategies were available for managing performance concerns. Most had access to human resources and/or occupational health departments for cases relating to ill health or psychological wellbeing. The majority also offered a range of intramural training programmes, although for clinical training and development activities, external providers were more commonly utilized. A smaller number of respondents from multiples also mentioned using ‘buddy’ or shadowing schemes whereby a pharmacist could obtain peer support and advice whilst learning from another pharmacist. Others, however, perceived the additional cost of such doubling up of pharmacists prohibitive. Intramural programmes of remediation were often based around action planning for the individual and supported by regular review, building on existing systems of appraisal. Relocation was also an option for pharmacists working for multiples. However, in more serious cases of performance concerns, these organizations could initiate disciplinary procedures, sometimes leading to dismissal, or refer to external agencies such as the pharmacy regulator or the police:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Well I suppose it depends on the nature and the severity of [the performance concern]. So it would range from the provision of additional training and an action plan being put together with the support and input of the individual themselves, through ultimately I suppose to dismissal. But I’d hope what we’d have is a number of steps along that journey and they could include amongst them shadowing another practitioner. For example, if the situation is one of an environment issue, the location, the level of business or whatever it may be, we have got the option to re-position that practitioner’. (Multiple 10)</p></disp-quote>In the smaller or independent community pharmacies, performance concerns were managed more informally. Without the organizational infrastructure available to the larger multiples, concerns were more likely to be managed on a one-to-one basis with the pharmacy owner or manager. Remedial training was accessed almost exclusively from external suppliers. Procedures for managing performance concerns, as in the larger organizations, were likely to be graded depending on the severity of the concern, with disciplinary procedures being brought to bear where necessary and referral made to the regulator in concerns about fitness-to-practise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1355819613476277"><title>Challenges in identifying and managing performance concerns</title>
<p>A number of challenges were reported in relation to identifying and managing performance concerns in community pharmacists. Many respondents perceived existing systems for managing performance concerns, for example through referral to the regulator, as punitive rather than supportive, discouraging individuals from coming forward with concerns. This could be exacerbated by a reluctance or inability by individual pharmacists to admit that they had a problem, a lack of clear benchmarks against which a pharmacist's performance could be measured and the professional isolation of many pharmacists. Furthermore, many interviewees encountered challenges in identifying performance concerns at an early enough stage to prevent any escalation or risks to patient safety:<disp-quote>
<p>‘People work in isolation really. And if they’re underperforming, and perhaps not realising it themselves, we really rely on the support staff or the line managers … to identify the poor performance and escalate it. And if that doesn’t happen because of poor communication or fear of reprisal or whatever then it’s difficult to identify it. I think at the moment because there hasn’t really been anything, a body like NCAS up until now … you had to wait until something drastic happened before something was done about it’. (Multiple 2)</p></disp-quote>Interviewees both from the larger organizations and independents perceived that there was a need for an independent mediator to provide support to pharmacists with performance concerns – someone out with the employing organization but not based in the regulator – and to help with signposting to appropriate training or other remediation activities. For independent pharmacies in particular, who lacked any intramural training or occupational health provision, the idea of a ‘one-stop shop’ providing signposting, support and advice to pharmacists and their employers was particularly attractive. A gap was also perceived in the provision of support for underperforming pharmacists with underlying problems with their health or wellbeing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1355819613476277"><title>Identifying and managing performance concerns in locum pharmacists</title>
<p>The transient nature of many locum pharmacists’ positions was a particular challenge for community pharmacy employers in identifying and managing performance concerns. Information about underperforming locums was not shared between organizations, and interviewees noted that this had potential implications for patient safety:<disp-quote>
<p>‘As for locums they are a huge concern … because they’re such a fractured workforce because they have such mobility and you really don’t know what’s happening from one end of the country to the other. It’s very difficult to track them’. (Multiple 3)</p></disp-quote>Moreover, there was neither a clear line of responsibility for monitoring locums’ performance nor access to performance management procedures such as employers’ systems of appraisal to aid identification of performance concerns:<disp-quote>
<p>‘You’re not allowed to appraise locums because that classes them as an employee and gives you a tax and national insurance issue’. (Multiple 8)</p></disp-quote>The performance of locum pharmacists was more often assessed informally by employers and contractors through peer reporting and customer complaints. For locum agencies, there was a reliance on reactive feedback from employers to identify poorly performing locums which was often not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Options open to employers in dealing with underperforming locums were primarily limited to terminating their appointment (or not reappointing them) and/or reporting them to the pharmacy regulator, a situation that frustrated many employers. However, a small number of employers stated that they would, and had, offered support to long-serving locums:<disp-quote>
<p>‘If it’s somebody that I really felt I could work with and improve and felt it was worth an investment of my time then definitely there are things that can be done. But I think my action would be to just move on and use a different locum’. (Independent 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1355819613476277" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are important differences in the ways in which community pharmacies, as private businesses, conceptualize ‘performance’ which has implications for the ways in which performance concerns are identified and managed. There is a reliance on reactive mechanisms for identifying performance concerns and a need identified for independent support with their management. Particular difficulties existed in the identification and management of performance concerns in locum pharmacists.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1355819613476277"><title>What is ‘performance’ in community pharmacy?</title>
<p>‘Performance’ is a multidimensional concept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1355819613476277">17</xref></sup> which can be influenced by a myriad of individual and workplace factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1355819613476277">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1355819613476277">19</xref></sup> Crucially, the organizational context in community pharmacy is unique in having to balance both the delivery of high-quality health care and profit-making activities. Many similarities to other professions existed in pharmacists’ performance described by pharmacy representatives such as behaviour and professional attitudes, communication skills and clinical competencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1355819613476277">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1355819613476277">17</xref></sup> However, a major difference was the strong business focus of the descriptions of performance concerns and the mechanisms by which they were identified. The implication of this is that employers may not currently be taking responsibility for the professional performance of their pharmacists as part of their ‘duty of care’ towards their employees. Moreover, by primarily judging pharmacists’ performance against business targets, the resulting pressure may be detrimental to performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1355819613476277">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1355819613476277">12</xref></sup> This dissonance in the interpretation of ‘performance’ must be recognized should employers be expected to take on any additional responsibilities for ensuring community pharmacists’ fitness-to-practise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1355819613476277">20</xref></sup> Moreover, this may have implications for the regulation of other professionals’ performance more widely, where increasing numbers are employed by private, for-profit organizations providing publically funded services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1355819613476277"><title>How should performance concerns be identified?</title>
<p>The predominantly reactive approach taken by community pharmacy organizations to identifying performance concerns mirrors the situation in medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1355819613476277">21</xref></sup> However, the problem with reactive mechanisms is that they are ad hoc, rarely recorded systematically and risk alerting the employer to performance concerns only once a mistake has been made. Moreover, there was, unsurprisingly, a reliance on identifying aspects of performance that were easy to measure, such as dispensing errors. This unidimensional approach is inadequate for assessing what is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon and it risks missing underlying causes, whether in relation to a pharmacist's competence or skills, or to their health and wellbeing. The ‘professional isolation’ of many community pharmacists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1355819613476277">22</xref></sup> further exacerbates these difficulties. As with single-handed doctors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1355819613476277">23</xref></sup> working in professional isolation can cause stress for community pharmacists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1355819613476277">24</xref></sup> as well as affect ethical decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1355819613476277">22</xref></sup> Not only may this, in itself, be detrimental to pharmacists’ performance but it may also reduce self-awareness of problems when they occur by having no other pharmacist against whom they can measure their own performance.</p>
<p>Whilst some proactive mechanisms for identifying performance concerns (such as systems of appraisal) exist in the larger community pharmacy organizations, their focus on business targets suggests that they may not be suitable for identifying aspects of professional performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1355819613476277">20</xref></sup> Thus, pharmacists may not use appraisals as an opportunity to seek support or remediation in these areas if they suspect that is necessary. This supports the need to develop additional proactive mechanisms for the early identification of performance concerns to prevent any undetected concerns escalating to the point where patients are put at risk. Indeed, to address this need, new systems of revalidation for health care professionals are currently being implemented in the UK, initially for doctors but subsequently for pharmacists and others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1355819613476277"><title>What support is required for those with performance concerns?</title>
<p>Most community pharmacy organizations sought to manage employee pharmacists with performance concerns internally, and many, particularly the larger organizations, had a range of strategies they could use. Locating external support, however, through support organizations or training providers presented more difficulties. This appeared to be a particular challenge for independent and small-chain pharmacies which lacked the organizational infrastructure of the multiples. These findings suggest that there is a need for improved knowledge of available support, a challenge NCAS could meet. Moreover, NCAS as an independent intermediary may also fulfil the need for an impartial mediator.</p>
<p>That a mediator such as NCAS has a role to play is illustrated in their early experience of providing support for pharmacists, receiving 63 referrals about the performance of individual pharmacists, and a further 24 requests from employers seeking general advice within the first 15 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1355819613476277">25</xref></sup> There is a risk that by increasing their reliance on an external support organization to manage pharmacists’ performance concerns, organizations may see no need to develop further their own duty of care towards their employees. However, the pharmacy regulator may also have a role through regulation and inspection in ensuring that employers take more responsibility for the fitness-to-practise of their employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1355819613476277"><title>Locum pharmacists</title>
<p>Locums make up approximately one-third of the UK community pharmacy workforce, yet these findings suggest that there are few mechanisms available by which their performance is monitored, concerns identified or remedial support provided. Whilst there is no reason to suspect that locum pharmacists perform to a lower standard than employee pharmacists, they do face additional challenges such as a lack of familiarity with new systems and surroundings and a lack of support from other staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1355819613476277">26</xref></sup> However, with the majority of concerns with locum pharmacists’ performance appearing from these interviews to be ‘managed’ through dismissal, these are likely to go unrecorded and unchecked. This poses a potential threat to patients whereby knowledge of performance concerns does not get passed on from organization to organization and will only be addressed if they become fitness-to-practise issues referred to the regulator. In medicine, calls have been made for the tighter regulation of locum agencies and for NHS organizations to record and report performance information about locum doctors systematically to minimize any threat to patient safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1355819613476277">27</xref></sup> Similar developments may also be of some benefit in community pharmacy. The introduction of a ‘performer's list’ for UK pharmacists, which would be held by local health care commissioners, has recently been legislated for and may be particularly useful in cases of locum pharmacists with performance concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1355819613476277">28</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1355819613476277"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The relatively small sample/sub-sample size from which these findings are drawn limits their generalizability to all community pharmacy organizations in the UK. Nonetheless, as an exploratory study, these qualitative interviews produced a depth and breadth of views providing a unique and valuable insight into the conceptualization and management of health care practitioners’ performance concerns by private sector health care organizations.</p>
