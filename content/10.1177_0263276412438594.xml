<abstract>
<p>Certain of Kant’s political essays suggest that the project of socio-political emancipation should be seen as a process of working ourselves out of affective attachments to pathological social relations. This aspect of Kant’s thinking is read through Marx’s materialist notion of commodity fetishism, which provides a paradigmatic approach to understanding the ways in which concrete forms of sociality either thwart or facilitate the process of emancipation. It is then suggested that Freud’s notion of the work of mourning can help to clarify the possibility of breaking with the fixated attachments that contribute to our own domination. In this light, the author considers the respective accounts of the relationship between Freudian theory and Kantian cosmopolitanism given by Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler in light of Theodor Adorno’s materialist account of working-through the past. Reading Freud with Adorno offers a more coherent clarification of the concrete conditions of possibility of cosmopolitanism.</p>

<p>In his political essays, Kant’s project is connected with socio-political emancipation. On one hand, emancipation is conceived in terms of cosmopolitanism and enlightenment to come, which are claimed to provide the meaning of history for rational beings. On the other hand, emancipation is conceived as a concrete process of working ourselves out of a pathological socio-historical legacy. It is notable that Kant links this legacy with the reproduction of affective forms of fixated sociality, suggesting that emancipation would involve a process of working-through our affective attachments to pathological social arrangements.</p>
<p>From this perspective, one might make a connection between Kant and the respective thinking of Marx and Freud. Marx also conceives of emancipation as a process of working ourselves out of a pathological history, although, for Marx, this history is reproduced through the fetishism of commodities which structures the organization of society. Emancipation would then imply subjective abilities to bear and work-through that fetishism, as well as the social project of creating social spaces sheltered from the coercion of exchange value.</p>
<p>Freud’s analyses of <italic>melancholia</italic> and the <italic>work of mourning</italic> can contribute to an understanding of key dimensions of such pathological social fixations, as well as the possibility of working-through the past. For Freud, mourning is a process of bearing the loss of affectively-charged objects to which one is attached, and thus helps us to think about what it might take to accomplish the loss – subjectively and collectively – of the legacy of social pathologies in which we are invested. Although Freud does not integrate these concepts into a theory of socio-political emancipation, they can nonetheless be read within the Kantian and Marxian problematic that has been suggested. Theodor Adorno hints at this possibility at certain moments, and the following essay will appeal to Adorno to draw a contrast with attempts by Julia Kristeva and Judith Butler to link Freud with emancipation. In this way, the essay attempts to establish the basic feasibility of a link between emancipation and working-through.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412438594"><title>Kant: Towards Non-pathological Forms of Sociality</title>
<p>Central to Kant’s reflections on politics is an ambivalent assessment of history as, on one hand, a horrible, chaotic repetition of injustice and, on the other, a field of progress in which the world is made into a moral whole. Jean-François Lyotard has described this ambivalence as one example of the way in which Kant’s critical philosophy embraces heterogeneity in the form of the <italic>differend</italic>. On Lyotard’s account, Kantian judgment mediates between the discourse of despair and the discourse of emancipation; it ‘calls together the two parties, the one who says that human history is simply disorder, and the one who says it is organized by a providential nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438594">Lyotard, 1988</xref>: 163). In so doing, the ‘passages’ of judgment avoid the injustice of foreclosing on either discourse, and allows each to interrogate the other, within an affective experience of heterogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412438594">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is notable that in his analysis of this aspect of Kant’s philosophy, Lyotard recognizes that the passages between these heterogeneous discourses are fundamentally <italic>affective</italic>, and that he characterizes the social experience of judgment in terms of the ‘affective paradox’ of the Kantian sublime. Nonetheless, in Lyotard’s account, the sociality of affectivity is conceived in abstraction from historical concreteness, in the sense that it is experienced by the ‘critical watchman’ in the intrasubjective passage between discourses. The sociality of the experience of sublime enthusiasm arises from the <italic>sensus communis</italic>, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438594">Lyotard characterizes as ‘an appeal to community carried out <italic>a priori</italic>’ (1988: 169)</xref>. Thus, within concrete historical upheaval, one might legitimately judge – along with others in one’s community – that progress toward cosmopolitanism is taking place, because the discourse of freedom is constituted by the interpretation of signs, not by determinative judgment. Although Lyotard does point out that for Kant culture is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for judgment, there is no development of the idea that the relationship between <italic>concrete</italic> social arrangements and affectivity may be of importance.</p>
<p>Whereas Lyotard primarily draws on Kant’s characterization of reflective judgment in the third <italic>Critique</italic>, there are other aspects of Kant’s political essays that account for the affective and concretely social dimensions of the ambivalence discussed by Lyotard. These aspects invite an interrogation of the concrete social conditions of the affective <italic>passages</italic> that on Lyotard’s account are primarily performed in the consciousness of the critical watchman. Kant implies that the ability to have such experiences of heterogeneity has concrete socio-historical conditions of possibility; thus, the goal of criticism would not merely be the clarification of its transcendental conditions of possibility, but also of its <italic>historical and political</italic> conditions of possibility. Such clarification has a concretely-situated character, primarily in its contestation of religious and other traditional social arrangements which condition affectivity. Criticism would therefore not merely be an internal, subjective activity, but also a concretely, socio-historically situated activity which responds to, or <italic>works through</italic>, the socially-conditioned and shared suffering of theocratic and other dominations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276412438594">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This suggests another way to approach the concept of passage as the concrete <italic>suffering</italic> of history, rather than as the ambivalent space of judgment – albeit affective – of the critical watchman. Drawing on Freudian concepts, one might say that, on one hand, this suffering is melancholic, i.e. tied to an unbearable pathological history that can only be escaped through an imagined ideal. On the other hand, this suffering can take the form of an ordeal in which that pathological history is mournfully borne, and worked-through. There is much in Kant’s philosophy that seems decidedly melancholic. For example, Kant writes of the subject:<disp-quote>
<p>with a will free from impulses of sensibility he transfers himself in thought into an order of things altogether different from that of his desires in the field of sensibility, since from that wish he can expect no satisfaction of his desires and hence no condition that would satisfy any of his actual or other otherwise imaginable inclinations … he can expect only a greater inner worth of his person. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412438594">Kant, 1997</xref>: 59)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Freud, melancholia is a neurosis in which unbearable concrete life is disavowed and lost love objects are introjected, taking on an idealized form <italic>within the subject</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 249–50). Thus, the appeal to subjective power or ideals can be read as an expression of an affectivity that cannot be borne. Hannah Arendt describes Kant’s melancholia in her provocative lectures on Kant’s political philosophy, where she suggests that the political essays reflect the overall shift in Kant’s philosophy from the emphasis on the moral law in his analyses of practical reason to an emphasis on <italic>purposiveness</italic> which guides the third <italic>Critique</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412438594">Arendt, 1989</xref>: 25–7). Here, Kant asserts that reason necessarily projects a teleology into nature, which is a condition of possibility for our faculty of judgment and governs our assessment of history. Arendt writes that, for Kant,<disp-quote>
<p>history is a part of nature; the historical subject is the human species understood as part of creation, though as its final end and creation’s crown, so to speak. What matters in history, whose haphazard, contingent melancholy he never forgot, are not the stories, not the historical individuals, nothing that men did of good or evil, but the secret ruse of nature that caused the species to progress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412438594">Arendt, 1989</xref>: 8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One might say that in reaction to the suffered absurdity of socio-historical life, melancholic Kant seems to animistically posit a natural tendency towards progress. Only a ‘secret ruse of nature’ could save us.</p>
<p>In <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic>, Adorno and Horkheimer also emphasize this melancholic character of Kant’s thinking. In reference to Kant, they write: ‘The difficulties within this concept of reason, arising from the fact that its subjects, the bearers of one and the same reason, are in real opposition to each other, are concealed in the Western Enlightenment behind the apparent clarity of its judgments … the whole represents the idea of a true universal utopia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412438594">Adorno and Horkheimer, 2002</xref>: 65). On this reading, the Kantian idea of society as moral whole is simply a projection of an appealing ideality that takes the form of a disavowal of suffering. Because conflict cannot be borne, the desire for amelioration separates itself in fantasy from the concrete so that it can survive. A bit later they write: ‘The root of Kantian optimism, according to which moral actions are reasonable even when base ones are likely to prosper, is a horror of relapsing into barbarism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412438594">Adorno and Horkheimer, 2002</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>Despite this melancholic element in Kantian theory, there are moments in his work which point toward a more mournful encounter with history – in the sense of Freud’s characterization of mourning as process of working-through loss, in contrast with the dissociative fixation characteristic of melancholia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 244–55). One can see glimmers of this gesture in the ‘Preface to the First Edition’ of the <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic>, where Kant claims that critique originates in <italic>judgment</italic>, which is characterized by varying levels of <italic>maturity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412438594">Kant, 1965</xref>: 9). In the linking of history with judgment’s maturation, Kant avows the concrete socio-historical embeddedness of critique. Kant writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Our age is, in especial degree, the age of criticism, and to criticism everything must submit. Religion through its sanctity, and law-giving through its majesty, may seek to exempt themselves from it. But they awaken just suspicion, and cannot claim the sincere respect which reason accords only to that which has been able to sustain the test of free and open examination. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412438594">Kant, 1965</xref>: 9)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Criticism is thus claimed to be the source of legitimacy that has superseded that of traditional forms of legitimacy found in uncritical claims to <italic>sanctity</italic> and <italic>majesty</italic>. In some sense, this seems to be a simple expression of the standard enlightenment assertion of the propriety of reason over religion. However, insofar as the persistence of uncritical religious and political authority is avowed, Kant is also testifying to the concrete social struggle of his historical moment against regressive forms of religious and legal power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276412438594">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In ‘Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose’, Kant describes modernity as a transition in which ‘a <italic>pathologically</italic> enforced social union is transformed into a <italic>moral</italic> whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 45). Kant is clear that this transition is concretely social, i.e. it cannot be achieved simply with the proper individual use of reason. He writes:<disp-quote>
<p>In man … those natural capacities which are directed towards the use of his reason are such that they could be fully developed only in the species, but not in the individual … reason does not itself work instinctively, for it requires trial, practice and instruction to enable it to progress gradually from one stage of insight to the next. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 42)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Kant, modernity is the transition from pernicious forms of sociality to new forms of sociality, marked by the ascendance of a need for a diversity of others to teach, criticize and concretely experiment together. Moreover, this transition must be continually historical, in the sense that past work must be worked-through so that new work becomes possible. The use and development of reason presupposes a complex respect for cosmopolitanism that is threatened by dominant forms of religion and traditional authority that legitimate themselves through emotional appeals to sanctity and majesty. Yet, Kant says that his particular historical moment – which is perhaps not so distant from our own – was ‘little beyond the half-way mark’, claiming that humanity has yet ‘to endure the hardest of evils under the guise of outward prosperity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 49). He argues that despite seemingly high levels of cultivation and civilization, ‘we are still a long way from the point where we could consider ourselves morally mature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 49). This would take ‘a long internal process of careful work on the part of each commonwealth’, by which the human race would work itself out of ‘the chaotic state of its political relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 49). As suggested above, the casting of this transition as <italic>work</italic> might be read through Freud’s appeal to the work of mourning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276412438594">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kant’s essay ‘An Answer to the Question: “What is Enlightenment?”’ begins with the well-known definition: ‘Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s own understanding without the guidance of another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 54). This appeal to ‘emergence’ and ‘maturation’ coincides with the conception of the social work of politics. Initially, Kant suggests that immaturity is <italic>self-incurred</italic> – suggesting that a resolute, courageous use of reason could in itself lead us out of our political immaturity. Yet Kant adds that reason’s coming to itself is more likely to occur in societies in which freedom <italic>is granted</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 55). Kant here acknowledges that enlightenment is conditioned by concrete social arrangements, and he designates religious guardianship as ‘the most pernicious and dishonorable’ enemy to enlightenment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 59). He writes: ‘An age cannot enter into an alliance on oath to put the next age in a position where it would be impossible for it to extend and correct its knowledge …this would be a crime against human nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 57). Kant thus portrays the inherent political and historical situatedness of criticism, which must struggle with forms of sociality that seek to destroy it.</p>
<p>To be critical, then, is to find oneself in tension between fixated forms of traditional authority which continue to shape us and emerging cosmopolitan forms of society. Kant’s reference to the need of society to work itself out of immaturity demonstrates its concrete, social nature, and he notes the affective character of such work that is frightening for those who have grown fond of dominating or being dominated. Kant writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The guardians who have kindly taken upon themselves the work of supervision will soon see to it that by far the largest part of mankind (including the entire fair sex) should consider the step forward to maturity not only as difficult but also as highly dangerous. Having first infatuated their domestic animals, and carefully prevented the docile creatures from daring to take a single step without the leading-strings to which they are tied, they next show them the danger which threatens them if they try to walk unaided. Now this danger is not in fact so very great … But an example of this kind is intimidating, and usually frightens them off from further attempts … it is difficult for each separate individual to work his way out of the immaturity which has become almost second nature to him. He has even grown fond of it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 54)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Kant describes the affective basis of the social reproduction of immaturity: institutionalized guardianship produces immature subjects, who then reproduce the same institutions. This cycle is enabled by affective forms of sociality that could only be broken slowly and socially – not from a mere personal decision or revolution, which would simply leave the immaturity intact to be repeated in a new form. To be clear, the claim is not that Kant achieves a materialist account of history, but merely that within his persistent idealism, a certain avowal of material conditions shows through. For example, Kant’s idealism is evident when he writes: ‘once the germ on which nature has lavished most care – man’s inclination and vocation to <italic>think freely</italic> – has developed within this hard shell, it gradually reacts upon the mentality of the people, who thus gradually become increasingly able to <italic>act freely</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991a</xref>: 59). Yet, at the same time, he implies that to facilitate this long, social process of maturation, there are two concrete conditions which must be provided by society and the world community: the establishment of the free public use of reason in coordination with constrained private use of reason. In contrast with forms of sociality constituted by affective guardianship – theocracy, feudalism, etc. – such conditions would facilitate a form of sociality in which affective maturity would be encouraged and required. A social space that is protected from the fear aroused by guardians through appeals to the sanctity and majesty of their authority could be seen as enabling the social struggle of ‘trial, practice, and instruction’ that are essential to reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 42). Moreover, since reason progresses through the grappling with history, one might say that this non-coercive social space enables the working-through of the past.</p>
<p>Kant thereby lays down a prototype of the conditions for the possibility of an emancipatory form of sociality: a public space in which religious or ideological power would be countered by the force of law which preserves the free space of criticism by rigid restrictions on the private use of reason. One might say that this would create and protect a transitional space of affective sociality. Given Kant’s claim that cultural maturation is driven by the antagonism inherent to human society, and that critique is produced from a need to overcome concrete conflicts between individuals, groups, countries, and civilizations, the distinction between private and public uses of reason would facilitate the peaceful working-through of that antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412438594">Kant, 1991b</xref>: 44). Kant thus places a premium on forms of sociality that facilitate the tolerance of cosmopolitan heterogeneity – in what he calls our ‘unsocial sociability’ – such that social antagonism can take an increasingly less violent, less fixated form.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412438594"><title>Guardianship and Fetishism</title>
<p>Kant was obviously one of the targets of Marx’s materialist critique of idealism: in <italic>The German Ideology</italic>, for example, Marx refers to Kant as the ‘whitewashing spokesman’ of the German burghers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412438594">Marx, 2004: 99</xref>). At the same time, Marx’s project might be understood as a recasting – albeit obviously not uncritical recasting – of the Kantian project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276412438594">5</xref></sup> Kant and Marx share, for example, a critique of dominant forms of religion as forms of sociality that are coextensive with political immaturity; similarly, Marx’s view of the proletariat as the ‘universal class’ can perhaps find a prototype in Kant’s thinking of universality in terms of the <italic>kingdom of ends</italic>. Capitalism nonetheless poses a problem for enlightenment that Kant could not have foreseen – a problem indicated in the simple announcement at the beginning of the <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>: ‘The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438594">Marx, 1978</xref>: 44). Marx can thus be seen as taking up a more contemporary form of the Kantian problem of the relation between guardianship and history.</p>
<p>Borrowing the term from anthropological discourse on non-Western religious practices, Marx argues that the fetishistic character of the commodity lies at the core of capitalism. Pre-modern forms of domination, legitimated by appeals to mystical or divine truths, and which are assumed to be overcome in capitalism, persist within the modern. As suggested by the reading of Kant articulated above, however, the religious element which persists in the commodity is more than simply subjective superstition or error; rather, it indicates coercive sociality itself. Marx writes:<disp-quote>
<p>This fetishism of the world of commodities arises from <italic>the peculiar social character of the labour which produces them</italic> … the producers do not come into social contact until they exchange the products of their labour, the specific social characteristics of their private labours appear only within this exchange … the labour of the private individual manifests itself as an element of the total labour of society only through the relations which the act of exchange establishes between the products, and, through their mediation, between the producers. To the producers, therefore, the social relations between their private labours appear <italic>as what they are</italic>, i.e. they do not appear as direct social relations between persons in their work, but rather as material [<italic>dinglich</italic>] relations between persons and social relations between things. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412438594">Marx, 1977</xref>: 165–6, emphasis added)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The fetishistic character is not bestowed on the commodity as an accidental predicate – as if the problem lay merely in subjective delusion or ignorance. The commodity, i.e. the object which is endowed with exchange value, is a fetish because its exchange constitutes concrete social life within capitalism. In capitalism, labor is concretely organized as private activity which takes on social value only when the product of that labor is exchanged; this historical form of labor appears to be <italic>natural</italic> because there are no substantive alternatives. Thus, in place of entrenched forms of civil and religious guardianship that, for Kant, work to preempt political maturation, capitalist modernity enforces the obligatory form of publicness as the act of commodity exchange, imbuing it with sanctity and majesty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276412438594">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In capitalism, sociality is predominantly mediated by commodity exchange, which governs concrete relationships between human beings; like religion for our ancestors, commodity exchange permeates even our most intimate social activities – our relationships, our health, our exposure to stress and trauma, and our ability to experience as such. On this reading of fetishism, then, religion is not simply a form of mass superstition or delusion; nor is it, as in Feuerbach’s account, an anthropological projection that denies its human origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412438594">Feuerbach, 1956</xref>). Rather, religious fetishism refers to the obligatory form of sociality which establishes value. Within religious culture, fetishes and rituals have value because they constitute the way in which singular individuals are social – to neglect or refuse the fetish is to neglect or refuse the others. Without that social value, which brings with it approval, cooperation, love, rights, health, opportunity, etc., life is impossible.</p>
<p>The violence implicit in commodity fetishism can be seen explicitly in Marx’s discussions of <italic>estranged labor</italic> and <italic>primitive accumulation</italic>. For Marx, estrangement is to be understood as concretely social, rather than as some sort of abstract characteristic of the essence of human beings. The laborer ‘begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product … confers to the stranger activity which is not his own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438594">Marx, 1978</xref>: 78–9). Thus, the ‘secret’ of private property is that it arises from estranged labor itself, and not vice versa. In other words, a prehistory of coercion produced the system of private property which is now perceived to be natural; without coercive separation of the worker from others, from herself, from her world, from time and place, etc., there could be no private property, no accumulation. Moreover, Marx’s account of this concretely alienated form of sociality – capitalism – emphasizes the way in which it is self-perpetuating: ‘on the one hand it is the product of alienated labour, and … secondly it is the means by which labour alienates itself, the realization of this alienation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276412438594">Marx, 1978</xref>: 79). This argument is repeated towards the end of the first volume of <italic>Capital</italic>, where Marx de-mystifies the ideological account of the origins of wealth distribution, which characterizes the workers as lazy and immoral, and the bourgeoisie as diligent and virtuous. Marx shows that ‘primitive accumulation’ is essentially a social process of violently expropriating the masses from any means of production, so that they have no choice but to sell their labor to survive. He writes: ‘The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realize their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412438594">Marx, 1977</xref>: 432).</p>
<p>Marx helps us to see the Kantian problem of the reproduction of coercive, affectively-based social relations in a different light. The fixation of the old regime and its unchangeable symbols has simply been replaced by the fixated form of commodity fetishism. The ‘immaturity’ of guardians and of those who fondly embrace being dominated by them has simply taken the form of the love of commodity exchange, which is the locus of universality within capitalist modernity. This social value embodied in the commodity carries with it the concrete marks of the violence by which primitive accumulation transformed, and continues to coercively transform, alternative forms of political economies into industrial wage labor. In so far as exchange implies coercive guardianship, it continually invokes subtle forms of sanctities and majesties of private property, which subvert the sheltered forms of cosmopolitan criticism that Kant valorized. Following the glimmers of materiality that we claim to have found in Kant’s depiction of his historical moment – in the transition to non-pathological forms of cosmopolitanism which entails the need to expand the objective conditions that facilitate maturity – Marx can be seen as contributing to the clarification of the concrete conditions for the possibility of new forms of non-fixated cosmopolitanism. Following Marx, one would have to conceive of such a transition as de-fetishizing and de-alienating, in which the coercive eternally-recurring origin of capitalism – expropriation – would be interrupted, and the possibility for non-fetishized forms of creative sociality that could repair alienation would be fostered.</p>
<p>This analysis of fetishism as the way in which domination is reproduced as a form of affective fixation must be read in the context of the themes of struggle and emancipation so central to Marx’s thinking. Emancipation as the overcoming of fetishism would take both a subjective and social form. On one hand, there must be subjective struggle with and within fetishized sociality, which would require an ability to bear non-conformity with the fetish. Such struggle would work-through one’s internalized socialization within concrete social conditions which work to reinforce that internalization. At the same time, there must be a collective effort to create and protect social spaces free of the enforced affective coercion that reproduces commodity fetishism.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412438594"><title>Freud, Kristeva, Butler</title>
<p>There is a Freudian account of the reproduction of, and emancipation from, pathological social conditions that we identified in the theories of Kant and Marx. Theodor Adorno has suggested that although Freud’s later works emphasize the individual, they inform a sociological assessment of mass culture. Adorno writes:<disp-quote>
<p>According to Freud, the problem of mass psychology is closely related to the new type of psychological affliction so characteristic of the era which for socio-economic reasons witnesses the decline of the individual and his subsequent weakness. While Freud did not concern himself with social changes, it may be said that he developed within the monadological confines of the individual the traces of its profound crisis and willingness to yield unquestioningly to powerful, outside collective agencies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412438594">Adorno, 1982</xref>: 116)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Such a sociological reading of Freud can contribute to a wider reflection on emancipation. One might say that, for Freud, manic-depressive culture – culture dominated by the cultural superego and the mania typical of group psychology – produces traumatically dissociated subjects who are then appropriated into social forms of manic-depression, reproducing those forms which impose further trauma. The self-perpetuating interrelationship between trauma and symptom arises from their concrete character. Like estrangement and capitalism, trauma and symptoms are not merely ‘in the mind’, but rather forms of concrete sociality, suffered in a manner that reproduces itself.</p>
<p>Freud’s later writings contain a preoccupation with the neuroses, melancholia and mania. On Freud’s account, a neurosis is a defense against trauma; the repetitious symptoms serve to help the neurotic avoid an encounter with the unbearable. In melancholia, the inability to mourn, i.e. the inability to bear the traumatic loss of a love object, has taken the form of the internalization of the object. In other words, the melancholic cannot detach herself or himself from the complex affective investments in the lost object, maintains the attachment as an internalized fixation, and is thus unable to accomplish loss. Freud thus describes melancholia in terms of an obliteration of temporality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001b: 276</xref>). Mania is the periodic affective release from melancholic fixation in intoxication, festivals, religious fanaticism, etc., so one might speak of the theme of ‘manic-depression’ in later Freud, although he never uses this exact terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001d: 131–2</xref>).</p>
<p>As a mark of the centrality of these neuroses in Freud’s later thought, the (cultural) superego itself is described as being a symptom of melancholia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 247). What Freud describes as a garrison set up within us by society for purposes of domination is itself a response to trauma, and an <italic>inability to mourn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001e</xref>: 123–4)<italic>.</italic> This then suggests a way for us to understand how affectivity might mediate the interface between concrete forms of sociality and consciousness. Dominant forms of society can be seen to enable or even produce the very trauma which leads to the melancholic response. At the same time, the appropriation of that manic-depression is used as a tool of domination. For example, in the contemporary economic crisis, more or less traumatic anxiety is produced on a mass scale. In response, various forms of manic-depressive responses to this anxiety are sold back to the anxious in the form of manic political movements and entertainment guided by corporate interests, video games offering more stimulating fantasy life, television shows empathizing with the working-class produced by those who caused the crisis, and will cause the next one, etc. We might then conceive of the break in this manic-depressive cycle in terms of mournful forms of sociality. In other words, in terms of forms of sociality that would seek to minimize the anxiety produced by contemporary forms of social life, and facilitate our abilities to bear our more or less traumatic anxiety.</p>
<p>It may be useful to note that any contemporary discussion of the topic of mourning immediately evokes the work of Jacques Derrida and several of his critics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276412438594">7</xref></sup> While it is clearly beyond the scope of this essay to give a worthy consideration of the Derridean interpretation of mourning, it seems fair to indicate the direction in which such a consideration might go. Derrida describes mourning ‘as the attempt, always doomed to failure – a constitutive failure, precisely – to incorporate, interiorize, introject, subjectivize the other in me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412438594">Derrida, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412438594">Bennington, 2010</xref>: xi). In contrast, Freud does not describe mourning as an effort at incorporating the object within the subject, but rather as a suffered ordeal in which the subject slowly, bit by bit, <italic>detaches</italic> herself from the object which had already been incompletely ‘internalized’ in the form of countless memories, expectations, etc., arising from libidinal investments in the object. Freud writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The testing of reality, having shown that the loved object no longer exists, requires forthwith that all the libido shall be withdrawn from its attachments to this object. Against this demand a struggle of course arises – it may be universally observed that man never willingly abandons a libido-position, not even when a substitute is already beckoning to him. This struggle can be so intense that a turning away from reality ensues … The task is now carried through bit by bit, under great expense of time and cathectic energy, while all the time the existence of the lost object is continued in the mind. Each single one of the memories and hopes which bound the libido to the object is brought up and hyper-cathected, and the detachment of the libido from it accomplished. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 244–5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One must immediately recognize that Freud’s claim that mourning is both normal and capable of being completed is problematic, and it is clearly one of the virtues of Derrida’s account that he insists on its impossibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276412438594">8</xref></sup> Nonetheless, Derrida’s characterization of mourning – as an (impossible) attempt to subjectively subsume the other – is in some sense the inversion of Freud’s own characterization as the work of concretely detaching one’s narcissism from the other. What is, for Derrida, an impossible action of the subject is, for Freud, a concretely undergone ordeal of the subject <italic>being worked on</italic> by suffered loss. Any fair assessment of these views would need to take this difference into account.</p>
<p>The fondness for being dominated that Kant sees as a core problem for modernity can perhaps be understood in terms of Freudian <italic>libido</italic>, which is meant to account for the diversity of attachments to other people, as well as objects and ideals which ‘stand in’ for other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 243). One’s embeddedness in culture, including one’s attachment to guardians (parents, pastors, politicians, media personalities, etc.), ideals (‘freedom’, ‘the nation’, ‘the people’, ‘private property’, etc.), and objects, can be described in terms of libidinal <italic>economy</italic>. According to Freud, ‘one never willingly abandons a libido position’, which suggests the persistence of our singular libidinal economies, and the inefficacy of mere will power to alter them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001a</xref>: 244). Freud thus uses similar language to that of Kant, speaking of mournful ‘working-through’ to account for the possible transition to new libido positions, new forms of sociality. This would be the salutary alternative to forms of sociality based on neurotic fixation characteristic of melancholia and mania.</p>
<p>Peter Homans draws on Freud’s notion of mourning to outline what he calls the ‘de-idealization experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412438594">Homans, 1989</xref>: 23–7). The latter is meant to capture the suffered <italic>ordeal</italic> of the loss of loved objects, and one must incidentally hear the implications of both terms; ‘loved’ implies affective, narcissistic attachment, and ‘the object’ constitutively exceeds and resists all attempts at containment by the one who loves and loses. It begins with the culturally embedded subject’s love or fusion with objects or ideals, i.e. with idealization. Such idealization is then inevitably fractured by concrete loss – in death, abandonment, abuse or even in simply growing up or undergoing perpetual social change – leading to a state of fear and uncertainty. From here, according to Homans, there are three alternatives: subjects can slowly, mournfully establish new ideals and new self knowledge; they can remain paralyzed by fear of the new; or they can actively rebel against the new in an attempt to retrieve the lost ideals. The salutary transitional experience outlined by Homans – from love of ideals, to loss, to fear, to the new – could be understood as a social process, and not merely subjectively. The structurally self-perpetuating character of manic-depressive sociality works to reproduce a traumatic experience of heterogeneity and the beyond of experience. In contrast, mournful sociality would facilitate abilities to negotiate, love and be vulnerable to new objects.</p>
<p>In an attempt to bridge the gap between Kantian cosmopolitanism and Freudian psychoanalysis, Julia Kristeva characterizes Kant’s view of history in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>European states considered newly discovered countries as being ‘lands without owners,’ and they have intensified their injustices toward foreigners. In order to proceed out of that dramatic situation toward the state of nations that he proposed, Kant could only call upon ‘free practical reason,’ which will accomplish no more than a design inherent in Nature itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 172)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Kant’s view is purely idealistic in Kristeva’s eyes, and she speculates that ‘cosmopolitanism as moral imperative’ could be ‘the secular form of that bond bringing together families, languages, and states that religion claimed to be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 173). Kristeva argues that this utopian ideal is possible once human beings have achieved the key Freudian insight that we are strangers to ourselves.</p>
<p>Kristeva reads Freud’s understanding of otherness, and thus cosmopolitanism, through the history of literary romanticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 181). She writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Psychoanalysis is … experienced as a journey into the strangeness of the other and of oneself, toward an ethics of respect for the irreconcilable. How could one tolerate a foreigner if one did not know one was a stranger to oneself? And to think that it has taken such a long time for that small truth, which transverses or even runs against religious uniformist tendencies, to enlighten the people of our time! Will it allow them to put up with one another as irreducible, because they are desiring, desirable, mortal, and death-bearing? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 182)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On this reading, psychoanalysis is a method of gaining knowledge of the strangeness within ourselves which leads to an ‘ethics of respect for the irreconcilable’. Kristeva claims that in Freud’s discussion of the uncanny, ‘a first step was taken that removed the uncanny strangeness from the outside, where fright had anchored it, to locate it inside … the other is my … unconscious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 183; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001c</xref>: 219–52). She praises Freud for recognizing that what had been taken to be an external strangeness was actually located <italic>inside us</italic>, enabling our loves and aggressions, complicating our efforts to achieve autonomy and self-awareness.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that not only does Kristeva read Kant straightforwardly as an idealist, she does something similar with Freud, whose key contribution to the amelioration of modern social crisis is said to lie in his <italic>recognition</italic> of our essential uncanniness, of the strangeness within us. For Kristeva, cosmopolitanism is made possible by a thorough-going <italic>awareness</italic> of our own uncanniness. We could reach Kant’s utopia, which – on her account of Kant – is simply an ideal commanded by the moral law, if we were to all become self-aware, and she wistfully bemoans the fact that this widespread self-awareness has not yet occurred: ‘to think that it has taken such a long time for that small truth, which traverses or even runs against religious uniformist tendencies, to enlighten the people of our time!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 182). In arguing that our historical task is for the ‘people of our time’ to <italic>understand</italic> Freud’s insight, and bemoaning the fact that we have not yet done so, Kristeva conspicuously omits inquiry into the concrete historical conditions of possibility for such an understanding.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis is not simply a ‘knowing’ of a truth – albeit the truth of the uncanny – but a concrete work of mourning, of working-through the legacy of manic-depression which is concretely perpetuated. With his analysis of mourning and melancholia, and the vicissitudes of libidinal cathexis, Freud provides a way for us to clarify the material conditions of any such recognition of our own uncanniness. Whereas Kristeva valorizes the possibility of a sociality grounded in uncanny self-awareness, Freud’s description of libidinal investment helps to clarify the concrete barriers to such recognition, in that melancholic fixation prevents consciousness of the legacy of loss. For Freud, traumatic loss gives rise to neurosis; because the anxiety precipitated by the loss cannot be borne, the fixation arises as a defense against the anxiety. Such fixation represents the fundamental obliteration of time and place, and an implicit inability to negotiate with unbearable otherness. The extent of our ability to <italic>recognize</italic> an internal strangeness is conditioned by our ability to <italic>bear</italic> that strangeness. In itself, the <italic>recognition</italic> of my own strangeness cannot produce an ability to mourn, and to love the strange within and without. Rather, the inverse is the case: concrete, socio-historically embedded mourning is the condition for the possibility of such recognition. Therefore, what Kristeva calls the ‘small truth’ of our own uncanny otherness cannot ‘enlighten the people’ because the <italic>culture</italic> of manic-depression concretely prevents its becoming conscious, which happens both by concretely producing or allowing trauma itself, and by thwarting the development of all means of reparation. In this way, contemporary culture produces traumatized persons, whose symptoms are channeled into institutional domination from the marketplace to religions, nationalisms, racisms, misogynies, etc.</p>
<p>For Kristeva: ‘The uncanny would thus be the royal way … by means of which Freud introduced the fascinated rejection of the other at the heart of that “our self”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991</xref>: 191). For Freud, however, there is not primarily a <italic>rejection</italic> of the other within our hearts, but rather the inability to bear the loss of particular others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276412438594">9</xref></sup> It is the melancholic inability to mourn the loss of infantile love objects, and the group appropriation of that neurosis, which makes xenophobia possible. From this Freudian perspective, the social construction of the ‘other’ which enables racism, misogyny, nationalism, etc., is a defense mechanism that is co-original with the identification and idealization of the ‘same’ within group libidinal investment. Amelioration is not produced by the ‘recognition’ of the strangeness within, but rather by the displacement of pathological forms of culture through objectively facilitating the sheltered working-through of my own radical attachment and vulnerability to concrete others. Thus, one might respond to Kristeva – when she writes that ‘Freud does not speak of foreigners: he teaches us how to detect foreignness in ourselves’ – and claim that Freud always speaks of foreigners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412438594">Kristeva, 1991: 191</xref>). He does so, first and foremost, not in terms of ‘detection’, but rather in terms of love, loss, and defense – a constellation which points towards the mother, father, siblings, and even ourselves as our first foreigners. It is within our more or less traumatic encounters with these first foreigners, according to Freud, that we learn to experience foreignness as threat or delight.</p>
<p>In her provocative text <italic>Precarious Life</italic>, Judith Butler appeals to Freud’s notion of mourning as resource for politics. Butler argues that mourning shows that the Other is within us, that we are dispossessed by the Other, and although Butler does not mention cosmopolitanism, she suggests that a new form of politics could arise from a recognition of our vulnerability to loss. Like Kristeva, however, Butler’s analysis does not do justice to the concrete conditions of possibility of the subjective shift – towards a mindfulness of our vulnerability – she seeks.</p>
<p>Appealing to certain basic features of Freud’s analysis of mourning, Butler argues that the experience of grief in the wake of loss reveals that we are dispossessed by others. More importantly, it reveals that we were never merely ourselves; ‘I’ was never merely ‘I’, but always already constitutively a relation to an other. Unlike Freud, however, Butler sees this relationality as a sort of fact about ourselves that should be <italic>recognized</italic>. She writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Many people think that grief is privatizing, that it returns us to a solitary situation and is, in that sense, depoliticizing. But I think it furnishes a sense of political community of a complex order, and it does this first of all by bringing to the fore the relational ties that have implications for theorizing fundamental dependency and ethical responsibility. If my fate is not originally or finally separable from yours, then the ‘we’ is traversed by a relationality that we cannot easily argue against; or, rather, we can argue against it, but we would be denying something fundamental about the social conditions of our very formation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412438594">Butler, 2006</xref>: 22)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Butler implies that we should <italic>accept</italic> this relationality, since it constitutes the conditions of our development. Like Kristeva, Butler argues that the recognition of this constitutive relationality would itself have salutary ethical and political implications. Lost in a supposedly self-contained narcissism, in grief we are taken out of our mistaken self-definitions, and shown a world of radical vulnerability to each other. Butler writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Mindfulness of this vulnerability can become the basis of claims for non-military political solutions, just as denial of this vulnerability through a fantasy of mastery (an institutionalized fantasy of mastery) can fuel the instruments of war. We cannot, however, will away this vulnerability. We must attend to it, even abide by it, as we begin to think about what politics might be implied by staying with the thought of corporeal vulnerability itself, a situation in which we can be vanquished or lose others. Is there something to be learned about the geopolitical distribution of corporeal vulnerability from our own brief and devastating exposure to this condition? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412438594">Butler, 2006</xref>: 29)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One cannot underestimate the importance of excavating the geopolitical exposure to vulnerability that Butler calls for. However, does my vulnerability not overly-determine my ability to do such excavation? As has been suggested, this ability presupposes an ability to mourn which is complexly entangled in concrete social histories, which Butler’s appeal to ‘mindfulness’ covers over. The ability to <italic>bear</italic> vulnerability conditions the ability to be mindful of vulnerability; the traumatized cannot attend to their vulnerability, because they are too busy defending against it. Moreover, such defenses are often socially fetishized such that abandoning them carries often traumatic consequences.</p>
<p>Butler thinks that we <italic>should</italic> calculate the ‘gain’ that can be attained from grieving as a ‘resource for politics’, from staying ‘with the sense of loss’, and she suggests that ‘to foreclose that vulnerability … is to eradicate one of the most important sources from which we must take our bearings and find our way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412438594">Butler, 2006</xref>: 30). She implies that we can calculate the advantages of bearing our suffering and then choose to do so, rather than ‘foreclose’ our vulnerability. But what is it within us, what power of <italic>mind</italic> or <italic>will</italic> or <italic>conscience</italic> that calculates advantage and either opens or forecloses on our own vulnerability? On the reading of Freud we have articulated, the power to attend to our vulnerability is not a universal human trait, but is rather a complexly, concretely socio-historical possibility, <italic>which is itself an expression of our vulnerability</italic>. My ability to bear my suffering depends upon my more or less traumatic social histories, as well as on the contemporary forms of sociality in which I am immersed.</p>
<p>Butler gives an eloquent call for analysis of the way in which cultures establish hierarchies of grief, which posit norms for identifying which and whose suffering is legitimate. Why, she asks, do we recognize some loss as legitimate, but de-realize the suffering of the Other – in the form of the sexual minority, the racial minority, the Palestinian, the Arab, the Muslim, etc. – as if their grief were non-existent, as if they were non-existent. In this way discourse, she argues, ‘effects violence through omission’. She writes: ‘What follows as well from prohibitions on avowing grief in public is an effective mandate in favor of a generalized melancholia (and a derealization of loss) when it comes to considering <italic>as dead</italic> those the United States or its allies have killed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412438594">Butler, 2006</xref>: 37). Here, she implies that the discourse and prohibitions on public mourning somehow produce the melancholic inability to work-through the past. While there is truth to this claim that the forms of discourse, in what they omit as much as in what they posit, contribute to the perpetuation of cultural melancholia – it nonetheless represents an occlusion of the role of cultural history in producing that discourse (inclusive of its omissions and prohibitions). Discourse is as much the product of melancholia as it is its cause; it is not merely a site of performative repetition, but also the legacy of concrete cultural histories, which give rise to the symbolic code and its prohibitions.</p>
<p><italic>Mindfulness</italic> of universal vulnerability is not the <italic>source</italic> of a new politics, but rather simply the form of that desired new politics. If we were mindful of that vulnerability, in Butler’s sense, we would have that new politics. In other words, Butler seems to put the cart before the horse; she simply reinscribes the desired result – a deeper sensibility to our constitutive relationality – as an animistic source of amelioration. The question is begged as to how this mindfulness will be achieved within our troubled historical circumstances, which reproduce forms of culture in which our relationality cannot be borne.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276412438594"><title>Conclusion: Working-through the Past</title>
<p>As a contrast with the accounts of Kristeva and Butler, one could look at Theodor Adorno’s essay ‘The Meaning of Working through the Past’ to help clarify a notion of cosmopolitanism as a form of mournful sociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412438594">Adorno, 2003</xref>). In this essay, written in the wake of National Socialism in post-war Germany, Adorno considers the difference between the widespread desire to ‘forget and move on’ from the past, and a serious working-on (<italic>Aufarbeitung</italic>) the past. For Adorno, the danger of a recuperation of fascism does not simply lie in the persistence of racist fringe movements, but rather in the very structure of democracy itself which is resistant to a serious grappling with its own history; this resistance lives on in the affective constellations of concrete historical conditions – the objective conditions of the possibility of fascism survive within democratic mass society.</p>
<p>Although in ‘Mourning and Melancholia’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412438594">Freud (2001a)</xref> speaks of working-through (<italic>Durcharbeitung</italic>), rather than <italic>Aufarbeitung</italic>, the similarity is clear. The main target of Adorno’s critique is the ideological reduction of the problem of social crisis to some sort of subjectively-conceived understanding, ignorance, psychopathology, misrecognition, etc. Adorno writes:<disp-quote>
<p>the dominant ideology today dictates that the more individuals are delivered over to objective constellations, over which they have, or believe they have, no power, the more they subjectivize this powerlessness. Starting from the phrase that everything depends on the person, they attribute to people everything that in fact is due to the external conditions, so that in turn the conditions remain undisturbed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412438594">Adorno, 2003</xref>: 7–8)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This subjectivization amounts to a disavowal of the concrete socio-historical conditions that perpetuate the powerlessness. We do not seriously work-through our pasts, and thus have no idea what the world is, what to fear, what is possible, etc. One can understand this through what Adorno sees as a central characteristic of contemporary mass culture: the loss of memory. The fetishistic structure of society works to obliterate historical consciousness and produce dissociated subjects so that their manic-depression can be perpetuated and exploited – dissociated subjects reproduce the social conditions of their dissociation.</p>
<p>According to Adorno, one can see the defensive denial that the past still lives on in the pervasive, varied animisms which seek to destroy all memory of the past. After the Second World War in Germany, Adorno observed that when discussing the war, people minimize what happened; they say that ‘it happened a long time ago’, or that ‘it is time to move on’; or, they claim not to have known about the death camps, or compare it to civilian deaths during the Allied bombing of Dresden, or even imply that the horrors were a justifiable response to some sort of provocation. Adorno writes: ‘The idiocy of all this is truly a sign of something that psychologically has not been mastered, a wound, although the idea of wounds would be rather more appropriate for the victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412438594">Adorno, 2003</xref>: 5). One can find many contemporary examples of this same sociological phenomenon, as in the myriad, absurd justifications for the Iraq War in the popular imagination. These symptomatic attempts to obliterate all memory of certain pasts, on the Freudian account, appear as symptomatic defenses against unbearable affectivity, as expressions of the inability to mourn.</p>
<p>Adorno’s analysis thus helps us conceive of cosmopolitanism anew as a material form of sociality that would subvert the self-perpetuating forms of pathological sociality identified above; it would thus work to objectively de-fetishize, de-traumatize (to prevent and protect from trauma), and to concretely socially facilitate mourning. Such mournful cosmopolitanisms would disrupt the dominant social mechanisms that assure that the other is experienced traumatically. In lieu of the philosophical valorization of vulnerability or uncanny strangeness – which in subjectivizing powerlessness simply reproduces the dominant culture of manic-depression – there is a possibility of mournful socialities which would facilitate singular abilities to work-through loss and to bear, bit-by-bit, concrete encounters with concrete otherness, which is both within and without. Instead of appropriating that singularity into a monolithic symptom which trumpets its inability to mourn as freedom – as in contemporary American consumerist nationalism, for example – mournful socialities would concretely facilitate the bearing of our vulnerability to others. Such socialities will not come merely as an indefinitely delayed, ideal future, nor will they arrive when recognition of our uncanniness or mindfulness of vulnerability become widespread. Rather, such socialities have <italic>already</italic> been experienced by many of us, and continue to be so, albeit fleetingly and in distorted forms. The ideal will arrive, over and against the enduring legacy of manic-depressive culture, to the degree that we are able to work-through our pasts, and build upon concrete social conditions which facilitate abilities to bear singular, suffered social histories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276412438594">9</xref></sup></p></sec>

<fn id="fn1-0263276412438594"><label>1</label><p>Lyotard writes: ‘In the Introduction to the third <italic>Critique</italic>, the dispersion of the genres of discourse is not just recognized, it is dramatized to the point that the problem posed is that of finding “passages” (<italic>Uebergänge</italic>) between these heteronomous genres. The “faculty” of judgment, by very reason of its ubiquity, that is, on account of the fact that it is called upon each time a phrase has to be validated by a presentation, appears as a force of “passages” between the faculties, to the point that it is accorded a major privilege in the area of unifying capacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438594">Lyotard, 1988</xref>: 130).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-0263276412438594"><label>2</label><p>In the interests of establishing a broader context of more contemporary commentary on Kantian politics, one might consider Derrida’s essay, ‘The Ends of Man’, which plays on the ambiguity in the Kantian conception of human beings as ‘ends’. Derrida considers the way in which Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger critique the tradition of philosophical anthropology of which Kant is central, and argues that, despite their criticisms, they nonetheless maintain the <italic>form</italic> of anthropology in their own theories. In contrast, Derrida proposes a type of deconstruction that would break from this form, by deciding ‘to change ground, in a discontinuous and eruptive manner, by stepping abruptly outside and by affirming absolute rupture and difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412438594">Derrida, 1969: 56</xref>). Here, Derrida criticizes what he characterizes as the Heideggerian appeal to a spontaneous decision of philosophical thought after the maturation of its history, and valorizes Nietzsche’s appeal to the laughter and dance of the Übermensch as a model of active forgetfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412438594">Derrida, 1969: 57</xref>). This, however, begs the question as to how this change of ground and affirmation of ‘absolute rupture and difference’ would be possible given the fact that our fixated autism is concretely and <italic>affectively</italic> reproduced. In short, this appeal to abrupt rupture and change on the model of laughter occludes the element of working-through. For an alternative to Derrida s reading of Nietzsche, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412438594">Jeffrey Jackson (2010)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-0263276412438594"><label>3</label><p>To be clear, the claim is that Kant is criticizing dominant forms of religion, not religion as such.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-0263276412438594"><label>4</label><p>One may note that Lyotard’s account of the possibility of cosmopolitanism in terms of the communal experience of the sublime occludes this element of work. According to Lyotard, ‘because the feeling of the sublime is an affective paradox, the paradox of feeling publicly and as a group that something which is “formless” alludes to a beyond of experience, that feeling constitutes an “as-if presentation” of the Idea of civil society and even of cosmopolitical society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412438594">Lyotard, 1988</xref>: 170). On this account, the sublime is a public feeling that emerges within particular historical circumstances. It is not examined within concrete socio-historical economics of affectivity that may or may not facilitate abilities to bear the ‘beyond of experience’. For Freud, social histories condition whether or not that beyond is experienced as promising or threatening.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-0263276412438594"><label>5</label><p>See, for example, Harry van der Linden’s discussion of the Neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412438594">Van der Linden, 1988</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-0263276412438594"><label>6</label><p>This reading of Marx’s notion of fetishism is in important ways in agreement with William Pietz’s argument that the dominant semiological readings of fetishism – which Pietz traces from the beginnings of French Structuralism to the most popular figures in contemporary Continental philosophy – present a decidedly de-materialized Marx. According to Pietz, for these thinkers ‘the concept of materiality is always either replaced altogether by a concept of objectified form, of the pure signifier, or else abstracted on a textualist model as sheer heterogeneity and contingency, as the “outside” of preexisting codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412438594">Pietz, 1993</xref>: 127). In other words, the concrete social character of fetishism is lost, and along with it, the <italic>suffered</italic> character of this form of social life.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-0263276412438594"><label>7</label><p>See Jacques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412438594">Derrida (2001)</xref>. Examples of the critical discourse on this theme include Geoffrey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412438594">Bennington (2010)</xref> and Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412438594">Nass (2003)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-0263276412438594"><label>8</label><p>There is a body of criticism of Freud’s assertion of the normalcy of mourning. See, for example, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412438594">Eng (2000)</xref>, Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412438594">Butler (1997)</xref>, and Seth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412438594">Moglen (2005)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-0263276412438594"><label>9</label><p>Kristeva occludes the way in which Freud – most specifically in ‘Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego’, where he continues his discussion of mania begun in ‘Mourning and Melancholia’ – characterizes this ‘fascinated rejection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412438594">Freud, 2001c</xref>).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
