<p>Times are tough. Everywhere. Even in academia—perhaps especially in academia, because it seems that so many government agencies are looking for ways to save money by cutting academic funding. There is a certain irony in the many attempts to cut educational budgets (and particularly business school budgets) because the “return on educational investment” is, according to some arcane calculations, at least 100% and often much more. Why would any ostensibly rationale body (e.g., state governments) cut funding for institutions with that kind of return on investment? Short-term thinking, that’s why—the social disease of our time, as Norman Lear has labeled it.</p>
<p>Despite such apparently irrational behavior, state governments are, if anything, engaging in more and more cutting. Somewhat surprisingly, some of the hardest hit groups in academia are research-oriented institutions because the average lay person (and the average state legislator) has a difficult time understanding the direct benefit of academic inquiry—an observation that raises a larger question: Is academic research valuable? Of course it is. Is all academic research equally valuable? Of course not. Do we occasionally conduct research that is of marginal value? Of course we do. Business and organizational research is like most scientific research, in that it is a probabilistic game. Sometimes it works out, sometimes not. Sometimes it’s extraordinarily valuable, sometimes not. But it is unarguably worth doing, assuming that we do it well.</p>
<p>Still, we in business schools, and particularly management departments, do not live in a vacuum. We need to be able to justify ourselves and the worth of our research to internal and external stakeholders, which means that we need first to emphasize the quality of our research. But just what is quality research and how should we assess it? Mike Hitt and Bob Greer take up this issue in the following essay, arguing that some of our more recent attempts at assessing the worth of our research might be a touch misguided. They take up four areas for reconsideration and recommend not only that we get our evaluative house in order but also that we broaden the criteria for judging the worth of management research and faculty productivity.</p>
