<abstract>
<p>This study examines whether social presence through a virtual sales associate (VSA) affects mature consumers’ perceptions of technical and social supports from an apparel retail website and whether these perceptions influence consumers’ attitudes and patronage intentions toward the website. Sixty mature consumers participated in a laboratory experiment and completed a shopping task on a mock apparel website with or without a VSA. Results revealed that participants in the VSA (vs. no-VSA) condition perceived significantly greater social support; however, no significant difference existed in perceived technical support between the two conditions. This study also revealed that mature consumers’ perceived social support and ease of use of the retail website positively influenced their attitude toward the retail website, which in turn led to their website patronage intentions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed with respect to the potential of VSAs in enhancing the e-tail service quality for mature consumers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Virtual animated characters, sometimes called avatars, can play a role as a sales associate on a retail website. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12456903">Holzwarth, Janiszewski, and Neumann (2006)</xref> define avatars as “general graphic representations that are personified by means of computer technology” (p. 20). Avatars take the form of cartoon humans, animals, or objects and interact with online customers to represent the online retailer (Keeling, McGoldrick, &amp; Beatty, 2009). The virtual sales associate (VSA), in this study, specifically denotes an avatar that has a human-like appearance and interacts with online customers as a service agent on a retail website.</p>
<p>Recently, numerous companies such as Rovion, iNago, and Artificial Life entered into the development of VSAs, and e-commerce sites such as ikea.com and alaskaair.com utilized VSAs as a new service tool. The use of VSAs can benefit online retailers by reducing operational costs as well as by enhancing customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12456903">Barbara, 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12456903">Barbara (2005)</xref>, the average operational cost for a call is only 45 cents when a VSA is used, as compared to four dollars for a live human sales associate. Moreover, VSAs may contribute to customer satisfaction by providing information search and navigation assistance.</p>
<p>The service literature has emphasized two aspects of service quality: technical and functional quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12456903">Gronroos, 1984</xref>). Technical quality addresses “what” customers receive from a service, whereas functional quality deals with “how” customers receive the service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12456903">Gronroos, 1984</xref>). When these concepts are applied in a traditional offline retail setting, the technical quality of a retail service is related to whether the in-store system enables customers to fulfill their goals for the store visit (e.g., find products, complete purchases, return items they did not like after a purchase). Sales associates can contribute to enhancing the technical quality of a retail service by providing customers with information necessary to meet their shopping goals. On the other hand, the functional quality of an offline retail service refers to the pleasantness of the process by which the customer’s goal is fulfilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12456903">Gronroos, 1984</xref>). Thus, the functional quality in offline retail settings involves appropriateness of the system (e.g., how well the store is laid out for an easy product search, how customer-oriented the return policy is) as well as the “social” quality of sales associates’ interpersonal interactions with the customer. Sales associates can enhance the functional quality of a retail service by smoothening the customer’s shopping process through their courteous and caring attitude in addition to offering helpful information to the customer.</p>
<p>In online retail environments, where personal assistance is generally limited, VSAs can serve as an alternative means for providing online customers with ongoing, real-time assistance that simulates personal sales associate interactions in offline retail settings (Keeling et al., 2009). Like personal sales associates in an offline store, VSAs may enhance both the technical and the functional service quality of an online retailer. VSA technical support in guiding the online customer through the shopping and transaction processes can directly influence the customer’s perceived technical quality of a retail website. Further, social support through the VSA can enhance the online customer’s perceived functional quality of the retail website. Despite the potential contribution of VSAs, little empirical research has examined the role of VSAs in enhancing online customers’ e-retail service perceptions, and no studies, to the researchers’ best knowledge, have examined this issue in the online apparel retailing environment.</p>
<p>The sharp growth of the mature consumer population (over 50 years old) and the economic importance of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12456903">Court, Farrell, &amp; Forsyth, 2007</xref>) provide rationales for online retailers to pay attention to this consumer group. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12456903">Pew Internet (2010)</xref>, in the United States, 70% of people aged 55–64 years are Internet users, while only 38% of those 65 or older are connected to the Internet. Moreover, even in the 55–64 age group, only 37% shop online, whereas 52% and 65% of those aged 45–54 and 25–34 do so, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12456903">The Consumer Council, 2010</xref>). The slow adoption of online shopping by mature consumers is attributed to social and cognitive barriers these consumers experience. In terms of the social barrier, mature consumers tend to rely on social support from their family and friends to learn how to use the Internet (Joseph &amp; Stone, 2005). Without access to social support to seek advice for potential technical problems, mature consumers often do not feel confident in using the Internet. Mature consumers also feel a cognitive barrier in searching for information in complex online environments because aging causes the decline of cognitive abilities such as short-term memory and spatial visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12456903">Czaja &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). Mature consumers are also known to be more reliant on sales assistants’ advice than are their younger counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12456903">Hervé &amp; Mullet, 2009</xref>), and thus social and technical supports provided by VSAs may be beneficial particularly for mature consumers to overcome their social and cognitive barriers in online shopping.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine the impact of social presence through a VSA on mature consumers’ perceptions of technical and social supports from an apparel retail website. In addition, this study examines potential moderating roles of mature consumers’ personal characteristics such as gender and Internet use experience that may alter the effectiveness of the VSA. Finally, this study also investigates whether mature consumers’ perception of the VSA’s social and technical support influences their attitudes and patronage intentions toward the apparel retail website.</p>

<title>Social Presence and VSAs</title>
<p>Social presence theory was developed to address people’s subjective perceptions of other people in the context of mediated communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short, William, &amp; Christie, 1976</xref>). Social presence theory has been broadly applied to computer-mediated communication research over the years. According to the social presence theory, communication can be more effective when the communication medium has appropriate social presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short et al., 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short et al. (1976)</xref> define social presence as “the degree of salience of the other person in a mediated interaction and the consequent salience of the interpersonal interaction” (p. 65). The face-to-face medium can be considered to have the most social presence, whereas the written and text-based communication has the least social presence.</p>
<p>In the computer-mediated communication, social presence addresses a feeling of human contact, sociability, and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12456903">Hassanein &amp; Head, 2005</xref>) and offers a sense of connection to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887302X12456903">Yoo &amp; Alavi, 2001</xref>). Social presence in computer-mediated communications may be accomplished through actual interactions with other people via tools such as live chats, virtual communities, and message boards. But, social presence can also be achieved through simulated interactions such as communicating with avatars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12456903">Hassanein &amp; Head, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12456903">Qiu &amp; Benbasat, 2009</xref>), which are considered to provide a high level of social presence due to their high media richness. Media richness refers to the media’s ability to approximate the characteristics of face-to-face interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12456903">Hackman &amp; Walker, 1990</xref>). Avatars can achieve high media richness due to their ability to communicate interactively with users through their human-like appearance, facial expressions, voice, nonverbal behavior, and/or socially rich conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12456903">Holzwarth et al., 2006</xref>; Joyner, 2010; Keeling et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12456903">Loker, Ashdown, &amp; Carnrite, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12456903">Qiu &amp; Benbasat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12456903">Vasalou, Joinson, Bänziger, Goldie, &amp; Pitt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12456903">Wang, Baker, Wagner, &amp; Wakefield, 2007</xref>). Personal avatars created by users to represent themselves in a social networking website are a good example of social presence that indicates the users’ availability and willingness to communicate with other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12456903">Vasalou et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, social presence through VSAs in an apparel retail website may enhance a consumer’s perception that the online retailer is available and willing to communicate with their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X12456903">Cyr, Hassanein, Head, &amp; Ivanov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12456903">Qiu &amp; Benbasat, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has indicated that by allowing users to feel a sense of connection to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887302X12456903">Yoo &amp; Alavi, 2001</xref>), social presence may influence social and relational outcomes such as users’ perceptions of social support, trust, respect, and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12456903">Kehrwald, 2008</xref>) in computer-mediated environments and enhance users’ interpersonal involvement with the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short et al., 1976</xref>). Social presence in an apparel retail website through VSAs may generate similar effects, enhancing online customers’ social and relational outcomes. Previous literature has also demonstrated that social presence enhances information richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X12456903">Straub, 1994</xref>), which may lead to increased task achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short et al., 1976</xref>). Thus, social presence through VSAs is expected to enhance the usefulness of the apparel retail website and help online customers to complete their shopping task with greater ease.</p>

<title>Social and Technical Supports through VSAs</title>
<p>Gronroos’ (1984, 1991) two service quality dimensions—technical quality and functional quality—have contributed to understanding the nature of service quality. Technical quality is defined as the service outcome from customers’ interactions with a service provider, such as the service provider’s general know-how delivered to the customer and technical solutions to the customer’s problem. On the other hand, functional quality refers to how customers get the service outcome functionally. Functional quality may be communicated to customers through the service employee’s appearance, behavior, service-mindedness, customer-oriented attitude, accessibility, and ability to maintain continuous contact with the customer.</p>
<p>In the context of retail service quality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady (2001)</xref> expanded Gronroos’ (1984, 1991) two dimensions of service quality to three dimensions: Interaction quality, service environment quality, and outcome quality. Brady’s (2001) outcome quality refers to service outcome such as waiting time and tangibles obtained through the service, which addresses a concept similar to Gronroos’ (1984, 1991) technical quality. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady (2001)</xref> divides Gronroos’ functional quality concept into interaction quality and service environment quality. Interaction quality refers to the quality of interpersonal interactions between employees and customers, and is greatly influenced by attitude and behavior of the service employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady, 2001</xref>). Service environment quality relates to characteristics of the physical service environment which consists of facility design, ambient, and social factors. Among these, the social factor addresses both service employees and other customers present in the retail environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady (2001)</xref>, social support by service employees is an important determinant of both interaction and service environment dimensions of functional quality. Social support through personal interactions with service employees is rare in the online shopping process (Keeling et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X12456903">van der Heijden, Verhagen, &amp; Creemers, 2003</xref>). Consequently, online service quality literature has tended to downplay the role of social support in contributing to online consumers’ overall service quality perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12456903">Bauer, Falk, &amp; Hammerschmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12456903">Kim &amp; Damhorst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X12456903">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, &amp; Malhotra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887302X12456903">Yang &amp; Fang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887302X12456903">Yang, Jun, &amp; Peterson, 2004</xref>). However, some researchers have argued that online service quality also should contain social aspects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X12456903">Cai and Jun (2003)</xref> suggest that availability of various communication tools such as e-mail, chat room, bulletin board, and frequently asked questions may signal the online service provider’s empathy with customers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887302X12456903">Santos (2003)</xref> also adds the dimensions of support (e.g., personal advice, user-friendly guideline) and communication (e.g., various contact methods, language choices) to online service quality.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers have begun to view the potential of incorporating VSAs into a website as a viable tool to provide social and technical supports (Joyner, 2010; Keeling et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12456903">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). First, VSAs may provide <italic>technical support</italic> by: (1) presenting customized product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12456903">Choy &amp; Loker, 2004</xref>) or service information according to the customer’s unique needs expressed through the conversation with the VSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12456903">Dash &amp; Saji, 2007</xref>) and (2) guiding the customer through the order process (Joyner, 2010). In doing so, VSAs may help customers accomplish their shopping goal. Second, VSAs may offer <italic>social support</italic> to online retail customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12456903">Dash &amp; Saji, 2007</xref>; Keeling et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12456903">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) through simulated social cues such as human-like appearance, voice, gestures, and greeting messages as well as through their social role as a sales assistant, a personal shopper, and/or a customer representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12456903">Qiu &amp; Benbasat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12456903">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). VSAs may encourage mature consumers to engage more with the online retailer and be more involved in the online shopping process by increasing their perception of socialness of the retail website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12456903">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed based on the aforementioned literature:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Social presence by a VSA will increase mature consumers’ perceived social support from an apparel retail website.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Social presence by a VSA will increase mature consumers’ perceived technical support from an apparel retail website.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Research on technology acceptance has shown that prior technology experience positively influences users’ perceptions of ease of use and usefulness of a new technology and their acceptance of the new technology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X12456903">Carey, Wade, &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887302X12456903">Uwaifo, 2008</xref>). In other words, users tend to perceive a new technology more positively and are more likely to accept it when they are already comfortable with other similar technology. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887302X12456903">Uwaifo (2008)</xref> reported that librarians who were more comfortable with computers perceived greater ease of use of automated library systems. However, contrary to these existing findings, the effect of a VSA that enhances the ease of use and usefulness of a retail website is anticipated to be greater for mature consumers who are less familiar with the Internet due to their greater need for the guidance and information provided by the VSA. A VSA’s interaction mode (i.e., speaking to the user via a speaker or a headset) resembles human communication, requiring no or little training for users to communicate with it. Given the low learning curve to use a VSA regardless of the consumer’s previous Internet experience levels, VSA support is expected to be valued more by mature consumers who have a greater need for the VSA’s technical guidance and information to perform the Internet shopping task (i.e., those with less Internet use experience). Thus, the researchers propose current Internet use as a moderator for the effectiveness of the VSA in enhancing mature consumers’ perceptions of technical support from an apparel retail website.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> The effect of social presence by a VSA on consumers’ perceived technical support from an apparel retail website will be greater among mature consumers who are light (vs. heavy) Internet users.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Women tend to be more susceptible to interpersonal influences and more sensitive to social cues than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12456903">Johnson, 2011</xref>). For example, in a web-based learning environment, women tend to communicate more and perceive the environment to have greater social presence than men, and thus women tend to be more satisfied with the learning experience and have better performance than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12456903">Johnson, 2011</xref>). Given this gender difference, it is plausible that female mature consumers may be more sensitive to the social presence through a VSA in an apparel retail website than their male counterparts, which may lead to greater perception of the social support provided by the VSA among female consumers.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: The effect of social presence by a VSA on consumers’ perceived social support from an apparel retail website will be greater for female than male mature consumers.</p>

<title>Website Attitude and Patronage Intention</title>
<p>The technology acceptance model (TAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12456903">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12456903">Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989</xref>) provides a theoretical framework to explain how VSAs may influence mature consumers’ acceptance of a retail website (i.e., website attitude and patronage intention). The TAM posits that the acceptance of a new technology is determined by the user’s perceived usefulness and ease of use of the technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12456903">Davis et al., 1989</xref>). The TAM specifies the causal relationships between perceived usefulness and ease of use and attitudes toward the technology, which in turn influences the intention to accept the technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12456903">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12456903">Davis et al., 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12456903">Davis (1989)</xref> defines perceived usefulness as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance” (p. 320) and perceived ease of use as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort” (p. 320). The perceived usefulness and ease of use concepts from the TAM mirror the perceived technical support concept proposed in this study because the technical guidance of VSAs can help users reach their goals more easily and quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12456903">Barbara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12456903">Hostler, Yoon, &amp; Guimaraes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12456903">Rickel &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>). In addition, technical support provided by VSAs may expedite consumers’ access to more relevant information regarding products, services, and shopping and transaction processes on a retail website and thus make the website more technically helpful. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Mature consumers’ perceived technical support (i.e., ease of use and usefulness) of an apparel retail website will positively influence their attitudes toward the website.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition to technical support, social support by VSAs can have positive effects on consumers’ attitudes toward a retail website. According to the social presence theory, a persuasive communication can be more effective when it occurs through appropriate social presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X12456903">Rice, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12456903">Short et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887302X12456903">Skalski &amp; Tamborini, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12456903">Hassanein and Head (2007)</xref> provided empirical support for this contention in an online shopping context by reporting that higher levels of perceived social presence through socially rich design elements of a website led to more favorable consumer attitudes. Thus, the social support perceived from the VSA is likely to enhance the effectiveness of the retail website in influencing consumers’ attitude toward the website. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12456903">Cyr, Head, and Ivanov (2009)</xref> found that perceived social presence had a positive effect on loyalty toward service websites. Loyalty is an integrative concept combining consumers’ favorable attitudes toward a product or service provider and their behavioral characteristics such as patronizing (i.e., repeatedly purchasing or using) the product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12456903">Baldinger &amp; Rubinson, 1996</xref>). Researchers have demonstrated a close relationship between the attitudinal and behavioral components of loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12456903">Baldinger &amp; Rubinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12456903">Oliver, 1999</xref>). The causal relationship between attitudes and patronage intentions for a retail website has been repeatedly verified in studies using the TAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12456903">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12456903">Davis et al., 1989</xref>) and in other online shopping studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12456903">Chung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X12456903">Park, Stoel, &amp; Lennon, 2008</xref>). Thus, it is likely that consumers’ attitude toward the retail website enhanced by perceived social and technical support from the VSA will improve their patronage intention for the website, which is reflected in the following hypothesis.</p>

<title>Stimulus Development and Data Collection Procedure</title>
<p>Mock apparel retail websites were created to manipulate the VSA and no-VSA conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12456903">Figure 1</xref>). Participants came in small groups of two to eight and were randomly assigned to either condition. Participants were asked to shop for predetermined items consisting of a jacket and a pair of pants on their assigned website. After the online shopping task, participants filled out a paper-based questionnaire, which included the dependent measures and questions seeking demographic and computer experience information. For the shopping task, on the VSA website, participants were guided by a female VSA in every step of the shopping process, and they interacted with the VSA by typing their questions or responses to the VSA in the chat box. The VSA was created using SitePal (purchased from sitepal.com), an application which allowed an easy incorporation of VSAs into webpages. The VSA was programmed so that she would deliver her speech through voice and text. The participants heard the VSA voice through headphones and saw the text in the chat box. On the other hand, the no-VSA website did not feature a VSA, and thus participants carried out the shopping task on their own without the VSA’s assistance as they would in a regular e-tail site. Except for the presence and absence of the VSA, the two websites were identical in their function, appearance, and merchandise assortment. A monetary compensation of US$15 was offered to each participant for their time. The laboratory experiment lasted for about 1 hr for each group.</p>

<p>Before the main experiment, a pilot test of the stimulus websites and the questionnaire was conducted with a separate convenience sample of 15 mature consumers (8 men and 7 women; 56–85 years old with a mean age of 69.9). All pilot test participants viewed both stimulus websites with and without a VSA and were able to distinguish the difference between the two websites, which was the presence and absence of the VSA guidance. All pilot test participants used the website with the VSA to complete a shopping task identical to the task used in the main experiment, and reported that they were able to use the VSA with ease, confirming its usability for the main experiment. Finally, pilot test participants verified the readability and appropriateness of the questionnaire item wordings.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Prior to hypothesis testing, item scores for each variable were averaged to construct the variable score. To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was run with social presence (VSA vs. no VSA) as the independent variable and perceived social support, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use as the dependent variables. MANOVA results revealed a significant effect of social presence (Wilks’s λ = .83, <italic>F</italic>
<sub>3, 56</sub> = 3.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), warranting further univariate analyses. Results from univariate analyses showed significantly greater perceived social support (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>58</sub> = 3.35, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01) in the VSA condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.84) compared to the no-VSA condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.20), supporting Hypothesis 1. Both perceived ease of use (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 4.50, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 4.29, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>58</sub> = 1.47, <italic>p </italic>= .26) and perceived usefulness (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 4.08, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 3.93, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>58</sub> = .63, <italic>p </italic>= .53) were greater in the VSA condition than in the no-VSA condition, but the differences were not statistically significant, rejecting Hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>To test Hypothesis 3 predicting the moderating role of Internet use for the social presence effect on perceived technical support, first, respondents were categorized into two groups (i.e., 30 light Internet users and 30 heavy Internet users) using a median split based on the number of hours per week they currently used the Internet (<italic>Mdn</italic> = 9 hr). Then, Hypothesis 3 was tested using a two-way MANOVA with Social Presence and Internet Use group as the independent variables and perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as the dependent variables. Results revealed a nonsignificant Internet use main effect (Wilks’s λ = .92, <italic>F</italic>
<sub>2, 55</sub> = 2.47, <italic>p</italic> = .09) and a nonsignificant Social Presence × Internet Use interaction effect (Wilks’s λ = .99, <italic>F</italic>
<sub>2, 55</sub> = .20, <italic>p</italic> = .82), rejecting Hypothesis 3. For both light and heavy Internet users, perceived usefulness was greater in the VSA (vs. no-VSA) condition (light users: <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 3.81, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 3.97; heavy users: <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 4.09, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 4.16). The same results were found for perceived ease of use (light users: <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 4.17, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 4.30; heavy users: <italic>M</italic>
<sub>no-VSA</sub> = 4.44, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>VSA</sub> = 4.66). However, the main effect of social presence was again nonsignificant (Wilks’s λ = .97, <italic>F</italic>
<sub>2, 55</sub> = .79, <italic>p</italic> = .46) from this two-way MANOVA, confirming the aforementioned Hypothesis 2 testing results. These results indicate that the observed differences between the VSA and no-VSA conditions in perceived usefulness and ease of use were not statistically significant for both heavy and light Internet users.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4, which predicted a gender difference for the effect of social presence on perceived social support, was also not supported because a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Social Presence and Gender as the independent variables revealed a nonsignificant interaction effect (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1, 56</sub> = .00, <italic>p</italic> = .99). The ANOVA results also showed a significant main effect of Social Presence (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1, 56</sub> = 10.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), while revealing a nonsignificant main effect of Gender (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1, 56</sub> = .61, <italic>p</italic> = .44). For both Gender groups, higher perceived social support was observed in the VSA condition (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>male</sub> = 3.92, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>female</sub> = 3.77) than in the no-VSA condition (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>male</sub> = 3.30, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>female</sub> = 3.14).</p>
<p>To test Hypotheses 5 through 7, a latent structural model was run using SmartPLS employing a partial least squares (PLS) procedure with bootstrapping. The model was specified with regression paths from three exogenous latent variables, including the two perceived technical support variables (ease of use and usefulness) and perceived social support, to the website attitude latent variable, which in turn emitted a regression path to the website patronage intention latent variable. Each latent variable was indicated by its measurement items. PLS results revealed that mature consumers’ perceived social support (β = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and perceived ease of use (β = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) had a significantly positive influence on their attitudes toward the retail website, but perceived usefulness did not significantly explain attitudes toward the retail website (β = .02, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Thus, Hypothesis 6 was supported, while Hypothesis 5 was only partially supported. The PLS results also showed that mature consumers’ website attitudes positively influenced their website patronage intention (β = .52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), supporting Hypothesis 7.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the effectiveness of incorporating VSAs in addressing mature consumers’ barriers to online shopping adoption. Findings of this study demonstrate the significant effect of social presence through VSAs in enhancing mature consumers’ perceptions of social support from an apparel retail website, which then leads to more favorable attitudes and patronage intention for the website. Mature consumers have been less emphasized in the e-commerce literature in the past. Given the importance of this population for future online retailing, this study is considered very timely to stimulate future research in online apparel retail services for mature consumers. Mature consumers suffer from various cognitive and social barriers to use a new technology such as the Internet or e-commerce sites (Joseph &amp; Stone, 2005). This study suggests that a VSA can provide mature consumers with social support needed to reduce these barriers and facilitate their task completion during online shopping in the absence of personal social support from human customer service representatives or family and friends.</p>
<p>This study further shows a nonsignificant gender effect for perceived social support. A possible reason for this result may be the task-oriented style of the VSA interaction designed for this study, which focused on helping participants complete the given task with no small talk except for the initial greeting. This style of interaction might have provided an optimal level of socialness for men who are known to be less appreciative of overly social interactions than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12456903">Moskowitz, Suh, &amp; Desaulniers, 1994</xref>), while this style of VSA interactions might have been felt somewhat insufficient by women who tend to be more susceptible to social cues. If the VSA was designed with more social talk beyond task-relevant conversations, female participants might have perceived greater social support than male participants.</p>
<p>In addition, this study fails to show the main effect of social presence or the Social Presence × Internet use interaction effect on mature consumers’ perceived technical support. Three potential reasons for these results can be speculated. First, due to the simple nature of the shopping task assigned in the present experiment and the lack of complexity of the mock website, most participants in the no-VSA condition as well as those in the VSA condition were able to successfully carry out the task without much difficulty. If a more complex website is used and/or a more complicated task is given to participants, the technical aspect of VSA service may be appreciated more, generating significantly different perceived technical support between the two conditions; and the moderating effect of Internet use may become more pronounced.</p>
<p>Another reason for the lack of evidence for the technical support of VSAs can be understood in light of the early developmental stage of the VSA. The VSA technology is still in its inception, and thus advanced features for providing customized services to meet individual consumers’ needs are yet limited. Hence, in this study, even though the VSA successfully directed most participants through the shopping task, the VSA’s guidance might have been insufficient for some participants, who were unfamiliar with online shopping, while it might have been perceived as an unnecessary intrusion by other participants with extensive online experience. Thus, the level of assistance programmed in the VSA design used in the present study might have been disadvantageous to both high- and low Internet experience groups, leading to the nonsignificant effect on perceived technical support.</p>
<p>Finally, participants’ psychological overemphasis of social aspects of the VSA may be partially responsible for the lack of evidence for the VSA’s technical support in this study. The categorization theory explicates the factors that affect the acquisition of knowledge about one’s social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12456903">Wyer, 1980</xref>). People interpret new information about a person, object, or event by comparing its features to those of previously formed schemas stored in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12456903">Wyer, 1980</xref>). The schema that is activated for use in encoding and organizing new information may depend in part on the purpose for which the information is to be used. If a schema applicable for encoding information has already been activated at the time the information is received, only those features of the information that exemplify concepts contained in that schema will tend to be encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12456903">Wyer, 1980</xref>). When the participants were exposed to the VSA in the experiment, the VSA’s human embodiment may have reminded them of a salesperson in the in-store shopping environment. Considering the lack of socialness typically experienced in online environments, the participants may have instantly categorized the VSA interaction as being “social” in nature, activating a social interaction schema. This activation could have biased the encoding of the VSA service so that only social aspects of the VSA interaction became representative of the whole benefits of the VSA, thus leading to perceptions of social rather than technical support. Had the websites featured the VSA with a chat box only without using the human appearance, the technical aspects of the interaction might have been more salient in the participants’ minds.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>This study makes significant contributions to the existing apparel retail service literature by integrating the social presence theory and the TAM to understand the effect of VSAs for mature consumers. First, technical and social dimensions of service quality have been emphasized in the service literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X12456903">Gronroos, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X12456903">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, &amp; Berry, 1988</xref>) and traditional retailing literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12456903">Brady, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12456903">Dabholkar, Thorpe, &amp; Rentz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12456903">Finn &amp; Lamb, 1991</xref>). However, the effect of the social dimension of service quality has been rarely addressed in the online retailing literature. This study addresses this gap by introducing VSAs as a novel online retail service tool that provides social presence in the apparel retail website, which generally lacks human interaction and socialness (Keeling et al., 2009). Using an experimental approach, this study reveals that social presence through a VSA enhances mature consumers’ perceptions of social support of a retail website. This finding indicates the potential of incorporating VSAs in a retail website in enhancing mature consumers’ perceived service quality of the website by increasing social or relational quality of the online retail service.</p>
<p>This study also contributes to the literature by integrating the social presence theory in the framework of the TAM to explain the effect of social presence through VSAs in enhancing mature consumers’ intention to adopt and patronize an apparel retail website. The social presence theory and the TAM have been tested separately in many contexts, but have not often been applied together in a single study. The TAM postulates perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as antecedents to adoption of a new technology. Incorporating the concept of social support perception in the TAM framework adds another dimension of user perception antecedent to adoption of an apparel retail website, particularly among mature consumers.</p>
<p>Findings of this study also provide significant managerial implications for online apparel retailers. This study demonstrates that the VSA service enhances mature consumers’ experience with an apparel retail website mainly through perceived social support. This study also shows that mature consumers’ perceived social support enhanced by VSAs leads to an increased attitude and patronage intention for the website. These findings provide a rationale for online apparel retailers who target mature consumers to incorporate VSAs in their retail websites. Through social support by VSAs, online apparel retailers could enhance their customers’ online shopping experience and thus generate more positive attitude and patronage intention for their websites. Given the cost-effectiveness of the VSA as compared to human agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12456903">Barbara, 2005</xref>), the positive effect of VSAs on consumer attitudes and patronage intention through enhanced perceptions of social support provides a promising potential of this technology to replace or supplement human service agents with a positive impact on the online apparel retailer’s bottom line.</p>

<title>Limitations and Recommendations</title>
<p>Findings of this study need to be viewed with caution in light of the following limitations. First, due to the age of the participants and the nature of a laboratory experiment, the sample size in this study was small, and the sample was recruited through a nonrandom procedure, which limits the generalizability of the findings to a broader population of mature consumers. The small sample size also prevented the researchers from performing the recommended assessment of the instrument validity using statistical analyses such as factor analysis. Therefore, the instrument discriminant and convergent validity was assumed based on existing literature. Further, the nonsignificant result of the VSA effect on perceptions of technical support (ease of use and usefulness) despite the mean scores confirming the hypothesized VSA effect direction might also have stemmed from the low statistical power due to the small sample size (Agresti &amp; Finlay, 1997). Thus, field experiments with larger samples are recommended for future research to replicate this study to enhance the measurement validity and to further examine the potential VSA effect in enhancing consumers’ perceptions of technical support of online retailers.</p>
<p>Second, the mature participants in this study tended to be biased in terms of ethnicity, computer and Internet use history, and income; most participants were non-Hispanic white, more familiar with the computer and the Internet than the general population of mature consumers, and from mid to high income households. Especially, the homogeneity in participant characteristics regarding computer and Internet use history may have contributed to the nonsignificant main effect of the VSA and the nonsignificant moderating effect of Internet use for perceived technical support since most participants were computer and Internet savvy. In addition to computer and Internet usage, mature consumers’ previous online apparel shopping experience could be a factor that influenced this result; however, this factor was not addressed in this study. Hence, future research is recommended to examine the VSA effects addressed in this study using a sample that more closely resembles the general mature consumer population and encompasses mature consumer groups with diverse ethnic and income groups and levels of previous experiences with the computer, the Internet, online shopping, and online apparel shopping, so that potential moderating effects of these experience variables can be further investigated.</p>
<p>Third, this study manipulated the experimental conditions using mock websites. The mock website stimuli might not have fully reflected the complexity of retail websites present in the real world. For example, no advertisements or pop-up pages were used on the mock websites, and the website functions were restricted to those relevant to the purpose of the shopping task assigned in the experiment. This website design allowed the researchers to control confounding variables that can disturb the study purpose, which enhanced the internal validity of the study, at the expense of external validity (i.e., realism). Thus, future research is recommended to replicate this study using existing websites or mock websites with varying levels of complexity so that the external validity of the findings can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Next, the shopping task assigned to participants in this study was fairly simple, which, along with the simplicity of the website design, was discussed earlier as a potential cause of the nonsignificant effect of the VSA on mature participants’ perceived technical support. Thus, findings of this study cannot be generalized to all shopping task contexts, and future research is recommended to examine the moderating role of the difficulty or complexity of the shopping or information search task in altering the effectiveness of the VSA in providing technical support.</p>
<p>Finally, the VSA used in this study had a young, female human representation, constraining the applicability of the findings to other VSA representations. Future studies could investigate the social schema that are evoked in consumers’ minds while being assisted by VSAs with different appearances such as embodied versus nonembodied VSAs, humanoid versus VSAs that appear in abstract, nonhuman shapes, or male versus female VSAs.</p>
