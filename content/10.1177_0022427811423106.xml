Specifically, do urban African American men and women living in the United States benefit from marriage similarly to Whites? Methods: The authors use hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze the relationship between marriage and official arrest counts among African American male and female first graders from Woodlawn, an inner-city community in Chicago, first assessed in 1966 and followed up at three time points (ages 16, 32, and 42). Results: The authors find strong evidence of a marriage effect for the males across crime type, with a reduction in offending between 21 percent and 36 percent when in a state of marriage. The findings for females were less consistent across crime type, a 10 percent reduction in the odds of a property arrest and a 9 percent increase in the odds of a drug arrest when in a state of marriage. Conclusions: Their findings provide evidence in favor of the generality of Sampson and Laub’s theory, at least for males. However, the authors were not able to evaluate the mechanisms of desistance and identify this as an area of future research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>race/ethnicity</kwd><kwd>life-course theory</kwd><kwd>developmental theories</kwd><kwd>criminological theory</kwd><kwd>desistance from crime</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The notion that marriage produces benefits across a wide variety of domains is not a new one (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022427811423106">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). Marriage and marital quality are related to improved mental and physical health, lower levels of alcohol-related problems and risk-taking behaviors, and improved financial well-being, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811423106">Duncan, Wilkerson, and England 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811423106">Gove, Hughes, and Style 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811423106">Horwitz, White, and Howell-White 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022427811423106">Umberson 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022427811423106">Waite 1995</xref>). Marriage has also been linked to desistance from crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811423106">Sampson and Laub 1993</xref>). Since much of the literature regarding marriage and desistance has focused on Whites, males, or older samples, research has begun to focus on the generalizability of the “marriage effect” with respect to race, gender, location, and period. While our knowledge of whether marriage impacts desistance across various conditions is increasing, one important population that has been understudied is urban African American men and women living in the United States.</p><p>This article examines three main research questions: Does marriage influence offending among an urban African American cohort? if so, does marriage influence offending similarly across crime type? and what, if any, are the gender differences in the influence of marriage on offending among an urban African American cohort?</p><sec id="section1-0022427811423106"><title>Marriage and Desistance</title><sec id="section2-0022427811423106"><title>Theoretical Underpinnings</title><p>The concept of desistance from crime has a long history dating back to the Gluecks' research in the 1930s and 1940s (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811423106">Glueck and Glueck 1930</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811423106">1940</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811423106">1943</xref>). The 1990s sparked a renewed interest in desistance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811423106">Sampson and Laub’s (1993)</xref> presentation of their age-graded theory of informal social control. In essence, Sampson and Laub draw on the life-course framework (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811423106">Elder 1985</xref>) and Hirschi’s social control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811423106">1969</xref>) and suggest that people are more likely to commit crime and engage in deviance if their bonds to society are weakened or broken. Their theory also suggests that, among offenders, strong social bonds stemming from a variety of life events predict desistance from criminal offending in adulthood.</p><p>Using interview data from a sample of 52 of the Glueck juvenile delinquents from the <italic>Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811423106">Glueck and Glueck 1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811423106">1968</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref> found that marriage is a key event in the desistance process for violent, property, and alcohol/drug offenses, reducing offending by 20 percent to 40 percent. According to these researchers, the primary mechanism that underlies the impact of marriage on criminal desistance is the notion that marriage engenders social bonds and a sense of investment and obligation that is too costly to risk by committing crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811423106">Sampson and Laub 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref> further posit that marriage also creates a change in routines, a change in peers, and introduction of new family members which can be inconsistent with crime. Finally, they contend that marriage provides direct supervision and can change a person’s self-definition, which can facilitate desistance.</p><p>Empirical studies continuously find evidence that marriage can redirect someone from an offending pathway to one of nonoffending or at least reduced offending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811423106">Duncan et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811423106">Farrington and West 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811423106">Horney, Osgood, and Marshall 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811423106">Maume, Ousey, and Beaver 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811423106">Warr 1998</xref>). Theoretically, Sampson and Laub’s age-graded theory of informal social control is a general theory that is intended to apply to individuals from all genders, periods, cultures, and ethnicities. Research is beginning to test this generality assumption with a focus on the applicability of this theory across gender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811423106">Bersani, Laub, and Nieuwbeerta 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423106">King, Massoglia, and MacMillan 2007</xref>), historical context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811423106">Bersani et al. 2009</xref>), and European (albeit White) populations that tend to have different social contexts and marital patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811423106">Bersani et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811423106">Blokland and Niewbeerta 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427811423106">Savolainen 2009</xref>). Yet, there is little research on the impact of marriage on offending among U.S. African American males and females.</p><p>Using the 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811423106">Nielsen (1999)</xref> found evidence that adult social bonds impact drinking for Whites but not non-Whites. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811423106">Mudar, Kearns, and Leonard (2002)</xref> found that alcohol-related problems among the African Americans in their sample actually increased in the first 2 years of marriage when compared with Whites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811423106">Piquero, MacDonald, and Parker (2002)</xref> examined the impact of marriage on arrests among a group of male parolees and found that there was a significant marriage effect for non-Whites for nonviolent arrests but not violent arrests.</p><p>With respect to gender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423106">King et al. (2007)</xref> examined desistance among a national sample of males and females and found that although marriage led to a reduction in offending for males, this was not true for females. Upon further investigation, these researchers found that males with a low propensity to marry were particularly affected by their marriage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811423106">Bersani et al. (2009)</xref> examined gender differences in the influence of marriage among a sample of males and females from the Netherlands and found that marriage reduced offending across gender with a stronger effect for males. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811423106">Giordano, Cernkovich, and Rudolph (2002)</xref> examined the desistance process among serious adolescent White and African American males and females and found, in their quantitative work, that marriage did not impact offending for either males or females while the qualitative work showed a desistant effect that was similar for both genders.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0022427811423106"><title>The Generalizability of “The Marriage Effect”</title><p>Overall, there is some empirical evidence of racial and gender differences in the effect of marriage. However, it is still an open empirical question whether the marriage effect found among White populations can be generalized to offending for African American males and females in the United States, given the potential differences in social context, marital patterns, and offending patterns.</p><p>First, inner-city neighborhoods in the United States are characterized by joblessness, poverty, violence, and pervasive racial discrimination that permeate the lives of those living in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811423106">Sampson 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427811423106">Massey and Sampson 2009</xref>). As African Americans disproportionately reside in these neighborhoods, the capability of marriage to impact offending in these circumstances is questioned. Thus, the social control elements of marriage that can facilitate desistance may be overshadowed by such strong contextual influences.</p><p>Moreover, African Americans experience lower rates of marriage than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423106">Dixon 2009</xref>). This may reflect barriers to marriage resulting from these social contexts or reflect a low level of desirability of marriage (i.e., a low propensity toward marriage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811423106">South 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423106">King et al. (2007)</xref> found that the effect of marriage on crime reduction was actually most salient among the men with the lowest propensity to marry. Thus, perhaps those African American men who do marry reap substantial benefits from marriage, regardless of adverse social contexts.</p><p>Second, one of the key mechanisms of change, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref> is a knifing off from friends and a change in routine activities (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811423106">Warr 1998</xref>). The fact that marriage rates are lower in general among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427811423106">Schoen 1995</xref>) means that African Americans will have fewer married friends than Whites. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811423106">South (1993)</xref> speculates, this fact, coupled with the fact that peer groups are more highly regarded than marriage for urban African American men, in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811423106">Anderson 1999</xref>), suggests that African American men might be less likely to alter their routine activities with respect to spending time with friends. On the other hand, African American women are more likely to desire marriage than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811423106">South 1993</xref>). Moreover, these women value marriage highly, even if they do not enter into it often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811423106">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>), which suggests that women who do marry may reap many benefits from that marriage as well as exert strong social control over their husbands.</p><p>Third, several marital characteristics also differ between those African Americans and Whites who do marry. Married African Americans have shorter marriages and are more likely to divorce than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423106">Dixon 2009</xref>), which begs the question of whether the social control benefits have time to accumulate or be as strong as those for Whites. African Americans also have lower levels of marital happiness than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811423106">Broman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811423106">Bulanda and Brown 2007</xref>) and are more likely than Whites to distrust their spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811423106">Goodwin 2003</xref>). Theoretically, if marital quality is lower for African Americans and the strength of the marital bond is important for reaping the benefits of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811423106">Laub, Nagin, and Sampson 1998</xref>), then one might expect marriage among African Americans to be ineffective at reducing offending.</p><p>Finally, African Americans tend to marry later than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811423106">Dixon 2009</xref>), introducing the timing of marriage as a potentially important consideration. The idea that the timing of transitions can affect future success in life domains is not a new one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811423106">Hogan 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811423106">Elder 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811423106">Rindfuss, Swicegood, and Rosenfeld 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811423106">Uggen 2000</xref>). There is recent evidence from the Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development, a sample of White males from South London, indicating that the impact of marriage on desistance is evident only for those who married before age 25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811423106">Theobald and Farrington 2009</xref>). With only approximately 10 percent of African Americans married by age 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427811423106">U.S. Census Bureau 2004</xref>), this finding brings into question the impact of marriage on offending for this population. One speculation from Theobald and Farrington is that older individuals may be less receptive to change their self-definition, which is one mechanism of desistance outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref>. However, it is still an open question whether these findings regarding the timing of marriage apply to a population who tend to marry later as a whole.</p><p>Thus, although there has been a growing abundance of evidence of the marriage effect on crime among White males and females from different countries, there are several questions unanswered. Primarily, does the marriage effect apply to offending among urban African Americans? If so, does this relationship hold for all crime types and for both males and females? There are several distinctive characteristics about the experiences of African Americans with regard to offending, marriage, and social context that bring this marriage effect into question and make an investigation of this population important. The current study uses the Woodlawn cohort, an epidemiologically defined community cohort of urban African American males and females followed from age 6 to 42, to investigate these issues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-0022427811423106"><title>The Woodlawn Project</title><p>The Woodlawn Project is a longitudinal study initiated in the mid-1960s. It takes a life-course approach to studying lives through time, specifically focusing on the developmental patterns of substance use, crime, education, and physical and mental health across the life course and the correlates of these patterns. The study began in 1966 when all first-grade children in the nine public and three parochial schools in the Woodlawn community, an inner-city community in Chicago, were invited to participate. Thirteen families chose not to have their children participate, leaving a cohort size of 1,242 (98.9 percent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811423106">Kellam et al. 1975</xref>). The cohort was then followed up at three additional time points (ages 16, 32, and 42). Of the 1,242 original cohort members, 51 percent are female and 49 percent are male.</p><p>In 1966, the first graders' teachers and mothers were interviewed on a number of topics such as the child’s classroom behavior, academic achievement, and social adaptation as well as family context and mental health. In 1975, 56 percent of the cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 705) were interviewed when the cohort members were 16 years old. The retention rate for this assessment was low due to funding constraints that restricted the follow-up interviews in adolescence to those living in the Chicago area. During this assessment, the adolescents and their mothers reported on their home life, school life, psychological well-being, crime and drug use using group-administered questionnaires. In 1992 (at age 32), 952 of the original cohort members (79 percent of those alive) were interviewed about a wide variety of topics such as their psychological well-being, education, employment, living arrangements, relationships, health, and religious practices, as well as their crime and drug use. Data on criminal involvement were also obtained in 1993 from criminal records from the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In 2002 (at age 42), 833 of the cohort members (72 percent of those alive) were interviewed using a similar interview schedule to that at the young adult interview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811423106">1</xref></sup> Throughout the study, reports of mortality have been gathered from family members and neighbors as well as through searches of the National Death Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811423106">Ensminger, Anthony, and McCord 1997</xref>).</p><sec id="section5-0022427811423106"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Of the original cohort of 1,242, 470 (37.8 percent) were arrested between the ages of 17 and 32.

This left a cohort size of 1,218 with criminal history information. An additional 39 people died by age 32, 150 people did not have a young adult or mid-adult interview to provide marriage information, and an additional 64 individuals did not have complete information on other key variables used in the analysis resulting in a final sample size of 965 respondents (461 males and 504 females), 78 percent of the original cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811423106">2</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section6-0022427811423106"><title>Cohort Characteristics and Historical Context</title><p>At the time of the initial study in 1966, Woodlawn was a socially disadvantaged, largely African American, inner-city community of Chicago.

However, there was considerable diversity in economic and social structural backgrounds within this community due to the limited number of areas in which African Americans could live in Chicago at the time. Although few families would be considered wealthy or middle class at the start of the study, 68 percent of the Woodlawn study families were not on welfare and 47 percent were above poverty level.</p><p>Crime and drug use were prevalent within the community. During the period from 1966 to 1972, Woodlawn had the highest rate of male juvenile delinquents of the 76 community areas of Chicago (33.5 per 100 males between the ages of 12 and 16; Council for Community Services 1975). The 1970s, when the cohort was approximately aged 10 to 20, was a time of increased gang activity in the Woodlawn area with the neighborhood gang, the Blackstone Rangers, who developed into a young adult gang, the El Rukins. The violent crime boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which predominantly affected young African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811423106">Blumstein and Rosenfeld 1998</xref>), occurred when the cohort was 20 to 30 years old.</p><p>By 1992 (age 32), although most of the cohort members had moved out of Woodlawn, they continued to represent urban dwellers enduring significant disadvantage. For instance, by age 32, 9 percent of the interviewed cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 952) still lived in Woodlawn and 65 percent remained in the city of Chicago. In addition, the rates of poverty were high, with over a third (39 percent) below the poverty level and 49 percent in relative poverty compared to the median national income. In addition, only 9 percent reported no drug trafficking in their neighborhood while 62 percent reported heavy or moderate drug trafficking. Similarly, 66 percent stated that there were gangs in their neighborhood at age 32.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0022427811423106"><title>Measures</title><sec id="section8-0022427811423106"><title>Offending</title><p>The outcome of interest, adult criminal offending over the life course, is operationalized as annual arrest counts for ages 17 to 32.

The negligence of incarceration time in the rate of offending could result in an underestimation of the actual offending trajectory in any given year, as recent research has found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811423106">Eggleston, Laub, and Sampson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811423106">Piquero et al. 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, we do not have the exact number of days incarcerated at each age so we could not incorporate annualized exposure time on the street into the criminal histories. However, we are able to incorporate the sentencing data found in the arrest records into the criminal histories such that a person is considered incarcerated in any year where he or she has zero offenses and is known to have been sentenced to more than 1 year at that age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811423106">5</xref></sup> Using this strategy, we attempt to reduce the chances of presuming someone has desisted from offending who in fact was incarcerated.</p><p>Over the ages of 17 to 32, 40.8 percent of the 965 cohort members were arrested for at least one offense (59.9 percent males and 23.4 percent females; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811423106">Table 1</xref>). Among the offenders, over half (59.1 percent) of the male offenders and close to a third of the female offenders (34.7 percent) were arrested for violence (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427811423106">Figure 1</xref> presents a general overview of the annualized mean offending rate for the Woodlawn men and women for ages 17 through 32 for total offending.

This difference in mean level of offending is consistent with the wealth of information that exists on gender differences in offending. An unexpected finding from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427811423106">Figure 1</xref> is the fact that crime does not decline with age for this cohort, regardless of gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811423106">6</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="table1-0022427811423106" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Offending Descriptives for Woodlawn Cohort By Gender.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-0022427811423106" xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811423106-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="4">Total (<italic>N</italic> = 965)</th><th align="center" colspan="4">Males (<italic>N</italic> = 461)</th><th align="center" colspan="4">Females (<italic>N</italic> = 504)</th></tr><tr><th/><th>Percentage</th><th align="center"><italic>M</italic></th><th align="center"><italic>SD</italic></th><th>Range</th><th align="center">Percentage</th><th align="center"><italic>M</italic></th><th align="center"><italic>SD</italic></th><th align="center">Range</th><th align="center">Percentage</th><th align="center"><italic>M</italic></th><th align="center"><italic>SD</italic></th><th>Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any arrest</td><td>40.8</td><td>2.30</td><td>5.42</td><td>0–50</td><td>59.9</td><td>4.08</td><td>7.11</td><td>0–50</td><td>23.4</td><td>.68</td><td>2.11</td><td>0–23</td></tr><tr><td>Violent arrest</td><td>21.1</td><td>.59</td><td>1.70</td><td>0–21</td><td>35.4</td><td>1.10</td><td>2.31</td><td>0–21</td><td>8.1</td><td>.13</td><td>.50</td><td>0–5</td></tr><tr><td>Property arrest</td><td>26.5</td><td>.84</td><td>2.37</td><td>0–30</td><td>39.5</td><td>1.40</td><td>2.98</td><td>0–30</td><td>14.7</td><td>.33</td><td>1.45</td><td>0–22</td></tr><tr><td>Drug arrest</td><td>15.5</td><td>.35</td><td>1.20</td><td>0–14</td><td>28.0</td><td>.67</td><td>1.64</td><td>0–14</td><td>4.2</td><td>.06</td><td>.32</td><td>0–4</td></tr><tr><td>Other arrest</td><td>19.3</td><td>.46</td><td>1.35</td><td>0–13</td><td>30.8</td><td>.81</td><td>1.82</td><td>0–13</td><td>8.7</td><td>.13</td><td>.51</td><td>0–5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig1-0022427811423106" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mean number of arrests for Woodlawn Cohort by gender.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022427811423106-fig1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="section9-0022427811423106"><title>Marriage</title><p>We draw upon the self-report interview data from the young adult (age 32) and mid-life (age 42) interviews to compile annualized information of whether someone was married or not at each age.

Drawing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427811423106">Sampson and Laub’s (1994)</xref> work, we measure early disadvantage as a combination of structural components, family background, and parental disposition.

We employ hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), which allows a simultaneous estimate of variations in crime within individuals over time and between-individual differences in offending patterns. To study individual change within the HLM framework, the crime counts for each individual by age are viewed as nested within that individual. There are two levels of analysis. Level 1 estimates each person’s development with a unique individual growth trajectory that depends on a set of parameters. The growth parameters from level 1 become the outcome variables in level 2 of the model and are determined by person-level characteristics. Therefore, level 1 in the model estimates the within-individual change and level 2 in the model represents the between-individual analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427811423106">Raudenbush and Bryk 2002</xref>).</p><p>The analysis used here is modeled closely after Laub and Sampson’s analysis of marriage and offending among the Glueck males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>: chapter 9). At the within-individual level, crime is modeled as a function of age and marriage. Specifically, a hierarchical Poisson model is used for the males while a hierarchical Bernoulli model is used for the females since over 50 percent of the women were only arrested once. In both of these models, we use the overdispersed model to account for the skewed nature of the data with the abundance of zeros at each age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427811423106">Raudenbush et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>The outcome variable for the male model is the log of offending per year and for females it is the log of the odds of offending per year.

It is an open empirical question whether the differences in social context, marital patterns, and offending patterns among urban African American males and females impact the capacity of marriage to influence offending as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with national data, only one third of the Woodlawn men were married by age 32, with an average age of marriage of 26. These men did not follow a typical age-crime curve in their offending patterns with stable patterns throughout age 32, a trend that is in stark contrast to our existing knowledge of the age-crime curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811423106">Hirschi and Gottfredson 1983</xref>). This trend seems to be driven by assault behavior with assault increasing over time for this cohort and robbery decreasing with age, as predicted (data not shown). A comparison with the self-report data also indicates that the Woodlawn cohort has high rates of violence throughout young adulthood. In adolescence, 72 percent of the 705 respondents self-reported at least one violent crime in the past 3 years and 44 percent of the cohort interviewed in young adulthood (<italic>N</italic> = 952) reported at least one violent crime between ages 17 and 32.</p><p>Yet, despite these marital and offending patterns that are dissimilar from Whites, those African Americans that did marry benefited from that life event as evidenced by a reduction in offending across crime type. Thus, the African American men in our sample, despite their low propensity to marry are susceptible to marriage’s beneficial effects. This finding is consistent with Laub and Sampson (2003) and with the finding from King et al. (2007) who found that the effect of marriage on crime reduction was most salient among the men with the lowest propensity to marry.</p><p>Overall, the findings from the male sample provide strong evidence in favor of the generality of the core finding of Sampson and Laub’s age-graded theory of informal social control in that the marriage effect applies to urban African American males as well as White males. However, this study did not address the mechanisms by which marriage impacts a reduction in offending. Thus, while a marriage effect seems to exist for these urban African American males, questions remain as to whether the mechanisms that are proposed for Whites similarly apply to this population. This is clearly an area for future research. Another area of future research is in applying methodology that can examine the causality of marriage on desistance from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423106">King et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811423106">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>). Although our methodology did not allow us to speak directly to the causal nature of the relationship between marriage and offending, it should be noted that our findings for the Woodlawn males were similar in size and nature to those found in research using the Glueck data set, a less contemporary all White male data set.</p><p>For women, only property crime was reduced when a woman was in a state of marriage, with marriage having no effect on total crime or violent crime and increasing drug crime. This lack of consistent findings for females in our study is consistent with current research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811423106">King et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811423106">Leverentz 2006</xref>) and lends credence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson’s (2003)</xref> warning that “good marriage” effects may not be as applicable to women as they are for men. It may be that since the males are more antisocial they are more likely to “marry up” as opposed to their less antisocial female counterparts who “marry down” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). This notion may be particularly true for African American women. Several researchers have indicated that there is a smaller proportion of “marriageable men” (i.e., employed, not incarcerated, and alive) among African Americans compared to Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811423106">Lichter et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022427811423106">Wilson 1987</xref>) and African American women are less likely to marry outside their race than African American men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811423106">Qian 2005</xref>). Moreover, the dramatic impact of incarceration as a life experience for so many African American men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811423106">Lopoo and Western 2005</xref>) may eliminate their ability to provide direct supervision over their wives and compromise their ability to provide informal social control, two key mechanisms of desistance according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811423106">Laub and Sampson (2003)</xref>. An investigation into these potential mechanisms is needed.</p><p>Another possible explanation may be that if African American women are more likely to have children prior to marriage than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811423106">Chadiha, Veroff, and Leber 1998</xref>) and have high regard for motherhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811423106">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>), it may be that motherhood is an earlier and more salient source of social control for these women than marriage. Indeed, recent research has found parenthood to have strong inhibitory effects on disadvantaged African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811423106">Kreager, Matsueda, and Erosheva 2010</xref>). Although an investigation into parenthood as a time-varying covariate is beyond the scope of this study, preliminary evidence indicates that motherhood was prevalent in the teen years (37 percent of the Woodlawn women became mothers before the age 20) with high rates of having a child before marriage (39 percent) or having a child and never marrying (27 percent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022427811423106">12</xref></sup> Another explanation that must be noted may be that since the Woodlawn women had much lower rates of offending than the men, the lack of findings may be the result of too little power to see a marriage effect.</p><p>The fact that drug arrests increase among the Woodlawn women when in a state of marriage suggests that assortative mating may be at play for these women when it comes to substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811423106">Simons et al. 2002</xref>). Although we do not have information on the deviance of the marital partner, the pool of antisocial men may be quite large in disadvantaged areas, which increases the likelihood that antisocial females will have antisocial partners. This assortative mating may be particularly relevant for drug crimes as having drug using partners has been linked with continuity in offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811423106">Leverentz 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427811423106">Schroeder, Giordano, and Cernkovich 2007</xref>). However, given that only 4.2 percent of the women were arrested for a drug crime, future research on larger samples of women with drug offenses would increase the confidence in this finding.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study that need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, we use official records to establish offending patterns. Although official records often provide more accuracy regarding timing and the type of offense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811423106">Weis 1986</xref>), official records are limited to those events that come to the attention of the police. More specifically, the use of official data introduces the requirement of an official reaction to crime in addition to the commission of a criminal offense, which only allows a subset of actual criminal offending to be assessed. There may also be gender differences in police reaction, which could further underestimate female crime. Second, the data lack annualized incarceration data, which will inevitably underestimate the crime among this population, especially since it is a population that is likely to experience incarceration. To the extent possible, future analyses should include both official and self-report data and include more precise incarceration information. Third, we could not study cohabitation, study competing time-varying social control elements such as employment, or uncover the mechanisms underlying the change in offending. Therefore, greater attention as to whether cohabitation functions similarly to marriage, whether marriage remains a robust predictor of desistance once other life events are taken into account, and why marriage reduces offending (e.g., through increased social control, a change in self-definition, or a change in routine activities and friendships) is needed. Finally, as in all longitudinal studies, the Woodlawn study has experienced attrition. Although attrition analyses uncovered very few differences between those who were and were not followed, the results should be interpreted with this in mind.</p><p>A major strength of the study is that it examines the marriage effect on a cohort of African Americans who grew up in a socially disadvantaged inner-city community in the 1960s. First, there are few longitudinal studies of African Americans who have both low rates of marriage, high rates of crime, and have been followed from childhood into young adulthood. Second, this type of cohort is of importance to criminological research as it represents those who live in communities ravaged with crime and drug use across the nation. Finally, although its findings are not necessarily generalizable to a specified larger population, the results do provide one more piece of the “generalizability of the marriage effect on crime” puzzle. Further research could add to this growing body of literature with respect to Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and cohorts from varying time periods and geographic locations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank John Laub for his comments on an earlier draft of this article and extend a special thanks to Judy Robertson for her invaluable research assistance.

Thus, a person is coded as married or not for the whole year at each age. There are two reasons for coding someone as “not married” who was living with a partner. First, some argue that marriage is a greater investment than cohabitation and marriage brings with it the social benefits under study that may be lacking in a cohabitating couple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811423106">Wilson 2002</xref>). Second, and more importantly, there is a data limitation in the Woodlawn data, in that, it lacks annualized data on cohabitation.

We reanalyzed the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) models restricting the sample to male offenders (<italic>N</italic> = 278) and found similar results.
