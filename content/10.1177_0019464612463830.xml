<p>Toby Huff’s aim in this book is to prove that civilisations outside of Europe—namely the Islamic world (Ottoman and Mughal Empires) and China—lacked curiosity and scientific creativity that Europe has proved to have had in the seventeenth century. Europe’s singular scientific and economic ascendancy is based on the so-called Scientific Revolution leading to Industrial Revolution which has lead to Europe’s economic prosperity. Phrased more generally, he asks why did scientific breakthroughs not take place outside of Europe? His goal is to unfold the historical deep structures in comparative framework to be able to understand the cultural and intellectual starting points of the four above mentioned civilisations. He goes on to partly explain this as inherent in the systems of education that Europe, Middle East, South Asia and China had and partly in the religion and culture of these places. Although he is quite convincing in the importance he attaches to universities—as means of knowledge creation, accumulation and diffusion—in economic growth of polities, his cultural explanations to divergent knowledge growth among the civilisations leave the reader rather unsatisfied.</p>
<p>In this book, almost an addition to his 1993 publication <italic>The rise of early modern science: Islam, China, and the West</italic>, Huff takes up astronomy, anatomy and microbiology, physics, magnetism and electricity to demonstrate how Europeans have solely intellectually transformed our understanding of nature and its principles which has lead to this modern world that we are all experiencing. In his opinion Europeans were uniquely infectiously curious about nature and humans in comparison to the non-Europeans and therefore were able to make discoveries and inventions that had powerful implications for humanity. Huff attempts to explain why Europe achieved what it did and others did not. Taking up the invention of telescope, for example, and then measuring the responses of its introduction by Europeans to the non-European civilisations and proving that their responses were muted, Huff concludes that they were ‘non-curios’.</p>
<p>The book under review is problematical and therefore weak in its very conception, planning and writing. To begin with the title: it cannot be termed ‘a global perspective’ as Eastern Europe, Russia, Safavid Empire, vast parts of South Asia outside of the Mughal Empire, South East Asia and Japan have not received any attention at all. Instead of multilateral comparison among the regions taken up, Huff chose to undertake binary comparisons of each of the non-European areas with Europe, thereby seeking differences rather than connections. He is unable to explain why the Ottomans and the Chinese did not continue their Golden Ages which were very linked to knowledge creation. The author makes faulty assumptions on civilisations and religions that they are intrinsically linked to and seems to be swayed by ‘Clash of Civilisations’ kind of writing that have been severely criticised.</p>
<p>For the case of South Asia, while he informs himself partly about Mughal India and Persian based knowledge, he entirely ignores the vast Sanskrit knowledge system, on which so much work has been done by scholars like David Pingree, David Shulman, Sheldon Pollock, and Christopher Minkowski, to name a very select group. Similarly Huff perceives Mughal India as Islamic, neglecting that the vast majority of the population was non-Islamic and that it was a multilingual, multicultural set-up with several peoples with their own varied traditions of learning in numerous vernacular languages, apart from Arabic and Persian. Similarly South Asia’s contributions to knowledge and technical standards are well recognised and written about by S R Sarma, Tirthankar Roy, Prasannan Parthasarathi, Dhruv Raina and Deepak Kumar to name a few, which Huff simply does not engage with. Huff’s writings on China are better informed yet he lacks a critical outlook on the Jesuit reporting of their activities in China, does not explain how similar institutional set up in education and physically unified world in Europe and China yield different results. Although Huff attempts to study the Ottoman Empire, no explanation is offered as to why the vast and stable Safavid Empire is left out of the scope of his study. The bibliography on the Ottoman empire also seems as dated as the one on Mughal India.</p>
<p>Despite critically acclaimed and widely available books on knowledge and science like Arun Bala, <italic>The Dialogue of Civilisations</italic>, Harold Cook, <italic>Matters of Exchange: Commerce, Medicine and Science in the Dutch Golden Age</italic> and Simon Schaffer etc. edited <italic>The Brokered World: Go-Betweens and Global Intelligence</italic>, Huff neither acknowledges nor gives any credit to knowledge or information from the colonies and their role in the evolution of modern science.</p>
<p>It is surprising that a cultural explanation to the Great Divergence debate—to which this book is an addition—has been offered as an explanation: the failure of the rest to be culturally like the west. Perhaps unaware that in today’s world his conclusions—leaning on Max Weber and Benjamin Nelson—would be labelled as Euro-centric, he stills drives home the message hard and fast that there were no parallels to Europe’s discoveries in the seventeenth century, that other civilisations had no role to play in it, that knowledge contained in them gave no impetus to the Europeans and that Europe is superior because of its culture. For many scholars, these will be hard pills to swallow. For a book that claims to be on intellectual curiosity, a bit more curiosity on part of the author toward the well documented histories, societies and cultures of the non-European civilisations would have been appreciated.</p>
