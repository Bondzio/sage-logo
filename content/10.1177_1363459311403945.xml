<abstract>
<p>Knowledge about depression, access and help-seeking has increasingly been influenced from a range of disciplines including clinical and applied social science. A range of interventions can improve outcomes of depression and anxiety. However, many in need do not seek help, or their interaction with care-givers does not address their needs. We carried out a systematic search for qualitative articles focusing on the experiences of eight exemplar groups with exceptional problems in access (the homeless, long-term unemployed, adolescents with eating disorders, depressed elderly people, advanced cancer sufferers, patients with medically unexplained symptoms, asylum seekers and people from black and minority ethnic groups). Twenty articles representing these groups were selected, findings were then developed using qualitative meta-synthesis, this suggested a range of mechanisms accounting for poor access among these groups. Many regarded their mental health problems as rooted in social problems and employed a variety of self-management strategies to maintain function. These strategies could involve social withdrawal, focusing available resources on close family relationships and work roles. Over-investment in these roles could result in a sense of insecurity as wider networks were neglected. Material disadvantage affected both the resources people could bring to performing social roles and influenced help-seeking. A tacit understanding of the material, psychological and social ‘costs’ of engagement by patients and health professionals could influence decisions to seek and offer help. These costs were felt to be proportionally higher in deprived, marginalized and minority communities, where individual resources are limited and the stigma attached to mental ill-health is high.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A wide range of interventions are effective in improving outcomes of common but disabling mental health problems such as depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311403945">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311403945">2007b</xref>). However, many groups with high levels of mental distress are disadvantaged because care is not available to them in the right place and time, or when they access it, their interaction with care-givers deters help-seeking or diverts it into forms that do not address their needs.</p>
<p>We report on a qualitative meta-synthesis of the experiences and perspectives of people accessing mental health treatment. Eight exemplar groups were established a priori as part of a comprehensive multi-method review to inform the design of interventions to improve access in primary care in England<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459311403945">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311403945">Dowrick et al., 2009</xref>). We focused on groups with common mental health problems, which are routinely managed in primary care but who are known to have problems in access. The initial selection of groups was informed by literature review, clinical and professional experience, previous work of the authors and steering group, and refined in consultation with a panel of international experts:</p>
<list id="list1-1363459311403945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>people suffering from advanced cancer (AC);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>adolescents with eating disorders (AED);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>asylum seekers and refugees (AS);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>people from black and ethnic minority groups (BME);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>depressed elderly people (ELD);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>long-term unemployed people (EMP);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>homeless people (HL);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>people with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Access is a concept that defies simple definition and a number of different conceptual models are of use in understanding the nature of access. As a preliminary to the wider multi-method review, we conducted a comprehensive theoretical review of access in the health literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311403945">Gask et al., forthcoming</xref>) that informed the direction of the synthesis. The review suggested that many important barriers to access are found in individuals’ understandings of the meaning of mental health problems that impact on help-seeking behaviour and in the negotiation of appropriate care in the GP consultation. Identifying the experiences, understandings and needs of potential service users is therefore a central task in designing appropriate interventions to improve access. Two concepts were of particular relevance: candidacy and recursivity.</p>
<p>Candidacy describes how people’s eligibility for health care is determined between themselves and health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311403945">Dixon-Woods et al., 2005</xref>). The reaction to each illness episode draws on past experience, cultural expectations, norms and self-definitions of eligibility. This understanding of a right to care is then shaped towards resolving the individual illness episode. Candidacy in relation to an individual illness episode should be seen as a special case of the individuals’ ongoing perceptions of their right to care, balanced against a fear of socially inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>Like candidacy, recursivity focuses on interaction with health services. Recursivity suggests that patient health and illness behaviour can be both enabled and constrained by the interactions that take place between individuals and health professionals in health service settings. Illness behaviour and personal illness management strategies are modified by service contact, as people learn to ‘fit’ into what is required of them by health professionals and their beliefs about what is legitimate illness and service use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311403945">Rogers et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditional epidemiological approaches to access to care hint at an underlying complexity but they tend to focus on symptoms at the expense of context. However, decisions to access help are context specific and reflect people’s judgements about resources available to mitigate their distress. Access and utilization are thus social processes, with subjective, as well as objective, features. They involve a dynamic relationship with patients’ own resources for managing illness episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311403945">Gately et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311403945">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Qualitative research focuses on the experience, meanings and understandings of people from their individual perspectives. Approaches to research with roots in this <italic>verstehende</italic> (literally understanding) tradition have a common understanding of the status of concepts, which differs from that in traditions informed primarily by the hypothetico-deductive perspective. Since the researcher cannot know in advance how subjects understand and interpret the worlds they inhabit, qualitative research uses open questioning and is accordingly inductive and interpretive. In data collection, analysis and communicating findings, the researcher is actively involved in interpreting the meanings communicated by the research subject. These understandings are often fed back into subsequent lines of questioning, through for example the constant comparative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311403945">Glaser, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of approaches to qualitative synthesis in health have been developed in response to different research problems and orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311403945">Barnett-Page and Thomas, 2009</xref>). Meta-synthesis was identified as the most appropriate method to further conceptual understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311403945">Paterson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311403945">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>). Meta-synthesis in common with primary qualitative research is inductive and interpretive; more than simple review, its aim is to generate new concepts, theories and hypotheses by exploring those that exist in relation to particular phenomena. This can bring insights into the scope, range and operation of these concepts and their potential for transferability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311403945">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>), the degree of stability in contents, organization or operation across differing research contexts, or phenomena. Much like the relationship between conventional systematic review and meta-analyses then, meta-synthesis aims first to bring previous research on a particular problem together to inform decision making, and second, to explore implications which may extend specialist knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section3-1363459311403945">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>Searching for a specialist qualitative literature brings particular challenges, so a number of less conventional tools for maximizing the retrieval of appropriate articles were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311403945">Barroso et al., 2003</xref>). First we generated search terms for each group using:</p>
<list id="list2-1363459311403945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>identification of known articles by the research team;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>identification of citations from these articles;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>generation of free text search terms from these articles;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>generation of further terms from the Cochrane Anxiety, Depression and Neurosis Group and a review of access to health care in vulnerable groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311403945">Dixon-Woods et al., 2005</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>translation of these terms to the particular databases.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Search terms related to the population and/or symptoms/diagnosis appropriate to each exemplar group, which were then filtered using terms relating to ‘Mental Health’ and ‘Qualitative Methods’. A qualitative filter developed for previous work was used (search terms are available from the authors on request). Searches were piloted in Medline then adapted to run across Cinahl, Psychinfo, Embase, ASSIA and Web of Knowledge. Piloting involved checking that known articles were identified, and fine tuning as necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1363459311403945">
<title>Selecting the articles for synthesis</title>
<p>We searched across six databases using search terms designed to maximize retrieval, this can result in a significant number of duplicates and miss-hits. To arrive at the final selection for synthesis involved several stages of increasing attention to detail:</p>
<list id="list3-1363459311403945" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In total, 7370 articles were retrieved across Medline, Cinhal, Psychinfo, Embase, ASSIA and WoK.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 4421 duplicates and miss-hits were removed electronically and by hand, searching by title, then by abstract, resulting in 2949 articles going forward.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These 2949 were coded YES/ NO/MAYBE; maybe were discussed, resulting in 515 articles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These 515 articles were rated 1 to 5: of these, all AC and HL, for ELD ≥ 2*, for the remainder ≥ 3*, went forward, resulting in a total of 226 abstracts to be reviewed by the team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Of the 226 abstracts reviewed, 115 articles were selected and methodological details tabulated, to inform a selection of 47 articles for quality appraisal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality appraisal on standardized pro forma was carried out on the 47 articles; informed further discussion by the review team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These discussions resulted in selection of a final data set of 20 articles across the eight groups.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Following the insights gained in the conceptual review, the key principle guiding the selection of articles was whether or not there was some implicit or explicit discussion of help-seeking, lay referral or access, or engagement with services. The articles also had to be qualitative and appropriate to the predetermined exemplar groups. Where appropriate, samples were reviewed independently by a number of authors to check for consistency, the team then discussed the decisions made. From step 4 the standard required for inclusion in one of the less well-represented groups is lower than that in a group in which more articles were retrieved. Other factors affecting the number of articles in the final selection of each group relates to the diversity of the population within a group (e.g. BME) and to the range of concepts used in relation to that group (e.g. MUS). At each stage we maintained a rough conceptual map, to check that important concepts were not being discarded, and to inform the selection at the next stage. The selection of articles was then an inductive process, akin to theoretical sampling in primary qualitative data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311403945">Glaser, 1965</xref>).</p>

<title>Quality appraisal</title>
<p>Quality appraisal provides the necessary confidence in the veracity of the relationship between primary data and the authors’ interpretations, centred on the visible grounding of authors’ interpretations in primary data, and a clear description of the selection of participants and the way data was collected and analysed. Following previous meta-synthesis in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311403945">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311403945">Pound et al., 2005</xref>) we chose a quality appraisal tool developed by the British Sociological Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311403945">Blaxter, 1996</xref>). This tool uses 15 principal dimensions for appraisal related to:</p>
<list id="list4-1363459311403945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>appropriateness of research design to research question;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>relationship of aims and methods to subject and methodological literature;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>systematic, well-considered and documented data collection procedures;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>adequacy of presentation of primary data and its relationship to analysis;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>appropriateness and rigour in analysis.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The resulting pro forma were summarized and collated to inform discussion of the final selection of articles (detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363459311403945">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The ‘line of argument synthesis’ is appropriate when the intent of synthesis is to map, explore and bring together the range of conceptual thinking in relation to a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311403945">Noblit and Hare, 1988</xref>). Meta-synthesis conceives of concepts as being of three orders:</p>
<list id="list5-1363459311403945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First order concepts relate to the interpretations of their own experiences related by those interviewed in the original studies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second order concepts relate to the interpretations the original authors bring to these data, and to their study as a whole through exploring the differences and similarities in the primary data, and by relating these insights to common concepts in the literature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third order concepts relate to the new interpretations created through the synthesis by bringing together the second order concepts as a line of argument.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The process of meta-synthesis involved three main steps. Qualitative reporting often takes a narrative approach, conventionally first order concepts emerge in findings, while second order concepts are found in the discussion. The first stage of the synthesis was to extract the first and second order concepts and associated primary quotations to a standardized pro forma (represented by the first two columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363459311403945">Table 3</xref>). Since the second order concepts used are interpretive, similar concepts are used in different ways across studies. The first phase of the second order synthesis, aimed to ‘translate’ the findings, metaphors and concepts derived from each article into one another. Translation involved experimenting with different arrangements and groupings of the key concepts identified in the extraction, and the relationships between them. Concepts and relationships were interrogated as rough maps on a whiteboard while referring back to the extraction pro forma. Promising configurations were photographed. This process went through many iterations until we arrived at a network of meanings that was felt to capture accurately and characterize the findings within and across groups accurately. The operation of this framework was checked by referring to the original articles (resulting in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363459311403945">Table 2</xref>). The aim of the second order synthesis was to arrive at a set of concepts that represent the most parsimonious expression that can account for the data as a whole.</p>

<p>The third order synthesis involved refining the relationships between concepts and sets of concepts to arrive at some organizing principles and structures (1 to 7 in Findings), which could best contain and bring meaning to these networks of concepts.

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>The qualitative synthesis presented here is only one possible reading of the issues. Looking for commonalities across a wide range of groups, often with quite different problems, inevitably fails to explore fully the complex difficulties experienced within each group. Members of the extended research team authored a number of articles included in this review; this was discussed at some length by the review panel. The team was made up of members who often had considerable expertise in the groups under study; it was felt that to exclude articles on this basis would skew the sample. Furthermore the presence of these authors on the working group allowed for interrogation and clarification of the concepts generated and provided a useful check of authenticity to the source document.</p>

<title>1. Illness models – a bricolage of psyche, soma, social</title>
<p>Findings across exemplar groups emphasized that psychological distress was accompanied, preceded or understood through meshed problems of physical and social functioning. ‘Bricolage’ refers to ad hoc construction of something that works from a range of things which happen to be available.</p>
<p>Both pain and mood could be experienced as fluid, flowing between biological, psychological and social elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311403945">Peters et al., 1998</xref>). In this respect, metaphors, spiritual, magical and religious understandings bridged systems, allowing pain and suffering to be externalized, or moved to a location where it was easier to cope with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311403945">Peters et al., 1998</xref>). Conviction about these understandings and beliefs could be an effective coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403945">Koffman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403945">Whittaker et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For asylum seekers and BME groups, traditional professional notions of mental health were regarded as dissonant with individuals’ self-concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>) and culturally unacceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>). Pain and suffering were seen as personally or culturally dependent experiences that could not be understood by western doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403945">Green et al., 2002</xref>). Health systems in people’s countries of origin often prioritized physical illness, leading to a tendency towards somatic expression of psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311403945">Perron and Hudelson, 2006</xref>). Adolescents with eating disorders understood their problems as psychosocial in origin though their presenting problem and subsequent treatment focused on the resulting physical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>2. Illness narratives – trajectories of uncertainty, control, hope and fear</title>
<p>Across the groups there was an understanding of the development of mental ill-health as a process. This could be characterized as a gradual ‘wearing down’, or as a series of ‘crisis events’ and ‘traumas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403945">Palmer and Ward, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311403945">Perron and Hudelson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311403945">Rogers and Allison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403945">Tischler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403945">Warfa et al., 2006</xref>). These events might be considered as distinct triggers but appeared more often to be brought together forming a ‘legacy of residual, untreated psychological distress’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Fear, uncertainty and a lack of control were characterized as a ‘merry-go-round of hope and despair’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403945">Nettleton et al., 2005</xref>: 206) and could relate to pain, physical symptoms, degeneration or mortality. This lack of control affected people’s capacity to perform social roles adequately, resulting in a feeling of losing control over self-definition.</p>
<p>This was particularly marked for South Asian women who experienced a sense of burden over social responsibilities beyond their control. The concept of ‘izzat’ refers to personal and family status that was described as a pervasive feature of family life. While ‘izzat’ is owned by men, its maintenance is frequently the result of the gender role performance of women. Inadequate performance can be sanctioned through the threat of isolation from family and wider community networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-1363459311403945">
<title>3. Illness experience – the relevance of roles, relationships and social networks</title>
<p>Psychological distress was understood as a consequence of difficult personal circumstances. Social problems related to changes in the capacity to perform the roles central to an individual’s identity. These included familial roles, work roles as well as associated and peripheral social roles. Illness could bring a change in the sense of self and the way individuals interacted with the social world around them. Concepts of illness and personal identity were used to frame the interplay of complex sociological and psychological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311403945">Chew and May, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403945">Millward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403945">Nettleton et al., 2005</xref>), social roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311403945">Chew and May, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403945">Millward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403945">Palmer and Ward, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311403945">Perron and Hudelson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403945">Tischler et al., 2007</xref>) and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403945">Burroughs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Across all groups this resulted in feelings of insecurity and isolation as a result of being unable to engage meaningfully with social networks. The mechanisms underlying this isolation differed across and within groups. For some it was a result of life changes or changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403945">Burroughs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403945">Luoma and Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403945">Millward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403945">Tischler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403945">Warfa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403945">Whittaker et al., 2005</xref>). For others it related to dysfunctional social networks or a lack of fit between their self-understandings and others’ expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, one study illuminated how some homeless mothers had exhausted the capacity of their social networks, resulting in withdrawal and a lack of confidence in others. The inevitable focus on their children and their role as mother clashed with shelter living which deprived them of the space and resources for performing the maternal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403945">Tischler et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, women from South Asian communities could be cut off from their familial and social networks if they failed to conform to the rules and roles of those cultures or the expectations of their partner or family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>). For Chinese women the circumstances of their migration and language problems resulted in ‘encapsulation in their husband’s social networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403945">Green et al., 2002</xref>: 218). Respondents from the Somali community reported that divisions within the community rooted in pre-migration experiences of war were exacerbated by factors (such as geographic mobility, lack of permission to work and the receipt of inflexible benefits) which diminished the ability of the community to establish networks and resources which could contain community life and emotional support in diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403945">Warfa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403945">Whittaker et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1363459311403945">
<title>4. Stigma – stereotyping, labelling and discrimination</title>
<p>Lack of control over self-definition could occur through the experience of stereotypes and labelling. Asylum seekers experienced discrimination in their day-to-day lives and contacts with services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403945">Warfa et al., 2006</xref>). This experience was shared by women from more established minority communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>). The elderly could be subject to discrimination in accessing mental health treatment in the form of ‘therapeutic nihilism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311403945">Burroughs et al., 2006</xref>: 370). Advanced cancer sufferers struggled to conceal their changing physical appearance and the side-effects of cancer treatment fearing that others would perceive and define them in this limited way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403945">Luoma and Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These experiences could extend into interaction with the health care system, stigma often related to mental health diagnosis but was also felt in relation to other diagnoses (such as eating disorders and cancer) and problems (such as unemployment and the sick role). Experience and fear of discrimination in day-to-day life added to individuals’ perceptions that medical diagnosis was another form of labelling.</p>
<p>People worried that voicing their difficulties in coping rather than denying them could cause the problems and the lack of control over them to somehow become more ‘real’. The threat in accepting a mental health diagnosis was not just the lack of power experienced in allowing medical personnel to define them in professional terms, but more potently, in the danger that allowing labelling leads to acceptance and accommodation, such that ‘you live your label’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>: 21). This was just one example of the way that labels and stereotypes could be self-imposed as well as imposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403945">Green et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403945">Koffman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459311403945">Warfa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403945">Whittaker et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>5. Self-management and coping strategies</title>
<p>Studies reported how members of the exemplar groups could go for long periods without recognizing their problems as related to mental health. Recognition of the need for help was followed at times by a reluctance to engage in treatment. Consequently informal coping or self-management strategies took on a greater salience. Different groups and cultures had distinctive self-management styles.</p>
<p>An important theme across groups was a source of pride, self-esteem and a sense of belonging derived from their ability to cope with adversity. This fed into a tendency to rely on individualized or group self-care as a first option in preference to treatment from formal services. Black women interviewed in two studies felt a deep cultural connection to ‘being strong’ related to community and understanding of enduring longstanding oppression and slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>). This interpretation of individual narratives based on wider collective narratives relating to power, struggle and oppression was also emphasized in other groups through themes such as ‘resilience’, ‘overcoming’ and ‘mastery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403945">Koffman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403945">Palmer and Ward, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A related self-management strategy focused on concealment of symptoms from wider social networks, in an attempt to maintain a semblance of normative social function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311403945">Koffman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459311403945">Whittaker et al., 2005</xref>). While self-management strategies could be instituted by the person, it was clear that families, communities and health professionals could encourage or coerce individuals in the adoption of particular strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403945">Luoma and Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>). Concealment also functioned as a coping mechanism where withdrawing from peripheral roles meant that resources (time, skills, etc.) could be reallocated to primary roles. Concealment of mental health problems allowed communities to maintain confidence in the functionality of their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311403945">Burr and Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403945">Palmer and Ward, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>6. Disclosure, reframing, normalizing</title>
<p>The value of talking about problems and the decisions about who to talk to featured prominently. While talking might lead to practical help it did not appear to be the primary aim. A key aim of disclosure was in validating and normalizing their experience. Talking could also allow people to reframe their difficulties in relation to the problems of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459311403945">Tischler et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings raised the importance of talking to somebody else who would listen, and be understanding. Trust and confidentiality were often considered paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311403945">Chew-Graham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311403945">Palmer and Ward, 2007</xref>). Less explicit though perhaps equally important was that the person who was listening respected the boundaries set by those disclosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311403945">Luoma and Hakamies-Blomqvist, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311403945">Rother and Buckroyd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Those who became ‘patients’ or ‘service users’ reported particularly valuing talking therapies. Experiences of group therapy varied; some valued the social interaction and chance to meet new people, some used it to reframe their own problems in relation to the more difficult circumstances of others. Some valued the sense of identification with others, although others construed it as stigmatizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>). In some cases identification with the treatment group could result in the validation, normalization and sharing of dysfunctional coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311403945">Millward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459311403945">Tierney, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>7. Primary care experiences and perceptions of help-seeking</title>
<p>Accounts suggested that GPs appeared to act from a tacit understanding of the personal and social costs of engaging in mental health treatment and from an assumption about the lack of effective or appropriate treatment strategies for dealing with the complexities of mental ill-health. This contributed further to the difficulty of negotiating candidacy.</p>
<p>Many patients interviewed in these studies expressed a dislike of anti-depressant treatment. This could be attributed to fear of addiction or dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311403945">Edge and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311403945">Green et al., 2002</xref>), but appeared also to relate to the idea of treatment as a symbolic transaction. It appeared that from the GPs’ perspective anti-depressant treatment had the benefit of low social and personal costs for the patient and, where stigma was an issue, was relatively easily concealed. However, this did not fit with patients’ understandings of their problems as appropriate responses to difficult circumstances. Anti-depressant prescribing could also be perceived as being ‘fobbed off’, leaving a feeling of being cheated after the difficulties of help-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311403945">Nettleton et al., 2005</xref>). While the GP perceived the costs of anti-depressants to be low for the patient, the patient perceived the costs to be low for the GP.</p>

<title>Configuring findings towards the problem of access – third order synthesis</title>
<p>Three concepts emerged from the synthesis, which link the second order concepts described above to the problem of access. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363459311403945">Table 3</xref> shows the relationship between the concepts used in the original articles, the key themes and sub-themes used in the translation, the second order concepts and the final synthesis (third order).</p>
<p>Across articles the most significant barriers to patients accessing mental health treatment related to an inability, reluctance or unwillingness to understand or configure their problems as mental health problems. This could be ascribed to a <italic>dissonance</italic> between professionals and patients which arises out of different understandings about the genesis, trajectories and management of distress.</p>
<p>This dissonance leads to people in ‘hard to reach groups’ experiencing <italic>communication problems</italic> in articulating their problems and negotiating their needs in general practice. This was not merely a lack of a common language, or a need for greater mental health literacy, rather it reflected reluctance on the part of patients to adapt to professional models of mental ill-health because of perceived threats to closely held identities.</p>
<p>This was linked to the perception that health professionals were unable or unwilling to engage with the patients’ <italic>understanding of who they are and how they relate to the worlds they inhabit</italic>. This emerged as fundamental to people’s understanding of aetiology, the way they framed their problems, their decisions to seek help and the behaviours they adopted in living with chronic mental health issues.</p>
<p>The operation and interaction of second and third order concepts are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363459311403945">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Illness models</italic> and <italic>illness experience</italic> are understood and situated within patients’ understandings of who they are, and the worlds they inhabit in the form of <italic>illness narratives. Stigma</italic> is experienced in wider life experiences and in relation to mental health diagnoses, leading to a reliance on <italic>self-management</italic> and uncertainty and ambivalence over <italic>disclosure</italic>. When help is sought this can limit patients’ capacity to communicate their distress, previous difficulty communicating in the <italic>primary care experience</italic> may result in the perception that primary care is not appropriate to these patients, or their problems, further impacting individual and group <italic>illness models</italic>. Taken as a whole, this dynamic was characterized as a <italic>dissonance</italic> between patient and professional understandings, resulting in problems of <italic>communication</italic> between patients and health professionals. To engage with the mental health problems of people from hard to reach groups when they do consult in primary care, GPs must <italic>understand the patient’s view of self and world</italic> and demonstrate this to the patient in negotiating the meaning of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options. In the context of the standard primary care consultation this is challenging, however, it can usefully be approached through the dynamic outlined in the synthesis. These seven key dimensions outline the mechanisms through which personal and cultural understandings of mental health problems are constructed over time. Different aspects of these dimensions may be more or less salient in the understandings of different groups, or individuals, at different stages in their life and illness. These meanings inform decisions to seek help, the ways in which individuals present and their perceptions about the appropriateness of diagnosis and treatment; these meanings are in turn modified by this interaction.</p>

<sec id="section18-1363459311403945" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our prior theoretical review suggested that we focus on understanding the problems of access from the perspective of potential service users, their perceptions and their interactions with health providers. We discovered that a number of groups did have what could be regarded as more traditional problems in accessing treatment: transport difficulties; residential instability; lack of time to engage with the health system; questions over their eligibility for primary health care; and a lack of understanding of the health care system. However, the most powerful barriers to access related to personal, cultural and social beliefs about the appropriateness and legitimacy of addressing issues they regarded as appropriate emotional responses to adverse social conditions within the health care system.</p>
<p>This highlights that the operation of candidacy and recursivity are dependent on individual circumstances, biography and systems of meaning. To address access through these channels requires an understanding of what accepting or avoiding a mental health diagnosis, and engaging or refusing treatment, means for the individual patient. The focus of the synthesis was the implications for accessing primary care, this emphasized the need for health practitioners to understand and engage with the patients’ wider life experiences. Three perspectives emerged as particularly important in understanding the interplay of mental health problems and everyday life, which must be considered in developing interventions: social withdrawal; resources; and roles.</p>
<sec id="section19-1363459311403945">
<title>The importance of social withdrawal</title>
<p>A principal finding was withdrawal from wider social networks and an increased focus on attempting to maintain core identities and roles. Social isolation was an important aetiological factor, a feature of coping mechanisms and an underlying factor in individuals’ reluctance to seek help in a form that involves accepting a mental health diagnosis. The threat to core identities in accepting a mental health diagnosis is greater for individuals who are isolated since they have less capacity to adapt existing identities or to reframe their experience.</p>
<p>Previous research and theoretical perspectives on social isolation, roles and identities suggests that multiple roles and wider social networks should promote well-being and provide a buffer against identity threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311403945">Thoits, 1983</xref>). This assumes that the social values and norms through which roles are understood are reasonably consistent across an individual’s social networks.</p>
<p>The experiences of the exemplar groups suggest a much more complex picture of individuals routinely operating across multiple competing value systems. The ability to influence which set of values are used to judge behaviour was important in maintaining the sense of personal agency necessary for well-being. In contingent relationships members of exemplar groups were often subordinates, forced to accept the definitions of the other party. Peripheral social roles are characteristically non-contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311403945">Giddens, 1991</xref>); as such they may provide discursive arenas for reflection where individuals have a greater freedom over their self-presentation, they could therefore be important in providing validation for an individual’s own interpretation of their behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1363459311403945">
<title>Material and immaterial ‘costs’ of engagement</title>
<p>An individual’s identity can be understood as a complex of investments, receipts and transactions that are given meaning and value through the shared understandings of recipients. These investments involve material and immaterial components. Social investments are rewarded through social capital and status and give the individual confidence in their ability to act at a distance through the community.</p>
<p>Collective understandings of the value of material and immaterial investments are understood through value systems and culture. Operating across multiple value systems gave rise to uncertainties over the value of social investments and the meanings of roles and identities. Loss of established roles and declining physical and social function were associated with loss of social status. Changes in environment could bring previous role competencies into question.</p>
<p>Behaviour is in some ways mediated through identity but it is also bounded by material and immaterial resources. Many of the studies focused on patients from socially disadvantaged groups, living in deprived areas under difficult circumstances, limiting both the material and social resources they could use to respond to adversity through illness. The proportional investment in managing illness when it occurs is therefore higher.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, fear of the stigma of mental illness is higher since any break in continuity of established role performance has greater social impact in communities already close to the limits of their capacity to function. This makes entering the sick role a more difficult prospect, it may have greater persistence since members of these communities cannot afford to invest heavily in members whose reliability has been called into question. Consequently, mental health treatment is concealed; leading to perceptions that treatment is not appropriate to the needs of individuals in such communities. This lack of identification will inevitably influence the receipt of health messages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1363459311403945">
<title>Patient and professional roles in the primary care mental health consultation</title>
<p>Traditional cultures commonly favour ritualized roles in which each actor is aware of the performance requirements of their role which increases the confidence in the outcome. This confidence is deemed particularly important in long-term social transactions and can be strongly sanctioned. This was exemplified in the synthesis in relation to the importance of ‘izzat’, or honour in South Asian culture. By contrast modern western cultures have moved to idealize what have been termed ‘pure’, or non-contingent relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311403945">Giddens, 1991</xref>), in which open, or fluid roles are possible. They are an idealized relationship characterized by openness, and an absence, or an agreement to suspend differences in status, values, or power relationships.</p>
<p>In what is essentially a transactional, or contingent relationship such as the GP consultation, where there is a significant difference in status and power, elements of these ‘fluid roles’ are often used in an attempt to put both parties at ease. This masking of differential status and power appears helpful, or unproblematic in consultations about problems with a clear physical origin. However, in mental health consultations the uncertainties inherent in this fluidity of roles can act as a further barrier to service entry. The successful negotiation of patient and practitioner roles and the establishment of a mutually acceptable understanding of the problem requires more time than is often available in orthodox settings such as the general practice consultation.</p>
<p>A moral dimension has been suggested whereby maintaining a core role function takes precedence over management of symptoms, impacting effective self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459311403945">Townsend et al., 2006</xref>). Our synthesis suggests that this moral dimension is often codified in group narratives, frequently related to the wider meta-narrative of oppression and overcoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311403945">Lyotard, 1984 [1979]</xref>). If individuals’ illness narratives and moral imperatives are constructed with reference to wider culturally specific narratives then understanding the operation of common, underlying moral themes may then suggest generic approaches to improving the acceptability of interventions.</p>
<p>Narratives were often used both to communicate and make sense of the chronic nature of the illness experience. Experience is rooted in understandings of who people are and embedded in the social world which gives meaning to behaviour. Meanings are constructed personally and presented and reflected socially; successful presentation of self is dependent on adequate assessments of audience and the willingness of the audience to react positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311403945">Goffman, 1959</xref>). The individual’s perspective on mental health problems and their resolution was located within this nexus of personal and social meaning.</p>
<p>Consequently the complexity of the formation and nature of identities are likely to compete with the ideal types operating in relation to mental illness patienthood in primary care settings. While the latter are by no means devoid of social notions of causation, they are likely to fail to acknowledge the diverse and contextually refined role played by differential social environments – in particular the challenges from which illness identities are mobilized, which then shape the experience of mental distress for the groups identified. This points to the need for interventions to incorporate a wider ranging notion of cultural competency, fostering an understanding of help-seeking which can address the diversity of cultures and plurality of needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311403945">Kirmayer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311403945">Papadopoulos, 2006</xref>: 82).</p>

<title>Conclusions: implications for the design of access interventions</title>
<p>This qualitative meta-synthesis examined the experiences of and attitudes to mental health treatment of the exemplar groups in order to shed light on access. The findings highlight the difficulties involved in engaging these groups through primary care. The depth perspective provided by this kind of review can help to inform interventions to encourage engagement both in and beyond primary care. However, it also highlights the reasons why many individuals, for whom mental distress, anxiety and depression add to already difficult life circumstances, are reticent about approaching primary care providers. This must be addressed through raising awareness of the range of mental health issues that can be appropriately addressed through primary care and for those who are not ready, able or willing to engage with this system providing signposts to more effective forms of self-management and ways of coping.</p>
<p>The conceptual overview provided by the synthesis resulted in the development of the following practical recommendations for the design of interventions to improve access to effective treatment for common mental health conditions in vulnerable groups.</p>
<list id="list6-1363459311403945" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The person providing the intervention has to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the service user/patient views themselves in relation to their world and their presenting problems in order to engage them effectively in care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The focus of treatment needs to be much broader than the individual, with an emphasis on re-engagement with the wider social world and its inherent and often complex problems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Self-help may be counter-productive in some groups as a focus on further investment within the narrow perspective of the primary role (which may be inherently dysfunctional e.g. being an ‘anorexic’) may be unhelpful as it further isolates the person from reintegrating with the world.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People require interventions which can offer opportunities to fulfil new roles which build on their existing strengths and help to increase confidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The challenge of treatment is to address unrealistic expectations sometimes brought about through a person’s engagement with multiple value systems but not pose a threat to a person’s standing, position and safety within their community.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Depending on the nature of the problem in question cultural/gender matching may or may not be the most appropriate option for presentation with mental health problems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The traditional ongoing GP relationship was reportedly valued however the ability to make informed choices and a diversity of available gatekeepers is paramount to increasing access for these groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Respect for and interest in culture (wanting to find out rather than knowing) appears to be more important than understanding – although some service users considered this to be important.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pressure to consult in family pairs/units and the use of family translators limit opportunities for effective mental health treatment in orthodox settings such as the general practice consultation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identity may be addressed through work on the self-narrative, through reframing past experience or by addressing attribution styles through cognitive behavioural approaches to therapy.</p></list-item>
