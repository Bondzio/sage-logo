<abstract>
<p>This study compared Chinese mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding of preschool children in different problem solving tasks. Participants were 57 children (including 29 girls) from seven kindergartens in Beijing, their mothers and teachers. Mothers varied in educational levels while all teachers were professionally qualified. Children solved four problems (supermarket, jigsaw puzzle, worksheet, and map) with their mothers and four comparable ones with their teachers. These tasks were appropriate for Chinese five-year-olds and differed in terms of dependence on verbal guidance, explicit learning content, contextual information, and complexity. Twenty-eight children worked with their mothers first; the problems were presented in the same order for both sets of dyads. Problem solving episodes (<italic>n</italic> = 228) were videotaped and transcribed. An interaction turn was the unit of analyses. Results indicated that teachers gave higher-level cognitive support and emotional feedback than did mothers. Mothers with more education provided more optimal scaffolding than those with less education; but teachers’ scaffolding for these two groups of children rarely differed. Both mothers and teachers adjusted their scaffolding as a function of task characteristics but teachers were more sensitive to task characteristics than mothers. Possible reasons for these results are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 30 years, interpersonal and contextual influences on young children’s cognitive development have been investigated with the Vygotskian perspective garnering more support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476718X11415578">Conner and Cross, 2003</xref>). This study compared Chinese mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding of preschoolers in different problem solving tasks, and examined the influences of maternal education and professional training in early childhood education on the quality of scaffolding.</p>
<sec id="section2-1476718X11415578">
<title>Child development in social contexts</title>
<p>According to Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476718X11415578">1978</xref>), children extend and transform the knowledge they bring into a situation through interaction with peers and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476718X11415578">Cobb, 1996</xref>). Collaborative interaction between preschool children and more experienced persons occurs in both preschool and family contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476718X11415578">Harkness and Super, 2002</xref>) and this significantly influences children’s thinking and learning.</p>
<p>The tutoring from the mother is an important context in which the child learns shared meanings in a specific culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476718X11415578">Rogoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476718X11415578">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). When children enter a formal kindergarten, the teacher gradually takes over the role of being the primary instructor from the mother by preparing the environment with stimulating, challenging activity choices to ‘facilitate children’s engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476718X11415578">Bredekamp, 1987</xref>). Thus, both parents’ and teachers’ involvement facilitates children’s learning by managing the learning environment, presenting materials, or designing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476718X11415578">Coltman et al., 2002</xref>). A match between children’s experiences in family and school settings could be beneficial for child development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1476718X11415578">
<title>The nature of scaffolding</title>
<p>The metaphor of scaffolding denotes the form of support that an adult provides a child learning how to perform a task beyond his or her current ability to ensure that the child not only succeeds at the task but gradually acquires the skills to complete the task independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476718X11415578">Wood and Wood, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476718X11415578">Wood et al., 1976</xref>). It provides a framework for understanding adult–child interaction in a learning context.</p>
<p>Three aspects of scaffolding support, that is, cognitive, emotional, and autonomous, have been identified. These three dimensions have been integrated into a hierarchical model to represent the quality of scaffolding and are all predictive of children’s academic self-regulatory competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476718X11415578">Stright and Neitzel, 2003</xref>). The extent to which adults provide cognitive support that promotes children’s active cognitive involvement is correlated with children’s mastery of problem solving skills in both current and future school tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476718X11415578">Stright et al., 2001</xref>). Effective scaffolding includes appropriate feedback implemented in warm and mutually responsive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476718X11415578">Mulvaney et al., 2006</xref>). Further, transferring the responsibility to the child gradually as his or her competence develops is beneficial for children’s independent problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1476718X11415578">
<title>Partner influences</title>
<p>The partners’ relationship to the child affects the quality of scaffolding. The literature suggests that mothers provide more direct forms of assistance than do teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X11415578">Hess et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476718X11415578">Wertsch et al., 1984</xref>) and they spend a considerable amount of time managing goals and defining problems while teachers exert effort in helping children elaborate and make sense of problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X11415578">Hess et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476718X11415578">Lehrer and Shumow, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Mothers with higher education levels are found to provide more collaborative support for children than mothers with lower education levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476718X11415578">Harris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476718X11415578">Nilholm and Saljo, 1996</xref>). More educated mothers have been shown to use more verbal praise but fewer corrections, modeling, and demonstration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476718X11415578">Moreno, 1996</xref>) than those with less formal education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476718X11415578">Donovan et al. (2007)</xref> showed that mothers’ reduced sensitivity is associated with low knowledge of child development, which might be correlated with their limited educational levels. It has been postulated that mothers’ scaffolding at home could be a mechanism that contributes to the association between maternal education, socioeconomic background, and children’s academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11415578">Davis-Kean, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1476718X11415578">
<title>Task influences</title>
<p>Parents tend to assume more responsibility and provide more commands and non-verbal physical strategies as the structure and complexity of tasks increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476718X11415578">Freund, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X11415578">Gonzalez, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476718X11415578">McNaughton and Leyland, 1990</xref>). For example, mothers showed little contingent scaffolding in pretend play and story-telling, but more in puzzle games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476718X11415578">Kim, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476718X11415578">Kermani and Brenner (2000)</xref> further found that Iranian immigrant mothers used more directive teaching strategies than Anglo-American mothers in goal-oriented activities, but not in free play. They assumed that this was because there was no cultural relevant teaching information in the free play. The extent to which a task contains explicit school learning information has also been found to influence adults’ scaffolding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476718X11415578">Kermani and Janes (1999)</xref> found that mothers promoted more independence and were more tuned to children’s interest in home-like than in school-like tasks.</p>
<p>Adults’ adjustment of scaffolding in various tasks might reflect differences in parents’ interpretation of the tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476718X11415578">Rogoff, 1990</xref>). More elaborate and facilitating strategies occurred in the activities that they perceived as learning opportunities for children and where adults’ support was thought to be necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476718X11415578">Gonzalez, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright, 2004</xref>). Variations of adults’ behaviors in different tasks may also be affected by their familiarity with the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476718X11415578">Goodsitt et al., 1988</xref>). More directive guidance seems to occur in a novel task than in a familiar task and participation in culturally familiar tasks in meaningful contexts elicits the most effective degree of scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476718X11415578">Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that most studies of scaffolding have been conducted in Western societies. Since parenting practices differ across cultures and socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476718X11415578">Bornstein and Bradley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476718X11415578">Harkness and Super, 2002</xref>), the variety, scope, and range of scaffolding behaviors may vary accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476718X11415578">Kermani and Janes, 1999</xref>). This study examined adults’ scaffolding behaviors in China. The Chinese social context may influence Chinese adults’ scaffolding behaviors and is therefore considered in the following section.</p>

<title>Child development in the Chinese context</title>
<sec id="section7-1476718X11415578">
<title>Traditional beliefs</title>
<p>At the core of Chinese value system are Confucianism and Taoism, which guide Chinese people’s behavior and social interaction. In general, these two doctrines oppose individuality and self-assertion but advocate a balance between natural, human, and spiritual entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476718X11415578">Munro, 1985</xref>). Taoism and Confucianism provide the philosophical basis for Chinese parenting and for early childhood education to a certain extent so that some constructs developed with Western populations are not readily generalizable to Chinese parents. For example, although Chinese parents are more authoritarian or restrictive than their American counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476718X11415578">Chiu, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476718X11415578">Lin and Fu, 1990</xref>), they have also been shown to be both authoritarian and authoritative in a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476718X11415578">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). The Chinese notion of <italic>guan</italic>, which means ‘to govern’, ‘to care for’, and ‘to love’, is considered as parents’ responsibility and can not be categorized as either authoritative or authoritarian parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476718X11415578">Chao, 1994</xref>). In addition, Chinese parents emphasize children’s school achievement more than Western parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476718X11415578">Rao et al., 2003</xref>). Chinese parents instruct in a more formal, structured, and direct way and provide more encouragement for children’s mathematics-related activities than do Euro-American parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476718X11415578">Huntsinger et al., 1997</xref>). Chinese parents also offer a more supportive family environment for children’s mathematical learning than Western parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476718X11415578">Wang, 2004</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476718X11415578">Pan et al. (2006)</xref> found that although both Chinese and American mothers adopted concept-focused and calculation-focused instructions in their interactions of mathematical related activities, Chinese mothers teach more complex calculation in daily life than American mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1476718X11415578">
<title>Parenting</title>
<p>Mainland China has undergone considerable sociocontextual changes since the 1980s and Western ideology and Chinese traditional values have been integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X11415578">Liu and Feng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476718X11415578">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Social and economic changes have not only improved standards of living but have also offered more opportunities for learning about other parts of the world and for receiving more education. Mainland Chinese parents who have an understanding of Western patterns of child-rearing are more likely to appreciate inductive reasoning, democratic forms of control, flexibility, and respect for individualization over power assertive, restrictive, and directive approaches to child-rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476718X11415578">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476718X11415578">Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1476718X11415578">
<title>Early childhood education</title>
<p>Traditional and contemporary beliefs have also contributed to early childhood education in Mainland China. But notions promoted by the kindergarten educational reform may be at odds with traditional Chinese beliefs about early education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476718X11415578">Rao and Li, 2008</xref>). Taking the example of mathematics education in preschool, traditional early mathematics education emphasized the memorizing of arithmetic facts and drill-and-practice and neglected problem solving. However, the Regulations on Kindergarten Education (on a trial basis), which is considered as a milestone in Chinese preschool and early childhood education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476718X11415578">Chan and Mellor, 2002</xref>), emphasize logical reasoning and problem solving skills. Mathematics teachers are now encouraged to teach with variation and emphasize precise and elegant mathematical language, logical reasoning and mathematical thinking. Nevertheless, traditional Chinese values are still evident in the views of experts, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476718X11415578">Lim (2007)</xref>, who recommend ‘order and serious classroom discipline’, ‘strong and coherent teacher-student rapport’, and ‘a strong collaborative culture’.</p>
<p>Taken together, the fusion of Chinese traditional values with Western educational ideas has a substantial and unique influence on both parenting and early childhood education in the Chinese context. Such influences should be evident in adults’ scaffolding behaviors in the dyadic problem solving tasks. However, there have been no studies systematically examining adults’ scaffolding behaviors in the Chinese context. The present study aims to fill this gap by comparing Chinese mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding behaviors in different problem solving tasks and has three objectives. First, it compared the amount and type of scaffolding shown by Chinese mothers and teachers in dyadic activities with preschoolers. It was hypothesized that teachers would provide more optimal scaffolding than mothers. Second, it examined how mothers’ educational levels influenced the scaffolding children received from both their mothers and teachers. Mothers with more education were expected to provide higher levels of scaffolding than those with less education. It was also expected that mothers with higher educational levels would show less optimal scaffolding than teachers, reflecting the influence of professional training. Teachers of different groups of children (high versus low maternal education) were not expected to differ in terms of the scaffolding provided, since teachers were all professionally qualified. Third, this study explored the influence of tasks’ characteristics on Chinese mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding. Explicit learning knowledge, rich contextual information, and a moderate level of complexity were expected to help Chinese adults provide more optimal scaffolding.</p>
<p>It is believed that this study contributes to the knowledge about how adults provide scaffolding for preschoolers’ problem solving in the Chinese context. In addition, this is the first systematic examination of adults’ scaffolding in different problem solving tasks in the Chinese context. It would be interesting to see how ‘scaffolding’, which is well-defined in Western societies, is implemented by adults in China, wherein distinctive beliefs and values are held. This study is also of practical significance for the promotion of both mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding skills by providing a comprehensive picture of mothers’ and teachers’ interactions with preschoolers in problem solving.</p>

<sec id="section11-1476718X11415578">
<title>Pilot study</title>
<p>We first conducted a pilot study with 10 children and their mothers and teachers to refine the tasks and develop the coding framework for analyzing dyadic problem solving interactions. The task order for mother–child and teacher–child dyads was counter-balanced by ensuring each task occurred in each position of the task sequence at least twice. No effects of task sequence on adult–child interactions were found. But the problem solving tasks and coding scheme were revised based on the results by reducing task difficulty to meet children’s Zones of Proximal Development, combining similar codes, and deleting codes which rarely appeared.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 65 K3<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476718X11415578">1</xref></sup> children (mean age: 5.4 years, range: 4.7–6.4 years), recruited from seven kindergartens in Beijing, their mothers and teachers participated in this study. The data from eight children were excluded from analyses because of their failure to complete both mother-child and teacher-child sessions. Thus the analyses focused on 57 children (including 29 girls) who solved the problems with both their mothers and teachers. Twenty-eight children (including 15 girls) were from three kindergartens catering mainly for children of migrant laborers. None of these mothers had studied beyond Grade 8. The other children (including 14 girls) were enrolled in four kindergartens affiliated with a college or the government. All of their mothers had at least two years’ education beyond high school.</p>
<p>Mean ages for mothers and teachers were 31.8 years (range = 21.0–43.0 years) and 24.7 years (range = 20.0–38.0 years), respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476718X11415578">Table 1</xref> presents demographic information about the mothers.

<title>Problem solving tasks</title>
<p>To ensure that the adult–child interactions were comprehensively assessed, a variety of tasks were used. The selection of problem solving tasks in this study was based on: a) research purposes of this study, b) tasks described in the literature, c) literature on Chinese children’s mathematical development, d) interviews with preschool teachers, and e) findings from the pilot study. It was felt necessary to focus on tasks within one domain. We selected the domain of children’s mathematics learning, given numerous studies have shown that Chinese children outperform American children in mathematical achievement right from the early years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476718X11415578">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Mothers and teachers solved four tasks with children: supermarket, jigsaw puzzle, worksheet, and map tasks. The first three tasks for mother–child and teacher–child dyads were similar in terms of the level of difficulty and content but differed in form. In the supermarket task, the dyads were given 10 Yuan (¥) (one ¥5 note, one ¥2 note, and three ¥1 notes) and were asked to use all the money to buy a combination of fruits (apples, oranges, or bananas) priced at ¥2, ¥3, or ¥4, respectively. The prices of fruit differed in mother–child and teacher–child problem solving tasks. In the next task, each adult–child dyad was asked to construct a 20-piece jigsaw puzzle together following a sample picture. The shapes and positions of pieces were exactly the same for mother–child and teacher–child dyads, but the figures on the puzzles were different. In the worksheet task, the dyads were to solve an arithmetic problem, with ‘23 – 9 = ?’ for mother–child dyads and ‘22 – 8 = ?’ for teacher–child dyads. Mother–child and teacher–child dyads worked on the same map task. They were provided with a simplified Beijing subway map, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476718X11415578">Figure 1</xref>. The distance between the two adjacent stations on the blue line was one kilometer and the fare was ¥1; the distance between the two adjacent stations on the red line was two kilometers and the fare was ¥3. The dyads were required to determine the most cost-effective routes from the two black-red points to the pink one and compare their travel distances and costs. In all tasks, paper, pencils, and beans were provided as aids to facilitate dyadic problem solving.</p>

<p>The four tasks, which integrate different characteristics hierarchically, constituted a comprehensive spectrum of frequently encountered problem solving situations for Chinese five-year-olds (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476718X11415578">Table 2</xref>). There were abstract symbols in the supermarket, worksheet, and map tasks. The worksheet task required the highest level of abstract thinking from children. The jigsaw puzzle did not emphasize children’s understanding of numbers and calculation but contained some implicit mathematical information, such as shape and space. In the three tasks containing explicit mathematic knowledge (supermarket, worksheet, map), both the supermarket and map tasks were based on children’s everyday activities and contained rich contextual information. There was no contextual information in the worksheet task. Finally, in the two tasks containing rich contextual information, the map task required more complex thinking than the supermarket task.</p>

<p>The four tasks were considered to suit the five-year-old Chinese children’s Zone of Proximal Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476718X11415578">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). First of all, the selection of the tasks was based on rigorous criteria described above and the pilot study helped determine the appropriate level of complexity. Interviews with mothers and teachers indicated that all mothers and teachers provided activities similar to the supermarket and map tasks for children either in daily life (e.g. shopping in a supermarket with the child or talking about the map issues when traveling by subway) or in the preschool (e.g. a supermarket corner in the classroom). Children were not required to add or subtract quantities more than 10 in these tasks and most Chinese children in K3 can add and subtract with quantities less than 10 without adult help. However, children had to integrate their mathematical knowledge in a real context with other problem solving skills, such as planning, comparison and decision-making, which were beyond these children’s current ability and adult help was required to solve the supermarket and map problems. But the calculation in the map task was more complex than in the supermarket. It is common for parents to involve preschoolers in worksheet exercises at home and teachers also provide formal mathematical knowledge to prepare children for the primary school. As the worksheet task was considered difficult for K3 children, beans, pencils and paper were provided as teaching aids. Jigsaw puzzles are an age appropriate toy for preschoolers and are regularly used in scaffolding studies. In the puzzle task, children could find the pieces at the corners and borders themselves; adult help was needed for other positions.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Adult–child dyads completed the tasks in a quiet classroom in the child’s kindergarten. The rooms were equipped with a desk, two chairs, materials for cooperative tasks, and a video camera. Twenty-eight randomly selected children (12 of mothers with high educational levels) worked with their mothers first and the other children (17 of mothers with low educational levels) worked with their teachers first. There was an interval of at least three days between the mother–child and teacher–child sessions. Because no task sequence effects were detected in the pilot study, the task sequence was the same for all adult–child dyads. Children were given some time to get familiar with the environment and the video camera before the tasks were presented.</p>
<p>The adults were asked to help children, to the extent they thought appropriate, to solve the problems. The order of task presentation was supermarket, puzzle, worksheet, and map, respectively. Before each problem solving task, the adult was informed of the criteria for successful completion and adults were invited to pose questions for further clarification. The dyads could opt for a two-minute break between tasks if they desired. Each dyad was allowed a maximum of 20 minutes for each task. If the problem was not solved within that time, the next one would be presented. All dyads completed each task within 20 minutes except for one dyad who had not completed the puzzle task with the allocated time. All problem solving episodes were videotaped.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1476718X11415578">
<title>Coding of problem solving episodes</title>
<p>All problem solving episodes were transcribed. However, only the first five minutes of interactions in the puzzle task were transcribed because some dyads spent a really long time completing this task and the average duration taken was five minutes. Both verbal and nonverbal behaviors were noted.</p>
<p>Interactions in the problem solving tasks were analyzed in terms of interaction turns, which are defined based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X11415578">Chin (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476718X11415578">Heckhausen (1987)</xref>. As long as the participant continued his or her speech or actions without a pause longer than two seconds, the sequential actions or utterances were treated as one turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476718X11415578">Chin, 1995</xref>). The duration of problem solving was first noted; then, adults’ scaffolding behaviors in each turn were coded in terms of three dimensions (cognitive assistance, emotional feedback, and transfer of responsibility) based on the definitions of scaffolding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476718X11415578">Wood et al. (1976)</xref> and its measurement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright (2003)</xref>. Adults’ cognitive assistance was coded from scaffolding contents (the information delivered in scaffolding) and manners of scaffolding (how the adult delivered supportive information to the child). Both of these were coded as being collaborative, directive, or unidentified. Adults’ emotional feedback was assessed in terms of whether the adult provided encouragement, rejected the child’s efforts, or gave no feedback. Transfer of responsibility was coded to indicate adult responsibility, child responsibility, or unidentified responsibility distribution. Analyses were focused on the identified cognitive assistance (collaborative or directive), emotional feedback (positive or negative), and transfer of responsibility (adult’s or child’s responsibility). Optimal scaffolding should involve children’s active thinking in problem solving with collaborative cognitive assistance, positive emotional feedback, and adults’ withdrawal of responsibility. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476718X11415578">Table 3</xref> provides information about the coding scheme.</p>

<p>Due to the moderate correlations (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .60) between the codes of collaborative and directive scaffolding contents, collaborative and directive manners, and adult and child responsibility in mother–child and teacher–child interactions, overall scores for these indicators were calculated by reverse coding and averaging the two scores, respectively. This method has been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright (2003)</xref>. Adults with high scores in each code showed more collaborative scaffolding contents, more collaborative scaffolding manners, and transferred more responsibility to the child than those with lower scores.</p>
<p>Each interaction turn was coded with ‘1’ representing the occurrence and ‘0’ representing non-occurrence of a specific code. An example of the coding for an instruction from a mother in the puzzle task is shown below:<disp-quote>
<p>Mother: ‘You find the position for this piece first.’ [Cognitive content: directive; Cognitive manner: directive; Emotional feedback: no; Transfer of responsibility: child’s responsibility.]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After each turn had been coded, the proportions of adults’ scaffolding were computed as a function of the total number of turns to represent the scores for each interaction episode.</p>
<p>The first author coded all the interactions. A postgraduate student in early childhood education independently coded six children’s interactions with their mothers and teachers (48 episodes). The percentages of agreement in scaffolding indicators for each turn between the raters ranged from 94 percent to 100 percent and the Cohen’s kappa ranged from .85 to .99.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section25-1476718X11415578">
<title>Influences of professional training on scaffolding</title>
<p>The first objective of this study was to compare mothers’ and teachers’ scaffolding. Results of this study are consistent with early studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476718X11415578">Hess et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476718X11415578">Lehrer and Shumow, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476718X11415578">Wertsch et al., 1984</xref>) which have shown that professional training in early childhood education is important for equipping adults with effective scaffolding skills. Specifically, teachers showed a higher level of scaffolding manners, less negative feedback, and transferred more responsibility to children than mothers.</p>
<p>Differences between teachers’ and mothers’ scaffolding may be due to their different expectations and understanding of early childhood development. With increased pre- and in-service training, Chinese kindergarten teachers recognize the value of promoting children’s interest in learning and are cognizant of children’s ability to learn during the early years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476718X11415578">Liu and Feng, 2005</xref>). Teachers are trained to provide appropriate scaffolding to meet children’s specific needs. However, this is not the case for Chinese parents. Chinese parents place high expectations on their children’s academic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476718X11415578">Rao et al., 2003</xref>): mothers with high educational levels hope that excellent school achievement will help their single child succeed in the very competitive society and mothers with lower educational levels may hold a stronger expectation for children’s academic achievement since they see education as a means for upward social mobility. However, parents’ knowledge of how to facilitate children’s development is still limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476718X11415578">Tews and Merali, 2008</xref>). They may accord more attention to the efficacy and accuracy of problem solving, rather than to the learning process.</p>
<p>Discrepant scaffolding patterns shown by mothers and teachers may have adverse influences on children’s development in the long run as children’s development is largely a function of the balance between their experiences in the kindergarten and home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476718X11415578">Alnert and Lamb, 2003</xref>). Such a balance could be broken easily because of children’s asymmetrical experiences with their mothers and teachers. Teachers’ scaffolding had a higher collaborative level and contained little negative feedback; they also transferred more responsibility to the children. In contrast, mothers’ more directive scaffolding manners and less frequent transfer of responsibility to the children reduced opportunities for children’s exploration and active involvement. Although children attend kindergarten, the home is a very important context for early development and learning. Inappropriate maternal scaffolding might not only mitigate teachers’ efforts of fostering children’s autonomy but hinder teachers’ further work if children obtain the habit of dependence and unwillingness to make explorations from their home experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1476718X11415578">
<title>Influences of mothers’ educational level</title>
<p>This study also examined the influences of mothers’ educational levels on the scaffolding children received. The results are consistent with those from previous studies which indicate that maternal education is positively related to adults’ scaffolding skills (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476718X11415578">Neitzel and Stright, 2004</xref>). Mothers with higher education levels usually have more exposure to the Western child-rearing approaches than those with lower levels of education. This may be associated with more collaboration, democratic forms of control, and respect for individualization rather than power assertive, restrictive and directive approaches in dyadic problem solving. As suggested in theories of academic socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476718X11415578">Taylor and Clayton, 2004</xref>), the findings may provide evidence for the relationship between improvements in maternal education and changes in children’s home learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476718X11415578">Votruba-Drzal, 2003</xref>), which may explain the different outcomes of children of mothers with different levels of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476718X11415578">Davis-Kean, 2005</xref>). Although general school education is helpful for equipping mothers with more appropriate scaffolding skills, the mothers with high education did not attain the same level of appropriate skills as teachers did on most of the indicators. Therefore, professional training in early childhood education has an important role in facilitating children’s problem solving.</p>
<p>Maternal education was found to have independent and unique influences on adults’ emotional feedback: children in the high ME group received more positive feedback from their interactions with adults than other children. This suggests that maternal education influences both mothers’ and teachers’ behaviors. It is speculated that the higher expectation of parents in the low ME group for their children to achieve academic outcomes influenced the teachers to establish higher standards for these children and therefore less positive feedback was provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1476718X11415578">
<title>Task characteristics and adults’ scaffolding</title>
<p>In this study, four types of task characteristics were examined: a) whether verbal (supermarket, worksheet, and map) or physical prompts (puzzle) facilitated problem solving, b) level of explicit learning knowledge, c) contextual information, and d) task complexity. Results indicated adults’ adjustment of scaffolding in different tasks and reflected the context-bound nature of scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476718X11415578">Newman et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section28-1476718X11415578">
<title>Operational play-like task versus communicative school-learning tasks</title>
<p>The puzzle task was regarded more as a play-like activity and the other three tasks contained explicit learning content to differing extents in this study. All dyads took the longest to solve the puzzle task compared to the other tasks. The scaffolding manner was rated the lowest in the puzzle task and the scaffolding content was rated lower in the puzzle than in the map and worksheet tasks. The most positive and negative emotional feedback was also found in the puzzle task.</p>
<p>These results indicate that adults encouraged children’s experimentation in the task which required manual manipulation. Furthermore, since the puzzle task contained the least obvious mathematical knowledge and was considered as a playful activity by most adults, solving puzzles may be considered less important than exposing children to tasks with opportunities to gain explicit mathematical knowledge. As a result, most of the scaffolding found in the puzzle task was directive and more emotional feedback (either positive or negative) was found in the puzzle task than in other tasks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1476718X11415578">
<title>Informal mathematical activities versus formal mathematical learning activity</title>
<p>In the three tasks with explicit learning knowledge, both the supermarket and map tasks were based on children’s familiar experience and contained vivid contextual information; but the worksheet task was a typical school mathematical exercise without contextual support. Results confirmed the hypothesis that the contextual information in problem solving tasks was helpful for the adults’ scaffolding. There was a higher level of scaffolding manner in the map and supermarket tasks than in other tasks. In the tasks with familiar contextual information, adults may feel more comfortable working with the child, finding it easier to detect the children’s understanding of the problem, and may scaffold the child’s learning in a more collaborative manner. Without the help of contextual information, it was more difficult for adults to provide appropriate scaffolding in the worksheet task and the scaffolding manner and content were both not optimal. However, adults transferred the most responsibility to the child in the worksheet task. This indicates again shows Chinese adults’ recognition of the developmental value of the worksheet task and their emphasis on school achievement.</p>
<p>However, parents’ and teachers’ strong emphasis on children’s academic achievement may have side effects on child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476718X11415578">Woo et al., 2005</xref>). For example, many children in China and other Asian countries have too much homework and not enough time to play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X11415578">Liu, 2004</xref>) and it is common for parents of children who attend kindergartens to provide extra homework for their children and to arrange for them to attend multiple extra-curricular lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476718X11415578">Xie, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1476718X11415578">
<title>Moderately complex versus highly complex tasks</title>
<p>The complexity of problem solving tasks was also considered in this study. The supermarket and map tasks were considered to have similar problem structure but the supermarket task had a moderate level of complexity and the map task had a high level of complexity. Results showed that the supermarket task took less time and solicited higher levels of scaffolding content than the map task. Adults’ adjustment of their scaffolding in terms of the task complexity reflects consistency between mothers’ and teachers’ understanding of appropriate help in a complex problem solving task. On the one hand, adults acknowledged the importance of providing collaborative scaffolding in the dyadic activity and adopted scaffolding manners with highly collaborative levels in both the supermarket and map tasks. On the other hand, the directive scaffolding content may be regarded as more effective to help the child in the complex problem solving task. These suggest that contextual information was insufficient for adults to provide higher quality scaffolding in a complex task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1476718X11415578">
<title>Combined influences of task and individual characteristics</title>
<p>This study also found that mothers and teachers varied their scaffolding across four tasks. Both mothers and teachers spent longer time in the map task than in the supermarket and worksheet tasks. But the duration of teacher–child interactions in the map task was longer than mother–child interactions. This suggests that teachers are more likely to adjust their scaffolding by dividing the task into specific steps and give specific instructions than mothers. Results also showed that teachers’ scaffolding manners were rated higher than that of mothers only in the puzzle task. Since the puzzle task is not highly complex for preschoolers, mothers’ less skilled scaffolding in the puzzle task could be related to their unfamiliarity with the task and lack of sensitivity and professional knowledge for scaffolding in play-like activities.</p>
<p>Children in the low ME group were found to receive less optimal scaffolding in the puzzle task than in other tasks than those in the high ME group. Mothers with higher education and teachers have more contact and familiarity with the contemporary educational ideas, such as the importance of children’s active exploration and autonomy in learning. But the counterparts in the low ME group may have few contacts with these new ideas and the dichotomy between ‘play’ and ‘learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476718X11415578">Liu, 2004</xref>) may be more obvious in these mothers with lower education and these may influence the teachers’ behavior styles with children.</p>
<p>The relatively few differences of adults’ scaffolding for children in high and low ME group in the worksheet task is consistent with findings that Chinese parents give much importance to school learning and it further suggested that such an emphasis did not vary due to adults’ level of professional training in education or general school education.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1476718X11415578">
<title>Limitations and implications</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, the sample was drawn from urban China and was relatively small. Caution should be exercised in generalizing the results to other regions, particularly rural areas, given the vast urban–rural gaps in income and living standards and variations across regions in children’s early educational experiences in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476718X11415578">Corter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476718X11415578">Khan and Riskin, 1998</xref>). Second, although the dyadic behaviors were observed in situations designed to induce adults’ and children’s typical behaviors in daily experiences, it is impossible to deduce the extent to which the behaviors observed reflect the behaviors in authentic situations. Third, no information of dyads’ different prior experiences in related task contexts was collected in this study, but such experiences may influence the adult–child interactions in problem solving.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current findings have implications for both educators and parents. Mothers and teachers were found to adopt a high proportion of directive scaffolding, especially in the play-like and complex tasks. Although the adoption of directive assistance is related to traditional Chinese values which emphasize adults’ authority and children’s obedience and is necessary in adult–child collaborative work, more collaborative assistance should be provided to encourage children’s autonomy. Further, teachers should be aware of the values of different types of problem solving tasks for child development and provide appropriate cognitive, emotional, and autonomous scaffolding in these tasks, particularly in tasks without explicit learning information and with high complexity.</p>
<p>Results indicated that teachers scaffolded children whose mothers had varying levels of education in a similar manner. However, children in the low ME group were always enrolled in kindergartens which charged lower fees. These kindergartens had larger group sizes and fewer resources than the kindergartens with higher fees. Therefore, it is common for teachers in the kindergartens for children from the low ME families to face a large number of children in classes and have few teaching materials and little assistance; they have considerable difficulty providing individualized help to each child as behaving in this study. As a result, these children are less likely to obtain enough attention and individualized instruction in kindergarten and may be disadvantaged compared to children in the high ME group. In response to this problem, policy-makers and communities should provide necessary support for these kindergartens to ensure those teachers can provide appropriate and sufficient guidance to each child.</p>
<p>These findings also have implications on the design of parent education programs. Mothers’ scaffolding skills could be improved by helping them provide optimal cognitive and emotional support and transfer more responsibility to the child in the dyadic work. The implementation and popularization of parent education programs may improve parents’ scaffolding skills and thereby facilitate the development children, particularly those of mothers who have relatively lower levels of education.</p>
