<abstract>
<p>Most studies related to addressing weight management of obese children have focused on understanding the perceptions of parents and health professionals. This study identifies the factors that obese children who have tried to lose weight perceive as affecting their efforts. This descriptive qualitative study has sought to identify factors affecting obese children’s weight-loss decision making and process and to explore the development of an effective weight-loss program. This study screened 603 primary school children equivalent to U.S. Grades 5 and 6 of age 10–12. Seventy-nine out of 93 obese children who had been trying on their own to lose weight for at least 1 month formed 6 focus groups. Four themes were identified: Making the decision, self-efficacy, social influences, and environmental constraints. The results suggest that the design of a weight-loss program for obese children should include the contribution of family members, school, and health professionals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood obesity is a growing global health concern. The prevalence of childhood obesity has shown marked acceleration since the 1970s in many advanced countries (World Health Organization [WHO], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512440176">2010</xref>). The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents aged 2–19 was 16.9% in the United States, in 2007–2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512440176">Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>). One in three Grade 6 children was overweight in England, in 2010–2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512440176">NHS The Information Centre for Health and Social Care, 2011</xref>). This situation is, however, not confined to western countries. The obesity epidemic in most Asian countries is also showing an increasing trend (WHO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512440176">2011</xref>). The prevalence of obesity of primary school students in Hong Kong increased from 16.4% in 1997–1998 to 22% in 2009–2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512440176">Department of Health, 2010</xref>). The WHO has estimated that worldwide 43 million children under 5 years of age will be overweight, by the end of 2010 (, 2010). This trend reflects a serious threat in adult life since studies have indicated that obese children have up to an 80% chance of becoming obese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512440176">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). The consequences of childhood obesity include physical and psychosocial problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512440176">Renehan, Tyson, Egger, Heller, &amp; Zwahlen, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, obesity burdens society with the costly treatments of obesity-related chronic diseases and disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512440176">Wang &amp; Dietz, 2002</xref>). Children are considered as one of the vulnerable groups as they encounter different barriers affecting their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512440176">de Garbino, 2004</xref>). The importance of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight for height must be stressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840512440176">
<title>Contributing Factors Leading to Childhood Obesity</title>
<p>Obesity is primarily related to genetic, behavioral, psychosocial, obesogenic environmental factors, and the interactions among these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512440176">Kimm et al., 2002</xref>). The obesogenic environment refers to the possible influencing factors in an environment that support being obese in individuals and populations (Swinburn, Eggar &amp; Raza, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512440176">1999</xref>). In addition, certain genetic characteristics are associated with increase in body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512440176">Farooqi, 2006</xref>). It is estimated that 30–70% of the variance in body mass index (BMI) can be explained by genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512440176">Loos &amp; Bouchard, 2003</xref>). Genetics are a nonmodifiable risk factor of obesity. However, the rapid rise in the obesity rate cannot be attributed solely to genetic factors.</p>
<p>Behavioral and psychosocial factors are related to the unhealthy lifestyle of obese children. Poor dietary habits, including high consumption of sugar-sweetened food and a low intake of vegetables and fruit, lead to an increase in adiposity in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512440176">Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are known to predispose children to being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512440176">Jimenez-Pavon, Kelly, Reilly, &amp; Jaafar, 2010</xref>), while self-efficacy beliefs are positively associated with weight-loss behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512440176">Linde, Rothman, Baldwin, &amp; Jeffery, 2006</xref>). An obesogenic environment includes schools, homes, and neighborhoods affecting childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512440176">Kirk, Penney, &amp; McHugh, 2010</xref>). Low socioeconomic status is also a considerable risk factor for being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512440176">Tamayo, Christian, &amp; Rathmann, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840512440176">
<title>Treatment Programs for Obese Children</title>
<p>Effective weight-loss programs to prevent and treat childhood obesity are viewed as an important approach to preventing unhealthy weight gain and helping with weight loss. Reviews of the components for nonpharmacological or nonsurgical treatment programs focus on dietary intervention, physical activity, and behavioral components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512440176">Oude Luttikhuis et al., 2009</xref>). These programs can be categorized into individual and family levels, while preventive and promotion activities are at the school and community levels.</p>
<p>Obese children are usually referred by medical practitioners to receive assessment and counseling services in a clinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512440176">Oude Luttikhuis et al., 2009</xref>). Family-based intervention focuses on the encouragement of parents to offer appropriate food portions, foster physical activity, increase daily living activities, and keep sedentary behaviors to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512440176">Hawkins, Cole, &amp; Law, 2009</xref>). School settings have not been regarded as sites for treatment but for the prevention of childhood obesity. Programs include a combination of nutrition education, physical education, school meal modifications, and instruction on behavior modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512440176">Gonzalez-Suarez, Worley, Grimmer-Somers, &amp; Dones, 2009</xref>). In the community, most government guidelines have traditionally focused on the adequacy of nutritional intake and physical activity (WHO, 2010). Parents and health professionals are considered as the most influential people for reducing the risk of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512440176">Barlow, Trowbridge, Klish, &amp; Dietz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to the design of current weight-loss programs for obese children, existing knowledge is founded on the parents’ perceptions of their children’s needs or on health professionals’ perceptions of the children’s overweight status rather than on the needs of obese children who have attempted to lose weight as they perceive themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512440176">Stewart, Chapple, Hughes, Poustie, &amp; Reilly, 2008</xref>). The coverage of services in the current pediatric weight clinics is open to obese children with a pediatrician or family doctor’s referral. These programs do not benefit obese children without immediate medical problems but who have a high chance of developing adulthood obesity. In order to understand the complexities of weight-loss experience from a population of obese children, direct inquiry of obese children’s perspectives is fundamental to recognizing their needs. The purposes of this study were therefore to (1) identify factors affecting obese children’s weight-loss decisions; (2) determine social–environmental factors affecting their weight-loss process; and (3) based on the findings of (1) and (2), to make recommendations for developing an effective weight-loss program for obese children in the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840512440176" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study employed an exploratory qualitative design using semistructured focus-group interviews to elicit the views from children who were obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512440176">Heary &amp; Hennessy, 2002</xref>). The interviews were carried out in the conference room of three subsidized primary schools in Hong Kong from where the obese children were recruited. Subsidized schools are run by various nongovernmental organizations with government funding and represent 83% of all local primary schools. The three subsidized primary schools were selected by convenience sampling based on the rank of the school’s current academic performance. Band 1 schools have the highest academic performance ranking, while Band 3 schools have the lowest. We selected one school from each band. Unfortunately, none of these three schools had a school nurse. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of a publicly funded territory institute.</p>
<sec id="section5-1059840512440176">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We screened 603 primary school children in the fifth and sixth grades for obesity. All the fifth and sixth grade students from the three participating schools received a weight management talk provided by the principal investigator during the school assembly. This age group of children was selected as they are more independent and have more control than younger children over their choice of food items for their meals and snacks. The eligibility criteria for this study included (1) currently obese, which was defined as a body weight of more than 120% of the median weight for height. This definition is from a local reference used to define obesity in Hong Kong children based on a territory-wide growth survey with sex-specific reference charts of weight-for-height to understand children’s growth on a steady percentile line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512440176">Leung, Lau, Tse, &amp; Oppenheimer, 1996</xref>); (2) absence of severe food allergies or chronic medical problems affecting food intake; (3) absence of dietary restrictions; (4) having tried on their own to lose weight for at least 1 month, and (5) child assent and parental permission. Those with chronic illnesses or those who were taking regular medication were excluded to avoid any bias these illnesses could have on growth parameters and physical activity capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840512440176">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Anthropometric measurements for the children were arranged during class time in their own school halls or activity rooms during the same week. After screening, eligible children were invited to join the focus-group interviews. A basic demographic data collection form was completed by the children. All interviews were conducted by an experienced female pediatric research nurse who was not known to the children and were audio taped using a digital voice recorder. The interviews lasted from 30 to 45 min and were drawn to a close when the children offered no new information. Totally, 132 children who were obese were screened, 93 met the study selection criteria and 79 agreed to take part in the study. A total of six focus-group interviews were conducted and each included between 9 and 18 children who were grouped based on their grade level within the same school. Two groups had more than 12 students. The large interview group size was uncontrollable in this study due to a packed teaching schedule and rigid time-tabling. The three schools in this study offer half-day schooling that makes the timetabling even more rigid.</p>
<p>It is suggested that additional activities not be implemented in the revision and examination period in a 4-month semester that they may affect the normal teaching schedule. A larger group size is acceptable considering the fact that the students within the same group had similar sociodemographic situations and education backgrounds. This arrangement, although undesirable, was unavoidable in this study due to the need to minimize the influence on the teaching schedules and the impact on the students’ learning time.</p>
<p>A semistructured interview guide was developed by the research team (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512440176">Table 1</xref> for the interview guide) and was pilot tested on 7 children who were obese prior to the first focus group. The pilot testing group did not participate in the main study. Probing questions were added to encourage discussion and to ensure that more in-depth information was provided.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data analysis procedures began with the verbatim transcription of the interviews. The recordings were transcribed and then translated from Cantonese to English by a qualified bilingual translator. The translation of each interview was then validated by another bilingual research assistant who reviewed the taped interviews to ensure the translation was accurate and that there was no loss of information. After the transcription, content analysis with an inductive approach was adopted so as to condense the large amount of raw data into a meaningful format and to establish the relationship between the research objectives and findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512440176">Elo &amp; Kyngas, 2007</xref>). All text-based transcribed data were read thoughtfully and were reviewed repeatedly and independently by two investigators. In order to extract the significant statements or phrases related to the main categories scheme, related concepts were coded into emergent themes or patterns across each statement or phrase based on the interview guide. Constant comparisons were made. The ideas were then analyzed and clustered into themes. After independent coding, the investigators compared categories and themes and reviewed the data until a consensus was reached concerning the meaning and the most appropriate codes. Once the themes were identified, the transcripts were reviewed again to validate the thematic analysis and to ensure that all meaningful interview data had been analyzed. All investigators examined the final analysis for consistency and valid interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512440176">Tong, Sainsbury, &amp; Craig, 2007</xref>). The data were organized and managed by the QSR NVivo 8.0 software program.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 79 children included 54 males and 25 females between 10 and 13 years of age. Seven children had a weight greater than 150% of the recommended weight-for-height percentage, 38 were between 131% and 150%, and 34 were between 121% and 130% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840512440176">Figure 1</xref>). Most of the children relied on the school-based physical education sessions to improve and maintain their physical fitness. On average in Hong Kong primary schools, there is only one physical education session per week, lasting for 50 min. Only 17 children had engaged in extracurricular exercise for more than 3 hr in the week before the study. No difference was detected for their reasons for wanting to lose weight among the different ranks of schools.</p>

<title>Making the Decision for Weight Loss</title>
<p>The issues reported regarding making a weight-loss decision are related to good physical health, poor fitness, and body shape. All of the children consistently identified that keeping good physical health was the main reason for them to want to lose weight. They also realized that weight loss could improve their health status and lessen the incidence of obesity-related diseases. The children had learned the information about obesity-induced health problems from school.<disp-quote>
<p>Teachers teach us that obesity introduces diabetic mellitus, hypertension, and cardiac problems. I am afraid that I will have these diseases and so want to reduce my body weight. (Primary 5 student, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Five out of the six groups reflected that they felt dissatisfied with their poor fitness. Their level of physical capacity was diminished due to their excess weight. They perceived that they were not as fit as their friends when performing physical activities.<disp-quote>
<p>I am not able to run or even walk as fast as my friends. I feel exhausted easily. It seems to me that my physical activity performance is worse than that of others who are not obese. (Primary 5 student, Band 1 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Most of the children were very conscious about their body shape and size. They struggled with the amount of food intake and their body shape dissatisfaction. They combined their natural desire for social acceptance with trying to build up their own self-esteem to enhance their weight-loss motivation.<disp-quote>
<p>I love eating but I am afraid of being fat. My friends are all slim and can wear beautiful dresses. I want to have a beautiful figure like them so that I can be more attractive. (Primary 6 student, Band 3 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840512440176">
<title>Social–Environmental Factors Affecting Their Weight-Loss Practices</title>
<p>The children described three levels of factors including individual, social influences, and environmental constraints affecting their weight-loss process. Individual self-efficacy was affected by lack of weight-loss skills, social persuasion, and a feeling of failure due to their low weight-loss rate. The people affecting their practices were their parents, caregivers, health professionals, and peers. The environmental constraints included accessibility of snacks and academic stress.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy during the weight-loss process was an underlying theme affecting the children’s weight-loss actions. They were unaware of how to use self-regulation skills or weight-loss plans to help them achieve their weight-loss goals. Their weight-loss strategies mainly included simply trying to prevent themselves from eating. In turn, they became discouraged in their inability to consistently lose weight.<disp-quote>
<p>I intend to lose weight but don’t know how to work on it. At the beginning, I starved myself but that cannot last for long. I don’t know how to decrease my weight …. There is no program designed for children. They are only for adults. (Primary 5 student, Band 1 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Two thirds of the children indicated that social support was a key element in promoting their psychological well-being and enabling them to lose weight. They had a high sense of self-efficacy if they received positive feedback and encouragement from others.<disp-quote>
<p>My mum says that I am looking slimmer now. I am happy that I have made good progress and will keep this up. (Primary 5 student, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One half of the obese children had a feeling of failure due to their low weight-loss rate. They felt frustrated over the steady but not very obvious weight-loss rate such that it diminished their motivation for continued weight-loss effort.<disp-quote>
<p>In the first three weeks, I lost 1 kg but now there is no change in my body weight. I’m a bit disappointed by this result. I can’t understand why my weight loss has slowed down although I have eaten less and have done more exercise. It is difficult. I think I cannot succeed. (Primary 6 student, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One of the prominent influences on the children’s weight-loss practice was their parents’ attitude. If it was either neutral or negative, the children found it difficult to sustain their attempts. They also received mixed messages from their parents about the importance of losing weight.<disp-quote>
<p>My father supports me to continue losing weight. He said that I am too fat. He told me not to eat too much and do more exercise. However, he gives me some chocolate or potato chips and says that it is only once. This happens about four times every week …. (Primary 5 student, Band 1 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Parental use of food as a reward for good conduct or academic achievement or to comfort their children was common. This often satisfied the children’s emotional needs but diminished their motivation to continue their weight-loss efforts.<disp-quote>
<p>If I work well on my homework, he (my father) gives me a piece of chocolate. A piece of chocolate is not a big problem. I can eat less tomorrow. (Primary 6 student, Band 2 school)</p>

<p>All families with working parents had a habit of eating out on weekends or holidays. The children also viewed eating out as a family activity that they enjoyed. Parents were also not too restrictive on the types and portions of food their children could consume when eating out.<disp-quote>
<p>We usually eat out during weekends and holidays …. It is good for mum, dad, and me to take a break after a whole week’s work and there is no restriction on the food I can eat. (Primary 6 student, Band 1 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some of the children discussed how their parents’ power was regularly challenged by their grandparents. Grandparents often encouraged the children to eat more, and the wishes of grandparents were respected by the parents in order to maintain family harmony and minimize family conflict.<disp-quote>
<p>I understand my mum wants me to eat less but she doesn’t want to have direct confrontation with my grandmother …. She does not give comments on my eating in the presence of my grandmother but asks me to control my eating by myself. (Primary 6 student, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The children primarily identified their grandparents as their caregivers. Some of the children stated that their grandparents did not perceive they were at risk of suffering from health problems due to their obesity. Some grandparents even believed that obesity in children was a sign of health and wealth.<disp-quote>
<p>My grandmother said that I will become thinner when I grow up. Keeping a small amount of fat looks cute. (Primary 5 students, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nurses, doctors, and/or dieticians were the health professionals most commonly mentioned by the children. The children found the weight management talk provided by the principal investigator as part of this study to be helpful. They felt that health professionals could provide more accurate and reliable sources of weight-loss information and better skills training. They also suggested that health professionals should extend their services to their family members and that they could provide tailor-made individual programs.<disp-quote>
<p>I like the activities provided by the nurse. Her weight management advice and the body composition analysis were more reliable. The tools she used were advanced. The problems she stated are the ones I am facing but which I don’t know how to solve. I am trying the methods she suggested … I want her to talk to my mum as well. (Primary 6 student, Band 2 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Peers were described as their friends or classmates. Three groups identified that peer interaction had a strong influence on their motivation to exercise. They had an increased sense of self-worth through peer support that resulted in an increased desire to join exercise activities.<disp-quote>
<p>When my friends call me, I will go to the playground and play football with them. Their encouragement reinforces me to play football …. Playing with them makes me happy. It is a social activity. I am accepted by my friends and have a feeling of achievement. (Primary 5 student, Band 3 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>All of the children indicated that they could easily access snacks at home or on the way home from school. They primarily got their snacks at home from their caregivers or from snack stalls. They also discussed the wide range of low-cost snacks available from the many food vendors in Hong Kong. Although they could identify many different types of healthy snacks, they did not actually eat them much.<disp-quote>
<p>There are many food stalls which sell different varieties of food from school to home. My mum gives me money for eating after school …. At home, I have instant noodles … I understand that having vegetables or fruit is a better choice but it is not a snack. (Primary 6 student, Band 1 school)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The children from band 1 schools argued that they did not have enough time to do exercise because of their heavy school workload and their participation in different after-school classes or tutorial programs. Achieving and maintaining a high level of academic performance was more important than their weight-loss goals.<disp-quote>
<p>I spend 2 to 3 hr daily doing homework. Then, I have to prepare for dictations, tests, and examinations since there are tests or quizzes every week. How can I have extra time to play? (Primary 6 student, Band 1 school)</p>

<title>Discussion and Recommendations</title>
<p>This study provides new insights into the underresearched area of perceptions, weight-loss intentions, and practices of school children who were obese. No recently published study has reported on the mixed messages from children's caregivers or the negative impacts that these mixed messages have on the children's behaviors. Although family involvement and positive support has been shown to be a viable intervention for obese children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512440176">Epstein, Paluch, Roemmich, &amp; Beecher, 2007</xref>), weight loss is viewed as their own personal responsibility by the children in this study. Existing interventions focus on discouraging overeating and encouraging physical activity among children who were obese or on how family members can help them achieve these objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512440176">Hawkins et al., 2009</xref>). This study provides further confirmation that social–environmental factors discourage obese children from persevering with their weight-loss activities. Therefore, interventions with obese children should not be confined to individual-level nutrition and physical activity–related behavioral interventions. Based on the present findings and the existing childhood obesity literature, weight-loss programs should involve families including parents and grandparents, as well as schools and health professionals, who are well positioned to foster a supportive environment and incorporate social–environmental change.</p>
<p>Consistent with Gunnarsdottir and colleagues’ investigation for the role of parental motivation in providing treatment for childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512440176">Gunnarsdottir, Njarkvik, Olafsdottir, Craighead, &amp; Bjarnason, 2011</xref>), the findings in this study suggest that family members play such an important role in developing healthy eating habits among children that parental involvement is critical to ensure the maintenance of children’s weight loss and to improve their health. It is important for weight-loss programs to begin with helping children and their families to set realistic goals that can be met within a specified time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512440176">Moens, Braet, &amp; Van Winckel, 2010</xref>). Goal setting in advance helps to review the weight-loss progress and helps to develop strategies about how to proceed in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512440176">Moens et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a consistent message regarding food choices, eating practice, and physical activity patterns should be given, and parents need to be reminded to promote positive parental practices in the home. It is highly recommended that skills such as parental modeling of appropriate eating, alternatives to food as rewards for children’s good behavior, food choices when eating out, and providing positive reinforcement to their children all be learned by parents as well as grandparents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512440176">Spear et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another key finding is the support, or lack thereof, from the children’s grandparents. This finding is consistent with previously conducted studies in the United Kingdom which also found that children taken care of by grandparents had a higher risk of becoming obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512440176">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>). While an obese body is considered unhealthy nowadays, the findings of this study reflected that being chubbier for children is equated with health and wealth in Chinese culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512440176">Wu, 2006</xref>). Evidence-based medical and health information should also be provided to the grandparents to improve their health literacy. While filial piety (respect for parents and grandparents to ensure a close intergenerational relations) is a unique Asian value, working with the grandparents specifically to address long-standing cultural beliefs can help to improve the health of children in their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512440176">Styles, Meier, Sutherland, &amp; Campbell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The children showed a clear knowledge gap in relation to healthy eating and physical activity. Similar to the findings from a Hong Kong population-based survey, students’ and parents’ awareness and knowledge of healthy eating was not consistent with their actual practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512440176">Department of Health, 2009</xref>). This discrepancy may be related to the children’s limited weight-loss skills and their inability to access age-appropriate weight-loss services. Research indicates that counseling services focused on increasing obese children's self-efficacy can be an effective strategy to support their weight-loss activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512440176">Oude Luttikhuis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The children reported that they experienced difficulty in resisting the temptation of snacks, which has been previously documented as a common environmental constraint to weight loss in overweight children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512440176">Campbell &amp; Crawford, 2001</xref>). To address this problem, parent–teacher associations can help to foster a more supportive environment for children in the school setting.</p>
<p>In this study, the children reported that they became alarmed when informed of the medical consequences of obesity. The development of health activities in schools should not only focus on improving knowledge but also on improving attitudes and changing behaviors in order to empower students with the ability to manage their own personal health. Schools should also consider applying the health promoting schools (HPS) framework to engage teachers, students, parents, health professionals and community leaders in making the school a healthier place (Lee, St. Leger, &amp; Cheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512440176">2007</xref>). The HPS framework is a whole-school approach that includes three interconnected components of planned teaching and learning, school environment, and partnerships formed between the school and community links. These components of the framework can help to plan and implement different school activities, programs, and policies (WHO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512440176">1998</xref>). Findings suggested the importance of social–environmental factors affecting children weight-loss practice. Children who were obese reflected that family support, peer interaction, and involvement of health professionals had strong influences on their motivation to lose weight. Compiling the collaborative groups HPS framework may enable the school, family, community, and health sectors to be more effective in school-based initiatives for weight management. Health talks, parent–child activities, peer support groups and health ambassador training can be organized to empower parents, students, and teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to select and prepare healthy food for the children and family.</p>

<title>Implications for School Nursing Practice</title>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that solutions to the childhood obesity crisis require concerted action that involves the strategic, synergistic efforts of individuals, families, schools, and health care professionals. Multidisciplinary and multimethod approaches are required to effectively treat childhood obesity. School nurses are well positioned to assume a leadership role in weight management for obese children. In direct care, they can implement individually tailored interventions aimed at behavior change, including identification of barriers to change, education about behavior change skills, and weight control counseling to build up children’s self-confidence and strengthen their self-efficacy. Nurses are also in an excellent position to develop family-based weight-loss programs, parent training on modeling healthy eating and activities for obese children, and teacher training on health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512440176">Murphy &amp; Polivka, 2007</xref>). Schools are an important venue for planning and coordinating programs and strategies to address the childhood obesity epidemic. Furthermore, nurses can collaborate with schools and community leaders to advocate making healthy lifestyle promotion a part of the school culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512440176">Wong, Cheng, &amp; Lo, 2010</xref>). Advocacy for policy change has the potential to affect an even larger number of people in the community. Unfortunately, community leaders often do not have the requisite knowledge and expertise in this area. Thus, nurses can assume a leadership role in weight management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512440176">Ryan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-1059840512440176">
<title>Limitations and Further Study</title>
<p>This study explored the weight-loss experiences of 79 upper primary school children who were obese in three primary schools in Hong Kong. Although the overall results of this study provide useful information for the design of child-specific weight-loss programs, further research is required to examine the association between the factors identified in this study and the risk of obesity in children, including an examination of potential mediators and moderators of these associations.</p>
<p>Although the interview groups were relatively homogeneous in their socioeconomic characteristics and education background, and the experienced researcher was able to elicit the perceptions, the large focus-group size may have inhibited interaction and expression of the children’s perceptions and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512440176">Heary &amp; Hennessy, 2002</xref>). In addition to screening the children to take part in the focus-group interviews, either splitting the large interview group into an appropriate group size or asking for teachers’ assistance in the selection of children who are more likely to be reflective may be more effective in generating useful information.</p>
<p>The focus of this study is to investigate the perception of obese children and their weight-loss experience. If time and resources are available, further study may look into the beliefs of children who were obese and who have not engaged in weight-loss efforts. In addition, comparing the beliefs and characteristics of children with a history of obesity, who have actually lost weight and those who have lost little to no weight may provide more understanding of their successes and failures in their weight-loss experience.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The growing global childhood obesity epidemic shows no sign of abating in the near future. The Asian population, with its concept of filial piety, lives around the world reflects differences in a combination of personal, environmental, social, and cultural factors. Due to the differences in the cultural and environmental context, grandparents and parents’ influences on their children’s food intake, food choices, and physical activity patterns can result in excess weight gain. Addressing this crisis and reversing the childhood obesity trend will require new and innovative as well as coordinated multidisciplinary approaches. Nurses clearly have an important role to play in managing and mitigating this epidemic and should take a leading role in weight-loss management programs for obese children in the community setting.</p>
