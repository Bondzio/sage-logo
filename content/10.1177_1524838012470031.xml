         <abstract>
            <p>The current review summarized results of 191 published empirical studies that examined the risk and protective factors for sexual violence perpetration. Studies in the review examined factors for perpetration by and against adolescents and adults, by male and female perpetrators, and by those who offended against individuals of the same sex or opposite sex. Factors associated with child sexual abuse (CSA) perpetration were not included. In all, 2 societal and community factors, 23 relationship factors, and 42 individual-level factors were identified. Of these 67 factors, consistent significant support for their association with SV was found for 35, nonsignificant effects were found for 10, 7 factors had limited or sample-specific evidence that they were associated with SV but were in need of further study, and 15 demonstrated mixed results. The factors identified in the review underscore the need for comprehensive prevention programs that target multiple risk and protective factors as well as factors that occur across the social ecology. Moreover, we identified two domains of factors—the presence and acceptance of violence and unhealthy sexual behaviors, experiences, or attitudes—that had consistent significant associations with SV but are not typically addressed in prevention programs. Therefore, SV prevention may also benefit from learning from effective strategies in other areas of public health, namely sexual health and youth violence prevention.</p>

      <p>Sexual violence (SV) refers to sexual activity where consent is not obtained or freely given; coercive strategies used in SV may be physical, verbal, or psychological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524838012470031">Basile &amp; Saltzman, 2002</xref>). SV is a serious public health problem that threatens the health and well-being of individuals across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1524838012470031">Jewkes, Sen, &amp; Garcia-Moreno, 2002</xref>). The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that 1 on 5 women and 1 in 71 men experience rape during their lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524838012470031">Black et al., 2011</xref>). Victims of SV may experience an increased risk of acute and chronic health problems, including injuries resulting from the sexual assault and subsequent health problems and health risk behaviors (e.g., binge drinking; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012470031">Black &amp; Breiding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1524838012470031">Koss &amp; Heslet, 1992</xref>). For perpetrators, arrest and conviction may result in social and economic costs related to incarceration or community notification and registration laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1524838012470031">Levenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1524838012470031">Levenson, D’Amora, &amp; Hern, 2007</xref>). The economic burden of SV victimization including medical and mental health care, loss of work, and impact on quality of life was estimated in 1996 to be approximately $126 billion annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1524838012470031">Miller, Cohen, &amp; Wiersema, 1996</xref>). </p>
      <p>Over the past three decades, substantial research has been conducted to better understand SV in the hopes of preventing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1524838012470031">Koss, 2005</xref>). Despite these efforts, very few primary prevention programs have been shown to be effective in preventing sexually violent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr228-1524838012470031">Teten Tharp et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of an extensive evidence base of effective prevention programs, practitioners must develop, select, and implement programs that reflect the principles of prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr184-1524838012470031">Nation et al., 2003</xref>) and known risk and protective factors for perpetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470031">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2004</xref>). Because it is clear that no single factor causes SV and it is unlikely that individual-level interventions when implemented alone will have a broad public health impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1524838012470031">Dodge, 2009</xref>), the principles of prevention suggest that effective prevention programs are comprehensive, such that they target multiple risk and protective factors and incorporate strategies across the social ecology. Therefore, to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners who are developing and implementing comprehensive prevention programs, the current systematic review summarizes the risk and protective factors for SV that have been studied over the past 20 years. Our goal was to capture the breadth of factors associated with SV perpetration at each level of the social ecology that might be considered in developing evidence-informed prevention strategies.</p>

         <title>Theoretical Framework for Review</title>
         <p>Comprehensive prevention must consider risk and protective factors at the individual, relationship, community, and societal levels of the social ecology and factors for SV that influence perpetration independently or by interacting with other factors. The Malamuth Confluence Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1524838012470031">Malamuth, Linz, Heavey, Barnes, &amp; Acker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1524838012470031">Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, &amp; Tananka, 1991</xref>) is an example of a comprehensive conceptualization of the diverse factors that are associated with SV. The Confluence Model was created by combining the risk factors for SV that were proposed from diverse theories (e.g., evolutionary theory, feminist theory) and combined prominent attitudinal and behavioral risk factors from each of these perspectives. For example, in the model, early risk factors (e.g., child maltreatment) give rise to a behavioral path that includes adolescent delinquency and early, impersonal sexual experience, and an attitudinal path that is comprised of attitudes supporting violence and hostile masculinity. The two paths of risk combine to create risk for SV perpetration in adulthood. Although the Confluence Model includes only specific individual- and relationship-level risk factors, our review was inspired by the Confluence Model in two ways: First, we applied a life span perspective to our search for factors, so that factors in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood were included; second, we performed a search and synthesis of the literature that cut across theoretical perspectives. We built on the conceptualization of the Confluence Model by including factors at the community and societal levels of the social ecology and by including protective factors. </p>
         <sec id="section2-1524838012470031">
            <title>Definition of Terms Used in the Review</title>
            <p>In the literature, a variety of terms are used to capture the behaviors that constitute SV. These behaviors are measured in a variety of ways (e.g., self-report, index offense). Therefore, we will use the term sexual violence, as defined above, as a broad, overarching category that runs along a continuum from minor acts, such as street harassment, to severe acts, such as physically forced sex. Most sexually violent acts involve some type of coercion and aggression, but given the variation in the literature in the use of the terms coercion and aggression, we use the broader term sexual violence but specify the particular behavior (e.g., harassment, rape) when possible and if clearly defined in the article reviewed. For the purposes of the current review, we use the terms risk and protective factors to describe any correlate, predictor, or characteristic that differentiates between those who have perpetrated SV and those who have not. Risk factors are factors reported more frequently among those who perpetrate SV; protective factors buffer against the expected effect of a risk factor or are more frequent among those who do not report SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1524838012470031">Gutman, Sameroff, &amp; Eccles, 2002</xref>). This approach is consistent with the conceptualization of risk and protective factors in the field of public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr233-1524838012470031">Tulchinsky &amp; Varavikova, 2009</xref>). For the remainder of our review, we will refer to risk and protective factors generally as “factors” and specify the nature of the association (e.g., protective, risk) when discussing specific results. </p>

         <title>Method</title>
         <p>The articles included in this review were obtained through a systematic review of the literature on factors associated with SV perpetration. Articles that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524838012470031">Table 1</xref>) were coded by the authors to extract the same information from each article. Significant, nonsignificant, and indirect effects were aggregated by factor, and these factor-specific summaries served as the basis for our results. </p>

            <title>Literature Search and Coding Procedures</title>
            <p>Prior to conducting the literature search, inclusion/exclusion criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524838012470031">Table 1</xref> were developed that were consistent with the goals of the review. Decisions for exclusion were based on our intention to include the best and most accurate data on perpetration that may be used to inform primary prevention and did not replicate recent work. For example, we excluded studies on prison rape, as we believed this unique form of SV was less relevant to guiding the development of primary prevention approaches and may be better addressed by other efforts. We also excluded studies of risk for CSA as these were recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr249-1524838012470031">Whitaker et al., 2008</xref>). Given that a substantial amount of SV is unreported and as a result, perpetrators of SV in the community may be conceptualized as “undetected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1524838012470031">Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002</xref>) or “unincarcerated” (Lisak &amp; Roth, 1990) rapists, we included studies of adjudicated offenders as well as nonadjudicated offenders as we expected some factors may be similar across these samples. We included only studies where SV behavior was measured versus proxy measures of SV such as rape proclivity. Similarly we only included studies in which nonperpetrators were included, as within-sample comparisons of offending individuals provides little information about how SV perpetrators differ from nonperpetrators. </p>
            <sec id="section5-1524838012470031">
               <title>Literature search</title>
               <p>For quality purposes, we selected only published articles or reports to ensure that all studies had been subjected to some level of external peer review and also represented the literature that is most accessible to practitioners when informing the development and implementation of prevention (i.e., dissertations were excluded). In Spring 2008, we conducted a search of the Pubmed, PsychInfo, Sociofiles, Anthrosource, and Anthropology Plus databases using the following key words: sexual AND (aggression OR coercion OR violence OR assault OR rape) AND perpetration. We limited our search to English documents with human samples published between 1989 and 2008, in order to capture what at the time of our search was research conducted over the last 20 years. This search yielded over 11,000 articles. We reviewed all abstracts and obtained articles that appeared to meet our criteria. Full articles were reviewed again for fit once obtained. Several months later, we updated our search by reviewing violence and women’s journals (e.g., <italic>Journal of Interpersonal Violence</italic>, <italic>Violence against Women</italic>) for newly released articles that may not yet have been indexed in databases. We also obtained studies that were not identified in our database searches from the reference lists of previously identified articles and chapters, including 69 reviews or meta-analyses identified during our search. Our final list of abstracts was then vetted by internal CDC SV subject matter experts and external experts to identify missing articles or gaps. The vetting procedure resulted in another literature search specifically of same-sex SV articles and articles examining arousal and SV. The new search yielded no additional same-sex SV articles and three additional articles related to arousal. </p>

            <sec id="section6-1524838012470031">
               <title>Coding</title>
               <p>All authors participated in coding and used a standardized coding sheet (available from first author on request) to code the articles that met our criteria. The coding sheet was developed based on domains of risk factors that comprise the Confluence Model, the social ecological model, and knowledge of common risk and protective factors. At the individual level, we captured factors related to psychosocial functioning, substance use, attitudes/beliefs, and sexual behaviors. However, the coding procedure also allowed us to capture any other factor via open-ended fields. Therefore, the coding sheet increased the ease of coding for common factors but also captured factors that may have been infrequently examined. We did not include individual demographic factors (e.g., race) in the current review as these factors are most reliably examined in representative samples and most of the samples in our review were convenience samples or samples with limited demographic variation, which led to conclusions not supported by epidemiological research. For each coded article, we also captured methodological and sample characteristics (e.g., sample age, recruitment strategy, analytic strategy, nature of comparison group), the nature of the effects (e.g., indirect or direct), and whether the results were significant or not. </p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>Our final sample included 191 articles; of these, 119 involved U.S. samples and 72 involved international samples. The characteristics of these articles are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524838012470031">Table 2</xref>. The majority of studies using nonadjudicated samples employed middle school, high school, or collegiate samples. Some adult community-based studies also drew samples from specific locations, such as the military or sexually transmitted infection clinics. The majority of adjudicated samples were comprised of currently incarcerated individuals or records reviews. </p>

         <p>Our review yielded 67 risk and protective factors, which were classified into 16 domains: community/societal factors (2 factors), family environment and history (5 factors), family characteristics (4 factors), family relationships (4 factors), peer attitudes and behaviors (3 factors), hypermasculine/all-male peer groups (2 factors), association with antisocial peers (2 factors), intimate partner processes and characteristics (2 factors), partner relationship conflict (1 factor), sexual behaviors and other noncognitive sex-related factors (15 factors), psychosocial factors (8 factors), sex-related cognitions (5 factors), interpersonal skill factors (5 factors), gender-based cognitions (4 factors), violence-related cognitions (3 factors), and substance use (2 factors). The domains are presented from the outer levels of the social ecology to the individual-level, and within each level the domains with the most factors are described first followed by domains with fewer factors. In the results, we only present the domain overviews that provide a brief description of the theories or conceptual background that have guided research on the factors within the domain, a summary of the results for the factors in the Appendix and any quality issues observed.</p>
         <p>Results for specific factors are presented in the Appendix. In the Appendix, factors within the domains are presented according to the amount of research conducted, with well-studied factors followed by factors for which less empirical work is available. Given the nature of results and differences in volume of work conducted for factors at different levels of the social ecology, the factor summaries in the Appendix are organized slightly differently for individual versus relationship, community, and societal levels. For example for individual-level factors, we describe significant direct effects, followed by significant moderated or mediated effects, followed by mixed and nonsignificant effects, whereas family factor descriptions are organized by offender type. We also highlight, when available, results based on sex of the perpetrator and victim (same-sex or heterosexual perpetration), adjudication status of the perpetrator (adjudicated sex offenders or community samples), and age of the perpetrator (adolescent or adult). The ways in which factors were operationalized in studies and explanations of mixed or null results are also included in many factor descriptions. A snapshot of the results by factor can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524838012470031">Table 3</xref> (described in detail in the discussion). Because most studies involved male-perpetrated SV, we refer to male perpetration unless otherwise noted. </p>

         <title>Overview of Community and Societal Level Factors</title>
         <p>Few studies examining community and societal level risk factors for SV perpetration were identified. The factors that have been studied fall into two broad categories, gender-based factors and structural/environmental factors. Both categories have been suggested as potential risk factors for SV in the theoretical literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524838012470031">Baron &amp; Straus, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1524838012470031">Jewkes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr201-1524838012470031">Sanday, 1981</xref>). However, the available evidence provided little empirical support for an association between these factors and SV. For example, in terms of gender-based factors, Koenig, Stephenson, Ahmed, Jejeebhoy, and Campbell (2006) examined female educational levels and men’s attitudes toward gender roles and domestic violence (all measured at the community level) and found no association with community SV rates. In terms of structural factors, higher levels of SV against intimate partners were found in areas with concurrently high homicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1524838012470031">Koenig, Stephenson, Ahmed, Jejeebhoy, &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>). Another study found higher rates of SV among men raised in communist East Berlin than in those from West Berlin, but this study did not control for socioeconomic status (SES), employment, or other possible differences between the samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1524838012470031">Krahé, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the evidence is limited on how community and societal level factors are associated with SV, and the existing evidence shows either nonsignificant or mixed effects.</p>

                  </sup> refers to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse as well as neglect experienced during childhood. Although the majority of abused and neglected children do not go on to perpetrate violence, research strongly suggests that child maltreatment can increase the risk for violence perpetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr253-1524838012470031">Widom, 2001</xref>). Our review suggests that the effects of childhood victimization on SV perpetration may vary by type of maltreatment and population studied. The most consistent evidence was found for childhood emotional abuse, although only a few studies examined this form of maltreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1524838012470031">DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr258-1524838012470031">Zakireh, Ronis, &amp; Knight, 2008</xref>). Significant effects were also reported for physical abuse and composite measures of child maltreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1524838012470031">Fineran &amp; Bolen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr258-1524838012470031">Zakireh et al., 2008</xref>). Multiple studies examined childhood sexual abuse victimization as a risk factor for SV perpetration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr252-1524838012470031">White &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>), and the findings were significant in a majority of studies. However, the evidence was not consistent and results may be sample dependent. Specifically, studies that included offenders against both children and adults were more likely to find significant effects than those in which perpetrators had only peer (i.e., similar age) or adult victims, suggesting that significant findings were driven by the inclusion of perpetrators who offended against children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr258-1524838012470031">Zakireh et al., 2008</xref>). Findings for neglect were mostly nonsignificant, but few studies have examined neglect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1524838012470031">Johnson-Reid &amp; Way, 2001</xref>).</p>

               <title>Family characteristics</title>
               <p>Family characteristics include parental SES, mental health, substance use, and criminal background, as well as family structure. As described in the Appendix, there is little consistent evidence implicating parent or family characteristics in SV perpetration. With a few exceptions, the studies suggested that parent characteristics including criminal behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr240-1524838012470031">van Wijk, Vreugdenhil, van Horn, Vermeiren, &amp; Doreleijers, 2007</xref>), substance abuse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470031">Borowsky, Hogan, &amp; Ireland, 1997</xref>), and mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524838012470031">Awad &amp; Saunders, 1991</xref>) were unrelated to SV perpetration. Indicators of family structure were also unrelated to SV perpetration in most studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1524838012470031">Hosser &amp; Bosold, 2006</xref>). Findings were mixed for indicators of family SES (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470031">DeSouza &amp; Ribeiro, 2005</xref>). However, the majority of research in this area compared adolescent sexual offenders (ASOs) with adolescent nonsexual offenders (who may also have heightened levels of these risk characteristics; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr186-1524838012470031">Oliver, Hall, &amp; Neuhaus, 1993</xref>). Thus, it may be that family characteristics represent more general risk factors for criminal or violent behavior rather than SV-specific factors.</p>

               <title>Family relationships</title>
               <p>Family relationships refer to interactions among family members including parental conflict, parent–child relationship quality, parenting style, and family functioning. Examination of family relationship quality and functioning as potential SV risk factors is supported by social learning theory, which emphasizes the family as a model for the child’s own behavior, and by attachment theory which points to the nature and quality of early parent–child relationships as critical to a child’s psychosocial development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470031">Burton, Miller, &amp; Shill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr245-1524838012470031">Ward, Hudson, &amp; Marshall, 1996</xref>). Indeed, findings reviewed here provided consistent support for exposure to family conflict and parental violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470031">Borowsky et al., 1997</xref>). Parent–child relationship quality was identified as a consistent predictor of SV in community and adult sex offender samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1524838012470031">McCormack, Hudson &amp; Ward, 2002</xref>) but not among ASOs when compared to other adolescent offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1524838012470031">Miner &amp; Munns, 2005</xref>). Evidence for the influence of family functioning and parenting style on SV was mixed. Notably, having parents who use reasoning to resolve family conflicts may serve as a protective factor for SV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1524838012470031">Forbes &amp; Adams-Curtis, 2001</xref>), though other parenting styles were not significantly associated with SV perpetration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524838012470031">Aberle &amp; Littlefield, 2001</xref>).</p>

Peer groups in which one or more individuals actively support or engage in SV may create the perception of social norms supportive of SV, normalizing and justifying these behaviors. Further, individuals who perceive pressure by their friends to have sex may view SV as having social benefits that outweigh the personal risks. Indeed, findings from several studies with community samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012470031">Abbey, Parkhill, Clinton-Sherrod, &amp; Zawacki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1524838012470031">Jewkes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1524838012470031">Krahé, 1998</xref>) consistently supported SV-supportive peer sexual attitudes and behaviors as risk factors for perpetration.

This type of group participation or membership may influence SV perpetration by reinforcing and providing social support for the use of violence, objectification of women, hostile attitudes toward women, hypermasculine ideals, or excessive alcohol use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1524838012470031">Godenzi, Schwartz, &amp; DeKeseredy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1524838012470031">Humphrey &amp; Kahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1524838012470031">Murnen &amp; Kohlman, 2007</xref>). Although the connection between male peer groups/sports participation and SV has been explored in the literature, the majority of studies examine SV-supporting attitudes rather than behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470031">Forbes, Adams-Curtis, Pakalka, &amp; White, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1524838012470031">Murnen &amp; Kohlman, 2007</xref>). In the current review, participation in fraternities and sports was associated with increased risk for SV perpetration behavior in more studies than not (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524838012470031">Boeringer, Shehan, &amp; Akers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1524838012470031">Loh, Gidycz, Lobo, &amp; Luthra, 2005</xref>), but the results were notably mixed. A few studies found that this relationship may be moderated by characteristics of the fraternity, sport, or individual participant (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524838012470031">Caron, Halteman, &amp; Stacy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1524838012470031">Gage, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1524838012470031">Humphrey &amp; Kahn, 2000</xref>). This is consistent with suggestions by several authors that this relationship may depend on the risk characteristics of specific fraternities or teams rather than participation in such groups generally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524838012470031">Casey &amp; Lindhorst, 2009</xref>). </p>

An evolutionary perspective suggests male and female differences in mating behaviors may pose a risk for SV. Evolutionary theorists suggest male mating effort seeks to maximize the chance of reproduction by increasing the number of sexual partners and using coercive strategies when traditional methods of attraction (e.g., appearance, financial status) are ineffective or unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1524838012470031">Malamuth &amp; Malamuth, 1999</xref>).

The results from our review provide support for these theories; across samples, multiple sexual partners, impersonal sex/casual attitudes toward sex, early initiation of sex, a history of either sexual victimization during adolescence or adulthood or past SV perpetration, exposure to sexually explicit media, and higher sex drive were directly or indirectly associated with SV perpetration (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref> for specific studies that support each factor).

For example, bisexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524838012470031">Daleiden, Kaufman, Hilliker, &amp; O’Neil, 1998</xref>), sexual discomfort (preoccupation and conflict with sexuality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr258-1524838012470031">Zakireh et al., 2008</xref>), and deviant sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524838012470031">Daleiden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr240-1524838012470031">van Wijk et al., 2007</xref>) were significantly associated with SV in ASO samples. Sexual risk taking and sexually transmitted infection (STI) status were associated with SV in groups at particularly high risk for these risk factors (e.g., individuals seeking treatment at STI clinics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1524838012470031">Kalichman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr215-1524838012470031">Simbayi et al., 2006</xref>). Because these samples were not representative, further study is required to determine the applicability of these factors to the broader population. Results were mixed for arousal to deviant stimuli. Age at coming out was nonsignificant in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1524838012470031">Krahé, Scheinberger-Olwig, &amp; Schutze, 2001</xref>), and one study that examined testosterone levels did not support high levels of testosterone as a risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012470031">Aromäki, Lindman, &amp; Eriksson, 2002</xref>). Although much more work on testosterone as a risk factor has been conducted, these studies were excluded because they were published prior to 1989 or because they included only samples of male sex offenders. In general, many sexual behaviors or related factors were consistently associated with SV.</p>

               <p>A substantial amount of work has suggested links between psychopathology, other indicators of poor emotional functioning, and violence, with oppositional or antisocial disorders being particularly predictive of violence in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470031">Boots &amp; Wareham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1524838012470031">Eronen, Angermeyer, &amp; Schulze, 1998</xref>). Violence may be a symptom of a personality or disruptive behavior disorder or may be a strategy used to cope with psychosocial dysfunction. With regard to SV, the available evidence suggests suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470031">Bagley &amp; Shewchuk-Dann, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470031">Borowsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524838012470031">Christoffersen, Soothill, &amp; Francis, 2005</xref>) and aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470031">Bagley &amp; Shewchuk-Dann, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470031">DeSouza &amp; Ribeiro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1524838012470031">Gidycz, Warkentin, &amp; Orchowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr217-1524838012470031">Smallbone &amp; Dadds, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr235-1524838012470031">Ullman, Karbastsos, &amp; Koss, 1999</xref>) may occur at a higher rate among SV perpetrators than nonperpetrators. As described in detail in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref>, the evidence is mixed for general adjustment difficulties/psychopathology, delinquency, self-esteem, impulsivity, and poor school achievement. Religious affiliation was consistently not associated with SV. Somewhat surprisingly, many factors in this domain had both negative and positive effects, such that perpetrators fared both worse and better than comparison groups on some variables. For example, conduct problems/delinquency were positively associated with SV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470031">Bagley &amp; Shewchuk-Dann, 1991</xref>) and negatively associated with SV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524838012470031">Blaske, Borduin, Henggeler, &amp; Mann, 1989</xref>) among ASOs. </p>
               <p>A major limitation in this area is the wide variety of factors that have been examined within each category; in addition to major Axis I and II disorders, more nuanced variables such as hypochondrial preoccupation, self-absorption, repressed hostility, and concern with inner destructive impulses were also studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1524838012470031">McCraw &amp; Pegg-McNab, 1989</xref>). Such variation made succinct comparisons across studies difficult and may have resulted in mixed and null effects in some of the domains. The mixed and equivocal findings for aggression and delinquency may also be the result of the overrepresentation of ASO studies in this domain and the tendency to use nonsexual adolescent offenders as a comparison group for ASOs. Because variables like poor academic performance are related to violent behavior in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1524838012470031">Crapanzano, Frick, &amp; Terranova, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1524838012470031">Graham, Bellmore, &amp; Mize, 2006</xref>), this variable may not distinguish two adjudicated samples, although both these groups may have poorer achievement than community samples of youth. Compared to the other factor domains we examined, some of which show consistency across diverse samples, the evidence for factors in this domain may represent sample-specific characteristics.</p>

               <p>Interpersonal skills refer to a broad domain of factors that include social skills, empathy, intimacy deficits, cue misinterpretation, and social desirability. Some theories of sexual offending suggest deficits in interpersonal functioning lead to negative internal states, such as loneliness, which then contribute to SV perpetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1524838012470031">Marshall, 1989</xref>). In other words, an inability to negotiate social relationships leads to the development of maladaptive or coercive strategies to satisfy a need for intimacy. Although cue misinterpretation was consistently associated with SV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524838012470031">Abbey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr213-1524838012470031">Shea, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr255-1524838012470031">Yescavage, 1999</xref>), as discussed in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref> results were mixed for social skills deficits and intimacy.

Empathy had few direct significant effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470031">Farr, Brown, &amp; Beckett, 2004</xref>), but several moderated effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1524838012470031">Christopher, Owens, &amp; Stecker, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-1524838012470031">Malamuth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr248-1524838012470031">Wheeler, George, &amp; Dahl, 2002</xref>), suggesting this factor may work in concert with other risk factors to increase or decrease SV risk. For example, some studies suggested empathy and loss of face served as protective factors and buffered the effect of other risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012470031">Abbey, Parkhill, BeShears, Clinton-Sherrod, &amp; Zawacki, 2006</xref>). Empathy and loss of face may exert inhibitory control when decision making is compromised by other situational risk factors, such as intoxication, anger, or anxiety. Interpersonal factors have been conceptualized in a variety of ways across studies, making it difficult to summarize and compare results; this variability may have contributed to several null and mixed effects in this domain. A substantial portion of this work has been conducted in adjudicated samples with effects varying based on comparison group, victim characteristics, and aspect of empathy examined with nonsex offending comparison groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524838012470031">Burke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524838012470031">Fernandez &amp; Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1524838012470031">Lindsey, Carlozzi, &amp; Eells, 2001</xref>).</p>

Among domains reviewed and as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524838012470031">Table 3</xref> and the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref>, gender-related thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs were the most studied risk factors. Much of this research stems from feminist theory, which suggests men’s sexual aggression is propagated by patriarchal societies, which seek to maintain power and control over women through their sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr243-1524838012470031">Walker, 1989</xref>). Across studies as described in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref>, traditional, rape-supportive, hypermasculine, and adversarial sexual beliefs and attitudes demonstrated associations with SV. A particular strength of this literature is that many studies have examined the interaction of these and other factors, suggesting factors work in concert to increase the risk for SV. In Malamuth’s Confluence Model of sexual aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1524838012470031">Malamuth et al., 1995</xref>), for example, attitudes supporting violence against women interact with violent and sexual behaviors to give rise to SV.

         <title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
         <p>To date, the research on SV has uncovered a host of risk factors and a few protective factors related to SV perpetration. However, the translation of this knowledge into effective primary prevention strategies has been a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr228-1524838012470031">Teten Tharp et al., 2011</xref>). To serve as a resource for practitioners who are developing, selecting, and implementing comprehensive prevention programs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on factors associated with SV perpetration across each level of the social ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470031">CDC, 2004</xref>). Our review identified 25 factors at the relationship, community, and societal levels and 42 factors at the individual level. The risk and protective factors that hold the most promise as primary prevention targets are those factors with consistent significant associations with SV perpetration across well-designed and rigorous studies and across diverse samples. </p>
         <p>Among the 67 factors we examined, consistent significant associations with SV perpetration were found for 35 (52.2%) factors. Ten (14.9%) factors were not supported as risk or protective factors for SV, and 7 (10.4%) showed some positive effects (e.g., examined in only one study, significant for a specific sample) but were in need of more research. For 15 (22.4%) factors, the evidence was mixed; such mixed effects often resulted from methodological differences across studies, different conceptualizations of the factor, or different comparison groups, which are discussed subsequently in more detail and highlighted for each factor summary in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1524838012470031">Appendix</xref> where applicable. The effect across studies of each factor is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524838012470031">Table 3</xref>

            </sup>. Multiple interactions among factors were identified, suggesting that multiple risk factors combine in different ways to increase the likelihood of SV perpetration. Results suggest the need to take a comprehensive approach to prevention by targeting multiple, modifiable factors (factors that can be changed by intervention) that are most consistently associated with SV.</p>
         <p>Our review identified only a few protective factors, most of which were examined in only a few studies or applied only to specific groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470031">Borowsky, Hogan, and Ireland (1997)</xref> found emotional health and connectedness were protective factors for high school boys’ perpetration, and academic achievement was a protective factor for high school girls’ perpetration. Hall and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1524838012470031">Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1524838012470031">Hall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1524838012470031">Hall, Teten, DeGarmo, Sue, &amp; Stephens, 2005</xref>) identified “loss of face,”—a concern for how one’s actions affect others—as a protective factor for SV among Asian American men, although the effect varied by risk factor; for example, loss of face, but not hostile masculinity, protected against the effect of early risk factors on SV. In terms of family factors, some evidence suggests that having parents who use reasoning to resolve family conflicts may be associated with a lower risk for SV perpetration by males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1524838012470031">Forbes &amp; Adams-Curtis, 2001</xref>). In general, empathy had several direct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012470031">Abbey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470031">Farr et al., 2004</xref>) and indirect effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012470031">Abbey et al., 2006</xref>) on SV, suggesting greater empathy may be a potential protective factor. The nuanced nature of protective factors may suggest that these factors, like many risk factors, are activated in certain situations and may be most relevant during particular developmental periods. The results of the review suggest our current knowledge of protective factors within the SV literature is extremely limited and hampers our ability to develop and identify prevention strategies that can take more of a health promotion or resiliency approach.</p>
         <p>As described above, the Confluence Model inspired our review, such that risk and protective factors from across the social ecology and from diverse theories were included. Like the Confluence Model that offered a unified conceptualization of paths to SV, we looked for patterns, trends, or commonalities among factors that were significant at the individual, relationship, and community or societal levels. To identify constellations, we examined the factors identified as consistently significant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524838012470031">Table 3</xref>. Constellations of factors that have effects across the social ecology may support the development of comprehensive and cohesive prevention strategies that are organized around a particular constellation of risk. Two constellations emerged as promising targets for comprehensive approaches to SV prevention. </p>
         <p>The first constellation was the <italic>presence and acceptance of violence</italic>. At the individual level, this constellation was comprised of risk factors such as acceptance of violence, past SV perpetration, and SV victimization as an adolescent or adult. At the family level, this constellation included risk factors such as conflict in the family of origin and different forms of child maltreatment. At the peer level, this constellation included peers that perpetrate SV, peer support for SV, and gang membership, as well as relationship conflict at the intimate partner relationship level. Many of these factors were supported across samples and developmental phases. Studies have not yet examined the cumulative effect on SV of sexual and non-SV experienced and promoted in multiple contexts; however, the factors identified in our review suggest that individuals who experience violence in their family of origin, have peers who support violence, and have relationships characterized by violence may have attitudes that support the use of violence and subsequently are at higher risk for perpetrating SV. As we discuss in detail below, the presence and acceptance of violence has been extensively examined in other areas of violence research, such as youth violence. Drawing from other violence literatures may be useful in identifying additional risk and protective factors that may be associated with SV. </p>
         <p>The second promising constellation involves <italic>unhealthy sexual behaviors</italic>, <italic>experiences</italic>, or<italic> attitudes</italic>. Factors associated with this constellation were consistently supported at the individual and peer level and included risk factors such as multiple sexual partners, impersonal sex, early initiation of sex, adversarial heterosexual beliefs, CSA victimization, exposure to sexually aggressive peers, and peer pressure to have sex. Sex-related factors have not been examined at the community or societal levels, although some theoretical work suggests community level variables, such as norms promoting the delay of sexual activity in Asian cultures, may protect against SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1524838012470031">Hall, Windover, &amp; Maramba, 1998</xref>). Future empirical work is needed to validate such theoretical propositions and to identify other risk and protective effects of sex-related variables at the outer levels of the social ecology. As we discuss in detail below, the potential role of unhealthy sexual behaviors, experiences, or attitudes in the etiology of SV suggests the development of evidence-informed SV prevention strategies may benefit from drawing on other public health research and programming that targets risky sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr242-1524838012470031">Vivolo et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

The evidence of the constellations and the research underlying the Confluence Model suggests it may be a useful model in guiding SV prevention development.</p>
         <p>Two major benefits exist to expanding the study of risk and protective factors and the development of effective prevention strategies to include research on youth violence and sexual risk behaviors. First, youth violence and sexual risk prevention offer a cadre of effective and promising prevention strategies implemented at multiple levels of the social ecology that may be adapted or integrated into SV prevention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524838012470031">Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1524838012470031">Herbst et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the risk and protective factor literature in these areas is vast, well established, often methodologically rigorous, and may offer new avenues for the study of SV. </p>
         <p>Using youth violence as an example (for further discussion see DeGue, Massetti, Holt, Tharp, Valle, Matjasko, et al., 2012 with the appropriate reference citation.), some SV risk and protective factors overlap with those associated with youth violence, including acceptance of violence, but most SV studies were not informed by the large and rich youth violence developmental literature. Including risk and protective factors that have a long-established relationship with youth violence (e.g., lack of parental monitoring) and at the outer levels of the social ecology (e.g., living in neighborhoods characterized by high concentrations of poverty and unemployment or with lower levels of collective efficacy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr200-1524838012470031">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>) in models of SV will yield important information and linkages among different forms of violence. For example, recent work has found that individuals who engage in bullying are more likely to also engage in SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470031">DeSouza &amp; Ribeiro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr190-1524838012470031">Pellegrini, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr191-1524838012470031">Pepler et al., 2006</xref>), and SV and bullying have some shared risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012470031">Basile, Espelage, Rivers, McMahon, &amp; Simon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524838012470031">Espelage, 2009</xref>). It is also possible that well-established SV risk factors will not maintain their significance when key youth violence risk and protective factors are considered. Similarly, substantial work in youth violence has identified developmental trajectories of problem behavior and the interaction of trajectories with risk factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1524838012470031">Herrenkohl, Hill, Hawkins, Chung, &amp; Nagin, 2006</xref>), which has informed the developmentally appropriate implementation of prevention strategies and identification of youth at elevated risk for violence. SV research may benefit both from considering effective prevention strategies for youth violence and from the methodological and conceptual advances in this field.</p>
         <sec id="section30-1524838012470031">
            <title>Methodological Considerations and Recommendations</title>
            <p>In the course of conducting this review, our team identified several methodological and other issues in the literature that need to be considered when interpreting the findings of our review and in conducting future research. Our recommendations focus on issues of definition, research design, sampling, measurement, analyses, and gaps in the samples studied. Our assessment of the mixed results for some factors suggests these methodological considerations may account for some of the variable results across studies. Although many of the methodological issues we raise are common to etiological research, in general, SV research seems to have progressed more slowly than other areas of violence, so we describe these limitations in light of our review and as a call for more rigorous studies. </p>
            <p>First, there is a need to clearly define SV and to try to increase the consistency of definitions used in the research. Studies operationalized SV differently; and often the types of SV perpetration captured were not described (e.g., in studies of sex offenders), vaguely described, or focused on more extreme forms of SV (i.e., rape). The particular form of SV examined also varied by developmental phase of the participants, such that studies of youth often measured less severe forms of SV, such as sexual harassment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr190-1524838012470031">Pellegrini, 2001</xref>), and studies of adults often measured a variety of forms of forced or coerced sex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr251-1524838012470031">White, McMullin, Swartout, Sechrist, &amp; Gollehon, 2008</xref>). The tendency to assess less severe forms of SV in younger samples may reflect reluctance to ask children and youth questions about sexual behavior; nonetheless, these differences make it difficult to summarize results across studies or to examine whether specific types of SV (e.g., sexual harassment, use of coercion, rape) are associated with different risk and protective factors. Although the need for a consistent definition has been voiced before (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524838012470031">Basile &amp; Saltzman, 2002</xref>), our review reiterates this need. In our review, we utilized the CDC definition for SV and would recommend this definition as a starting point to gain consistency in the field.</p>
            <p>Second, there is a need to use longitudinal methodology across the life span to identify developmental trajectories of SV behavior, critical periods for intervention, and populations at elevated developmental risk for SV perpetration during different developmental periods. Because effective prevention often capitalizes on opportunities to intervene at earlier stages in developmental processes, it is critical to understand the development and expression of risk and protective factors for SV at early ages and how this expression changes over time. In addition, research is needed that identifies risk and protective factors for SV using research designs that can demonstrate, at a minimum, temporal patterns of the factors on SV. In terms of design, the majority of the studies in our review were cross sectional. Cross-sectional designs, while useful for determining associations between SV and different risk and protective factors, do not allow temporal or developmental timing of these associations to be determined. Longitudinal studies are often more expensive to conduct than cross sectional and a starting point for addressing this weakness may be to add SV measures to ongoing longitudinal studies.</p>
            <p>Third, future work requires well-matched, well-measured comparison groups, particularly for adjudicated samples. The public health approach to prevention that targets risk and protective factors in hopes of preventing problem behavior relies on the identification of factors that clearly discriminate offenders from nonoffenders, which is only possible in well-designed studies with carefully matched comparison groups. Sampling procedures used in many of the studies for factors with mixed effects contributed to difficulties in generalizing across studies. Most studies focused on a limited number of risk factors within the circumscribed context of a particular theory or sample. As a result, some risk and protective factors were examined only within specific groups. For example, gender-based cognitions were examined primarily among college students, and psychosocial and interpersonal factors were examined primarily in adjudicated samples. Therefore, it is unclear how generalizable some of these factors are to other types of SV perpetrators. Many studies, particularly those with college students, used convenience samples, and it is unclear how well these results translate to other populations. </p>
            <p>Adjudicated samples were often small, and comparison groups were often convenience samples of incarcerated nonsex offenders. Group membership often was determined by the nature of the index offense (i.e., SV or nonsex offense resulting in incarceration), which introduces the possibility that individuals with undocumented sexual offenses may have been included in the comparison group. Studies with adjudicated samples often resulted in null effects on factors common to both sexual and nonsexual offending groups (e.g., delinquency), which could reflect true shared risk factors in adjudicated populations or undetected SV perpetration histories in the comparison offenders. Future work with adjudicated sex offenders might consider gathering additional information (e.g., self-report) on SV perpetration across all groups and including matched incarcerated and community comparison groups to disentangle factors associated with general offending and factors specific to SV perpetration. </p>
            <p>Fourth, measurement of SV and other factors needs to be conducted using well-designed, comprehensive measures. There was a tendency across studies to use retrospective self-report instruments to assess SV perpetration behaviors and risk and protective factors. Although validated instruments such as the Sexual Experiences Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1524838012470031">Koss &amp; Oros, 1982</xref>) were often used, other measures of SV were commonly embedded in instruments that assess a variety of relationship or risk behaviors (e.g., Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr254-1524838012470031">Wolfe et al., 2001</xref>; Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470031">CDC, 2007</xref>) and may have included only a few items that measure only the most severe forms of SV. Future work should focus on the development and use of well-validated instruments that measure the range of SV behaviors as well as the context of the violence. Finally, in terms of measurement, studies assessing factors at the relationship, community, and societal levels of the social ecology often used individual level surveys rather than assessing the factor at the level of the social ecology being examined (e.g., community-level data for community factors; assessment of relationship factors as opposed to one individual’s report of relationship factors). We acknowledge that there are significant, though not insurmountable, methodological hurdles involved in measuring risk factors at the community and societal levels. These challenges may contribute to the particularly sparse literature at these levels and explain why few of the outer-level risk factors hypothesized in the theoretical literature have been empirically examined. These potential risk factors, many supported by qualitative or victimization data, are in need of rigorous empirical investigation to identify promising targets for the prevention of SV perpetration. </p>
            <p>Fifth, research should be conducted that examines multiple risk and protective factors and utilize analyses that allow for the examination of interactions and mediating and moderating effects. Protective factors were rarely examined. With respect to analyses, the analytic techniques used in most studies often relied on correlations or tests of mean differences and examined the factors in isolation rather than in relation to each other. Although the nested nature of the social ecological model suggests the interplay of risk and protective factors among levels and reflects the fact that factors within and across levels frequently co-occur with each other and with outcomes, few analytic approaches were used that could capture these interactions (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling). Moreover, it is unclear what the cumulative effect over development of multiple risk factors are and how and when protective factors may influence this risk. Future work should employ multimethod assessment of multiple factors associated with SV as well as analytic techniques that can account for the complex interplay between factors and levels of the social ecology.</p>
            <p>Sixth, there are extensive gaps in our knowledge of factors associated with SV in certain demographic groups. The final sample of articles reflected the diversity of SV perpetrators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524838012470031">Table 2</xref>), but overrepresented samples comprised exclusively of male college students (<italic>n = </italic>63, 33.0%) and tended to include mostly male perpetrators (<italic>n</italic> = 160, 83.7%). Four primary groups were underrepresented in our review: men in the community; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals; military personnel; and girls/women. Although not represented in our review and not discussed here, several groups also exist that experience particularly high rates of SV victimization (e.g., economically disadvantaged individuals, some ethnic and cultural minorities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr185-1524838012470031">National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2009</xref>); however, because no perpetration research has been conducted with these groups, it is unclear whether both perpetration and victimization are elevated. </p>
            <sec id="section31-1524838012470031">
               <title>Community samples of men</title>
               <p>A substantial number of studies used college student samples, despite the fact that SV occurs across age groups and settings. College samples are often used because of the convenience of data collection and because of the documented frequency of SV that takes place on college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1524838012470031">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000</xref>). The major drawback of these samples is that, for the most part, they do not represent the general population, in that collegiate samples are often predominantly Caucasian, young, and relatively affluent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1524838012470031">Gidycz et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, some risk factors, such as excessive alcohol use, may be concentrated in collegiate samples, whereas other risk factors, such as gang membership, may be more common in noncollegiate samples. In one of the few studies that directly compared collegiate and community samples of men, a different pattern of results for each sample was found for traditional gender role adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr244-1524838012470031">Walker, Rowe, &amp; Quinsey, 1993</xref>). More work with representative samples of noncollegiate men is needed to understand the generalizability of risk factors that have been examined primarily in collegiate samples and to identify factors that may be unique to community samples.</p>

            <sec id="section32-1524838012470031">
               <title>LGBT individuals</title>
               <p>Similarly, very little work has been conducted with LGBT samples or with same-sex SV. In our review, 3 (1.6%) studies specifically examined same-sex SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1524838012470031">Krahé et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1524838012470031">Kwon, Lee, Kim, &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr225-1524838012470031">Strike, Myers, Calzavara, &amp; Haubrich, 2001</xref>), although a few additional articles included individuals with both heterosexual and homosexual orientations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524838012470031">Daleiden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr207-1524838012470031">Segurado et al., 2008</xref>). Two primary forms of SV involving this group are in need of further study: harassment or SV between same-sex individuals due to homophobia or bullying, and SV within same-sex relationships that occur in the context of intimate partner violence. Both forms of violence present unique research challenges. For the former, perpetrators or victims of homophobic bullying may not consider the behavior a form of SV, and stigma may prevent reporting of such acts. For the latter, it is logistically difficult to recruit a representative sample of same-sex couples to ensure sufficient statistical power, although a variety of recruitment methods in other areas of public health are being evaluated for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1524838012470031">Fisher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1524838012470031">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). As an alternative to representative samples, some research utilizes convenience samples of LGBT individuals; the limitation of using convenience samples is that factors identified in circumscribed samples may not generalize to the population. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr225-1524838012470031">Strike and colleagues (2001)</xref> conducted focus groups with LGBT individuals who were currently homeless or at one time had been homeless. While this approach was useful in describing the particular needs of this group, the study’s results may have conflated risk for SV with factors associated with homelessness. </p>
               <p>The studies in our review that examined risk factors for same-sex SV examined some risk factors that we did not encounter in other studies, such as exchanging money for sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1524838012470031">Krahé et al., 2001</xref>). Because these factors have not been examined in heterosexual samples, it is unclear whether this is a sample-specific risk factor or whether it is associated with heterosexual SV as well. Future work is needed to clarify which risk and protective factors are unique to same-sex SV and which may be applicable to other groups. As a step toward clarifying risk and protective factors that pertain to heterosexual and same-sex SV, studies should at a minimum assess the sexual orientation of their participants and the sex of the target of the violence.</p>

               <title>Military personnel</title>
               <p>A third area in need of further study is SV perpetration during military service. In the United States, according to the 2000 census, approximately 1.4 million individuals were serving as active duty or reserve military, and approximately 26.4 million were military veterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr236-1524838012470031">U.S. Census Bureau, 2003</xref>). In 2003, the number of veterans and military constituted over 13% of U.S. citizens over the age of 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr236-1524838012470031">U.S. Census Bureau, 2003</xref>), but only 1.6% of the studies we reviewed (<italic>n</italic> = 3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1524838012470031">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1524838012470031">Merrill, Thomsen, Gold, &amp; Milner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr222-1524838012470031">Stander, Merrill, Thomsen, Crouch, &amp; Milner, 2008</xref>) involved this group. Of the three studies that examined military samples, two U.S. studies examined pre-military male-to-female sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1524838012470031">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr222-1524838012470031">Stander et al., 2008</xref>). The other military study involved male-on-male SV in the South Korean military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1524838012470031">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, sexual assault in the military has received substantial attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524838012470031">Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military, 2009</xref>), resulting in large-scale prevention efforts; however, most of the research with this group has examined the mental and physical health consequences of victimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1524838012470031">Haskell et al., 2010</xref>) rather than risk for perpetration. Reports of SV victimization indicate men as well as women are at risk for military sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr226-1524838012470031">Suris &amp; Lind, 2008</xref>) and suggest research on both male-on-female and male-on-male SV is needed. Therefore, in order to better guide the selection, adaptation, and development of prevention strategies for the military, we must understand whether the existing evidence on risk and protective factors from incarcerated, college, and community samples is applicable, and if not, what factors may be unique to military and veteran populations. </p>

               <title>Girls and women</title>
               <p>The final group that was underrepresented in our review and requires more study is women. Consistent evidence suggests women are less likely to perpetrate SV than men. For example, in 2008, women accounted for 1.2% of arrests for forcible rape and 8.5% of arrests for other sex crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524838012470031">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2008</xref>). However, a smaller, sometimes negligible difference exists between the prevalence of men’s and women’s nonphysical forms of coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012470031">Anderson &amp; Melson, 2002</xref>). Despite this, very little rigorous work has focused on risk and protective factors for women’s perpetration. Although some SV prevention programs target only men and boys (e.g., <italic>Men Can Stop Rape, </italic>www.mencanstoprape.org; <italic>The Men’s Program, </italic>www.oneinfourusa.org), many programs, particularly those for adolescents, include both sexes in the intervention. These programs often address known risk and protective factors for SV; however, as our review has demonstrated, this literature has predominantly been obtained from studies of male samples. We do not discourage the inclusion of men and women in the same prevention interventions, as this strategy has proven effective and mutually beneficial for some programs (e.g., <italic>Safe Dates</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1524838012470031">Foshee et al., 2004</xref>). However, without an evidence base that supports the comparability of risk factors for men and women, the justification for the universal application of these programs is unclear. As mentioned above, the four groups highlighted as in need of further study are those that were underrepresented in our review. </p>

         <title>Limitations</title>
         <p>Our review was limited in several ways: First, our exclusion criteria produced a select subset of the SV risk or protective factor research that was most relevant to primary prevention of perpetration. Rigorous work on other levels of prevention (e.g., risk factors for SV recidivism) has been completed but was not a focus of this review. Further, we did not examine the risk factors for sexual victimization due to our focus on the prevention of perpetration. Second, the results provide a snapshot of the amount of research for each factor, but the quality issues we encountered suggest all results should not be equally weighted. Because our goal was to be inclusive of multiple factors, we did not pursue a meta-analysis, as the data needed for this analysis was not found in many of the studies. However, only a meta-analysis could provide information about the robustness of the association between SV and the factors. Third, due to the cross-sectional nature of most studies, causal links between the factors and SV could not be established, meaning that preventing one of these risk factors may not necessarily influence SV perpetration. Fourth, while we included numerous articles on factors associated with SV, it is inevitable that our search may have failed to detect some relevant articles, particularly those that did not use our keyword search terms or that were not indexed in the databases we searched. Finally, for quality purposes we selected only published articles or reports to ensure that all studies had been subjected to some level of peer review; this process excluded other potential sources of information, such as foundation reports and dissertations.</p>

         <title>Implications for Prevention</title>
         <p>Our review has several implications for SV prevention, including considerations in translating etiological research into practice. In order for the factors we identified to be useful in preventing SV, they must be able to impact changes in SV, they must be targeted at key times in development, and they must be modifiable. Due to the cross-sectional designs used in the majority of the studies we reviewed, we have only scant evidence of what factors precede SV and thereby can reasonably be expected, if changed, to subsequently impact SV. Therefore, prevention strategies that target many of the risk and protective factors we reviewed may or may not influence SV behaviors. </p>
         <p>The methods of our review also provided little information about which factors are most strongly associated with SV, leaving it unclear which factors should be prioritized in prevention. The multiple interactions we identified and some differences in factors between adolescent and adult samples suggest that some of the factors may be activated in the presence of other factors or only salient at certain developmental phases. For example, alcohol use was significantly associated with SV only in adult samples, suggesting adolescence may be a key time for primary prevention efforts targeting alcohol use, SV, or the intersection of the two. This observation, in addition to the multiple significant factors we identified, suggests programs must be comprehensive, appropriately and developmentally timed, and should reflect the breadth of factors associated with SV. </p>
         <p>The factors that have been examined in different age groups and samples provide clues about the predominant theories employed by the practitioners who work with these groups. For example, the majority of collegiate studies examined at least one gender-based cognition suggesting feminist theory may be a foundation for much SV prevention or research on college campuses. However, some of the consistently supported risk factors we identified, such as suicide attempts/self-harm, may be inconsistent with or omitted from some SV theories in practice. That significant risk factors are inconsistent with theory does not negate their effects, but challenges the field to expand preexisting conceptualizations of SV to include the multiple factors across levels of the social ecology that increase risk for perpetration. Advancing SV prevention may require revisiting or expanding traditional theories and developing inclusive models of risk and prevention that are widely applicable. Additionally, an overarching theory or framework may be needed that incorporates factors associated with SV across different developmental phases, as well as factors at multiple levels of the social ecology. As mentioned before, the Confluence Model provides an example of the explanatory power gained from a multitheory approach. However, it has been over 15 years since the Confluence Model was supported in a 10-year study, and at the time of this writing this work has not been translated into a cohesive prevention program or strategy. The existence of risk factor research, such as the Confluence Model, that could be but is not being used in programming, suggests the need to reduce the time lag that typically occurs in translating research into practice. </p>
         <p>Our review also underscores the need to develop comprehensive SV prevention programs that target multiple, interacting risk and protective factors in comprehensive, behaviorally relevant ways. While many rape prevention psychoeducational programs attempt to change multiple risk and protective factors in one to two hours (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1524838012470031">Gidycz et al., 2001</xref>), it is unlikely that this strategy for presenting such complex information in a single session will result in lasting behavior change, as the complexity of the factors associated with SV suggests skills training may be needed to change entrenched behaviors and attitudes and prevent SV. As the factors we reviewed demonstrate, SV risk is a confluence of developmental antecedents, peer influences, attitudes, sexual behaviors, and relationship factors. Therefore, comprehensive SV prevention must be of sufficient dosage and delivered in such a way as to allow participants to learn and incorporate the skills and knowledge to prevent violence across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr184-1524838012470031">Nation et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, current prevention approaches tend to focus primarily on change at the individual level and typically fail to change the broader systems that may facilitate and maintain SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr227-1524838012470031">Swift &amp; Ryan-Finn, 1995</xref>), which may account for these programs failing to demonstrate evidence of effectiveness in reducing SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012470031">Breitenbecher, 2000</xref>). </p>
         <p>Taken together, our review suggests that while some additional risk and protective factor research is needed, particularly at the outer levels of the social ecology, and some methodological limitations need to be addressed, the existing SV literature and that of other areas (e.g., youth violence, sexual health) provide a strong foundation for improving primary prevention efforts. A number of issues must be considered in translating this research into practice, including the nature of the association between the factors and SV, accurately operationalizing research factors into prevention targets, understanding the modifiability of factors, considering the appropriate time for intervention, and fostering theoretical flexibility and ingenuity.</p>
         <p>This review sought to summarize risk and protective factors associated with SV and serve as a resource to practitioners developing and implementing comprehensive SV prevention programs. To date, very few programs have shown an impact on SV behavior and effective SV prevention is sorely needed. By targeting the modifiable factors that are most consistently associated with SV perpetration at appropriate developmental periods and applying knowledge gained from other fields, existing programs potentially can be strengthened and new prevention strategies can be developed. The resulting efforts to prevent SV may have greater impact in stopping violence before it begins.</p>

These authors found that more conservative gender role norms and accepting attitudes toward domestic violence at the community level did not predict SV perpetration against intimate partners by individual men in the community when accounting for other factors. The use of only three items with unknown reliability and validity per index to assess these constructs may have limited their ability to identify effects in this study; however, the authors did detect significant effects of community norms regarding domestic violence on physical (but not sexual) abuse of a partner. </p>

                     <p>History of CSA victimization was associated with SV perpetration by males and females in high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470031">Borowsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1524838012470031">Lodico, Gruber, &amp; DiClemente, 1996</xref>) and college samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-1524838012470031">Loh &amp; Gidcyz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr252-1524838012470031">White &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>). However, the relationship between CSA victimization and SV perpetration may vary by gender and tactics used. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524838012470031">Anderson, Kontos, and colleagues (2005)</xref> reported that female college students who reported SV perpetration were <italic>less</italic> likely to have a history of CSA victimization than nonperpetrating women.

                     <p>CSA victimization was also related to SV perpetration in three adult community samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1524838012470031">Knight &amp; Sims-Knight, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1524838012470031">Krahé et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1524838012470031">Lim &amp; Howard, 1998</xref>), though two other studies found no direct relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012470031">Abbey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1524838012470031">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>).

However, risk may vary by characteristics of the athlete and sport. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1524838012470031">Humphrey and Kahn (2000)</xref> found that risk of SV perpetration was higher for members of “high-risk” athletic teams, which were recognized by other students as having parties which created atmospheres conducive to SV but not for athletes on “low-risk” teams. Also, college athletes playing high-profile team sports, such as football, reported significantly more SV than athletes involved in less prominent sports, such as tennis and track/field, or nonathletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1524838012470031">Gage, 2008</xref>).

These mixed results may be an artifact of the comparison groups used in these studies. For example, most studies of adjudicated samples utilized nonsexual violent and nonviolent comparison groups. These results suggest that young sex offenders compared to young violent or nonviolent offenders report comparable or less delinquency and conduct problems. This pattern of effects could reflect the different types of offenses sex and nonsex offenders commit and the overlap between these offenses and the criteria for delinquency and conduct disorder. For example, only one criterion for conduct disorder involves sexual behavior, whereas multiple criteria involve non-SV or property offenses.</p>

                     <p>In addition to direct effects, among Asian American college men, the effect of loss of face on SV was moderated by rape myth acceptance, such that men who reported loss of face, or a belief that acting in certain ways (e.g., criticizing, asking questions) will make others feel uncomfortable, and who reported rape myth acceptance, were more likely to report SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1524838012470031">Hall et al., 2000</xref>).

However, other work has shown loss of face can function as a protective factor or a risk factor depending on one’s peer group norms. Rape myth acceptance also interacted with casual attitudes about sex for male and female aggressors, such that men with high endorsement of a composite variable that included rape myth acceptance, and women with very low endorsement of the composite, who also reported casual sexual attitudes, were more likely to report SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr256-1524838012470031">Yost &amp; Zurbriggen, 2006</xref>).

               <p>We defined the relationship level as those factors that occur in the context of a defined relationship between the perpetrator and his or her family, peers, or intimate partners. In the majority of the studies, relationship-level factors were measured through self-report surveys completed by the participant. Rarely did studies employ multiple-measurement models in which both the participant and his or her family, intimate partner, or peers completed relationship indices. We acknowledge the use of only individual self-report data to measure relationship characteristics is problematic from a conceptual level, and method invariance may account for some of the results. Without true relationship-level data, it is not possible to parcel out the unique contribution of the individual’s relationships above and beyond individual characteristics. However, because the factors included here reflect the nature of the individual’s relationships and may be addressed through preventive interventions aimed at changing these relationship characteristics or the behavior of people other than the perpetrator (e.g., parents at risk for child maltreatment), we opted to consider these factors as facets of one’s family, peer, and intimate partner relationships rather than personal characteristics. </p>
