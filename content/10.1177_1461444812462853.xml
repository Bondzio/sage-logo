<abstract>
<p>While media studies have been locked into a classic producer-text-audience model, most theories of social media suggest some degree of collapse between the producer and audience. In this article, we address social media in terms of processes of value creation. The aim of the article is to demonstrate that social media are either addressed in terms of economic and socio-political value creation, that is, power, exploitation and business revenues, or in terms of value creation as sense-making, that is, creative explorations of the self and management of social relationships in everyday life. These different interests in value creation, we argue, have consequences for the conceptualization of the media user as a participatory agent. With specific focus on the notion of value creation in social media, we uncover implicit conceptions of the social media user guiding industry and user-centric perspectives, respectively. We demonstrate that while studying the same phenomenon, the two perspectives operate with very different conceptions of the producer/user nexus. We then discuss whether the literature is inconsequential in the analytic treatment of its own suggested collapse by questioning if, and if so how, this collapse is in fact taking place. Finally, we offer a mapping of the multifarious actor roles identified in the literature review to nuance the understanding of the producer/user nexus in social media and use it to identify and discuss possible opportunities for collapse and cross-fertilization of user-centric and industry perspectives in future studies of social media.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social media constitute a challenge to media studies. While media studies have held to a classic producer-text-audience model, most theories of social media suggest some degree of collapse or oscillation between producer and audience when users create content or when media professionals use productions and activities from the users as part of their media products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462853">Green and Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1461444812462853">Tapscott and Williams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1461444812462853">Van Dijck, 2009</xref>). Social media also challenge the idea of ‘text’ as an end-product. For companies, a text is a perpetual beta product, understood as an open development project; for users, it is something unfinished, emergent and always on the way to becoming something else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns, 2008</xref>: 21). Here we address this continuous building and extending of content in social media in terms of processes of value creation in order to clarify theoretically different understandings of the ‘user’ in social media. Our first aim is thus to contribute to a fuller establishment of social media theory.</p>
<p>Social media – and specifically the blurring of boundaries between producers and users – further allow for ‘opening up’ the traditional toolkits of media studies. These have been framed within the discipline’s sub-fields of production studies, text analysis and reception studies. Social media invite a reconsideration of how these sub-fields can be integrated both in theory and in research design and analysis.</p>
<p>Despite this opportunity for integration and cross-fertilization, actual analyses of social media seem coloured by either traditional media production and industry-centric perspectives or audience- and user-centric perspectives. Our second aim here is to demonstrate that social media are either addressed in terms of <italic>economic and socio-political value creation in an industry perspective</italic>, that is, power, exploitation and business revenues, or in terms of <italic>value creation as sense-making in a user-centric perspective</italic>, that is, creative explorations of the self and management of social relationships in everyday life. We argue that the different interests in value creation in these two perspectives immediately impact the conceptualization of the media user as a participatory agent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444812462853">2</xref></sup> After offering a definition of social media to ground the analytic object in question, we review two distinct bodies of literature, namely industry-centric and user-centric studies on user participation and usage patterns in social media. Focusing specifically on the notion of value creation in social media, we uncover assumptions and implicit conceptions of the user, as these guide industry- and user-centric perspectives on social media. We demonstrate that the two perspectives, while studying the same phenomenon, thus operate with very different conceptions of the producer/user nexus. Failing to recognize these differences risks inconsistencies in the analytic treatment of the suggested collapse between user and producer. By mapping these diverse actor roles, however, we both refine the understanding of the producer/user nexus in social media and identify opportunities for cross-fertilization of user-centric and industry-centric perspectives in future studies on social media.</p>

<sec id="section2-1461444812462853">
<title>Definition of social media</title>
<p>The notion of ‘social media’ is associated with new digital media phenomena such as blogs, social network sites, location-based services, microblogs, photo- and video- sharing sites, etc., in which ordinary users (i.e. not only media professionals) can communicate with each other and create and share content with others online through their personal networked computers and digital mobile devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd, 2008</xref>: 92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444812462853">Lüders, 2008</xref>). Three characteristics are commonly emphasized when theorizing social media.</p>
<p>Firstly, communication is de-institutionalized. Instead of relying on media companies delivering content and controlling channels of distribution, social media allow users to contribute to and filter the content that they find relevant, and to share it with audiences of their choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd, 2008</xref>: 27–34). Moreover, the internet enables a decentralized structure, giving a wealth of users, companies and institutions access to producing and disseminating content. De-institutionalization, however, is only partial: the ownership of the main internet access points remains centralized in the hands of just a few international media players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444812462853">Castells, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondly, the user is regarded as a producer. In tandem with de-institutionalization, labels such as ‘user-generated content’ and ‘user innovation’ celebrate ordinary users as active (even leading) participants in media production and distribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns (2008)</xref> offers the term ‘produser’ (a contraction of producer and user) to highlight this collapse, or hybridization, of producing and using social media.</p>
<p>Thirdly, communication is interactive and networked. Social media are fundamentally driven by interaction between users: rather than having fixed positions (as either producer or recipient), in interactive exchanges users constantly shift between production and reception modes. Moreover, social media users are typically connected in a networked structure. This structure is perhaps most obvious in services such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+, in which the public articulation of networks of affiliation is a preamble for engagement. As a consequence of de-institutionalization and users’ interactive and networked engagement with others in content production and distribution, the relationship between communicating parties in social media becomes more symmetrical and less hierarchical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444812462853">Lüders, 2008</xref>). Users are in direct contact with each other without an intermediary agent. Simultaneously, however, because the companies facilitating the ‘produsage’ through specific services have the power to structure the possibilities and patterns of communication in specific ways, different degrees of asymmetric power structures emerge between users, and companies.</p>
<p>This definition sketches an inherent double-sidedness in user participation and associated patterns and values of ‘produsage’ in social media: the user is simultaneously an empowered, productive agent, and a target for companies to exploit. To further nuance this understanding, we now show the two main perspectives for interpreting ‘value creation’ in the underlying assumptions and research interests of theories and studies on user participation – namely, a user-centric perspective and an industry-centric perspective.</p>

<title>User participation in user-centric studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1461444812462853">Van Dijck (2009)</xref> identifies audience studies’ long tradition of research into media use in terms of how users make sense of texts and incorporate these meanings into their everyday lives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444812462853">Livingstone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461444812462853">Schrøder et al., 2003</xref>). This focus on the text–user nexus as a process of sense-making is mirrored in the current research agenda of user-centric studies on social media and in the history of user studies within internet research. From pioneering early studies on computer-mediated communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462853">Baym, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444812462853">Markham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1461444812462853">Turkle, 1995</xref>) to contemporary research, the overarching focus has been to understand processes of sense-making concerning the self and social relationships through available media technologies. Here the value of social media use lies in the meanings that the users ascribe to their usage practices.</p>
<p>In user-centric studies, the user is conceptualized as a productive agent in at least three ways: (a) as someone who interacts and connects with fellow users, drawing from these relationships a sense of social belonging; (b) as someone who engages actively and sometimes creatively with technologies to express and explore their senses of self; (c) as someone using social media more instrumentally as a source of information and expertise in everyday life.</p>
<sec id="section4-1461444812462853">
<title>Sense-making as social belonging</title>
<p>Digital media have offered enhanced possibilities for connecting with likeminded strangers despite spatial and temporal dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812462853">Baym, 2010</xref>: 102; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444812462853">McKenna et al., 2002</xref>). A central line of inquiry in internet studies concerns relationship formation with likeminded strangers and how online social relationships are nurtured, whether these are defined in community or network terms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812462853">Baym, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1461444812462853">Wellman and Gulia, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>With longitudinal participant observation and interview methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462853">Baym (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444812462853">Kendall (2002)</xref>, among others, have studied specific online groups with regards to relationship development and management, and the development and continued negotiation of group norms and purposes over time. For example, Baym’s study of soap-opera fans in a newsgroup shows how the online group can develop an ethics of friendliness over time, that is, common rules for appropriate group social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462853">Baym, 2000</xref>: 138). These rules are informally constituted in communicative practice, including recognition, social sanctioning (e.g. giving someone ‘the cold shoulder’) or encouragement to change behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462853">Baym, 2000</xref>: 189).</p>
<p>Recent studies of blogs and Twitter have documented similar phenomena in the conversational practices among strangers sharing common interests. To manage interaction, users negotiate norms of relevance, appropriate behaviour and ethics of privacy protection. These norms assist in the development of social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444812462853">Kendall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444812462853">Lomborg, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444812462853">2012</xref>). Moreover, the emergence and proliferation of social network sites has shifted research from a primary focus on the relationships among strangers to an increasing focus on how already established social relationships and groupings are expressed and negotiated both online and offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1461444812462853">Wellman and Gulia, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding actor roles, this type of study commonly distinguishes between different modes of engagement in relation to membership in <italic>specific</italic> groups or networks within the social media environment. The very active and densely networked users are labelled ‘insiders’; ‘newbies’ are the new users learning how to behave in a certain community or genre; and ‘lurkers’ are those who read, for example, a blog or a newsgroup but never contribute and thus remain an unknown audience at the boundary of group membership, solely reflected in site statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462853">Baym, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444812462853">Lomborg, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Sense-making as ‘writing oneself into being’</title>
<p>Early scholars of online identity stressed the online self as increasingly playful, fragmented and distributed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1461444812462853">Turkle, 1995</xref>) while, in recent years, many voices critical of the early studies’ emphasis on liberation and empowerment of the self online have argued for a need to ground identity performances in practices and relationships from offline contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444812462853">Robinson, 2007</xref>). A focus on continuity between online and offline expressions of self has become particularly important with digital genres such as social network sites, in which people connect with people they already know and thus are highly constrained by the audiences’ pre-existing impressions of who they are.</p>
<p>Many studies on self-presentation online have invoked theories on facework and impression management to describe how users adjust their self-presentation to their peers online (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444812462853">Donath, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812462853">Ellison et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444812462853">Robinson, 2007</xref>). In her research on youth and social network sites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd (2008)</xref>, inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461444812462853">Sundén (2003)</xref>, has framed self-presentation online as ‘writing oneself into being’ to describe how establishing online presence requires people to represent themselves to an audience by constructing profiles on social network sites, blogs, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462853">boyd, 2008</xref>: 128–130). Along similar lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444812462853">Liu (2007)</xref> understands social network profiles as taste performances, given the various types of personal information and interests (i.e. cultural preferences) that users can fill out to present themselves in their personal profiles on sites such as Facebook.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444812462853">Lüders’ (2007)</xref> study of mediated practices among Norwegian youth argues that creative desires are inherent to mediated practices and play a significant role in individual users’ everyday lives. Being in mediated spaces is fundamentally creative, argues Lüders, in that participants ‘tell stories through a multitude of expressive forms’, for example blog posts, photos, and more private instant messaging (IM) and email communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444812462853">Lüders, 2007</xref>: 163). A need for recognition grounds these creative expressions and contributes to the user’s self-development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444812462853">Lüders, 2007</xref>: 167–170). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444812462853">Livingstone (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444812462853">Lundby (2008)</xref> offer similar analyses of digital storytelling practices as self-expression. In some studies, creativity is explicitly linked to ideas of empowerment and citizenship through claims that social media ‘give voice’ to ordinary people and thus may have a democratizing function (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1461444812462853">Thumin, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1461444812462853">
<title>Sense-making as gratification: instrumental uses of social media</title>
<p>While studies of social relationships and self-exploration provide rich accounts of how social media may be used for making sense of self and the social world, they primarily describe social media from the perspective of very active, contributing users. However, much use of social media is better characterized in terms of ‘reading’, ‘surfing’, ‘looking up’ or simply ‘lurking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812462853">Wagman, 2010</xref>). In fact, research has continuously demonstrated that these more mundane and less demanding usage patterns are by far the most prevalent. To explain sense-making and the values of these social media uses, we must turn to studies that take their point of departure in actual users and their everyday lives and needs and motivations for going online.</p>
<p>In their survey-based study on the uses and gratifications of Facebook and IM among American college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444812462853">Quan-Haase and Young (2010)</xref> found that the primary usage pattern was pastime activity. Users reported procrastination, ‘goofing off’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812462853">Wagman, 2010</xref>), entertainment and relaxation to be primary motivations for using Facebook and IM, providing ‘a form of escape from everyday pressures and responsibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444812462853">Quan-Haase and Young, 2010</xref>: 358). Sociability and self-expression were reported among the additional reasons for using social media.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444812462853">Meyen et al. (2010)</xref> propose a typology of degrees of involvement and media competency of internet use in Germany, understood in terms of cultural and social capital. Some users (‘the virtuosi’, ‘the addicts’) are always online, and their different uses of the internet (information seeking, sociability, gaming, etc.) are seamlessly integrated into both their professional and leisure activities. Other user groups use the internet for specific purposes, for example in a professional context (‘the professionals’), in relation to special interests, such as fandom or politics (‘the aficionados’), and the maintenance and coordination of social activities with friends in everyday life (‘the companions’). Lastly, there are groups of internet-sceptical users with very limited use of and interest in the internet. The uses of these groups are very instrumental: the internet is solely a means to a concrete end such as banking or looking up information (‘the cautious’), or to keep in touch with relatives across geographical distances (‘the affiliated’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444812462853">Meyen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Bakardjieva’s interviews with domestic internet users in Canada result in a different typology, as defined by degrees of involvement with fellow users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812462853">2005</xref>). Her continuum ranges from individual, isolated consumption of digitized goods and services (information-oriented use, similar to the instrumental usage patterns described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444812462853">Meyen et al. (2010))</xref> to community-oriented uses and experiences of the internet for users who blend sociability, social support and collaborative knowledge creation with informational uses.</p>
<p>These tentative typologies of users and gratification patterns make clear that the creative, active self – as described in studies of creative play and storytelling in self- presentation online and in studies of high levels of contribution and commitment to sustaining social relationships in interest-based communities – may be obscuring a more instrumental perspective on social media use in everyday life. Coordinating mundane social activities, keeping in touch with friends and family and information-oriented uses of social media may constitute more common instrumental approaches to social media. Further, looking up information and seeking expertise to solve problems may demand less active contribution from the user, but these activities nonetheless demonstrate how social media may attain value for users in everyday life.</p>
<p>This review thus raises the following question: What kind of actor appears in a user-centric perspective on value creation as sense-making? If we emphasize various degrees of interaction and modes of engagement, including instrumental and goal-oriented, relationship-oriented and creative self-explorative engagements, then the social media user, from a user-centric perspective, is conceptualized as a quite competent and often highly active and reflexive agent who uses social media to make sense of self and social relationships.</p>
<p>Studies on relationships and sociability share the conception of the media user as a socially engaged actor whose media competence is primarily defined by abilities to act in accordance with a group of peers. In terms of values, interaction with peers adds to the experience of belonging (e.g. social support). In studies on self-representation and online identity, social media users are conceived of as creative actors who find value in using digital media as tools for shaping, exploring and developing themselves, sometimes in innovative ways. While less prone to celebrating the empowering, creative and democratizing aspects of social media use, studies describing mundane instrumental uses of social media for accessing relevant information provide an understanding of the user as actively and selectively choosing to seek and find specific gratification online, if only through reading. This creates an image of the social media user who, while not producing content, remains an agent in control, mastering social media for information, social relationships and self-expression in everyday life.</p>

<title>User participation in industry-centric studies</title>
<p>In contrast with user-centric studies, industry-centric studies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461444812462853">3</xref></sup> of media do not characterize ‘value creation’ as intrinsically motivated sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444812462853">Benkler, 2006</xref>), but rather in terms of revenue increases or business improvements (including in some cases the capacity to fulfil public service obligations). Traditional media industry studies often focus on business models in which (new) media productions are situated in a value chain for the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444812462853">Küng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444812462853">Porter, 1990</xref>), with special emphasis placed on targeting a mass audience (users, viewers, listeners or readers) through different cross-media strategies. User participation often serves as an add-on to traditional media platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444812462853">Bechmann, 2009</xref>). Internet media companies, on the other hand, often focus on creating a business model through a special (niche) service or a critical mass of users, so that the companies can either be sold to a bigger company (e.g. Google or Apple), create potential for larger investments in the company (venture capital) or use the mass users to gain advertising income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444812462853">Kauffman and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1461444812462853">Wirtz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The mass audience was and still is the potential income model for most traditional and new media industries, such as the film, broadcast, printing press, publishing, game, search and social media industries. The global reach of the internet still creates the potential of a mass audience across borders as the sum of specific targeted niche audiences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812462853">Anderson, 2007</xref>) or as an even larger international mass audience (e.g. Facebook, iTunes and Google Search). From an industry-centric perspective, the personalization of media through user participation, as suggested in the review of user-centric studies, therefore serves as a tool to create mass user markets and thus economic value (be it fees, advertising, venture capital or acquiring of companies).</p>
<p>Since the mid 1990s, the focus of the media industry has slowly shifted from a usage pattern where users are considered as solely a source of sales (products or services) and targeting ‘eyeballs’ to a more diverse value creation pattern where the user interactively participates in different degrees with a company service. The literature has at least three perspectives on user participation as value creation for the industry: (a) value creation from user networking, updating and content contribution; (b) value creation as contributing to development and innovation; and (c) value creation from the user’s personal trail of information (profiling) that can be sold to advertisers.</p>

<title>Value creation from user networking, uploading and updating</title>
<p>For social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare, user participation is the central function of the service. Without it, the service would not have any economic value. ‘Value creation’ here means users inviting new users into the network (e.g. through ‘friending’) and thereby creating greater diversity and ‘newness’ in the content presented (e.g. in newsfeeds). This should lead to increased saleable user attention (‘eyeballs’), creating status updates, uploading content bits and making links to content outside the service, which both gives the users something to talk about and enhances fine-grained user profiling. Under the popular term ‘Web 2.0’, scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns, 2008</xref>) and industry consultants and journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444812462853">O’Reilly, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461444812462853">Surowiecki, 2004</xref>) suggest different ways for cloud companies to harvest ‘the collective intelligence’ of the users. Viewing user participation as ‘creative labor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462853">Green and Jenkins, 2009</xref>) is a common interpretation: social media companies then seek to facilitate and encourage this creativity in order to maintain user interest in their service.</p>
<p>Studies of how traditional media industries adopt user participation in their services discuss the same division of labour. However, this has lead to a great deal of opposition and failed cross-media initiatives focusing on user participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444812462853">Bechmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444812462853">Carpentier, 2003</xref>) or embracing user participation without changing the traditional understandings of work divisions and routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1461444812462853">Wardle and Williams, 2010</xref>). Media industry employees identify themselves as creative and thereby, in competition with the user, as creative labourers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444812462853">Bechmann, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444812462853">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444812462853">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444812462853">Keen, 2007</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444812462853">Jenkins (2006</xref>: 257) sees user participation as a supplement to professional labour rather than a competitor.</p>
<p>Jenkins thus points to how user participation can be seen as value creation for traditional media companies. Jenkins and Green (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462853">2009</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444812462853">Jenkins, 2006</xref>: 62) suggest value creation to be based on ‘lovemarks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444812462853">Roberts, 2006</xref>) or an affective economy, where consumer loyalty is the central value. Loyalty over time could then be exchanged to increased income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444812462853">Bechmann, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Value creation as development and innovation</title>
<p>A related industry perspective on value creation regards user participants as a central element in product development and innovation. Users contribute with links, ratings, content and updates, and further improve the core service through new tailor-made functions targeting individual or niche user needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1461444812462853">Von Hippel, 2005</xref>), interface enhancements such as iPhone applications, games (e.g. on Facebook), suggestions for new initiatives, or ‘simply’ as testers in perpetual beta versions of software (now standard in most cloud companies – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444812462853">Banks, 2002</xref>).

<title>Profiling as value creation</title>
<p>An important factor in value creation for media companies is the traffic, data or ‘digital dossier’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461444812462853">Solove, 2004</xref>: 2) that users create as participants in social media, both with and without their explicit attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444812462853">Elmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461444812462853">Rogers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1461444812462853">Van Couvering, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1461444812462853">2011</xref>). Millar describes data mining methods for companies as being either descriptive or predictive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444812462853">Millar, 2009</xref>: 106), where <italic>predictive data mining</italic> methods are of special relevance to value creation for the companies as they try to predict, on the basis of datasets collected, the behaviour, needs and wants of the users and serve content and advertisements accordingly. Social media services collect user data (e.g. age, gender, civil status, current location, the network of ‘friends’, etc.), as well as traffic on the website (click-through patterns) or related websites (through single sign-in, like, share functions or apps using the social graph seamless integration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462853">Zimmer, 2008</xref>). As internet companies diversify their services (e.g. Google) and open their interface to include third-party websites and applications through Open APIs (e.g. Facebook and Google), the resulting dataset becomes more complex and user profiling potentially more accurate. The mining not only focuses on behavioural targeting (i.e. as cookies monitor and save user behaviour – the original model for the search industry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462853">Zimmer, 2008</xref>), but also increasingly on personal targeting, where behavioural patterns are combined with patterns in, for example, login information, social network and interests, as Facebook exemplifies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444812462853">Bechmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1461444812462853">Van Couvering, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Profiling as value creation for the media industry encompasses users independently of their degrees of participation and engagement with social media (from lurkers to insiders and innovators), but the profiling becomes more accurate the more the users contribute information and content to the social media sites and the more they are willing to let the company use the information. User acceptance is given in online clickwrap agreements, and social media allows for additional privacy settings. However, these privacy practices have evoked great debate among scholars of law and ethics because the anonymity of the user remains at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462853">Zimmer, 2008</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444812462853">Millar, 2009</xref>: 108).</p>
<p>In sum, our review of user participation in an industry-centric perspective shows that the active user is a ‘tool’ for the companies to exploit in economic value creation (e.g. via advertising or outsourcing creative labour functions). While commons-based peer production does not follow traditional market logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444812462853">Benkler, 2006</xref>: 60), it nonetheless functions in market terms when facilitated by companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. In contrast to the user-centric perspective, the agent in control is therefore the company. The company facilitates the activation of the user in economic roles as ‘product improver’ (network enhancer, content provider, interface developer and tester, and interface/platform expander) and, at the same time, as a source of profiling with direct value for the company. Also unlike user-centric studies, user participation in an industry-centric perspective may both come from end-users and other companies acting in, for example, the social network site.</p>

<title>Different kinds of ‘value’, different actor roles?</title>
<p>We have now seen critical differences between user-centric and industry-centric studies of social media regarding the conceptions and implicit assumptions underlying actor roles and value creation. Most briefly, ‘value creation’ refers (respectively) to either (a) the value creation of users as active, sense-making agents shaping and managing the social realities of everyday life, and/or (b) the economic value creation for companies facilitated by the user as a ‘tool’.</p>
<p>These different perspectives on actor roles and value creation thus raise two critical questions: Given the identification of such distinct value creation patterns in relation to differing actor roles, (a) is it then reasonable to claim a theoretical collapse of production and usage, and (b) is such a claim analytically fruitful? When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns (2008)</xref>, among others, talks about a collapse of roles, his perspective is primarily how the industry can make – and has made – use of user production patterns to create revenue through different patterns of ‘feeding, helping, harvesting, and hijacking the hive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns, 2008</xref>: 31–33). This coheres with Jenkins and Green’s idea that industry and users need to negotiate a new ‘moral economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462853">2009</xref>), where the negotiation of roles is central. From a user-centric perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444812462853">Baym (2011)</xref> argues that user studies largely seem to ignore a possibly relevant institutional and commercial perspective, that is, how user data is mined across sites and exploited for commercial gain for media companies such as Facebook and Google. While this issue has been explored theoretically in terms of exploitation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444812462853">Mørck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1461444812462853">Van Dijck, 2009</xref>), empirical studies of social media use have yet to integrate this dimension (see also Fuchs and Dyer-Witheford, this issue). This integrative scope, however analytically useful, is also formulated to fertilize user-centric studies, not to collapse the industry- and user-centric perspectives altogether.</p>
<p>One could therefore question whether the collapse prominent in the literature is in fact a collapse. Instead, it might be more usefully be framed in terms of an opening towards cross-fertilization, while preserving the two distinct perspectives of the user and the industry as key actors. We suggest that cross-fertilization in social media analysis can usefully begin by considering whether and how the two perspectives can complement and contextualize each other in specific analyses.</p>
<p>Rather than asking if some usage patterns create more value for the users and for the industry, we find it productive to explore and systematize different forms of value inherent in different usage patterns in social media. Are there any gaps that warrant future research? Are there any overlaps in the usage patterns studied? If so, how can industry- and user-centric studies of specific usage patterns cross-fertilize and possibly be integrated in a study set-up?</p>
<p>To get an overview of potential overlaps and differences, we mapped usage patterns and foci in the two perspectives, using Facebook – and the different usage patterns and actor roles within this service – as a heuristic example (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812462853">Table 1</xref>). We focus on one specific social network site to allow for sensitivity to the role of the company as a certain kind of (economic) facilitator for sense-making in user production. The resulting mapping allows us to identify possible overlaps in the types of usage patterns under study in the two bodies of research, in spite of their different conceptions of actor roles and logics of value creation. The model is a simplification of actual relations between usage patterns and actor roles as identified in the literature. Distinct actor roles, for instance the ‘user as entertainment-seeker’, are not bound to one specific usage pattern but may be present in various forms in all the different usage patterns.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812462853">Table 1</xref> summarizes and positions different contributions to understanding the roles of the user in both user-centric and industry-centric social media studies. Using a scale of participation to denote different degrees of participation in Facebook (the left-hand column), it is possible to locate different studies according to the usage patterns that they are most concerned with, and the conception of the user emerging from their focus. The classification is by no means exhaustive and should be considered a heuristic tool to flesh out the multifarious actor roles discussed in the two bodies of literature and to identify overlapping interests and gaps between them.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812462853">Table 1</xref> shows, there are clear overlaps between the interests of user- and industry-centric studies in some usage patterns, for instance ‘Connecting with friends and expanding personal networks’. However, the conception of the user in the user-centric and industry-centric studies of connecting with friends differs. <italic>Hence, arguably, no actual collapse is taking place</italic>. With the concrete example of connecting with friends and expanding personal networks on Facebook, the user is conceived, from the user-centric perspective, as a member of a social group and, from the industry-centric perspective, as an important target audience for advertisers buying advertising space from Facebook as a company. These two perspectives must function as context for each other, highlighting that they are in fact two sides of the same usage pattern. What – from the ordinary user’s perspective – is value creation in terms of social belonging is – on the flip side – economic benefit and thus value to Facebook.</p>
<p>There are similar possibilities for cross-fertilization of perspectives in the user pattern ‘Creating status updates, likes, comments and so forth’. Here, the user-centric perspective advances an understanding of the user as an expressive and creative actor, engaged in making sense of self by creatively writing themselves into being. At the same time, this user is a productive agent in an industry-centric perspective. When users provide content, Facebook arguably becomes more attractive: those who already participate may be less inclined to leave the service, and new users may be encouraged to join because Facebook provides valuable information regarding one’s social network. Accordingly, Facebook thrives on making its users want to post status updates, share photos, play games, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, there are overlapping interests in terms of users ‘Creating profiles’ and ‘Visiting Facebook’. Whereas, in a user-centric perspective, these usage patterns may be described in terms of gratification, the very same user activities, in an industry-centric optic, are valuable because they pave the way for fine-grained profiling and personal targeting.</p>
<p>Clearly, all these usage patterns and their inherent double-sidedness have implications in terms of privacy issues, including the degree of control over personal information. The power relations between end-users and facilitating companies are complex and ambiguous in social media, but much more asymmetrical than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444812462853">Lüders (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462853">Bruns (2008)</xref> seem to acknowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1461444812462853">Terranova, 2000</xref>). For instance, when users participate more actively, Facebook can perform more fine-grained profiling. This asymmetric power relationship is particularly evident in discussions of privacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444812462853">Gross and Acquisti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461444812462853">Solove, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462853">Zimmer, 2008</xref>), in which the autonomy of the users and the transparency of how, for example Google and Facebook, make use of user-entered and user-produced data in their business are the main focus points. Indeed, privacy may prove a useful focus for cross-fertilizing user- and industry-centric perspectives in empirical analysis.</p>
<p>There are usage patterns not covered by both perspectives. The mapping in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812462853">Table 1</xref> suggests that patterns of innovation in terms of creating applications, games, and so on, are a niche interest for the economically oriented industry perspective. However, lead users or innovators should be of interest to a user-centric perspective too, especially considering that user-centric studies broadly subscribe to the idea of social shaping of technology, implying that usage patterns and technology and design mutually shape and constrain each other over time (for elaborations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812462853">Bakardjieva, 2005</xref>). Although some studies have explicitly analysed how, over time, user practices shape and alter the design of services such as Twitter (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444812462853">boyd et al., 2010</xref>), more research dealing with this issue is needed. Furthermore, research is needed that examines the intrinsic motivations, meanings and gratifications tied to user-driven innovation in social media. A possible explanation for the lack of user-centric research explicitly aiming at understanding user-driven innovation could be the tendency for user-centric studies of sense-making (and its ancestral discipline, audience studies) to conceptualize user agency and creativity as tied to the relation between user and media content. Whereas the industry-centric perspective grasps creativity and innovation in multiple dimensions (content, personal data and software), the software level may constitute a specific challenge for user-centric studies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1461444812462853">Table 1</xref> finally suggests that specific usage patterns are well studied in the two bodies of literature. Both perspectives are rich on accounts of very active uses of social media, including participation through networking and content creation. Other usage patterns and modes of engagement – perhaps especially less visible patterns of engagement, as associated with lurking and information-oriented uses, as well as the flip side of personal targeting – seem under-researched in both perspectives. Framed critically, this might suggest that social media research primarily focuses on what is readily and easily available and observable. More research is needed that deals with patterns and meanings of reading social media without engaging in interaction with peers through content creation. More research is also needed concerning the traces left by all users regardless of their degree of engagement and of how they are data mined for personal targeting by companies such as Google and Facebook.</p>

<title>Conclusion: a ‘360-degree media analysis’</title>
<p>By identifying two different perspectives in studies on user participation – (a) value creation as sense-making and (b) value creation as economic revenue – we have argued that the literature is inconsistent in its analytical treatment of the suggested collapse of users and producers. We have attempted to clarify this discussion by pointing to the possibility of cross-fertilization between the two perspectives, recognizing and by making explicit the different perspectives on value creation and actor roles that are the focus of the study and incorporating the ‘other’ perspective as a contextual framing.</p>
<p>Through a mapping of <italic>different</italic> actor roles in user participation, with a focus on usage patterns, we have pointed to blind spots in social media research as well as overlapping interests in specific usage patterns, inviting cross-fertilization and integrative analysis while retaining the dual perspective on value creation.</p>
<p>One possible approach for integrative analysis incorporating both industry- and user-centric perspectives of a given social media service could be what we label a ‘<italic>360-degree media analysis</italic>’ – an analysis that actively addresses the different interests and underlying assumptions of value creation guiding the participating users and the company making the service available for them. Rather than entailing a theoretical and analytical collapse between producers and users, a 360-degree media analysis includes the two distinct perspectives in the same study without turning to one specific interest. Such a study would be more exhaustive, but has yet to be carried out.</p>

<p>We recognize that ‘value creation’, in the English-speaking world, is typically used in economic discourse. We use it here, however, as an overarching term for describing different forms of ‘value’ – either for users (value creation as sense-making) or media companies (value creation as business revenue). In this way, value creation refers to the ambiguity of ‘user participation’ that we aim to illustrate.</p>
