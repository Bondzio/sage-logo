<p>In <italic>Cop Watch</italic>, Hans Toch uses a series of historical events to document confrontations between police officers, citizens, and the media in three American cities in order to explore how these confrontations have led to various reactions and police reforms. He is particularly concerned with the actions and responses of the spectators of these confrontations, which he calls “the chorus.”</p>
<p>Toch refers to the first city that he deals with as “West Coast City.” He utilizes interviews with police offers to detail the contentious relationship between officers and the African American community in West Coast City from 1967 to 1971, explaining the chorus’ concerns about unfairness of police interventions and police brutality, and the resistant reaction of the West Coast City police officers to reforms aimed at encouraging community policing. Toch continues his work by detailing events which took place in Seattle from 2010 to 2011 in an effort to explain how technological advancements, like cell-phone video cameras and internet blogging, have expanded the chorus of spectators beyond those immediately present at the time of an altercation between officers and citizens. He explains how these advancements have influenced modern policing and encouraged continued reforms in policing toward more community-oriented policing. Finally, Toch turns to New York City in order to discuss the importance of stop-and-frisk policies for police/community relations. He discusses seminal Supreme Court decisions relating to the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk, as well as the consequences these decisions have had on racial profiling and citizen trust in police officers in general.</p>
<p>This book should interest anyone interested in relations between police officers and regular citizens, and anyone concerned with the media’s impact on the public’s perceptions of police conduct. The book should also appeal to those interested in historical accounts of police behavior and the changes in policing policies.</p>
