<abstract>
<p>Consultations related to asthma account for approximately 2–3% of GP encounters and 85% of asthma patients are managed solely in general practice. Uncontrolled asthma continues to be highly prevalent; in 2010 there were 1071 deaths from asthma in the UK. Exacerbations incur substantial costs to both the patient and the healthcare system. It is thus very important that all GPs and AiTs know how to manage acute asthma, are able to identify the ‘at risk’ patient and can arrange appropriate follow-up after acute exacerbations. This article aims to review current knowledge of acute asthma in adults, with an emphasis on management in a primary care setting according to the latest national guidelines.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738012468429"><title>Pathophysiology</title>
<p>Asthma is a heterogeneous condition with complex patterns of inflammation and allergy that can differ between patients and between attacks. Exposure to an allergen to which a patient is sensitised can trigger acute asthma, as can a wide range of respiratory infections. A recent study has shown that exposure to both an allergen and virus at the same time can result in synergistic responses and is a frequent precipitant of hospital admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1755738012468429">Green et al., 2002</xref>). It is also common for asthmatic patients to have allergic rhinitis; inflammation of the nasal mucosa may worsen asthma control and contribute to an attack.</p>
<p>During an exacerbation IgE responses cause airway inflammation with mucus plugging of the small airways, bronchial hyper-reactivity and bronchospasm. These processes result in airways obstruction and, in severe cases, can precipitate respiratory failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738012468429"><title>Risk factors for acute severe asthma exacerbation</title>
<p>Case control studies have revealed that adverse behavioural and psychosocial factors are major determinants of asthma mortality (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012468429">Box 1</xref>). These factors are at least as important as the disease-related factors indicative of severe asthma (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738012468429">Box 2</xref>) (British Thoracic Society (BTS)/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1755738012468429">SIGN), 2012</xref>).

<p>It has been recommended that an ‘at risk’ asthma register could be devised in general practices to identify patients more likely to die from asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1755738012468429">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>). Such a register would need to be tailored to each practice and would include a subset of patients drawn from the practice’s general asthma register, selected on the basis of meeting certain criteria such as those outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012468429">Boxes 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738012468429">2</xref>. In addition, all patients attending hospital for an asthma exacerbation would be entered on to the ‘at risk’ register, as would those on more than three classes of asthma medication. Other criteria can be tailored according to the clinicians’ knowledge of their patient; for example, patients known to come from chaotic households may be included if there is a known risk of treatment non-concordance. Patients on the ‘at risk’ register should have an alert attached to their electronic records. This ensures that all primary care health professionals, including reception staff, are aware of their status and can prioritise appointments and provide access to urgent clinical assessment on request. A system could also be implemented to ensure that these patients are contacted if they fail to attend follow-up. As practice nurses are involved in the day-to-day running of many primary care asthma clinics, they may have a key role in maintaining such ‘at risk’ registers.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that in young people in the UK (aged up to 44 years), there is a peak in asthma mortality during July and August. The reasons for this are not clear, although suggested explanations include exposure to fungal spores, treatment non-concordance and difficulties in accessing medical care during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012468429">Targonski et al., 1995</xref>). There is an additional mortality peak in older age groups in December and January, attributable to either viral infections or to miscoding of bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738012468429">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>). Similar trends in asthma mortality have been demonstrated in more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1755738012468429">Watson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738012468429"><title>Initial assessment</title>
<p>All personnel, including receptionists and out-of-hours staff, should take steps to ensure that asthmatic patients with respiratory symptoms are able urgently to access a doctor or nurse with appropriate training. Training in ‘red flags’ should be provided for front-line reception staff, so that they are able to screen for respiratory emergencies when a patient telephones the surgery or presents at the reception desk.</p>
<p>Key components of the initial assessment include a brief history and physical examination. History-taking should include questioning about the presence of wheeze, dyspnoea or cough, which often exhibit diurnal variation. Potential triggers, such as pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers, emotional upset, viral infections, exercise and use of some medications (e.g. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and beta<italic>-</italic>blockers) should be identified. The presence of any adverse behavioural and psychosocial factors should be elicited, as well as disease-related factors indicative of severe asthma (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012468429">Boxes 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738012468429">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The examination should incorporate measurement of routine vital signs, including pulse oximetry and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). PEFR is a simple, cheap and convenient measure of airway calibre in the acute setting. PEFR expressed as a percentage of the patient’s previous best value has most clinical utility; predicted values should only be used as a proxy measure if the previous best value is unknown. Oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) is used to determine severity of the exacerbation and the need for oxygen therapy.</p>
<p>During assessment one should be particularly alert to the presence of any features indicative of acute severe or life-threatening asthma. Clinical features that suggest a severe attack include severe breathlessness (including being too breathless to complete sentences in one breath), tachypnoea and tachycardia. Clinical features of a life-threatening attack include silent chest, cyanosis, accessory muscle use, altered consciousness or collapse. The presence of any of these symptoms should alert the healthcare provider to treat the attack as severe or life threatening. A summary of the features of acute asthma, and how these are graded by severity, is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738012468429">Table 1</xref>. Case study 1 illustrates an example of how a patient with acute asthma may be assessed.

<sec id="sec5-1755738012468429"><title>Differential diagnosis</title>
<p>Important differential diagnoses of acute asthma include pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and pneumothorax, and this should be borne in mind whilst carrying out the assessment. Anxiety-induced hyperventilation is another potential differential that can both resemble and coexist with acute asthma. In cases of hyperventilation the patient should be reassured and encouraged to avoid excessively rapid or deep breathing, particularly if they display symptoms of hypocapnia such as hand and lip tingling or carpopedal spasm.</p>
<p>Another differential that may be mistaken for acute asthma is vocal cord dysfunction (VCD). This is a poorly understood condition in which there is paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords. Laryngeal closure is a normal response to irritants, usually occurring only for a few seconds.</p>
<p>However, in VCD closure occurs more frequently and for prolonged periods, which can result in breathlessness and wheeze or stridor. Symptoms typically come on very rapidly and can resolve quickly, with a poor response to the bronchodilators and steroids that are often used to treat it. In suspected cases the patient should be referred to a specialist ear, nose and throat (ENT) or a ‘difficult asthma’ clinic for further investigation; VCD may be seen on flow-volume loops, where there is a flattened inspiratory loop or by laryngoscopy, but sensitivity is poor. Adopting a calm manner during an attack is important and, if the diagnosis has been established, asking the patient to focus on expiration with an ‘S’ sound may be helpful. Speech therapy is the mainstay of treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738012468429"><title>Management of acute asthma in adults in general practice</title>
<p>Treatment must be commenced as soon as the severity of the asthma exacerbation has been established. Supplementary oxygen should be administered urgently to hypoxaemic patients using a face mask, venturi mask or nasal cannulae, to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> values of 94–98%. Most general practice surgeries have oxygen cylinders available, although, as they tend to be infrequently used it is important to make sure that staff are familiar with their location and also that the cylinders are regularly checked to ensure they are in working order. Training in how to use the oxygen cylinders should be a part of mandatory annual basic life support training for all staff.</p>
<p>Patients with acute severe or life-threatening asthma should urgently receive nebulised beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist bronchodilators with oxygen given at a flow rate of 6 litres per minute. Oxygen-driven nebulisers are preferable, in view of the possibility of oxygen desaturation whilst using air-driven compressors. A high-flow regulator must be fitted if oxygen cylinders are used. If a nebuliser is not immediately available, it is equally effective to administer 10 puffs of a short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonist via a metred-dose inhaler (MDI) plus spacer, with concurrent delivery of oxygen by mask or nasal cannulae if required. Four puffs can be given initially, followed by a further two puffs every 2 minutes, up to a maximum of 10 puffs. Patients not improving despite treatment normally require admission to hospital. Patients who do respond to treatment can then go back to using their inhaled short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists one to two puffs as required, up to four times daily.</p>
<p>Nebulised bronchodilators are no more effective than those administered through large-volume spacers, but they have the advantage of being able to be used by healthcare providers to administer medications without needing patient input. If the patient is too unwell to use their inhalers they should normally be referred to hospital. Home nebulisers are not usually recommended, as they may encourage inappropriate self-treatment, although they may be helpful in rare situations where patients are unable to effectively use any inhalers.</p>
<p>Oral prednisolone 40–50 mg or parenteral hydrocortisone 100 mg should also be administered in all exacerbations of asthma, unless the exacerbation is classified as mild. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738012468429">Table 2</xref> demonstrates the management of asthma exacerbations, as determined by exacerbation severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1755738012468429">BTS/SIGN, 2012</xref>).

This usually necessitates an ambulance transfer because of the risk of deterioration en route to the hospital. Emergency treatment should be continued whilst waiting for the ambulance and a doctor or nurse should remain with the patient until arrival. The ambulance crew should be provided with a written referral letter that details the treatments already given.

<p>Patients with mild or moderate exacerbations may not require referral to hospital, but do still need management as outlined above to treat their exacerbation. This may include oral steroids and generally requires a review of usual asthma therapy (see Case study 2). Oral steroid treatment reduces mortality, relapse and admission rates and should be recommended in all acute asthma exacerbations, unless they are classified as mild. Oral prednisolone 40–50 mg should normally be given for 5 to 7 days or until the patient has recovered, along with his or her inhaled medications. Tapering the dose is not necessary after a short course.</p>
<p>Treatment compliance and inhaler technique should be reviewed and consideration given to increasing the patient’s regular medication, particularly if asthma control was poor prior to the exacerbation or if the patient is suffering repeated exacerbations. However, the dose of inhaled corticosteroids should not be increased as a substitute for oral prednisolone, as this strategy has been shown to be ineffective in treating asthma exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738012468429">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of antibiotics is controversial. Most exacerbations are not caused by bacterial infections and a recent Cochrane review found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend antibiotics for acute asthma exacerbations, although the review only identified two trials looking at 115 exacerbations that were suitable for inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738012468429">Graham et al., 2001</xref>). BTS guidelines state that the routine prescription of antibiotics for acute asthma is not recommended. It should be remembered that a productive cough does not necessarily indicate a bacterial infection, although it should alert the GP to the possibility of an alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia, particularly if there is fever.</p>
<p>If a patient has a mild or moderate exacerbation and improves sufficiently to be sent home from the practice, he or she will require a written asthma management plan (see below) that outlines what to do if they fail to improve or if their symptoms worsen. Early follow-up should be arranged a few days or up to a week later, depending on the patient and the severity of their exacerbation. Patients need to be aware that if their symptoms or PEFR worsen despite treatment they should seek medical attention sooner.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1755738012468429"><title>Follow-up after treatment and hospital discharge</title>
<p>An Adult Asthma Audit Report from the BTS identified that 9.5% of asthma admissions in September and October 2011 were readmissions from the previous month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1755738012468429">British Thoracic Society, 2011</xref>). It is therefore crucial that the patient’s general practice is notified after he or she has been discharged from the emergency department or hospital following an asthma exacerbation, so that the practice can arrange early follow-up with the aim of reducing readmission rates. Ideally, follow-up should be booked with the patient’s GP or asthma nurse within 2 working days of discharge, and with a hospital specialist asthma nurse or respiratory physician at 1 month post-admission for patients who required hospitalisation. A respiratory specialist should follow up patients admitted with severe asthma for at least a year after admission.</p>
<p>During follow-up it is important to make a comprehensive reassessment of asthma control. Patients often underestimate and under-report their symptoms, but a number of tools are available to help assess asthma control. One example is the Royal College of Physicians asthma control questionnaire, which provides a simple measure of asthma control (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1755738012468429">Box 4</xref>). The asthma control test (ACT) questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.qualitymetric.com/demos/TP_launch.aspx?SID=52461">www.qualitymetric.com/demos/TP_launch.aspx?SID=52461</ext-link>) is an alternative tool for patient self-assessment of disease control.

<p>Inhaler technique is often poor and deteriorates with time, so it should be checked frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1755738012468429">Virchow et al., 2008</xref>). Among the most common mistakes are inhaling too quickly with pressurised MDIs (where the drug is propelled by the inhaler) and inhaling too slowly on dry powder inhalers (where the drug must be aerosolised by the patient’s inspiration). Where multiple different inhalers are used these differences need to be explained. It may be necessary to change inhaler devices to suit the patient. It can also be beneficial to add a spacer to an MDI, as this improves lung deposition and reduces oral deposition of the drug, hence achieving better control at a lower drug dosage. Spacers also compensate for difficulties with inhaler technique, which may be encountered with MDIs.</p>
<p>Concordance with treatment should also be checked. A simple way of monitoring this is to check the frequency with which patients are collecting their prescriptions. Computerised records of repeat medications are in place in most practices, enabling doctors who authorise repeat prescription requests to see whether patients are over- or underusing their inhalers, and to invite patients in for a review of their asthma accordingly.</p>
<p>Finally, all patients should have a written asthma management plan as this can help to reduce readmission rates. Individualised action plans may be based on symptoms or PEFR measurements and should incorporate no more than two to four action points. PEFR-triggered action points should use personal best PEFR, rather than percent predicted values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1755738012468429">Gibson and Powell, 2004</xref>). Patients should be instructed regarding when and how to make medication adjustments and when to seek medical help. Instructions should also address how and when to use inhaled and oral corticosteroids. Customisable asthma management plans are available from a number of organisations involved in the care of asthma patients (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738012468429">Table 3</xref>). The key points of a follow-up consultation after an acute asthma exacerbation are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1755738012468429">Box 5</xref> and Case study 3 describes how this may be carried out in practice.

<td>Unfortunately, Mr Jones’ asthma deteriorated despite the treatment prescribed by his GP and he was admitted to hospital as an emergency. He improved with regular nebulisers and was ready to go home after 2 days. Before he was discharged his inhaler technique was assessed and was found to be optimal. He was also given a written asthma action plan and was advised to regularly monitor his PEFR. Assessment with the ACT revealed a score of 19, suggesting well-controlled asthma overall. He was advised to book a follow-up appointment with his GP in 3 days—this was also documented on his discharge summary, a copy of which was faxed to his GP practice. A follow-up appointment with the respiratory specialist was also arranged, as it had been less than 1 year since his previous admission. The importance of complying with medication and attending follow-up appointments was emphasised. In the event his symptoms should recur, Mr Jones was given clear instructions to contact his GP or the out-of-hours GP service if the surgery is closed, or in case of an emergency to call a 999 ambulance.</td>
