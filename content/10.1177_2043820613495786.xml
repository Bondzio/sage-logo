<p>This book offers a fantastically rich conceptual vocabulary for thinking through the tensed affective politics of life and endurance in contemporary liberal democracies. Elizabeth Povinelli provides a forensic analysis of the power of the discursive narratives and juridico-political formulations that both justify the ‘durative present’ (p. 3) of suffering and shape the distribution of harm and care in the affective tissue of ordinary experience. What emerges is a sustained and nuanced account of the persistence of different forms – and possible forms – of life within the constitutive texts and felt textures of what Povinelli calls ‘late liberalism’. Resisting the call of the will as a source of ethico-political agency, Povinelli seeks answers instead in scenes of the ordinary that show how forms of life are fashioned and assembled as gatherings of going-on. Crucially, these forms of life take place with just about enough consistency to matter without ever crossing the threshold of eventfulness that would see them incorporated either into discourses of the striving self or valorised as exemplars of a modest yet heroic resistance.</p>
<p>The introduction to the book has a heft generated by the necessity of laying-out and specifying the array of concepts that populate its pages. While unavoidable, the effect is dizzying, and I for one struggled at times to hold onto the relations and relays between these concepts, to the extent that about 30 pages through the 45-page introduction I began wondering how all these concepts would work together without adding up. That they do work so well is down to the remarkable skill with which Povinelli performs a scenographic storying of the ordinary as the locus through which to amplify the force of the arguments she develops. I read <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic> as a brilliant contribution to the on-going elaboration of a scenographic style of writing and thinking attuned to the promise and ethico-politics of contemporary affective life. It complements the work of other notable proponents of this style, including Kathleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613495786">Stewart (2007)</xref> and Lauren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613495786">Berlant (2011)</xref>. As with Stewart’s and Berlant’s writing, Povinelli’s is overfilled with perfectly pitched sentences and phrases that capture the circumstantial quality of shared forms of life. It is worth noting, however, that there are differences between how scenes work for each of these thinkers. For Stewart, they provide possibilities for attending to how the affective life of the ordinary coalesces around particular moments or gestures, while for Berlant, they are cases that exemplify the condition of cruel optimism as both a ‘personal and collective kind of relation’ (2011: 11). Like Stewart, Povinelli’s scenes are infused with the affective experience of worldly participation, and like Berlant’s, they are framed by a much wider discussion of the conceptual and political contexts in which they matter. The latter approach comes with two risks. The first is that the breadth of the frame can crowd out the details and nuance of the scene. A second and potentially greater risk is that scenes of the ordinary are asked to do too much work, and are therefore drained of life under the conceptual weight they bear. In <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic>, however, Povinelli manages to avoid both risks by deploying concepts as generative participants in storying the empirical details of the scenes about which she writes rather than frames of analysis that stand outside or above these scenes. And in doing so, she seeks to go some way towards closing the gap which figures in much critical thinking between those who write about ethical substance and those who <italic>are</italic> this substance. Put another way, Povinelli’s writing performs the relation of ethical co-substantiality that she foregrounds so starkly in the first pages of the book.</p>
<p>Where Povinelli’s scenes also succeed is in foregrounding how complex legal–political texts work to justify the persistence of ordinary, ‘chronic and cruddy’ suffering in late liberalism, while also elaborating the projects that reveal forms of persisting in – and despite – this suffering. That this suffering is largely invisible and increasingly normalised is due in part to the way it falls below the ethico-political event-horizon of the crisis or catastrophe that demands a response or intervention. On one level, this serves as a reminder of the familiar primacy of the spectacular as an index of emergency in the mediated politics of contemporary affective-economic life. But Povinelli’s analysis also poses wider questions about the role of event-centred politics in social theory, while also pointing to the limits of any critical ‘ethical impulse dependent on a certain kind of event and eventfulness’ (p. 4). Certainly, there is an implicit and necessary challenge in Povinelli’s account to the rather more heroic conception of the event that emerges, say, from the work of Alain Badiou. That is not to say that the concept of event disappears entirely from Povinelli’s thinking: rather, Povinelli is interested in foregrounding the ‘quasi-event’ as a generative spacing that gathers together the meaning and matter of suffering without precipitating anything like the sense of a wider crisis. This is rich and provocative stuff, although one might have asked here for a little more about the different formulations of an eventful politics or ethics that are at stake.</p>
<p>Certainly, the quasi-events in which Povinelli is interested, and in which she is sometimes a partial participant, are altogether more earthly than many other formulations of an event-centred ethics or politics. They are not celebrated here as revolutionary, nor are they affirmed as having the radical potential to disrupt systems or structures. They do not call attention to themselves as world shattering moments. They are about the actuality of persisting in potentiality while moving towards the possibility of an otherwise. In the process, Povinelli reminds us that the concept of potentiality as it figures in the work of philosophers such as Deleuze does not lead thinking out of this world in a form of quasi-mysticism. I am not sure, however, that Povinelli’s grouping of the various thinkers on page 106 in terms of how they affirm the infinite plasticity of potentiality over any sense of actuality is quite on the mark: there is not enough attention here to how the work of these thinkers is also informed by the ‘thick experience’ of their own and other projects. Nevertheless, there is an encouragement here to attend to the potentiality of living on as a kind of assembling or cobbling together of the materiality of worlds in the making. As such, there are important connections to be made between Povinelli’s discussion and recent work in human geography that emphasises different forms of improvised living and becoming otherwise in conditions that normalise suffering (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613495786">McFarlane, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613495786">2013</xref>). Equally, however, we might ask if Povinelli’s account is informed by a sufficiently nuanced sense of the state as a set of improvised projects and technical practices that work in parallel to and to some degree complicate the power of the juridico-political texts upon which Povinelli focuses much of her attention.</p>
<p>But there is another question that might be posed: what connects the scenes of persistence in Povinelli’s account? On one level, Povinelli’s answer to this question is straightforward – they exemplify particular conditions of life in late liberalism. Povinelli is careful to qualify her use of this latter term, and she is clear that it does not designate anything like an epoch or period. And yet I am not entirely convinced of the value of this category, no more than the other terms that occupy a place on Povinelli’s symphonic diagram of liberalism. Perhaps this is due to a residual suspicion on my part of the inflationary tendencies of these terms. The risk here is that different scenes become cases of something already recognised in advance, and the work of Povinelli’s ‘anthropology of the otherwise’ becomes a matter of adding local texture to this global category. But Povinelli is only too aware of the extent to which certain categories start to function as globalizing frames of reference through which to make sense of and connect diverse empirical and ethico-political circumstances: in this regard, she makes telling (if underdeveloped) remarks about the tendency on the part of critical thinkers to deploy Agamben’s notion of the camp in this way. These concerns about the category of late liberalism aside, however, Povinelli convincingly connects these scenes as demonstrations of the importance of attending to specific arrangements of potentiality as ‘the ethical substance of immanent critique’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>If the introduction to <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic> has a weight demanded by the arguments developed in the chapters that follow, the conclusion is altogether lighter and shorter. Perhaps because of this, I felt a little short-changed. I would like to have read more about how the affects of worldly participation make a difference to the shape and substance of immanent critique and to how it might be performed otherwise. But this should not necessarily detract from the fact that Povinelli’s book demonstrates the power of social and political theory in showing us how the affective tone and material configuration of life matters to the very way in which political economies become present. More than this, <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic> is a remarkable exemplification of how such theory can work as a critically animating influence in projects that pursue the possibilities of becoming otherwise in the tensed potentiality of the ordinary as it is lived.</p>
