<abstract>
<p>Analyzing media coverage of the men’s World Cup of soccer, this article explores the characterization of the United States relationship to this event as a form of national myth making. American journalists emphasized to their readers that the importance and meaning of the tournament domestically paled in comparison to that found outside its borders. Previous scholars have used the concept of “American exceptionalism” to interpret this type of media narrative as a reflection of the sport’s low cultural valence. Alternatively, the author argues that this characterization constitutes a form of “boundary-work” wherein American national identity could be specified in more concrete terms by representing the United States as both internally unified and different from all other nations through its ambivalence toward soccer.</p>

<title>U.S. Ambivalence Toward the World Cup and American Nationalism</title>
<p>Sociology of sport has developed a rich and vibrant literature on the indelible link between sport and nationalism. If we take national identity to be those imaginary bonds forged between members of a national community who can never expect to know each other through face-to-face interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511433861">Anderson, 1991</xref>), then there are few modern activities capable of providing such emotionally riveting opportunities for the collective representation and enactment of communal affinities. Given the preeminent role that mass media plays in both the formation of national communities and dissemination of international sporting events, it is not surprising that this well-developed body of literature on sport and national identity has often taken texts created by the media as a primary source of data. In this vein, scholars have explored the representation of national teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain, Boyle, &amp; O’Donnell, 1993</xref>), individual athletes as members of specific national communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723511433861">Critcher, 1991</xref>), and entire nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193723511433861">Lechner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Extending from these studies, this article takes representation of the meaning and importance of soccer within national culture as its central subject. With few exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723511433861">Andersson &amp; Radmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain et al., 1993</xref>) studies have not explored what this type of representation can tell us about how national identity is forged through media coverage of sport. This problem is particularly acute in the United States where sport remains a neglected subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0193723511433861">Washington &amp; Karen, 2001</xref>), one particularly prone to ignoring sport’s impact on national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511433861">Bairner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The central theme of the media coverage sampled here involved contrasting the significance of the World Cup in the United States and abroad. The story was, in many ways, a predictable one: Nowhere on the planet could one find a nation so unconcerned with the world’s most popular sporting event. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits &amp; Hellerman, 2001</xref>) has interpreted similar stories on American ambivalence toward soccer as an accurate reflection of the sport’s low cultural valence, adding it to a list of other “American exceptionalisms.” Of course, the sport is relatively marginalized in the U.S. culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits &amp; Hellerman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193723511433861">Sugden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193723511433861">Waddington &amp; Rodderick, 1996</xref>). But given that soccer failed to develop a significant following in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723511433861">Guoth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723511433861">Hay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193723511433861">Rowe, McKay, &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>, pp. 130-133; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193723511433861">Sugden, 1994</xref>, pp. 223-226), it is important to ask why Americans so often single themselves out—and are so often singled out by others—as a unique case unlike any other nation.</p>
<p>I propose that the answer to this question requires recognition of the powerful role that both sport and media play in the creation and maintenance of “symbolic boundaries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723511433861">Lamont &amp; Molnár, 2002</xref>, p. 168) between social groups organized around national identity. Indeed, reputations built in and around international sport provide national community members a powerful mechanism for articulating qualities thought to simultaneously bind the nation together and mark it as distinct from all others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193723511433861">Lechner, 2007</xref>). Drawing upon this proposition, I approach claims regarding American ambivalence toward the World Cup as a form of national myth making.</p>

<title>National Identity and Sport</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723511433861">Calhoun (1997)</xref> has noted, nations are most effectively defined not by the actuality of their territorial boundaries, sovereignty, indivisibility, or ancientness but by the claims made about these features. These assertions often evince the notion of national singularity through reference to two intertwined themes: internal homogeneity and external difference. The claim of internal homogeneity emphasizes collective similarities over domestic variation by highlighting what members of a national community share, such as common history, traditions, sense of place, and other mutual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0193723511433861">McClintock, 1997</xref>). The claim of external difference entails contrasting one national group against another to specify what makes each a distinct, unique entity separable from other similar communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193723511433861">Higson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As a social practice prone to arousing awareness of identity and difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193723511433861">Tudor, 1998</xref>), sport provides ample opportunities for the enactment of these two intertwined claims. The high levels of emotional expression in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511433861">Elias &amp; Dunning, 1986</xref>) and noninstrumental forms of interpersonal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193723511433861">Giulianotti, 2005</xref>) surrounding sport encourage strong feelings of affinity to the in-group. Media coverage of sporting events exacerbates this tendency through frequent use of language and visual images that give form to imaginary bonds of national unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193723511433861">Rowe et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the direct competition structured into modern sport provides a readymade adversary against whom perceptions of the in-group may be contrasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723511433861">Archetti, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511433861">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723511433861">Boyle &amp; Haynes, 2000</xref>). In this context, sport provides a particularly potent site for national groups to articulate the way they prefer to represent themselves and to be seen by relevant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193723511433861">Coelho, 1998</xref>, p 168).</p>
<sec id="section3-0193723511433861">
<title>National Sporting Styles</title>
<p>Among European scholars, national sporting stereotypes, as constructed through the linguistic discourses produced by media, have emerged as a considerable topic of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193723511433861">Tudor, 2006</xref>). Research in this vein indicates that nationality is often invoked though the allocation of sporting style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723511433861">Critcher, 1991</xref>). This involves representing national teams (and their individual members) as having distinctive habits of play, tactical affinities, or skill sets that influence how they perform on the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723511433861">Alabarces, Tomlinson, &amp; Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511433861">Blain &amp; O’Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723511433861">Crolley &amp; Hand, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193723511433861">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193723511433861">Maguire, Poulton, &amp; Possamai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0193723511433861">O’Donnell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193723511433861">Poulton, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A much smaller body of literature has extended this analysis to the portrayal of nationally-based fan groups, finding that, like the representation of national teams, these groups are presented as possessing a peculiar style of celebrating victories, reacting to losses, and making meaning out of their national team’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723511433861">Andersson &amp; Radmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain et al., 1993</xref>). What binds the representation of teams and fans together is the tendency to present style as a characteristic of that nation more generally. In this sense, collective performance and shared understandings of sport become framed as indicative, or “indexical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511433861">Blain &amp; O’Donnell, 1998</xref>, p. 369), of broader behavioral and mental patterns thought to be rooted in national identity.</p>
<p>Scholars in the United States have produced an equally impressive body of literature on identity formation in the U.S.-based sport media; however, the primary focus has been on gender and race. Even when exploring international competitions the national dimension has been given scant attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511433861">Billings &amp; Eastman, 2002</xref>), and where it has, research has failed to make a link to the aforementioned literature on national sporting style. Therefore, this article seeks to address this gap in the literature by exploring the representation of the United States via discussion of this nation’s relationship to the world’s most popular sporting event.</p>

<title>American Exceptionalism</title>
<p>Several scholars have explored the historical development of soccer in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511433861">Abrams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193723511433861">Sudgen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193723511433861">Waddington &amp; Roderick, 1996</xref>). In the most developed version, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits and Hellerman (2001)</xref> posit that highly industrialized nations solidified their national “sporting space” during the key period of modernization between 1870 and 1930. Baseball, American football, basketball, and (to a lesser degree) hockey became institutionalized during this era and, as a result, came to satiate this space. Thus, soccer’s absence, even in the present, is explained as the result of this historical “crowding out” (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193723511433861">Sudgen, 1994</xref>; for critiques see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511433861">Abrams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193723511433861">Waddington &amp; Roderick, 1996</xref>). More important, Markovits and Hellerman interpret the marginalization of soccer in the United States as another manifestation of “American exceptionalism” that, like the absence of an influential socialist party, “makes the United States different from the rest of the world” (p. 9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193723511433861">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovitz and Hellerman’s (2001)</xref> historical work casts much light on the contingent social forces that shaped the development of soccer in the United States. In concert, I begin with the understanding that soccer in the United States does not hold the same cultural significance as it does in many areas of the world, especially Africa, Europe, and Latin America. However, I do not begin with the concomitant assumption that the United States is entirely unique in this respect. Indeed, soccer failed to develop into the most popular sport in many areas of the world directly colonized by the British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193723511433861">Guoth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193723511433861">Hay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193723511433861">Rowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193723511433861">Sudgen, 1994</xref>) and several other countries (China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Japan, and Taiwan) as well. Recognizing soccer’s uneven diffusion creates the need to ask a different question than that typically proposed by the American exceptionalist thesis, namely, why the U.S. relationship to soccer has so often been understood as entirely unique, an emblem of difference that sets it apart from the rest of the world.</p>

<sec id="section5-0193723511433861" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>I base my analysis on print coverage of the 2002 and 2006 men’s World Cup from five sources: <italic>USA Today, New York Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Chicago Sun-Times</italic>, and <italic>San Diego Union-Tribune. USA Today</italic> (<italic>UST</italic>) provided a widely read, nationally oriented source with an extensive sport section. As the U.S.-based paper with the most influence globally and domestically, <italic>New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) often sets the tone of coverage for other papers in the United States, although less so regarding sport. In addition, the paper is located in a metropolitan area that is host to a franchise within Major League Soccer (MLS), the elite U.S. professional men’s soccer league. A regionally influential paper in the Midwest, <italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193723511433861">2</xref></sup> (<italic>CST</italic>), also operates in a city that is host to an MLS team. Both the <italic>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic> (<italic>AJC</italic>) and the <italic>San Diego Union-Tribune</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193723511433861">3</xref></sup> (<italic>SUT</italic>) were chosen to provide a greater regional perspective on the Southeast and West Coast, respectively.</p>
<p>As part of a larger project on the World Cup in American culture I performed a search of the term “World Cup” within the Lexis-Nexis Academic database for each publication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0193723511433861">4</xref></sup> Given that coverage of the World Cup typically begins several weeks in advance and ends a week or so after the tournament is completed, I limited my search to articles published between May 1 and July 31. This search retrieved 686 separate articles (404 from 2002 and 282 from 2006). Of these, 299 (206 from 2002 and 93 from 2006) made reference to fan or citizen reactions to the World Cup, including 117 articles that made this subject matter the primary storyline.</p>
<p>These articles ranged in type from straight news stories that summarized match outcomes or previewed upcoming games to editorial columns that afforded authors more leeway in terms of subject matter covered and opinions expressed. The most extensive coverage came from the <italic>NYT</italic> and <italic>SUT</italic>, whereas <italic>CST</italic> provided the thinnest coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0193723511433861">5</xref></sup> In addition, each paper emphasized different stories of local interest (reports on players with connections to the city or extra coverage of national teams corresponding to well-represented ethnic groups). However, each made fan and citizen reactions to the World Cup a significant portion of their overall tournament coverage and shared in the patterns described as follows. Therefore, the following themes cannot be dismissed as idiosyncratic products of a particular newspaper or journalist.</p>
<p>Electronic copies of the print articles were entered into a software program, MAX Qualitative Data Assistant (2007 version), to assist with storage, organization of coding, and retrieval. These texts were analyzed using a mixed-method style of content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723511433861">Altheide, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723511433861">Berg, 2001</xref>). In contrast to the more traditional, quantitative form of content analysis that focuses strictly on counting the most observable patterns, namely, the recurrence of particular words, phrases, or themes, the mixed-method style encourages the collection of both numeric-type data found in quantitative research and the narrative-type data found in qualitative studies. This approach overcomes several shortcomings associated with traditional content analysis, namely, the loss of meaning supplied by context, the inability to decode latent meanings, and the incapacity to show what is absent. Furthermore, whereas the traditional style of content analysis requires a deductive strategy in which texts are scanned for preset content, the mixed-method style is amendable to both deductive and inductive coding schemes. Like grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0193723511433861">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>), I began with a relatively open coding scheme and moved toward a more selective and refined one as determined by the patterns prevalent in the content.</p>
<p>The primary distinction present in this sample involved the varying importance and meaning of the World Cup across and within national communities. I coded comments by media outlets that indicated little or no interest as “indifferent,” while reserving “passionate” for those comments that claimed emotional investment in tournament outcomes. The results of this coding scheme are presented in the form of aggregated descriptive statistics for populations located outside (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193723511433861">Table 1</xref>) and within the United States (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193723511433861">Table 2</xref>). In addition, several subcategories emerged within these macro-level codes. The subcode “obsession” was applied to comments that indicated particularly fervent and persistent reactions, whereas remarks that assigned high levels of emotional investment to the entire nation were, borrowing from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain and colleagues (1993)</xref>, identified as expressing the “metonym” narrative. In addition, three subcategories only applicable to the U.S. context emerged: comments that framed soccer as “foreign,” “adolescent,” and “feminine.”</p>

<title>Differentiating Us From Them: The United States Versus the World</title>
<p>Two antinomies emerged as central to the media coverage analyzed here. The first operated at a global level by contrasting the circumscribed and apathetic responses to the World Cup in the United States with the intense, widespread emotional reactions found throughout the rest of the world. The second, domestic in scope, contrasted those unfamiliar, confused, even resentful of the tournament with an emergent American fan base.</p>
<sec id="section7-0193723511433861">
<title>The Nationalism of Others</title>
<p>Virtually every comment (339 of 351, 96.6%) about non-U.S. residents indicated a deep-rooted interest in the World Cup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193723511433861">Table 1</xref>), even in countries such as Bangladesh and Thailand that have never qualified. Fifty-three used the metonym narrative by projecting this interest onto <italic>all</italic> members of the national community. A preview of the 2002 tournament remarked that the build-up to the World Cup was a time “when <italic>entire nations become obsessed</italic> with a small bone in a midfielder’s left foot (see England) or the ligaments of a forward’s knee (see Italy) or the fine print of a coach’s contract (see Argentina)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0193723511433861">Zeigler, May 1, 2002</xref>, italics added). Comments in this subcategory presented the nation as “one sentient being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511433861">Blain et al., 1993</xref>, p. 15) reacting in unison to issues specific to sport. This suggested that passion was not just present but widespread in the extreme.</p>
<p>Comments coded as <italic>passionate</italic> insinuated not just knowledge, dedication, and interest in soccer but a fixation. Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Holland, and England were all identified as “soccer-obsessed” or “soccer-mad” countries. National fixation was even identified as affecting local laws in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0193723511433861">Zeigler, May 31, 2002</xref>), elections in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0193723511433861">Schwartz, 2006</xref>), economic performance in the Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0193723511433861">Vinton, 2006</xref>), and cultural norms in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723511433861">French, 2002</xref>). Altogether, 88 comments implied an “obsession” by using language that indicated a lack of emotional control leading to excited, uncontrollable, and even violent acts, such as rioting in Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723511433861">Brooke, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>On the few occasions in which the indifferent theme emerged, the majority (9 of 12) followed poor results on the field. For example, in the build-up to the 2002 tournament several stories reported that fans in Brazil and Germany were lacking enthusiasm because of struggles during qualifying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0193723511433861">Schmidt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0193723511433861">Vescey, 2002</xref>). However, once these teams performed well their fans were once again identified as passionate. As a cathartic coping mechanism for dealing with disappointments on the field, indifference in this context was temporary and subject to change.</p>

<sec id="section8-0193723511433861">
<title>The United States of Ambivalence</title>
<p>Despite general sentiment that the World Cup was less meaningful in the United States, the overall characterization was more complex—what I describe as ambivalent—oscillating between the indifferent and passionate themes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193723511433861">Table 2</xref>). Whereas the slight majority of comments characterized the U.S. public as ignorant, unconcerned, or uninterested (171 of 318, 53.8%), a large number suggested that at least segments of the U.S. population were emotionally invested (147 of 318, 46.2%). These two themes differed temporally with the indifference theme appearing early in the sample and remaining relatively strong throughout. Conversely, the passionate theme fluctuated with results, only appearing frequently once the national team performed better than expected during the 2002 tournament and waning slightly during 2006 when results disappointed.</p>

<sec id="section9-0193723511433861">
<title>Indifferent America</title>
<p>Comments coded as “indifferent” came in a variety of forms. Straight news stories often included isolated remarks that made only passing reference to lack of interest in the course of discussing other subjects. A story on the reactions of Mexican fans to a loss against the United States indicated that part of their anguish derived from soccer’s marginality in U.S. culture, a place where the tournament is “but a blip on sports bars’ screens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723511433861">Ferriss &amp; Rodriguez, 2002</xref>). Editorials, comprising 27 full articles, provided more extended commentary, including many that were critical and sarcastic in tone. An article printed the day before the U.S. first quarterfinal match in history opened by stating, “Ah, soccer fever. Now it’s Germany for our World Cup upstarts . . . and in some corners of this soccer-challenged land, you’ll be able to cut the tension with a bagel” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193723511433861">Lopresti, 2002</xref>). Even those genuinely supportive of the sport dedicated extended commentary to indifference. An article that ran under the headline “Sound the Alarm: U.S. Fans Are Missing a Great Tourney” ended with a story of the author driving through Chicago in an ultimately futile search to find fellow fans with whom to celebrate a U.S. victory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193723511433861">Mulligan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the most common way to articulate indifference, found in both isolated remarks and editorials, involved explicit comparisons between reactions found in the United States and overseas. Juxtaposing an indifferent America against a deeply invested globe, these comments referenced many of the ways passion for soccer outside the United States was framed. After suggesting that the United States would not experience a drop in worker productivity, an increase in alcohol consumption, or an escalation of mental anguish a preview of the 2006 tournament concluded that “life will go on as normal, while the rest of the world goes crazy over the World Cup” (“The Cups Runneth Over,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0193723511433861">2006</xref>). More than a description of how little the tournament altered the general flow of everyday life, indifference provided a mark of distinction that separated the United States from “the rest of the world.” Similarly, another story quoted a Costa Rican fan as saying, “The only country that doesn’t get soccer like everybody else is the United States” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193723511433861">Knobler, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Expressing this general sentiment, writers used language that expressed the most basic elements of in-group/out-group distinctions. One journalist observed, “They don’t relate to us, we don’t relate to them. They are on Mars, we are on Pluto” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193723511433861">Mariotti, 2006</xref>). Although this writer acknowledged that all countries shared an intense passion for sport, the different array of sports responded to demarcate a significant dividing line between the United States and the rest of the world. In this binary, “the United States” and indifference occupied the native/insider slot, with support for soccer, and the rest of the globe occupying the foreign/outsider pole. Thus, the U.S. relationship to the rest of the world as experienced through soccer could be summed up quite simply as “Soccer. Football. Us. Them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193723511433861">Brennan, 2006</xref>). Clearly indifference functioned as a point of national distinction, and although this opened up the possibility of broader claims regarding national difference or virtue, writers in this sample limited such claims to the world of sport.</p>
<p>Identification of this difference from the rest of the world encouraged the search for explanations. In this context, writers often framed soccer as <italic>foreign</italic>. As already established, in-group/out-group analogies depended on an understanding of passion for the sport as alien. In total, 40 comments indicated that the sport’s lower cultural valence derived from its outsider status. For example, a writer for the <italic>AJC</italic> stated, “We Americans continue to see soccer at its highest level as aimless and boring and foreign” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723511433861">Bradley, 2006</xref>). Like several comments in the indifference category, this one used inclusive pronouns (“we”) that extended lack of interest far beyond a solitary author and a finite set of readers, to include—like the metonym narrative—the entire nation. Another set of remarks framed soccer as foreign by claiming the sport came into direct conflict with core values of American culture. Stories identified lack of scoring and ties as incompatible with American entertainment preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511433861">Eskenazi, 2002</xref>); offsides as “simply un-American” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723511433861">della Cava, 2006</xref>), for not encouraging forward movement; and rule changes that would make the sport more appealing to American audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193723511433861">Mattox, 2006</xref>). More important, these claims established lack of interest as a permanent feature of national culture quite distinct from the more cathartic and temporary nature of indifference in non-U.S. settings. As an ‘alien’ activity, even domestically based fans were dismissed as quasi-foreigners. Those who liked the sport were proclaimed to be “the same people who drink Orangina and snack on Toblerone bars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193723511433861">Hummer, 2002</xref>). The claim that even passionate U.S. (native) fans also consumed products with origins outside the United States confirmed the sport’s nonnative status.</p>
<p>Explanations for lack of national interest also depended on soccer’s association with adolescents. Remarks in this category, appearing on 27 occasions, acknowledged high participation rates among youths, often citing figures establishing it as one of the most frequently played sports. However, participation was simultaneously an impediment to a more thorough and lifelong appreciation. This depended on an understanding that association with children also meant association with frivolous recreation. A writer noted that “for most youths, soccer means Mom dropping them at practice in the minivan and picking them up two hours later” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0193723511433861">Zeigler, May 29, 2002</xref>). This helped to explain why “millions of American children have grown up playing the game only to abandon it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193723511433861">Sullivan, 2006</xref>). Framing soccer as <italic>adolescent</italic> marked it as an activity to be grown out of and replaced in adulthood by more “serious” and “appropriate” endeavors.</p>
<p>In addition, 13 comments marked soccer as <italic>feminine</italic>. This primarily revolved around remarks that indentified the sport as one in which women excelled on and off the field in comparison to their male peers. An article on the U.S. player Clint Mathis, who had recently appeared on several magazine covers, began with a story in which a fan mistook him for a hockey player when asking for an autograph. The writer summed up the situation as follows: “Such is the anonymity of the male soccer star in this country . . . the only American soccer player getting any real face time on television is Mia Hamm in a Gatorade commercial” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193723511433861">Longman, 2002</xref>). In the same vein, another writer, after not recognizing a single player on the U.S. men’s team, stated, “Brandi Chastain, the US women’s soccer player who flashed us her sports bra at the 2000 [sic] World Cup. Her I’d recognize” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723511433861">Brown, 2002</xref>). These comments framed soccer as <italic>feminine</italic> by inverting the usual positions held by men’s and women’s sports in the United States.</p>
<p>Independently and in conjunction these three themes—soccer as foreign, feminine, and adolescent—offered lay explanations for the sport’s relative unpopularity. Although comments of this type often appeared alone, 13 articles contained 2 or more remarks that fell into different categories, indicating that these themes could also operate in conjunction with one another. Of course, framing soccer in the United States in this way provided another point for establishing difference with the rest of the world wherein passion extended to the entire nation, not just subsegments of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193723511433861">
<title>Passionate America</title>
<p>Comments coded as <italic>passionate</italic> often came in the form of full articles, 41 in total. This included stories describing a family in Atlanta planning game-watching parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193723511433861">Gast, 2002</xref>), members of an unofficial U.S. supporter’s club traveling in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193723511433861">Parker, 2002</xref>), and boisterous U.S. fans in and around stadiums in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723511433861">Dron, 2006</xref>). All papers sampled sent reporters to local establishments showing games in order to assess popularity. An article published under the headline “Fever for the Pitch: Soccer (Not Baseball) Fans Get Together in Wee Hours to Support US Team” provides a descriptive example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They showed in droves, their faces painted, their bodies swallowed by red, white and blue garments, their hearts on display for all to witness. . . . A standing-room-only throng breathlessly awaited and then intently watched . . . with the kind of affection and apprehension and animation as only those who appreciate this game can. Here, there was no cultural disconnection. The investment—by, yes, mostly Americans—went far beyond sport. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193723511433861">Graney, 2002</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, writers for the <italic>NYT</italic> commenting on the plethora of highly critical comments about the U.S. team’s disappointing 2006 performance stated, “In the hysteria of their response, American soccer fans sounded, marvelously, just like everyone else in the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193723511433861">Klein, Mackey, Mather, Irving, &amp; Kelley, 2006</xref>). Stories of this type establish that passion for soccer in the United States could, at times, be described in the type of language typically reserved for soccer fans outside its borders and that when this occurred soccer fandom became a source of resemblance with—rather than distinction from—the rest of world.</p>
<p>Moments of likeness, however, were exceedingly rare. Indeed, several qualitative patterns tempered the strength of the passionate theme, showing it to be unlike the representation of passion in non-U.S. contexts. First, stories often characterized this passion as numerically limited. For example, the aforementioned article on an unofficial U.S. supporter’s club ran under the headline “The Few, the Proud . . . U.S. Soccer ‘Sammers’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193723511433861">Parker, 2002</xref>). Consequently, passion in the U.S. context was <italic>never</italic> extended to the entire nation as it was for other countries. Even where this was not made explicit, it implicitly affected the framing of stories on even the most passionate displays by the U.S. fans, such as the articles by Graney as well as Klein and colleagues cited above. That the former stressed it was indeed “Americans”—and not those born outside but currently living in the United States—for whom there was “no cultural disconnect” and the latter considered the response of American fans “marvelous” indicates how unexpected this degree of interest was even to the reporters themselves. Second, passion in the U.S. context was described in more reserved terms than that applied to those outside its borders. Only 19 comments utilized words like “hysteria” that suggested a more uncontrollable, potentially dangerous “obsession.”</p>
<p>Third, 43.5% (64 of 147) of the comments coded as <italic>passionate</italic> were assigned to residents who supported not the United States but some other national team based on their ethnic ties. These remarks used language that mimicked the presentation of fan groups overseas, including 11 coded as <italic>obsessed</italic>. More important, ethnic or immigrant status often became the overwhelming feature of social identity. For example, an article on celebrations of Italy’s 2006 title on Chicago’s Northwest side ran under the headline: “It’s a great day to be Italian” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511433861">Donovan, 2006</xref>). Those described subsequently were marked specifically as “Italian,” not Americans of Italian descent or Italian Americans. This clearly contrasted with the presentation of fans interested in the U.S. national team, whose ethnicity was rarely identified and typically erased by use of the generic term “American” (as in Graney’s article above). In addition, ethnic identity served as the primary explanation for this population’s infatuation. Familial and immigrant enclave experiences were credited for peaking interest, even among those who had lived all or most of their lives in the United States: “Though he was born in Atlanta, he learned Mexican soccer traditions, from wearing the Mexican flag to chanting ‘Ole!’, from his family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193723511433861">Sutcliffe &amp; Sager, 2006</xref>). Identifying a significant portion of the passion found in the United States with ethnic groups tempers the weight of the passionate theme within the United States, while simultaneously supplementing the framing of soccer as <italic>foreign</italic> by emphasizing its nonnative origins.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193723511433861">
<title>Representing Sport Fandom as National Culture</title>
<p>To sum up, media coverage created a stark distinction between the United States and the rest of the world in terms of the meaning and importance of the World Cup within national culture. Whether in the form of explicit comparisons or tacit distinctions created via the overall representation of reactions to this event, the United States was understood to be the one place in the world one could find so many indifferent citizens and so few passionate fans.</p>
<p>One potential explanation for this pattern is that media coverage accurately captured the importance and meaning of the World Cup in the United States and abroad. Utilizing a variant of “reflection theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193723511433861">Griswold, 2008</xref>, p. 25; for an example involving media, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0193723511433861">Tuchman, 1978</xref>), this explanation posits that media portrayals of social life are literal representations of dominant societal values. This was the interpretation of contemporary U.S. media coverage of the World Cup provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits and Hellerman (2001)</xref>. Accordingly, the quantity of coverage and tone of narratives were unembellished expressions of soccer’s marginal place in the U.S. culture. Indeed, they have cited the sport’s association with foreigners, youth, and women as precipitating factors contributing to its’ continued absence from hegemonic U.S. sports space (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193723511433861">Markovits &amp; Hellerman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although such an explanation has the immediate appeal of face validity, it suffers from several shortcomings. First, this perspective is incapable of explaining the variety of mass media themes captured in this sample. The analysis conducted here encountered stories that ranged from indifference to passionate, even though the latter was sublimated to the former (discussed in the following). Second, scholars have noted that the themes found within mass media are more prescriptive than descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193723511433861">Kitch, 2001</xref>). Through a process of selection and interpretation influenced by both organizational and cultural constraints narratives constructed by the media create a particular <italic>version</italic> of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193723511433861">Gitlin, 1980</xref>). Although these prescriptive accounts are not entirely fictional and, therefore, maintain some veracity, they cannot be accepted as social facts in the same manner as other forms of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193723511433861">Klein, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, I interpret the characterization of the U.S. relationship to the World Cup found in print media as a form of “boundary-work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193723511433861">Gieryn, 1983</xref>). Boundary work refers to the activities engaged in by social actors to create symbolic boundaries (e.g., conceptual distinctions) between objects, practices, and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193723511433861">Lamont &amp; Molnár, 2002</xref>). Boundaries are particularly relevant for collective forms of identity because effective group formation depends on socially recognized distinctions between in- and out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193723511433861">Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193723511433861">Jenkins, 1996</xref>). At the national level this involves the ubiquitous claim that each nation is unique, that each is “internally unified and different from all others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723511433861">Calhoun, 1997</xref>, p. 7). More important, technology, including mass media, can facilitate the formation of a collective identity within communities that are too large or dispersed to involve face-to-face contact (such as national groups; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511433861">Anderson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723511433861">Calhoun, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193723511433861">Cerulo, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this literature I approach discourse about American ambivalence as part of national myth or, to slightly rephrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723511433861">Geertz’s (1973</xref>, p. 448) famous passage about Balinese cockfighting, a story Americans tell themselves about themselves. What the various claims about the meaning and significance of soccer in national culture share in common is the articulation of peculiar qualities thought to demarcate Americans as a homogeneous community distinct from all others, with appreciation and passion for soccer (or lack thereof) as the primary content of that boundary. In this sense, assigning a particular style of fandom to American residents became a way in which the nation could be framed and understood more generally.</p>
<sec id="section12-0193723511433861">
<title>Us Versus Them: Stories Americans Tell Themselves About Themselves</title>
<p>Juxtaposing the significance of the World Cup in the United States against other national communities offers the clearest example of national myth making via boundary work. In making this claim, journalists invoked the notion of national singularity by offering a concrete illustration of internal homogeneity and external difference. Accordingly, indifference toward soccer offered one collective experience shared by members of the national community that simultaneously distinguished them from other similar communities. Writers describing the U.S. indifference often used inclusive language (such as “we,” “our,” and “us”) that created a “deixis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723511433861">Billig, 1995</xref>) between the writer and the audience, suggesting that shared taste in sport constituted one commonality that bound the national group together (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0193723511433861">Whannel, 1992</xref>). Because “we,” the national group, are all the same, “our” reaction to and interest in sport is also the same, in part, through its opposability to “them” and their reaction. If the rest of the world was single-minded in its passion, often to the point of obsession, then the United States was curiously aloof. If passion for the sport could unite entire countries (at least metaphorically) then indifference served a similar function for the United States. As a springboard for claims about what made the United States stand out within the global pantheon of nationalities, mutual indifference was simultaneously an assertion of internal unity and a mark of external distinction.</p>
<p>At first glance, the significant presence of remarks regarding an emerging fan base in the United States appears to contradict claims of singularity via mutual disregard for the sport. However, national myths often contain several competing variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511433861">Edensor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193723511433861">Lechner, 2007</xref>), even if some become more prevalent than others. Because national communities claim to be unitary, indivisible, and singular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723511433861">Calhoun, 1995</xref>) they tend to be characterized by “a deep, horizontal comradeship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511433861">Anderson, 1991</xref>, p. 7) in which common interest prevails over individual and group variation. This apparent comradeship conceals power differences within the nation, wherein some groups are excluded from full citizenship on the basis of racial or ethnic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193723511433861">Marx, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0193723511433861">Yuval-Davis, 1993</xref>) or connected with different duties of citizenship on the basis of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0193723511433861">McClintock, 1997</xref>). This indicates that the process of national identity formation also occurs on an internal scale through distinctions made within the territorial boundaries of the nation-state.</p>
<p>The contrast between stories of American residents who were disinterested and passionate point to this type of internal boundary maintenance. Although a number of remarks recognized an emergent fan base, indifference rose to the fore as <italic>the</italic> idealized representation of the U.S. relationship to the World Cup, one capable of overriding potentially challenging characterizations. This can be most clearly seen in the way indifference became invoked during explicit comparisons to national communities overseas. As a result, those who were passionate about the sport in the United States were demoted to a secondary position incapable of substituting for the entire collective, even being identified as quasi-foreigners within American borders.</p>
<p>Internal boundary maintenance also provides a useful means for understanding the framing of soccer as <italic>foreign, feminine</italic>, and <italic>adolescent</italic>. As explanations for soccer’s low cultural valence in the United States, these themes specified why the sport failed to capture more broad-based sentiments. Gender is a crucial prism through which the link between sport and national identity becomes focused. Whereas sport media regularly appoint male athletes and teams as “plenipotentiaries of national character” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193723511433861">Rowe et al., 1998</xref>, p. 123), they rarely do so for their female counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0193723511433861">6</xref></sup> Thus, sports associated with women or marked as <italic>feminine</italic> (as soccer was in the United States) struggle—at least in their representational form—to capture the undivided emotional investment of the national group. As a sport most readily enjoyed by foreigners and immigrants (and about which much of the native population felt removed), soccer fandom could not become a center point of national bonding wherein strong feelings with the rest of the national community were generated. Rather than becoming exemplars of the national community, soccer fans in the United States were associated with subpopulations (youth, women, foreigners) that circumscribed the sports’ breadth and depth.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that even those journalists most sympathetic toward an emerging fan base were either unwilling or unable to use the <italic>deixis</italic> motif or the metonym narrative in association with the <italic>passionate</italic> theme. There might be Americans who enjoyed soccer and the World Cup, but they were not as “authentic” as those who were unfamiliar, confused, or resentful. Thus, part of the story Americans told themselves was that failure to embrace soccer like other areas of the world occurred because passion for the sport fell outside the usually imagined parameters of American identity.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Writing during the wake of the 2010 World Cup, in which the U.S. media coverage more frequently highlighted significant emotional reactions to the national team, provides an interesting vantage point for assessing the representations analyzed here. The ambiguity of American reactions found in this sample suggests that passion for soccer in the United States is not an altogether new representation even if its degree of emphasis has altered. Indeed, because the imagining of national communities is an ongoing project, one fraught with competition, variation over time is to be anticipated. What changes is not so much the substance of the national myth as how the myth’s basic components are “re-interpreted according to the politics of the present” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511433861">Edensor, 1997</xref>, p. 185). As the U.S. demographics change and new forms of media emerge it would not be surprising to see passion for soccer become a more viable theme.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the discourse about soccer in America is socially constructed does not dismiss historical explanations for soccer’s relative absence, such as that provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits and Hellerman (2001)</xref>. Undoubtedly, their analysis contributes to our understanding of social forces that contributed to the development of soccer within the U.S. sports space. More problematic is their interpretation of contemporary media representations. Their model, as presented, is denuded of the type of cultural analysis capable of exposing American exceptionalism as part of national myth. Of course, myths are not fictional, but partial truths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193723511433861">Rowe et al., 1998</xref>), which is precisely why they are so appealing at a commonsense level. The United States certainly has a particular relationship to soccer and the World Cup, one that can be compared and contrasted with other nations. But the discourse about this relationship requires analysis, not as a social fact reflecting some reality found in society, but as discourse.</p>
<p>The discourses generated about nations, despite substantive differences, share a similar structure. All assert the nation as distinct, unique, and exceptional as part of the articulation of internal unity and external difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723511433861">Calhoun, 1997</xref>). The reputations built through sport offer a particularly powerful mechanism for specifying this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193723511433861">Lechner, 2007</xref>). Although for many countries the assertion of national singularity through soccer involves the articulation of a particular playing style or the universal appeal of the sport, in the United States it entails stipulating the ambivalent meaning attached to soccer via the World Cup. Thus, the argument laid out here concurs in one way with the general theme present in the mass media texts analyzed: The U.S. relationship to soccer can be accurately characterized via us versus them statements. However, these statements are understood not as accurate descriptive accounts but as self-interested answers to the who-are-we question that all nations ask of themselves. In this sense, the discourse about soccer and what this means about American national identity is quite unexceptional.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193723511433861">Markovits and Hellerman’s (2001)</xref> analysis is, like the larger field of American exceptionalism, first and foremost, a cross-cultural comparison of the United States and Europe.

<p>I chose the <italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic> (<italic>CST</italic>) over the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> because the database used to gather these articles, Lexis Nexis Academic, groups the <italic>Tribune</italic> into an aggregate news source (“global news wire”) that includes more than 150 publications. These search results cannot be separated by publication. So in order to have a similar method of gathering articles and to avoid sampling issues I used the <italic>Sun-Times</italic>.</p>

<p>The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> might seem a better suit for determining the regional perspective on the West coast, given its prominence in that region. However, the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> is only available via Lexis-Nexus Academic Search Premier for 6 months prior to the search date. Therefore, the articles from the 2002 World Cup were unavailable through the search engine used to gather other articles analyzed in this project. Given this situation, I decided it best to use the <italic>San Diego Union-Tribune</italic> (<italic>SUT</italic>) for consistency.</p>
