<p>Johanna Bockman’s book, <italic>Markets in the Name of Socialism: The Left-Wing Origins of Neoliberalism</italic>, describes the origins of neoliberalism from a unique perspective that has hardly been explored so far, namely, the contribution of Eastern European economists to the articulation and implementation of neoclassical economic theories. In so doing, the book offers a number of important insights regarding the economic theories informing policies and programs under Communism and what Bockman refers to as “The Left-Wing Origins of Neoliberalism.” While Bockman frames the book around the second insight, I find the first one to be the more significant contribution. (An equally fitting title might have been <italic>Socialism in the Name of Markets</italic>.)</p>
<p>Bockman convincingly suggests that the literature on neoliberalism misleadingly conflates neoliberalism and neoclassical economics. The two do share some concepts and beliefs in common, most centrally the emphasis on free competition. But Bockman shows that, in contrast to what most of us believe, free competition has been understood by neoclassical economists to be entirely compatible with socialism. In fact, in their mathematical models, neoclassical economists considered free competition and a “social planner” to be equivalent in their capacity to bring optimal economic results. For neoclassical economists from Eastern Europe, private property was hardly a condition for free competition, which was to be achieved at the <italic>firm</italic> level. Yugoslavia, for example, advocated an economic system that was based on the social ownership of the means of production, combined with decentralization and worker self-management. Bockman’s important insight is that the neoliberalism which emerged in the West in the early 1980s, and then was implemented in Eastern Europe, was a decidedly <italic>narrow</italic> version of neoclassical economics that rejected the democratic principles emphasized by Eastern European economists and favored instead “hierarchical firms controlled by managers and owners, rather than by workers” (p. 4). As Bockman succinctly summarizes, “neoliberalism incorporated the transnational discussion about socialism in support of competitive markets but replaced the socialist calls for political and economic democracy with capitalist demands for hierarchical institutions” (p. 10).</p>
<p>The book’s empirical exploration begins with a chapter that describes how economists in Eastern Europe drew on neoclassical economics to analyze socialist economic systems. Bockman then discusses the existence of a transnational network in which ideas and theories were exchanged among economists in the East and economists in the West. Particularly fascinating is her evidence of illicit intellectual exchanges during the Stalinist era between the Soviet Union and economists in the United States during the McCarthy era. In the next two chapters, the book turns to an examination of Yugoslav and Hungarian alternatives to both Soviet socialism and Western capitalism. These experiences provide particularly convincing accounts of how Eastern European economists integrated neoclassical economics into the economic study of socialism. After devoting a chapter to the Center for the Study of Economic and Social Problems in Italy, which Bockman draws on to demonstrate the exchange of ideas between East and West, she ends the book with two particularly important accounts. In one chapter she describes the reforms in the Soviet Union just before 1989, which to a large extent realized a market socialist tradition within neoclassical economics. The last chapter before the conclusion then addresses the defeat of “market socialism” and the ultimate victory of the conservative, narrow version of neoliberalism.</p>
<p>The book provides an important sociological perspective on the intellectual developments in Eastern Europe during the Communist era. Surprisingly, the study of economics in Eastern Europe did not rely on Marxism-Leninism—Bockman shows that economists considered the Marxist analysis, because of its focus on capitalism, irrelevant to their needs and instead adapted neoclassical economic theories and methods. Bockman also offers a fascinating description of the different ways that economists of socialism considered markets and competition to be entirely compatible with the socialist project rather in opposition to it. (It would be fascinating to think about China’s recent economic reforms through this lens.) Bockman then makes the argument that the theories developed in Eastern Europe constituted the “left-wing origins” of neoliberalism.</p>
<p>The second part of the analysis was slightly less persuasive. Bockman convincingly demonstrates the existence of a long-term intellectual exchange between economists from the United States, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, but she does not provide details regarding the actual contribution of Eastern European economists to their Western counterparts. Indeed, neoclassical economists in the West used a “social planner” model that resembled the socialist state, but this is hardly an indication of the socialists’ own contributions. While the book reveals the existence of exchange, it does not show that economists supporting socialism had any effect on the trajectory of neoclassical economics in the West. At a minimum, it does not show that the theoretical contributions made by economists from Eastern Europe were inherently socialist or “left-wing.” Even if neoclassical economics was the joint intellectual outcome of economists from both West and East, Bockman herself makes it clear that the conservative version, supported by Milton Friedman and others, has prevailed over the versions favored by those who wanted to save, rather than replace, socialism.</p>
<p>Bockman shows great knowledge of the intellectual debates among economists, but she does not fully resolve the question as to <italic>why</italic> conservatives prevailed in the struggle. She also convincingly refers to the fact that the mathematical models dominating neoclassical economics (which are hard to understand and seem neutral) were particularly tempting in the politically repressive context of the Soviet Union, although it is only in the last chapter that the political economic context of economic knowledge becomes central. Bockman implies that after 1989, once the Berlin Wall fell, technocrats and “political elites” forced the transition to capitalism. It would have been interesting to know more about those elites and their allies and what allowed them to prevail. It would also be interesting to find out what happened to the economists who played such an important role until 1989. While some important questions remain open, however, the book is a major contribution to our understanding of the translation of neoclassical economics both to socialism and to neoliberalism, and as such is a particularly important addition to the field.</p>
