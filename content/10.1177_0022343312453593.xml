<abstract>
<p>The impact of ethnicity for the onset of conflicts has often been dismissed in the cross-country empirical literature on civil wars. Recently, however, several studies using disaggregated data have reached different conclusions and highlight the importance of the configuration of ethno-national groups. This article follows the latter approach and investigates a different phenomenon: the impact of ethnic heterogeneity on the severity of violence. Using disaggregated data at municipality level in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we perform a quantitative analysis to assess the impact of various indices of heterogeneity on the number of casualties that occurred in the 1992–95 war in the 109 municipalities composing the country. We argue that in a context where ethnicity plays a key role in shaping rivalry among groups, ethnic polarization, in particular, creates strategic incentives for severe violence as armed groups try to create ethnically homogenous territories in the first phase of the war. By also including the temporal dimension in the analysis, we show that ethnic polarization loses its impact as the war evolves over time; therefore, the geographic location of the municipalities becomes the best predictor of severe clashes because as the war goes on, ethnic groups shift their objective from creating internally homogenous municipalities to consolidating wider areas. As such, municipalities located on politically and militarily relevant frontlines experience the highest levels of violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first wave of empirical studies on civil wars investigated the impact of ethnic heterogeneity on the onset of internal conflicts from a cross-national perspective. While these studies have often reached different conclusions about the causes of intrastate wars, the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343312453593">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312453593">Collier &amp; Hoeffler, 2004</xref>) maintains that ethnicity does not play an important role in the outbreak of such conflicts (among the exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343312453593">Ellingsen, 2000</xref>). More recently, some studies have shown the importance of the local dimension and the use of disaggregated data in the study of civil wars, claiming that ethnic subnational groups play an important role in the outbreak of civil conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022343312453593">Cederman &amp; Girardin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312453593">Cederman, Girardin &amp; Gleditsch, 2009</xref>). Yet, while these studies emphasize the elements that lead to the outbreak of violence, we know much less about the factors accounting for the severity of violence <italic>within</italic> civil wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453593">Kalyvas, 2006</xref>). The purpose of this article is to contribute to the literature on the local dimension of civil wars by explaining the variance in severity of intrawar violence. Using a database of disaggregated data on the 109 municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, we assess the impact of variables pertaining to ethnic heterogeneity, as well as the influence of geographic and strategic factors on the number of casualties in the conflict.</p>
<p>Our study shows that when armed groups are mobilized along ethnic lines, as was the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ethnic polarization is a good predictor of the severity of violence in the first phases of the war – in other words, when the actors aim to create ethnically homogenous areas of control. Indeed, even in the context of what is often considered an archetypical ethnic conflict, violence follows a strategic rationale. As the war evolves, the ethnic composition of municipalities loses its strong impact while operationally relevant issues such as the location of those municipalities along political and military frontlines become central factors helping to explain the variance of violence. These findings should contribute to the expanding literature on the analysis of civil war violence, to the debate on ethnicity and violence, and to the research on Bosnia.</p>
<p>We will therefore first review the most relevant literature on the impact of ethnicity on civil wars and on the determinants of violence. We will then state our argument and the related hypotheses. Next, we will present our database and the methods used. Finally, we will comment on the results of the analysis and conclude by indicating possible directions for further research.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>While a large number of studies on the role of ethnicity in civil wars and few on the severity of violence in those same conflicts are available, the two topics rarely intersect. With regard to the first set of studies, the findings of the ‘first wave’ of empirical analysis, adopting a large-N approach, usually dismissed the impact of ethnic fractionalization on the onset of civil wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343312453593">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2003</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312453593">Collier &amp; Hoeffler (2004)</xref> found that the presence of a dominant ethnic group should increase the likelihood of war onset.</p>
<p>Critiques of this approach have come in different forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343312453593">Sambanis (2001)</xref>, for instance, argued that it is important to distinguish between ethnic and non-ethnic civil wars: while the latter may not be caused by ethnic heterogeneity, empirical analyses support the idea that the former are. Other scholars, instead, claimed that the focus of analysis should be the ‘political’ dimensions of ethnic conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022343312453593">Wimmer, Cederman &amp; Min (2009)</xref> introduced an index to measure ethnic power relations (EPR index) in order to understand ethno-political exclusion and the emergence of civil conflict, showing that rebellions tend to be robustly linked to high levels of ethnicity-based political exclusion. Ethno-nationalist grievances thus re-emerge as a powerful explanation for the outbreak of internal wars. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312453593">Cederman, Girardin &amp; Gleditsch, 2009</xref>) have also found that the political geography of conflict matters; that is, that there is a relation between the occurrence of conflict and the proximity to the border of ethnic groups akin to a politically excluded group within the country being studied.</p>
<p>Methodological concerns were also expressed regarding the ‘traditional’ cross-national perspective. The most recent strand of quantitative studies argued in favor of data disaggregation. Civil wars represent a heterogeneous set of phenomena, not solely because they differ from one another, but also because they present important internal differences that cross-country studies cannot capture. Violence, for instance, is not distributed evenly throughout the territory of the country at war. Therefore, it is quite arbitrary to assume that ‘national averages’ or ‘country-level’ characteristics exist in the first place and that they can explain the high internal variation of violence recorded in most civil wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343312453593">Buhaug, Cederman &amp; Rød, 2008)</xref>. Theories, then, should be conceived at a disaggregated level, and data should be gathered at the subnational level.</p>
<p>Further, recent research, departing from the mainstream literature on the onset of civil wars, takes into consideration the level and type of violence perpetrated in the conflicts. Using a cross-national research framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312453593">Lacina (2006)</xref> finds that foreign intervention and the absence of democracy are the variables most capable of explaining the severity of violence in intrastate conflicts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312453593">Melander, Öberg &amp; Hall (2009)</xref>, on the other hand, show that the overall decrease of conflict severity in the post-Cold War period is linked to the reduction of ‘proxy warfare’, which was commonly used by the two superpowers during the Cold War. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343312453593">Heger &amp; Salehyan (2007)</xref> argue that the size of the ruling coalitions is an important factor in explaining severity: in general, large coalitions need to resort to lower levels of violence to curb the opposition than smaller ones do, although this trend does not seem to apply in the case of democratic states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453593">Kalyvas (2006)</xref> integrated theory and empirics, focusing on the local variance of violence within civil wars. His explanation of the severity of violence rests on the strategic interaction between incumbents and insurgents. Specifically, violence would be a function of the degree of control exercised by the parties over the territory. Violence is low where one side has complete control and high in areas where control is ‘incomplete’. This is because defection is more likely in these partially contested areas, and actors will resort to high levels of violence in order to prevent it.</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned studies offer no clear answers on the potential role of ethnic heterogeneity in causing higher levels of violence in civil wars. An exception is represented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343312453593">Slack &amp; Doyon (2001)</xref>, who performed one of the first analyses of violence in civil wars using a disaggregated approach. They studied the demographic dynamics of two of the three relevant ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina and found that areas with a high loss of Serbian population in the years before the war underwent more violent events between 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the contributions that restate the importance of looking at ethno-political configurations in accounting for the onset of civil wars. In addition, Weidmann, using a new dataset, has recently provided an interesting evaluation of competing theories about the relationship between ethnicity and the eruption of violence in the Bosnian War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343312453593">Weidmann, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, an explicit attempt to investigate both the spatial and the temporal variation of violence within a civil war is still missing. We propose an argument that highlights the links among ethnicity, political geography, and the severity of violence across time and space in the Bosnian War.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022343312453593">
<title>The argument</title>
<p>Our analysis of the severity of violence in civil wars with strong ethnic features is based on three cornerstones. First, we argue that ethnic issues are essential to understanding the patterns of violence. We do not believe, however, that ethnicity is linked to irrational dynamics of violence mainly driven by ancestral hatred and vengeful instincts. Rather, we expect that armed groups act strategically in order to gain and hold control of the territory. Thus, the second underlying theme of this research is that violence responds to a strategic rationale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453593">Kalyvas, 2006</xref>). Existing studies on intrawar violence are based more or less explicitly on (a combination of) these two approaches (for an example dealing directly with the Bosnian War, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343312453593">Weidmann, 2011</xref>). We argue that there is a third set of considerations, deriving from the rich literature on state formation and from classic insurgent military strategy, which can shed more light on spatial and temporal variation of violence in civil war, the latter being an overlooked but essential dimension of analysis.</p>
<p>With reference to ethnicity, we acknowledge the validity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343312453593">Bhavnani &amp; Miodownik’s (2009)</xref> approach to the study of ethnic salience in order to detect the agents of violence. In Bosnia and Herzegovina the dimension of ethnic identities used to be so important that according to the Bosnian National Institute of Statistics (BNIS), in 1991 only 5.5% of the citizens considered themselves to be ‘Yugoslavs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312453593">BNIS, 1992</xref>). In 1990, for the first multiparty national elections, 84% of the seats were assigned to the three main ethnic and radical parties: SDA (Muslim), SDS (Serb), and HDZ (Croat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343312453593">Burg &amp; Shoup, 1999</xref>). These few but telling hints signal that even though the massive use of armed force fortified ethnic identities and made interethnic relationships even more difficult and adversarial, the processes of ethnicization and radicalization of Bosnian politics and society were already well established before the outbreak of actual violence. We do not assume ‘ethnic civil wars’ to be totally different from non-ethnic internal conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343312453593">Kalyvas &amp; Kocher, 2007</xref>), but if civil wars tend to break out where ethno-nationalist issues are at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343312453593">Buhaug, Cederman &amp; Rød, 2008</xref>) and ethnicity is so salient that political and armed groups will be primarily formed according to ethnic kinship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343312453593">Bhavnani &amp; Miodownik, 2009</xref>), we assume that the ethnic dimension will have a crucial role in explaining the severity of violence during the conflicts.</p>
<p>There are various ways to capture and measure the ethnic distribution of the population living within a certain territory. Using fractionalization and polarization indexes in order to predict the onset of conflicts (as many existing studies do) is profoundly different from using them to understand the severity of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343312453593">Esteban &amp; Ray, 2008</xref>). Moreover, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343312453593">Esteban &amp; Ray (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022343312453593">Weidmann (2011)</xref>, we argue that the severity of violence also strongly depends on the form of the war, which essentially depends on the technology and resources available to the groups. Thus, if the ethnic cleavage is central for the war, then it is also key in understanding the severity of violence, but it decisively interacts with the form of the war. As warfare in Bosnia took on the features of a symmetric conventional civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343312453593">Kalyvas &amp; Balcells, 2010</xref>), we believe that polarization is a more appropriate index for capturing social conflict in this case than fractionalization indexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343312453593">Horowitz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343312453593">Reynal-Querol, 2002</xref>). The index of polarization measures to what extent the distribution of the groups in a certain municipality resembles a bimodal distribution: it reaches higher values when the groups tend to be of the same size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343312453593">Reynal-Querol, 2002</xref>). In the polarization index, the probabilities that two individuals belong to different groups when one of them belongs to group <italic>i</italic> have weight equal to the relative size of group <italic>i</italic> on the given territory. Ethnic polarization is a way to take the power of groups into account, since the relative size of their populations should be a good proxy of the resources they can mobilize. High levels of polarization refer, therefore, to areas marked by relative power parity among the actors; such situations have been linked to higher levels of social conflict and internal political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312453593">Balcells, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343312453593">Benson &amp; Kugler, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanisms that explain the effect of polarization on the severity of violence are rooted in a classic thesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343312453593">Tilly (1978)</xref>, who argued that the areas where contestation is higher (where there is a lack of clear control by one actor) should be the most violent ones. Literature on international relations can also be applied to support this thesis in the field of civil wars: the presence of two large and powerful contestants might not be a cause of conflict (thanks to the mechanism of the balance of power), but once conflict emerges, it is expected to be harsher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343312453593">Kugler &amp; Domke, 1986</xref>). In fact, if a group has to face a large adversary, it will probably have to apply a high level of violence in order to establish its supremacy over the territory at stake. However, it will only be able to sustain such a level of violence during the conflict if it can count on considerable ‘mass’ and resources to use and rely on in the course of the war.</p>
<p>We also consider an index of fractionalization, as many studies on the link between ethnicity and violence have used it. Ethnic fractionalization represents the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belong to different ethnic groups, and it increases monotonically with the number of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343312453593">Alesina et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to polarization, the probabilities that two individuals belong to different groups when one of them belongs to group<italic> i</italic> have the same weight in each term of the index of fractionalization. We calculate both indexes using the data of the last national census completed before the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312453593">BNIS, 1992</xref>) and show that the difference between these two measures of ethnic composition can be easily captured in the case of Bosnian municipalities. In fact, low levels of fractionalization and polarization match perfectly, so that the municipalities with the ten lowest levels of fractionalization and polarization are the same. On the contrary, the indexes clearly diverge at the highest levels, to the point that none of the municipalities listed among the ten highest scores of one variable is included in the ten highest levels of the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343312453593">1</xref>
</sup> Such a discrepancy gives rise to different predictions concerning the highest levels of violence. Highly fragmented areas could be marked by severe violence because encounters among actors are more frequent, thus increasing the likelihood of clashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343312453593">Humphreys &amp; Weinstein, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, we could assume that in ethnic civil wars violence will be most severe in highly fragmented areas if the groups resort to terrorism, or if we expect them to employ terrorist attacks. Terrorism should in fact be easily implementable by small groups with few resources, and it is an effective way to produce many casualties. Nonetheless, the Bosnian conflict was mostly fought by organized groups and techniques such as suicide bombing were never used. Therefore, we expect violence to be most severe where two large groups were present, instead of a higher number of small groups. Such areas are marked by high levels of polarization, but only medium levels of fractionalization (around 0.5).</p>
<p>Consistently, we assume that situations of ‘ethnic dominance’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343312453593">2</xref>
</sup> where a large majority of the population living in a given area belongs to the same group, should show relatively low levels of violence. This hypothesis is in line with the idea that violence follows a strategic rationale, while remaining linked to the configuration of ethno-national groups on the territory. On the one hand, the supremacy of the large group over the territory is already established and its armed militias do not need to engage in bloody clashes to reach their objective, since they aim at maintaining the status quo or at complete dominance that is easy to reach even without large-scale violence. On the other hand, smaller groups cannot reasonably expect to subvert the status quo if they are operating in a situation where the imbalance of forces would lead to suicidal or otherwise unsuccessful acts. In other words, there may be grievances, but there is no real opportunity to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343312453593">Ellingsen, 2000</xref>). Thus, the small group has substantial incentives to accept the other’s supremacy, since even in ethno-nationalist civil wars the relationships among groups and the choice to resort to violence cannot escape a somewhat rational calculation of means and ends.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to investigate whether the different ethnic groups behave differently in cases of predominant presence in a certain area, we have also broken up the variable <italic>ethnic dominance</italic> into three separate variables relative to each ethnicity (Bosniaks, Croats, Serbs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022343312453593">3</xref>
</sup> If the logic of opportunity has a general validity, the identity of the ethnic groups should not make any difference, provided that such groups embody the relevant actors. To sum up, we expect that:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H1:</italic> The level of ethnic polarization should be positively correlated with the severity of violence. Consistently, violence should be most severe where fractionalization approaches 0.50.</p>
<p>
<italic>H2:</italic> Areas marked by ‘ethnic dominance’ should show relatively low levels of violence.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The considerations above should also explain the theoretical difference between our research and other studies on the features of violence in presence of two large groups. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453593">Kalyvas (2006)</xref>, areas where control is split should experience low violence, as individuals can exploit the protection of the opposing group if they change side. We argue, instead, that the presence of two large groups is a key factor in explaining the severity of violence. This is because ethnic defection is unlikely: in the Bosnian War, a Serb is always a Serb and a Bosniak always a Bosniak.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343312453593">4</xref>
</sup> In this sense, the presence of strong ethnic features in the war shapes the definition of the warring parties and of their interaction at the local level, but does not wholly affect the ‘strategic dimension’ of conflict. Armed groups, be they defined according to ethnic lines or not, always look for territorial control, and for this reason the pattern of violence changes through time.</p>
<p>In fact, limiting the analysis to the strategic consequences of ethnic groups’ distribution tells only one part of the story. Previous studies have failed to address the theoretical consequences of adding the time dimension to the analysis, while we argue that the weight of the variables that explain violence is time-variant. This is clear, for instance, to scholars analyzing state formation and to those dealing with conventional and insurgents’ military strategy. If the absence/fall of central authority recreates a quasi-anarchic political arena, the same process of reconstitution of the political units is linked to violence in two ways. This link is little addressed in the civil war literature but it highlights that groups strive for two constitutive elements: internal homogenization and external consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343312453593">Finer, 1974</xref>). Homogenization is but one of the activities of political agents willing to establish their control over the territory. The other major aim, once a desirable level of homogeneity is reached, is the consolidation of borders and territorial expansion.</p>
<p>Obtaining control over the territory is the first goal of armed groups, resulting in a process of ethnic homogenization that causes the majority of the victims and it is the most important determinant of violence in the first phase of the war. Although there are elements of overlap between internal and external consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343312453593">Tilly, 1990</xref>), the former process should occur earlier and have the features summarily described by Hypotheses 1 and 2. In the case of the Bosnian War, this phase should approximately correspond to 1992 and 1993, when the hostilities acquire a highly localized feature and then become marked by mass deportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343312453593">Kalyvas &amp; Sambanis, 2005</xref>). In a second phase of the war, though, the areas of control are already fairly well established, the frontlines are quite clearly determined, and this form of violence should decrease.</p>
<p>This diachronic divide is linked to the need for internal consolidation to precede external consolidation, and it is mostly due to the interplay of operational, logistical, and organizational factors. Having acquired control of an area, groups would need to strengthen the positions they conquered. This shifts the frontlines from internally divided municipalities to those on wider political-military frontlines. Operational requirements contribute to explaining the changing patterns of action of armed groups. From a military standpoint, this pattern of violence is linked to the need to first create the bases for action, and only then consolidate externally and, to an extent, expand. Besides being a shared cornerstone of conventional military theory, this point has also been addressed by strategists of irregular warfare, starting from Mao Zedong, who noticed how essential it was for insurgent forces to attentively phase their action by first consolidating their political control in geographically bounded areas and subsequently attempting to intensify their struggle in wider areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312453593">Knorr, 1962</xref>). Sound logistics, both in conventional and irregular warfare, also requires the establishment of some form of territorial control before a group can effectively focus its attention on protecting wider areas. This rationale holds even if a group wants to expand its areas of control. Lastly, armed groups, especially if not existent or scarcely institutionalized before the onset of war, need time to acquire organizational as well as military strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343312453593">Johnston, 2008</xref>). Ethnic cleansing operations within a municipality require a less developed military structure than those devoted to external consolidation. Time is essential for armed groups to develop and thus be able to extend their activities, shifting their areas of operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312453593">Knorr, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of hypotheses, there are two major consequences. First, the importance of the ethnic distribution as an explaining variable of the severity of violence should decrease. This does not mean that ethnicity becomes unimportant, as ethnicity-based groups remain in fact the key agents of violence. Still, the way ethnicity is linked to violence changes, since the role of polarization in causing violence decreases. Second, consistent with the idea that even in ethno-nationalist civil wars violence follows rational, political, and strategic logics, the fighting should now focus on the zones that are deemed most important in redefining the territorial balance among the factions and in achieving peace on the terms of the parties involved – what we might call ‘frontlines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312453593">Kalyvas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312453593">Balcells, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case under scrutiny, a sound operational definition of the variable should take into consideration the internal borders between the entities that then became the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srprska (RS). This is not just due to the endogenous development of the hostilities, which clearly marked that point as the frontline of confrontation, but also to external factors. The international peace negotiations, in fact, interacted with the internal situation in shaping the frontlines. The peace talks that took place at the international level recognized that the ‘situation on the field’ was to be respected in any possible agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343312453593">Woodward, 1995</xref>). Therefore, in the last phase of the war, the armed groups had a remarkable incentive to expand the territory under their rule and to try to establish their control over strategically relevant and valuable areas. We admit that this operational definition presents problems in terms of generalization and in capturing the complexity of the Bosnian War. Specifically, the variable indicating the municipalities located on the border between the FBiH and the RS is not directly transferable to other cases, but we want to highlight the importance of the strategic issues in ethnic conflicts, and we believe it is useful at least to sketch indicators of the geographic/strategic dimension of violence. The argument should, in fact, have broader validity, as any analysis of violence in civil wars cannot leave aside territorial considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312453593">Balcells, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Two related but distinct hypotheses emerge from the considerations above:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>H3:</italic> The influence of ethnic polarization on the severity of violence should decrease over time.</p>
<p>
<italic>H4:</italic> The impact of geographic location, namely the position of a municipality on internal borders, should increase over time as the strategic value of the frontlines increases.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The severity of violence, our dependent variable, is measured by the number of deaths that occurred in the Bosnian municipalities during military actions. Data concerning the number of victims derive from a recent research project carried out by the Research and Documentation Center of Sarajevo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343312453593">RDC, 2008</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343312453593">5</xref>
</sup> The project’s result was the most comprehensive database on the victims of the Bosnian war grounded on primary sources, without resorting to large-scale estimates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022343312453593">6</xref>
</sup> The total number of victims recorded (97,207) includes only persons killed or kidnapped during direct military activities. This is in line with the expectations of those experts who considered previous estimates inflated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343312453593">Tabeau &amp; Bijak, 2005</xref>). Considering the time passed since the hostilities came to an end, in our study ‘missing persons’ are equated with the dead. Typically, these are people taken away by armed groups of the opposing ethnicity and who never made it back home. Although their bodies have never been found, researchers could not gather any information indicating that they escaped the war and settled somewhere else. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that persons who are still ‘missing’ as a result of military actions are still alive and living elsewhere as refugees, or that they add up to a significant number. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343312453593">Brunborg, Lyngstad &amp; Urdal (2003)</xref> reach the same conclusion in their study on the Serbian attack against Srebrenica, analyzing the reports of the International Committee of the Red Cross which have also been used by the RDC staff to double-check their database. The severity of violence shows remarkable variation through space (see Table III in the online appendix) and time. 1992 was the most violent year, with 45,510 deaths. Violence then decreased in 1993 and 1994 (19,129 and 9,600 deaths, respectively), to increase again in 1995 (19,338).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022343312453593">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Data concerning the population of the municipalities and their ethnic composition come from the BNIS Yearbook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312453593">BNIS, 1992</xref>). They refer to the last national survey carried out in the country in 1991, one year before the war. Thus, ethnic identification is self-assigned, since the citizens were asked to indicate the ethnic group they felt themselves part of. The data on the ethnic composition of the population remain at the same levels throughout the war because, to our knowledge, no data on the ethnic distribution of the population relative to the years of the war exist. Therefore, the values in our study overestimate ethnic heterogeneity after 1992. This would be a problem if we assumed that ethnicity is still the main driving force of violence in that phase. Since we argue that the ethnic dimension is <italic>not</italic> the most important factor at that stage, we are testing our hypotheses in a more difficult way. If we notice a reduction in the influence of the ethnic indexes on the severity of violence in the last two years of war, our results are strengthened rather than weakened by the fact that the data on ethnicity do not follow the process of ethnic homogenization that took place on the ground.</p>
<p>However, in order to perform a robustness check on our results, we also use the data on the ethnic distribution of the population of 56 municipalities calculated by professional demographers on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (see online appendix). These reports provide data on the size of the ethnic groups in 1997 and we use them to construct the index of polarization relative to the years of the war in that sample of municipalities. As we do not have accurate information on the way the population changed through the years in those municipalities, we calculate the difference between the size of the ethnic groups in 1991 and in 1997 and we assume that they changed with constant yearly rates. Each ethnic group is marked by its own yearly rate. We then calculate the estimated polarization index for the missing years and test our models also on this sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022343312453593">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>A number of control variables are included in our models, as they might constitute alternative explanations of the severity of violence. The presence of rough terrain might increase the severity of violence because it is the ideal environment for guerrilla-style operations. Even though guerrilla activity did not represent the central form of warfare in the Bosnian War, we control for open terrain, a type of terrain that is mainly flat, free from dense vegetation and one which does not provide good shelter and opportunity for irregular military operations. We also take into account the presence of urbanized areas, since they might favor guerilla operations and increase the risk of military activities involving civilians. The variable that accounts for open terrain is simply the percentage of cultivated land relative to the total surface of each municipality, while the variable that refers to urban areas is represented by the percentage of municipal land occupied by buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312453593">BNIS, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Political geography also represents an important factor in shaping violence in civil wars. In fact, the presence and actions of bordering countries that intervene directly or indirectly in the conflict affect the likelihood of the onset as well as the course of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312453593">Cederman, Girardin &amp; Gleditsch, 2009</xref>). When contiguous states decide to directly intervene in order to ‘protect’ co-ethnics, respond to incursions (or risks of incursions) in their own territories, or expand their influence in the region profiting from a situation of crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343312453593">Posen, 1993</xref>), bordering areas can be marked by high levels of violence. The same can happen if external states indirectly intervene in the conflict by providing support to one faction and relying on it to reach the aforementioned goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312453593">Lacina (2006)</xref>, for instance, argues that the conflicts marked by external intervention are more violent than the ‘purely’ internal ones. In this study, we control for the contiguity of municipalities with the borders of Serbia and Croatia. Taking bordering areas into account is important, not only for possible external influences, but also because borders usually run along strategically important lines. Especially in the second phase of the war, when the zones under the control of the various groups are more clearly determined, violence is likely to concentrate around those areas, which, for instance, are vital for access to larger regions.</p>
<p>Popular accounts of civil wars and collections of memories often point to revenge as one of the major determinants of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312453593">Cohen, 1998</xref>). According to this view, after an initial period in which clashes occur in response to various ‘exogenous’ causes, these conflicts would turn into vicious circles of violence that lead to protracted fighting and cause high levels of violence in certain fixed areas. We take into account this perspective by considering the effects of previous violence on the severity of violence in a given year. For this reason we include a lagged dependent variable in our panel analysis.</p>
<p>Per capita income has been linked to the onset of civil wars through different causal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343312453593">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2003</xref>). The most recent literature on the relationship between civil war and social and economic conditions has relied on spatially disaggregated data that can locate relatively poorer regions within countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343312453593">Buhaug et al., 2011</xref>). We include the income per capita of the municipalities in the models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref> to check whether income at the local level also has an impact on the intensity of violence.</p>
<p>Finally, several important military factories were situated in Central Bosnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343312453593">Jane’s, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312453593">Shrader, 2003</xref>) and their location could have influenced the development of military operations. The military groups were clearly interested in controlling those factories and therefore the areas around them could have experienced particularly intense violence in the phases of the war when the rival factions tried to seize them.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To estimate our models on the severity of violence, we have chosen a semi-logarithmic form. The dependent variable and the independent continuous variables are expressed in logarithmic form, in order to reduce the skewness in the data. The dummy variables and the indexes that assume values between 0 and 1 are expressed in their original form. The first part of the empirical analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref>) consists of cross-sectional OLS regressions where the units of analysis are represented by the 109 municipalities of Bosnia and the number of deaths refers to the whole period of the war.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022343312453593">8</xref>
</sup> Given the nature of the data, we used clustered robust standard errors to deal with possible problems of clustering and heteroskedasticity, even though the White tests we performed did not show any relevant problem of the sort. The second part of the quantitative analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref>) assesses the changes in the relevance of the determinants of violence during the civil war, and it is based on time-series cross-section data. In order to show the shift in the logics and geography of violence during the war, we introduced multiplicative interactions between yearly dummy variables and the index of ethnic polarization, the variable indicating the future border between the FBiH and the RS, the variables that identify <table-wrap id="table2-0022343312453593" position="float">

</table-wrap>the municipalities situated on the borders with Croatia and Serbia, and the variable indicating the presence of military factories, respectively. We estimate four models to test our hypothesis, according to which the relevance of the ethnic dimension as a determinant of intense violence decreases over time. We also use them to investigate the influence of political geography on the severity of violence, especially in the second phase of the war. Taking into account the presence of heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in our panel dataset, we initially used panel-corrected standard errors and introduced the lagged dependent variable, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343312453593">Beck &amp; Katz (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343312453593">1996</xref>). Analyzing the relevance of the lagged dependent variable is also appropriate for our research. It allows us to account for the widespread idea that civil wars tend to generate spirals of violence because revenge might be one of the main determinants of violent actions. However, we acknowledge that the PCSE approach is designed for ‘small N, large T’ datasets that do not correspond to the features of our panel. The PCSE method estimates the full N x N cross-sectional covariance matrix, and this estimate tends to be rather imprecise when the ratio T/N is small. On the other hand, given the nature of our data, cross-sectional or spatial dependence could produce inconsistent estimates of the standard errors of the parameters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312453593">Driscoll &amp; Kraay (1998)</xref> provide a non-parametric estimator for the variance-covariance matrix that proves to be robust to very general forms of cross-sectional as well as temporal dependence. Through Monte Carlo simulations, Driscoll &amp; Kraay show the usefulness of their covariance matrix estimator for solving the problems that occur with other large-T consistent methods when utilized in cases where the cross-sectional dimension is clearly dominant over the temporal one. Thus, we base our comments on the results of these standard errors. We have also performed the models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref> using PCSEs as a robustness check: no relevant differences are recorded. Results have been omitted for reasons of space but are available upon request. Both methods are also applied in Table V (see online appendix), where the analysis includes the squared term of the index of ethnic fractionalization in order to perform a closer study of the impact of this variable on the severity of violence. Such analysis allows us to check whether fractionalization has a non-linear effect on violence, and we find that this is the case.</p>

<title>Results and comments</title>
<p>The empirical analysis shows that the ethnic dimension is essential in explaining the severity of violence. However, it does not seem to follow the ‘logic of hatred’ often mentioned in narratives about ethnic conflicts, according to which violence in these contexts would be mainly expressive, without a precise strategy and strongly driven by spirals of revenges in given areas. Instead, the results suggest that severe violence is the product of high levels of contestation on the ground. One may refer to typically strategic logics and military issues to discover the reasons why it assumes the highest levels in some areas.</p>
<p>In the analysis of the war as a whole, ethnic polarization proves to be a significant catalyst for severe violence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref>, Model 2): violence is higher in areas where two relatively large groups exist. Fractionalization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref>, Model 1) also turns out to be a significant and important explanation for violence. Assessing the relative importance of the two variables and the mechanisms that link them to violence is more difficult because in the Bosnian case they are highly correlated and for this reason not included in the same model. Nonetheless, it is possible to understand more about these two different aspects of the ethnic dimension. A comparison of the goodness of fit relative to the models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref> shows that polarization provides a slightly higher level of R<sup>2</sup> than fractionalization does, and it also has a stronger predictive power for the highest levels of violence.</p>
<p>Moreover, a simple analysis shows how four municipalities that belong to the list of the ten most polarized areas (Foča, Rogatica, Vlasenica, and Zvornik) are also included in the list of the ten most violent municipalities, while none of the ten most fragmented municipalities appears on the list. This happens because the effect of ethnic fractionalization on violence is not linear: in Table V, the positive coefficient of fractionalization shows that violence tends to increase up to a certain point, while the negative coefficient of its squared term points out that the level of violence decreases beyond such a point, giving rise to a ‘bell-shaped’ relationship. This suggests that violence is linked to a polarized rather than to an extremely fragmented situation: in other words, violence develops where there is a plurality of groups, but such groups must also be rather large in order to produce severe violence. As we expected, the most violent areas show medium levels of fractionalization: the mean of the index for the ten most violent municipalities is 0.496. Once the war has started, violence tends to be particularly harsh where relatively large groups face each other in a situation approaching power parity. In the case of Foča, for instance, the cleansing of the Bosniak population – which was relatively larger than the Serbs – was especially harsh because the similar size of the groups required large-scale actions in order for one to prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343312453593">Cigar, 1995</xref>: 60–61).</p>

<p>Model 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref> confirms the hypothesis on ethnic dominance (H2). Violence is higher where ethnic groups have to fight harder in order to achieve supremacy, and lower where such supremacy is already attained or very unlikely to be attained for a group that is too small. Contrary to popular belief, even in the most notable example of ethnic conflict, the intensity of violence is linked to calculations of costs and benefits. The 13 least violent municipalities (in terms of deaths over population) are all dominated by a single ethnic group. In contrast, in 27 out of the 28 most violent municipalities, there is not a dominant group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022343312453593">9</xref>
</sup> It is important to notice how the hypothesis on dominance holds independently of which ethnic group is dominant: even dominance of the Bosniaks becomes relevant if we exclude from the analysis the municipality of Srebrenica (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312453593">Table I</xref>, Model 4).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022343312453593">10</xref>
</sup> The latter represents an outlier, as it is the most violent municipality of the country, and as most of the victims (concentrated in 1995, when a tragic and famous episode of mass killing took place) were civilians, also coming from other municipalities and caught in an area that was defined as a `safe area' by the United Nations. The results of all other models, however, do not change if we exclude the case of Srebrenica from the analysis.</p>
<p>Taking time into consideration allows for a more detailed analysis, and helps us avoid an overly simplistic perspective about the severity of violence in ethnic conflicts. In general, the relationship between time and violence is markedly U-shaped. Violence is particularly intense in the first and in the last years of the war, while in the middle phase of the war the number of victims is lower. With direct reference to the impact of ethnic polarization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022343312453593">Figure 1</xref> (and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref>, years 1994–95) shows that it proves to be very important in the first phase of the war while it loses its impact as the hostilities continue, in accordance with Hypothesis 3. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022343312453593">Figure 1</xref> is based on the results of Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref>, but the strong downward trend of the coefficient of ethnic polarization is also clear in the other specifications of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref>. The robustness checks that were performed to test the same models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref> on the 56 municipalities for which we can estimate polarization during the war confirm the findings (see Table VI, online appendix). In all models, ethnic polarization is not significant at standard levels in 1994 and in 1995, and its effect decreases even more strongly through time.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the war, the main challenges to ethnic groups’ control come in fact from the ‘outside’ of the zones controlled by the ethnic groups, and therefore violence shifts to territorially and politically strategic points. In this phase, the territory has become more ethnically homogeneous, armed groups have developed organizationally (the organization of the Bosnian ArBiH, for instance, is not clearly shaped until well into 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312453593">Shrader, 2003</xref>), and the control of the armed groups over their respective areas is rather stable. Consistently with Hypothesis 4, the frontlines become well-defined around what would then become the border between the new political entities FBiH and RS. As military commentators observed, with time ‘military operations reached a stalemate’ and ‘defensive trenches … began to appear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343312453593">O’Ballance, 1995</xref>: 232). International factors play a role too: the actions of the international community during the course of the negotiations influenced the ways in which violence developed in the last year of the war, by recognizing that the situation ‘on the field’ was a starting point for designing the new territorial arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343312453593">Burg &amp; Shoup, 1999</xref>). Municipalities on the frontlines, that is, on the border of RS and FBiH, tended to experience intense violence, as they represented the ultimate stake in the fight between Serbs and Bosniaks in the last phases of the war, when the new political and territorial assets had to be defined.</p>
<p>Political geography does matter in other ways too. Taking into account the whole war, contiguity with Serbia is robustly linked to violence, while municipalities bordering Croatia were significantly less violent. Furthermore, the impact of geographic location also changes over time, reflecting the different phases of the war (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312453593">Table II</xref>). In 1993, as the scale of external military operations decreases, the contiguity to both borders is actually linked to less violence. In 1994, municipalities at the Croatian border tend to be more violent: 5 of the 6 most violent municipalities are contiguous to Croatia. Conversely, being on the border of Serbia significantly reduces the intensity of violence in the same year. Such a result, however, should be read through a more ‘qualitative’ analysis. Some of the most violent municipalities in 1994 that happen to be on the border with Croatia, such as Bosanska Krupa, Cazin, and the ‘safe area’ of Bihać, are also bordering or close to RS and represent strategically relevant areas for the Serbian forces who are aiming to extend their territorial control eastwards. Bihać, for instance, is considered particularly important to the Serbian forces, and to the Muslim forces of Fikret Abdic (allied to the Serbs), because of its position on the lines of communication towards the Serbian-held territories in Bosnia and for its relatively developed rail network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343312453593">Cigar, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022343312453593">Woodward (1995)</xref> has noticed that the ‘safe area’ was actually a trap for the people staying within it, in a way somewhat similar to Srebrenica. Indeed, it also represented a haven for (Bosniak) militias that were then the object of Serbian attacks that involved a large number of civilians.</p>
<p>In 1995, the same geographical setting has the opposite impact: being at the borders with Serbia increases violence, while the Croatian border is associated with low-intensity violence. This divergence is at least partly due to the different involvement of Croatia and Serbia in the war. The intervention of Croatia is on a smaller scale and limited to areas densely populated by Croats that are not necessarily on the borders (such as Mostar). Serbia, instead, seemed to aim more directly at the creation of an autonomous Serbian-dominated entity, with a more robust intervention focusing on bordering areas.</p>
<p>Other geographic variables related to the nature of ‘terrain’, which were found to be relevant for predicting the outbreak of violence in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343312453593">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2003</xref>), do not show an impact on violence here. One of the reasons for such a result, as mentioned above, is that the Bosnian war cannot be exclusively characterized as an insurgency (where mountainous terrain is fundamental for the emergence and development of armed struggle); it is rather a case of ‘conventional’ civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343312453593">Kalyvas &amp; Balcells, 2010</xref>). This might help in explaining why the location of military factories becomes a significant factor in a phase of the war (1993 and 1994) that corresponds to the period when major conventional military operations take place in Central Bosnia (the area is generally less violent in 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312453593">Shrader, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, and consistent with our overall hypotheses but contrary to some popular accounts of civil wars, the level of previous violence in a municipality is not relevant in predicting severe violence in the same place in the following year. This does not necessarily mean that revenge cannot be an important reason to resort to violence at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312453593">Cohen, 1998</xref>). However, when looking at the main phases of the war, even in an ethno-national conflict such as the Bosnian war, the severity of violence does not show marked spiral dynamics and the level of past violence does not prove to be among the relevant factors for locating the most violent areas today.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the rich literature on civil wars, there are still relatively few attempts to analyze the variation in the severity of a country’s internal violence during a civil war. This study is an attempt to explore such a field by focusing on the war that ravaged Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s. Focusing on this war allows us to investigate the relationship between the ethnic composition of the population and the intensity of violence at the local level across time and space. The ethnic distribution of the population proves to be extremely relevant, at least in the first phase of the conflict. Here, it is reasonable to assume that the goal of creating ‘ethnically cleansed’ areas was the major catalyst for violence. The relative size of groups is a good predictor of violence: the presence of large groups is consistently associated with severe violence.</p>
<p>Including the time dimension in the analysis highlights several remarkable variations in the course of the conflict. If ethnic polarization is a good predictor of the intensity of conflict in the first phase of the war, its impact decreases dramatically in the second phase. This shift in the focus of the clashes towards more strategic and military issues can be assessed with variables accounting for the geographic dimension of the fight: clashes over the control of military frontlines, defined here as the ‘new’ internal borders, become a major factor behind violence. The massive external intervention of Serbia also proves to be decisive in explaining the surge in violence in the latter phase of war. On the whole, we can claim that in ethnic civil wars such as Bosnia’s, looking at the ethnic dimension is essential to locate different levels of violence across space, but the strategic and operational dimensions of military activities also play a fundamental part in explaining the severity of violence over time.</p>
<p>We believe that this study has three major implications. First, in terms of approach, it shows the potential of looking at intrawar dynamics through spatial and temporal analysis of violence. This type of research on all types of civil wars is still underdeveloped. In particular, introducing temporal variation might shed light on the changing weight across time of the relevant variables explaining the dynamics of violence. A similar approach should also be combined with more thorough and theory-led case studies taking an in-depth look at the dynamics of internal violence of civil wars.</p>
<p>Second, the article shows that groups do not just aspire to ‘internal homogenization’, but also aim to constitute larger areas that can be defended (‘external consolidation’), and that the former process is chronologically anterior to the latter. This study argues that this is likely to happen in civil wars according to rather clearly defined ethnic lines. While the exportability of this finding to other types of conflicts would require further research, we argue that similar mechanisms should be at play in all large-scale confrontations that require some degree of territorial control. This should happen both if the aim is political (e.g. secession) and if the aim is strategic/operational (e.g. the need to establish military strongholds).</p>
<p>This leads to a third, broader point of the article: the need to look at the ‘military dimension of civil wars’. As indicated by Kalyvas, looking at the conflicts ‘from within’ permits a fine-grained view of how military operations affect the severity of violence in a war. This should be integrated in an approach to the study of violence in civil wars that focuses on more traditional, but often forgotten, military considerations. It would also be useful for increasing the knowledge on the ways armed groups act on the ground and for examining how external actions (be they associated with international peacekeeping or full-scale armed intervention) affect the patterns of ‘domestic’ violence.</p>
