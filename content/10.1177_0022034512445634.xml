<p>Over two decades ago, in a workshop held in Bethesda, MD, USA, a group of experts agreed to definitions for the terms ‘early childhood caries’ (ECC) and ‘severe early childhood caries’ (S-ECC). In children younger than 3 years of age, any sign of smooth-surface caries was indicative of severe early childhood caries. From ages 3 through 5, 1 or more cavitated, missing (due to caries), or filled smooth surfaces in primary maxillary anterior teeth, or dmf &gt; 4 (age 3), &gt; 5 (age 4), or &gt; 6 (age 5) surfaces constituted S-ECC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512445634">Drury <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the clinical review in the present issue, Caufield and co-workers address the role of hypoplasia in early childhood caries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). They suggest a new subcategory of S-ECC called “Hypoplasia-associated severe early childhood caries”, or “HAS-ECC”, a differentiation from other forms of early childhood caries warranted by its distinct etiology, clinical presentation, and eventual management.</p>

<title>Enamel Hypoplasia is Associated with Caries Risk</title>
<p>In an early report, a circular type of rampant decay affecting the primary dentition in Hawaiians was described under the name ‘odontoclasia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512445634">Jones <italic>et al</italic>., 1930</xref>). Later studies showed that the condition was due to caries involving hypoplastic enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512445634">Baume and Meyer, 1966</xref>), the type of hypoplasia being called linear hypoplasia and occurring on the labial surfaces of primary maxillary incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445634">Pindborg, 1970</xref>). The strong tendency of caries development was notable in areas affected by neonatal lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445634">Pindborg, 1970</xref>). The importance of enamel hypoplasia as a risk factor for ECC was also recognized, as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022034512445634">
<title>What about Hypomineralized Enamel?</title>
<p>During enamel formation, ameloblasts are susceptible to local and systemic disturbances that may be reflected in the fully formed enamel as hypoplasia, hypomineralization, or a combination of the two. The neonatal lines contain poorly mineralized enamel, and by the opening of the line, enamel is often hypomineralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512445634">Sabel <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In HAS-ECC, hypomineralization may increase the susceptibility of hypoplastic enamel to caries. Hypomineralization with enamel hypoplasia has been found to be the defect most frequently associated with dental caries in primary teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512445634">Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, increased attention has been paid to demarcated hypomineralization defects in the second primary and first permanent molars. The first epidemiological studies on hypomineralized defects as an entity in first permanent molars, and often also in incisors, were published in 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512445634">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>). The authors used the term ‘idiopathic enamel hypomineralization’. Later, the term Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) became widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512445634">Weerheijm <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Correspondingly, hypomineralization in the second primary molars was termed as ‘deciduous molar hypomineralization’ (DMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512445634">Elfrink <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In a study by Elfrink <italic>et al</italic>. in this issue, the prevalence of 9.0% for DMH and 8.7% for MIH was found in 5- to 6-year-old Dutch children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512445634">Elfrink <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). A correlation between DMH and MIH was noticed. Children with DMH had an odds ratio of 4.4 for developing MIH, indicating that at least some etiological factors are shared and affect these teeth at the same time. Interestingly, this entity or these entities were not described in the classic book by J.J. Pindborg, <italic>Pathology of Dental Hard Tissues</italic>, published in 1970. In contrast, he provided detailed descriptions of, for example, neonatal enamel hypoplasia and its role in caries development. He also included several illustrations of neonatal enamel hypoplasia, but not of severely hypomineralized first permanent molars, such as are frequently seen in clinical practices today. For a late description of MIH or DMH as an entity, and for a lack of its presentation in an old classic textbook, one can speculate that hypomineralization in the second primary and in the first permanent molars and incisors is a new phenomenon. Its etiology is still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512445634">Alaluusua, 2010</xref>), but it may be at least partly linked with systemic factors that did not exist some decades ago.</p>
<p>Risk factors for enamel hypoplasia in primary teeth have been thoroughly reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Some of them, such as premature birth and medical problems during the first year of the child’s life, have also been suggested to underlie MIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512445634">Alaluusua, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445634">Brogårdh-Roth <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). An interesting difference in risk factors is related to socio-economic status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> emphasized that a risk factor for HAS-ECC is specific antecedent conditions shared by children living in poverty. This does not seem to be a case in MIH. On the contrary, two recent studies suggest an opposite relation. In a report from Argentina, it was found that patients with better access to health care had greater prevalence and degree of severity of MIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512445634">Biondi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In line with this, a British study found that there was an association between prevalence of MIH and deprivation quintiles with a positive correlation in the first 4 quintiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512445634">Balmer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Why Defining Caries-Associated Developmental Enamel Defects is Important</title>
<p>MIH has been associated with increased caries prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512445634">Leppäniemi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512445634">Preusser <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512445634">Cho <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512445634">da Costa-Silva <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Hypomineralization was also found to be a risk factor of caries in second primary molars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512445634">Elfrink <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). I agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref> that it would be of value to distinguish hypoplasia-associated severe early childhood caries as a subgroup of S-ECC, but I would like to emphasize that developmental enamel defects—whether hypoplasia, hypomineralization, or in combination—can increase caries risk. As pointed out by Caufield <italic>et al</italic>., HAS-ECC increases treatment need, and children often need general anesthesia because of the severity of the disease and their young age. Furthermore, therapies that may work in controlling or prevention of other types of caries are likely to be less effective in hypoplastic teeth, because the structural integrity of the teeth is compromised prior to the emergence of the affected teeth into the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445634">Caufield <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). The same problems are present in DMH and MIH. The impact of treatment need due to hypomineralized second primary and first permanent molars varies with the prevalence of the conditions. In Finland, with low caries prevalence and fairly high prevalence of MIH, it was found that in a group of 7- to 13-year-old children, 44% of the first permanent molars demanding restorative treatment or being restored or extracted were affected with hypomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512445634">Leppäniemi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). In a Swedish study, children with MIH had undergone dental treatment of their first molars nearly 10 times as often as children without the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512445634">Jälevik and Klingberg, 2002</xref>). Thus, early diagnosis of enamel defects and the recognition of caries risk at both the individual and population levels are important. A new subgroup of caries associated with acquired developmental enamel defects would emphasize their importance and their distinct etiology. The subgroup could be defined as “caries associated with developmental defects of enamel” (DDE-C), with the following sub-conditions: HAS-ECC, “caries associated with deciduous molar hypomineralization” (DMH-C) or “caries associated with molar-incisor hypomineralization” (MIH-C). When the impact of MIH or DMH on caries indices is assessed, the DDE-DMF, MIH-DMF, or DMH-dmf indices could be applied.</p>
<p>In conclusion, acquired enamel defects have an impact on caries development. They present one factor of the multifactorial disease. Better pre- and post-natal care and nutrition are likely to decrease the prevalence of HAS-ECC. Caries control and treatment of severely affected hypomineralized molars have been challenging. Therefore, as in HAS-ECC, primary prevention, <italic>i.e.</italic>, prevention of the development of the defects, would be important. Only when we know more about the causative factors behind MIH and DMH is primary prevention possible. I hope that ongoing prospective observations in humans and experimental studies in animals will clarify the etiology of these entities.</p>
