<p>Emerging technologies bring opportunity to enhance patient safety and reduce health risks to the hospital population; however, the dynamic nature of the healthcare environment and new equipment may also bring new risks for infection to patients. This study addresses the emergence of the use of mobile phones in healthcare, introduced as a technology to advance support for patient safety. Applications on these phones allow evidence based guidance to be accessible at the point of care, but also bring the inherent risk associated with their use at the bedside. These risks include infection, and therein the practical problem of cleaning with appropriate products and processes to ensure the phone is not a risk in itself of cross-transmission of organisms between patients and healthcare staff.</p>
<p>The findings from this study contribute to the developing evidence base in this field, indicating that if there is a potential for cross-transmission of organisms from patients to healthcare workers and from healthcare workers to their phones and other equipment used at the bedside, the inverse is also theoretically possible too. The study has gone further than previous research published to date, in that it has examined this longitudinally and in an operating theatre context. Whilst the study is small, it demonstrates that the nature of contamination of organisms on phones is transient. It also highlights the importance of future studies using the method of contact plating rather than swabbing alone in optimally identifying the microorganisms on equipment. The authors call for further research to inform evidence based infection control policy on the use of personal equipment in healthcare settings, and in particular, the methods used for cleaning equipment. A potential confounder present in observational studies of this nature is that hand hygiene compliance was not measured.</p>
<p>Hand hygiene is noted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be the single most important intervention in infection prevention and control and yet hand hygiene compliance is known to be suboptimal in healthcare workers. The five moments for hand hygiene described by WHO are: before touching a patient, before procedures, after body fluid exposure, after touching a patient, and after touching the environment or equipment. Thus if compliance with these moments were observed by all healthcare workers with every patient and every time, the risk associated with the handling of mobile phones would be minimised and care would be safer. The researchers of this paper call for more research on the evidence base for use of these phones in practice and this is a reasonable gap in the evidence to identify. However, a focus for further research on the reasons for poor compliance with hand hygiene might be a better strategy as an intervention to reduce the risk associated with personal mobile phone used in healthcare and for infection prevention and control overall.</p>
