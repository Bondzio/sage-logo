<p>Over the past 2 decades, administering childhood immunizations has become a major headache for the practicing pediatrician. On one side are the alternative medicine advocates and the Hollywood celebrities, while on the other side are university physicians and scientists and public health officials from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One of the strongest advocates for immunization is Paul Offit, who has written a number of well-received books on the subject.<sup>

<p>The divide between the provaccine and antivaccine camps is wide and seemingly growing, with often little hope for compromise. Into this battle has come Mark Largent, the single parent of an infant daughter and associate professor of history and director of the Science, Technology, Environment, and Public Policy Specialization at James Madison College of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. He is also the author of the acclaimed 2007 book <italic>Breeding Contempt: The History of Coerced Sterilization in the United States</italic>.<sup>

<p>Largent approaches the subject of vaccines from a unique vantage point: a historian of biomedical science who must sort through the vast amount of provaccine and antivaccine information to decide upon the best course of health care for his daughter who was left motherless at age 19 months. Largent recounts his own personal struggles through the journey with his daughter as he narrates the reader through the key arguments associated with vaccines. The book is relatively short—just 176 main text pages divided into 6 chapters plus an introduction and a conclusion. In his first 2 chapters, he describes the widely acknowledged vaccine successes and the small yet vocal antivaccine movement that struggled to be heard up until the 1990s.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, he describes the unintended consequences of the 1997 FDA Modernization Act, which included a provision to create a list of drugs and foods that contained mercury. Since its creation in the 1970s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency had vocally campaigned against mercury as a critical environmental toxin producing significant harm to the nervous system of unborn babies, infants, and young children, alerting parents to the terrible dangers of this substance. Meanwhile, thimerosal (ethyl mercury) was being used as a preservative in the multidose vaccine vials used to immunize infants and children. This presence of thimerosal in vaccines became widely known as a result of the listing required by the FDA Modernization Act at around the same time that various articles were appearing suggesting an unexplained epidemic of autism diagnoses. Despite no scientific evidence to connect thimerosal with autism, an industry consensus developed that “thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precautionary measure” (p. 78). Of course, this move gave the antivaccine advocates an opening to raise public doubts about the reliability of provaccine advocates. Interestingly, Largent points out that thimerosal is still present in some multidose vaccine containers but not in single-dose containers. Unfortunately, vaccination of children can be a money-losing activity in many clinical pediatric practices, and the extra expense of single-dose containers would only add to the financial burden for pediatricians. Largent states that despite the scientific evidence, parents learning that their child had received a mercury-containing vaccine would be “compelled to ask themselves, how much smarter, happier, well behaved, or better adjusted could my child have been had he or she not been injected with vaccines that contain mercury” (p. 83)? </p>
<p>Chapter 4 discusses the controversy stirred by Andrew Wakefield’s now discredited assertion that administration of the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine produced a gastrointestinal inflammatory condition that subsequently led to brain injury manifested as autism. Wakefield’s ostracization by medical authorities served to turn him into a folk hero and helped to radicalize the antivaccine movement. In chapter 5, Largent describes the cult of celebrity (highlighting Jenny McCarthy) associated with the antivaccine movement and how the media attention has fueled this movement.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 and the concluding chapter are the most important reading in this book. Largent identifies as the underlying issue in the vaccine controversy the fact that scientists and public health officials seem to pontificate with an appeal to authority about vague public health issues, while parents want to be addressed individually and directly with answers about their specific child. As an example, Largent quotes Sybil Carlson who told the <italic>New York Times</italic> that she refused vaccines because “I refuse to sacrifice my children for the greater good” (p. 173). In his conclusions, Largent suggests that it is important to eliminate the polarizing rhetoric and have pediatricians spend enough time with parents to hear their concerns and address each issue particular to that child.</p>
<p>This is an important book in the context of the current vaccine wars. Every pediatrician and pediatric specialist should not only read this book but also take to heart its message so that we can develop the strategies that will ensure that we protect all children from devastating childhood infectious diseases.</p>
