<abstract>
<p>Recent or continued immobility is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acutely ill medical patients. Patients may benefit from thromboprophylaxis; however, its optimal duration remains unclear. The Extended Clinical Prophylaxis in Acutely Ill Medical Patients (EXCLAIM) study was the first trial to systematically investigate how the degree of immobilization relates to the risk of developing VTE. EXCLAIM offers insights into the duration of VTE risk associated with reduced mobility and helps identify which patients would benefit most from extended-duration thromboprophylaxis. Further recent studies suggest that extended-duration thromboprophylaxis may be in order in certain high-risk patients to protect the patients from the risk of VTE events occurring, particularly in the posthospitalization period. Baseline <sc>d</sc>-dimer data and level of mobility could be included in risk assessment. Physicians are recommended to consider the use of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis based on individual risk assessment management (RAM) and balance of benefit and harm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immobility or reduced independent mobility is an important and highly prevalent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE)—both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029612452781">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076029612452781"/>

<title>Immobility in Surgical Patients</title>
<p>In surgical patients, the risk of VTE associated with immobilization is well recognized. However, limited data are available that quantify the level of risk conferred by immobility in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076029612452781">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076029612452781">8</xref></sup> Postoperative immobility is an inherent consequence of the surgery itself and, therefore, it is difficult to separate the relative contributions of surgery and immobility as they are not strictly independent variables. Nevertheless, the importance of immobility in VTE is understood and early mobilization postsurgery in addition to anticoagulant therapy is a key strategy for reducing VTE incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076029612452781">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076029612452781">8</xref></sup> Historically, a 10-day course of thromboprophylaxis was recommended in high-risk surgical patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029612452781">9</xref></sup> However, studies have indicated that extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis up to 35 days can further reduce the incidence of VTE in high-risk surgical patients, such as those undergoing hip replacement or major abdominal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076029612452781">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076029612452781"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076029612452781">12</xref></sup> Therefore, the latest (2012) guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend prophylaxis beyond 10 days and up to 35 days in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076029612452781">8</xref></sup> and for 4 weeks for those undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076029612452781">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Immobility in Medical Patients</title>
<p>Immobility is a well-recognized VTE risk factor not only in surgical patients, but also a potential risk factor in medical patients. Heit et al showed that patients previously confined to bed rest, whether in a hospital or nursing home, have an 8-fold increase in the odds of developing VTE complications (odds ratio [OR] 7.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.49-14.1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076029612452781">13</xref></sup> More recently, a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies identified a 2- to 3-fold increase in VTE risk in immobilized medical patients (overall OR 2.52; 95% CI 1.70-3.74; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076029612452781">3</xref></sup> Medical patients often have a history of immobilization upon admission due to the morbidity associated with their presenting illness, or comorbid conditions for example, respiratory failure, heart failure (HF), advanced age, or obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076029612452781">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, many elderly patients are likely to have reduced mobility, and these patients may also present with asymptomatic VTE upon admission to hospital (18% of patients aged &gt;80 years).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076029612452781">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As immobility in medical patients is not necessarily directly attributable to their presenting condition, it is easier to assess immobility as an independent variable and determine how the degree of immobility can contribute to the magnitude of the VTE risk. Although the major clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis in medical patients have included definitions of immobility in their inclusion criteria, few specifically investigated the effects of immobility on VTE risk per se, or whether immobilized medical patients would benefit from extended-duration thromboprophylaxis.</p>
<p>This review examines the differing definitions of immobility used in studies of medical patients and the effect of VTE prophylaxis on outcomes in patients with recent or ongoing immobility. This will lead to a discussion on the optimum duration of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients with reduced mobility.</p>

<title>Definitions of Immobility in Clinical Trials of VTE Prophylaxis in Medical Patients</title>
<p>Many trials and registries of hospitalized medical patients have defined immobility in their enrollment criteria. However, there are numerous ways of defining immobility. For example, immobility could be classified as a dichotomous variable (mobile or immobile), or using different levels (partial or severe), although the exact criteria used to delineate these 2 levels should be clearly defined and enforced. Also, there are other factors that need to be taken into consideration such as the time period over which immobility is assessed. Many of the trials and registries that included “immobilized” medical patients used definitions that are specific to each individual study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076029612452781">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076029612452781">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076029612452781"/>

<title>Differences in Definitions</title>
<p>For example, in the Thromboembolism Prevention in Cardiac or Respiratory Disease with Enoxaparin (PRINCE) study, which compared enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin use in hospitalized medical patients, immobility was defined as “confinement to bed for more than two-thirds of each day” during the study period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076029612452781">21</xref></sup> In contrast, other studies focused principally on specifying its <italic>duration</italic> rather than describing the <italic>nature</italic> of the immobility. For example, The Prophylaxis in Medical Patients with Enoxaparin (MEDENOX) study specified that only patients who had ≤3 days of immobilization prior to hospital enrollment and who were predicted to spend ≥6 days in hospital were included, although this study did not initially qualify what constituted “immobilization.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1076029612452781">28</xref></sup> Thus it appeared that the definition of immobility could have been interpreted as “hospitalization.” However, a post hoc analysis of the MEDENOX study population defined nonambulatory patients as those unable to attain an autonomous walking distance of &gt;10 m at the end of the treatment period (day 10 ± 4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076029612452781">25</xref></sup> The Extended Clinical Prophylaxis in Acutely Ill Medical Patients (EXCLAIM) study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended prophylaxis with enoxaparin (40 mg once daily for 28 ± 4 days) compared with placebo after an initial standard enoxaparin regimen (40 mg once daily for 10 ± 4 days), in acutely ill medical patients with recent reduced mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076029612452781">29</xref></sup> The EXCLAIM eligibility criteria specify a history of recent reduced mobility of up to 3 days, and an anticipated period of reduced mobility of at least 3 days with either a prespecified medical or intrinsic risk factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1076029612452781">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref></sup> Patients were classified as either level 1 (total bed rest or sedentary without bathroom privileges) or level 2 (total bed rest or sedentary with bathroom privileges) mobility. Following a planned and blinded interim analysis for futility, the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that the steering committee change the enrollment criteria to refocus on patients with a high risk of VTE. The amended inclusion criteria were as above, except that level 2 mobility had to be accompanied by at least 1 of 3 other high-risk VTE factors: age over 75 years and/or prior VTE and/or diagnosed cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076029612452781">29</xref></sup> The EXCLAIM study is unique in that it is the first trial to prospectively delineate more than 1 level of immobility. This allowed investigators to determine whether the level of immobility is associated with an increased risk of VTE. Furthermore, by including a broad range of medical illnesses investigators were able to perform additional subgroup analysis to identify which patients would benefit most from extended-duration prophylaxis. The Apixaban Dosing to Optimize Protection from Thrombosis (ADOPT) trial also defined 2 levels of restricted mobility: moderate (walking around hospital room or to bathroom) and severe (confined to bed or chair at bedside).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076029612452781">27</xref></sup> The Multicenter, rAndomized, parallel Group Efficacy and safety study for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized acutely iLL medical patients comparing rivaroxabAN with enoxaparin (MAGELLAN) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of extended-duration prophylaxis included a definition of immobility that included both the type and duration of reduced mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1076029612452781">26</xref></sup> As an inclusion criterion, immobility was defined as complete confinement to bed or chair, with or without bathroom privileges, for more than 1 day during hospitalization with anticipated decreased mobility (bed or chair rest for more than half of daytime hours in any type of care setting) for 4 or more days with additional ongoing reduced mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1076029612452781">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Other Factors to Influence Outcomes</title>
<p>Although the definitions of immobility vary among studies, there are also other differences such as composition of the study populations (eg, presenting conditions, age), study design and methodology, and the clinical interventions used (eg, prophylaxis strategies, regimens, ascertainment methods for VTE), all of which can impact the study outcomes. Moreover, many studies are underpowered to detect significant differences in the VTE rates among risk factor subgroups. Most major clinical trials have enrolled specific subgroups of patients at risk (eg, elderly patients and other high-risk groups), which hinders the extrapolation of their findings to heterogeneous populations of immobilized medical patients. For example, the MEDENOX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1076029612452781">28</xref></sup> and PREVENT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076029612452781">22</xref></sup> studies had similar patient populations and defined both recent immobilization (≤3 days) and anticipated length of hospitalization, whereas ARTEMIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076029612452781">23</xref></sup> included more elderly patients and did not specify the length of recent immobilization. Studies that enrolled specific types of medical patients (eg, cancer, recent stroke) also included patients with reduced mobility. It should be emphasized, however, that the effect of immobilization on outcomes is hard to isolate across all these studies without comparing the results to a treatment group of patients within the same study also diagnosed with the primary condition (eg, cancer), but who are independently mobile.</p>

<p>In the ADOPT trial, patients who were hospitalized for ≥3 days with congestive HF, respiratory failure, or other medical disorders with 1 additional risk factor for VTE received either apixaban for 30 days or enoxaparin for at least 6 days (followed by placebo).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076029612452781">27</xref></sup> The primary 30-day efficacy outcome (death related to VTE, PE, symptomatic DVT, or asymptomatic proximal-leg DVT) was met by 2.71% patients in the apixaban group and 3.06% patients receiving enoxaparin (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.62-1.23; <italic>P</italic> = .44). Major bleeding was reported in 0.47% of patients with apixaban and 0.19% with enoxaparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076029612452781">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the basis of these results, it seems that extended-duration prophylaxis may not be justified for a broad population of medically ill patients. However, there may be specific subpopulations of patients in which it may be warranted.</p>

<title>Benefits of Extended Prophylaxis Specific to Subgroups of Patients—Role in VTE Risk Assessment</title>
<p>The results of the EXCLAIM study help to identify which medical patients would benefit most from extended-duration prophylaxis by analyzing the effect of various levels of immobility on outcomes within the same patient population. The EXCLAIM study identified that extended-duration enoxaparin reduced the risk of VTE more than it increased the risk of major bleeding complications in acutely ill medical patients with age &gt;75 years, women, and who were confined to bed or sedentary due to an acute medical illness. An analysis of several major subgroups of patients according to their primary diagnosis, comorbid conditions, or baseline characteristics consistently showed reductions in the risk of VTE in the patients who received extended-duration enoxaparin compared with placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref></sup> The effects on VTE reduction and bleeding of extended-duration prophylaxis compared with standard-duration prophylaxis were consistent across all these subgroups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref></sup> In a sub-analysis of patients who met the amended inclusion criteria, patients with level 2 immobility (with bathroom privileges), but without other predefined risk factors for VTE (age &gt;75 years, prior VTE, or history of cancer) had a low incidence of VTE (1.9% with enoxaparin and 2.0% with placebo) and a smaller reduction in VTE risk (RRR 5%; RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.46-1.93). Within this subgroup, the rates of total bleeding were 7.5% with enoxaparin and 4.0% with placebo (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.27-2.74).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076029612452781">24</xref></sup> Additionally, level 1 immobility was associated with an OR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.31-0.83) for VTE risk, and level 2 immobility was associated with an OR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.46-1.10), suggesting that increasing degrees of immobility are associated with a higher risk of VTE. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that the risk conferred by immobility is compounded by the presence of additional risk factors. Accordingly, the data suggest that extended-duration prophylaxis would reduce the risk of VTE in all subgroups of patients with level 1 immobility or level 2 immobility with risk factors for VTE but may not be justified in patients with level 2 immobility (with bathroom privileges) without other predefined risk factors for VTE.</p>
<p>A subgroup analysis of the MAGELLAN trial identified that patients with higher baseline <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels (&gt;2 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) were at increased risk of VTE and that <sc>d</sc>-dimer concentration was a significant predictor of VTE risk (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1076029612452781">45</xref></sup> In patients with elevated <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels, extended prophylaxis with rivaroxaban resulted in an RRR of 29% for the primary efficacy end point on day 35 (2.8% absolute risk reduction; <italic>P</italic> = .01), although still a higher risk of clinically relevant bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1076029612452781">45</xref></sup> Subgroup analyses of the ADOPT trial have not yet been published, but it should be noted that almost three quarters of enrolled patients had only “moderately restricted mobility,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076029612452781">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Considering that it seems that patients at highest risk of VTE benefit most from extended-duration prophylaxis with enoxaparin (EXCLAIM) and rivaroxaban (MAGELLAN), perhaps patients in the ADOPT trial were not “high risk enough” to show a beneficial effect of extended-duration apixaban. There is increasing evidence to suggest that our current definitions may not be sufficient to characterize patients at high risk of VTE. A study in Canada of medical records for 1134 consecutive high-risk medical patients followed for 100 days post-discharge showed that despite in-hospital standard mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis, 21% of patients received medical care for symptoms associated with VTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1076029612452781">46</xref></sup> Only 4% had diagnostically confirmed VTE and tests were negative or inconclusive for the remaining 17%. The mean time to confirmed VTE event was 34.1 days postadmission. These data suggest that the real-life rates of VTE are higher compared with randomized clinical trials. Further data from the same source found that the risk of confirmed symptomatic VTE increased from 2.9% in patients with no more than 2 risk factors to 6.1% of patients with over 2 VTE risk factors, to 8.7% in patients with over 3 risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1076029612452781">47</xref></sup> The mean length of time to first VTE event was 33.5 days, most (80%) of the first events occurred by day 57 after hospital admission and almost all events (90%) by day 69.</p>
<p>Collectively these data suggest that extended-duration prophylaxis may be in order in certain high-risk patients to protect the patients from the risk of VTE events occurring, particularly in the posthospitalization period. Baseline <sc>d</sc>-dimer data and the level of mobility could be included in risk assessment models to establish which patients would benefit most from extended-duration prophylaxis.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Immobility is an important risk factor for VTE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076029612452781">13</xref></sup> Many acutely ill medical patients have a history of immobilization or ongoing reduced mobility due to either their presenting illness or comorbid conditions such as respiratory failure, HF, and obesity. However, although clinical studies of VTE prophylaxis in medical patients have incorporated varying definitions of immobility in their inclusion criteria, immobility as a specific VTE risk factor per se has not been extensively studied. There are gradients in the level of immobilization so definitions need refining, especially as regional hospital practice may vary in promoting mobilization. What is clear from studies to date is that thromboprophylaxis with an LMWH or fondaparinux significantly reduces the risk of VTE in at risk acutely ill medical patients with recent immobility with no significant increase in the risk of major bleeding complications.</p>
<p>The optimal duration of prophylaxis in medical patients with reduced mobility has not been established. The results of large-scale clinical trials such as MEDENOX and PREVENT indicate that the current 10-day regimen of prophylaxis may be too short, with late VTE events occurring more than 1 month after the start of the acute illness. However, extended prophylaxis may not be appropriate for all acutely ill medical patients. The EXCLAIM trial has shown that extended-duration prophylaxis with enoxaparin benefits acutely ill medical patients with level 1 immobility (bed rest or sedentary without bathroom privileges), who are female and older than 75 years of age. A subgroup analysis of the MAGELLAN trial identified patients with baseline <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels of at least 2 × ULN at the highest and most continuous risk of VTE and, therefore, most likely to benefit from extended-duration prophylaxis. In light of these findings, physicians are recommended to consider the use of extended-duration prophylaxis based on individual RAM and balance of benefit and harm.</p>
