<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the most accessible health care professionals, community pharmacists are in a unique position to recommend products and counsel patients on appropriate self-care activities. Despite their accessibility, community pharmacists are often underutilized for their role in over-the-counter (OTC) medication and self-care recommendations. One reason may be consumers' perception of OTC products. According to a survey by the National Council for Patient Information and Education, 92% of consumers perceived nonprescription medications safe to use without any health care professional guidance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012465957">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012465957"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012465957">3</xref>
</sup> Other studies have revealed a trend in patient awareness of severe drug interactions with potentially grave consequences, while drug interactions of moderate severity, but still of potential clinical significance, are significantly less known.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012465957">4</xref>
</sup> Upward of 92% of patients report using at least 1 OTC medication within the last year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012465957">5</xref>
</sup> Patients self-medicating with OTC medications without consulting a pharmacist are at increased risk for drug interactions, masking symptoms of more serious disease, and delaying needed medical treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465957">6</xref>
</sup> With over 1000 OTC brands falling into over 148 categories, the pharmacist involvement in selecting the appropriate OTC medication is critical to safe and effective use of these products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465957">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>An additional study was conducted in 2010 solely in pharmacies participating to one degree or another in OTC counseling. The study revealed a trend of pharmacists spending more time on this activity than was seen in the same survey administered in 1998.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465957">8</xref>
</sup> Both studies were conducted to address providing patients with adequate pharmaceutical care. A finding from another study, however, indicated that higher volume stores were able to designate less time to the OTC counseling than lower volume stores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012465957">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of a pharmacist's role in OTC medication selection, accredited schools of pharmacy must incorporate elements of OTC education into their curriculum. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) outlines that schools must incorporate practice in “recommending prescription and nonprescription medication, dietary supplements, diet, nutrition, traditional nondrug therapies, and complementary and alternative therapies” into advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) educational rotations for pharmacy students.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012465957">10</xref>
</sup> Fourth professional year (PY4) student pharmacists on APPE rotations are effective resources for patients seeking OTC recommendations. Under pharmacist supervision, students experience the practice of making OTC recommendations while positively impacting patient outcomes.</p>
<p>The goal of this research project was to determine the financial and clinical impact of OTC consultations performed by doctorate of pharmacy (PharmD) student pharmacists on their experiential rotation in the community pharmacy setting. While numerous studies have assessed independent factors of patient counseling, very few have evaluated both the clinical and financial impact provided by PharmD student pharmacists. A 1996 study at Washington State University College of Pharmacy investigated the relationship between pharmacy consultation and OTC medication purchasing outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465957">8</xref>
</sup> Since that study, ACPE adopted its accreditation standards that transitioned to a doctorate of pharmacy as the sole pharmacy degree. Graduation of the last student from an ACPE-accredited baccalaureate program was in 2005.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012465957">10</xref>
</sup> Therefore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has assessed the impact of OTC counseling by PharmD student pharmacists whose curriculum has an emphasis on clinical teaching through experiential rotations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was prospective in nature, using convenience sampling of patients in 5 designated retail pharmacy settings, three locations of a chain pharmacy and two independent pharmacy locations. The study was conducted over a time period of 1 year to reach the desired sample size of 400 participants. This sample size would be expected to detect a difference of 10% between a measured proportion and a hypothesized value with 98% power at the .05 α level. Pharmacist-supervised OTC counseling and documentation was performed by 50 PY4 APPE students. Each student pharmacist on their APPE rotation at one of the study locations was involved in data collection throughout their 5-week rotation. Before data collection, several methods were used to ensure student competency. Prior to the APPE community rotation, students were given handouts prepared by faculty from the school of pharmacy on common OTC topics. These handouts were reviewed by the faculty preceptor on the first day of rotation. Students then had to successfully complete practice patient case scenarios involving OTC medications. Lastly, the students were asked to complete 4 self-care interventions which were reviewed with the faculty preceptor. To help students understand the purpose and design of the study, a pre voice-recorded PowerPoint presentation prepared by the faculty researchers was presented. This guaranteed that each student received the same training prior to participating in the study, which helped ensure documentation consistency of the study data.</p>
<sec id="section4-0897190012465957">
<title>Study Location</title>
<p>Five community pharmacy locations participated: 2 independent pharmacies and 3 pharmacy locations of a regional grocery store chain. The locations were chosen to participate due to their geographic location and access to PY4 APPE student pharmacists from a local school of pharmacy as well as access to a clinical faculty member from that same school who worked with all locations to ensure student proficiency in OTC counseling and accuracy of the data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190012465957">
<title>Data Collection, Instruments, and Statistical Tests</title>
<p>Study participants had to be <underline>≥</underline>18 years of age. This age restriction did not exclude parents, guardians or caregivers seeking consultation for a patient &lt;18 years of age. Patients in the pharmacy OTC area were eligible to participate in the study, along with patients that came to the pharmacy counter seeking an OTC recommendation. Since data collection occurred during normal pharmacy hours, the student pharmacists’ rotation schedules were adjusted to include evening and weekend hours.</p>
<p>The encounter between the student pharmacist and the patient could have occurred in 1 of the 3 ways: (1) the patient approached the pharmacy counter, (2) the student pharmacist was approached while out in the OTC aisle, or (3) the student pharmacist approached the patient in the OTC aisle. In any of these circumstances, the student pharmacist provided the OTC consultation as requested or offered <italic>before </italic>extending to the patient the offer to participate in the study. This was done as to not alter any normal interaction between the student pharmacist and patient, and to ensure the patient did not feel pressure to consult with the student pharmacist.</p>
<p>Three instruments were used for data collection: (1) over-the-counter patient consultation record sheet, (2) rationale for recommendation sheet, and (3) over-the-counter demographic sheet. The first 2 forms were filled out by the student pharmacist for every patient encounter that occurred, whereas the third demographic sheet was filled out by the participant only if he or she consented to the study by signing the approved consent form. The 3 forms are described in detail below. The study instruments and methods were approved by the primary researcher’s university investigational review board.</p>
<p>The first instrument used was the “over-the-counter patient consultation record sheet” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012465957">Figure 1</xref>). This sheet was used by the student pharmacist to collect generalized information about each encounter. Information gathered included who initiated the encounter, health care need(s) of the patient, special patient conditions (such as being a child, elderly, or pregnant), patient symptoms and disease states, and initial and final purchase selections (including whether the product was brand or generic, as well as cost of the initial and final product). Additionally, it was documented if the participant took the recommendation, if the recommendation was different than the participant’s original selection, whether the patient was referred to a physician, the rationale for the student pharmacist’s recommendation, and the participant’s likelihood to consult a pharmacy health care provider for OTC medication use in the future. The latter was determined by directly asking the participant. In addition, the student pharmacist recorded their name and the length of the consultation. The instrument did not contain any patient identifiers. If the patient denied consultation, only the “Encounter” section was filled out, as no data were available for the remainder of the sheet. The participant was then given the invitation to participate in the study. This was done to assess the demographics of those that accepted versus those that refused student pharmacist OTC consultation.</p>

</fig>
<p>The second instrument used by the student pharmacists was the “rationale for recommendation sheet.” This sheet, adapted from <italic>A Practical Guide to Pharmaceutical Care</italic>, was used to provide a numeric code for the student's rationalization for the OTC recommendation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012465957">11</xref>
</sup> Each drug-related need was further subcategorized to include the drug therapy problem and the reason for recommendation. For example, a patient that should not have taken a particular OTC product due to a drug interaction would receive the code of 312: drug-related need “safety” (code 3), drug therapy problem “adverse drug reaction” (subcode 1), reason for recommendation “medication–medication interaction” (subcode 2). Through this rationale for recommendation sheet, the overarching drug-related needs of appropriate indication, effectiveness, safety, cost savings, and preference were addressed. The student pharmacist was also able to include a descriptive explanation of the reason for recommendation. Analysis of these codes, particularly those relating to safety, are discussed later in this article as an indicator of student pharmacist clinical impact.</p>
<p>The final instrument used was the “over-the-counter demographic sheet.” If the participant consented to study participation, they were then given this form to complete, which collected demographical data such as their gender, age, race, income, household size, education, relationship to the patient, and whether or not the patient had prescription drug coverage. Before completing this form, participants were required to sign the IRB-approved study consent form.</p>
<p>To serve as a teaching tool, the forms were collected and reviewed with the students on a weekly basis by the faculty preceptor. Students were overseen daily by onsite clinical pharmacist preceptors throughout data collection to ensure accuracy of OTC recommendations.</p>
<p>The data collected from all 3 instruments were tabulated and analyzed using JMP Software version 9.30. Various statistical tests were used to test the major hypotheses of the study depending on the nature of the response. To begin, a chi-square test was used to compare the proportions (to a hypothesized value of 25%) of participants who actively sought student pharmacist consultation versus those to whom the consultation was offered, as recorded by the “encounter” section of the first study instrument.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis using a chi-square test for association were used to determine a shift in proportion of participant’s propensity from a brand name OTC medication to generic following an OTC consultation with the student pharmacist. This was done to evaluate the student pharmacist's impact on participant cost and product selection. However, testing the hypothesis that the student provided a cost benefit posed a challenge. In previous studies, cost benefits were estimated based on comparison of average costs before and after consultation for patients who completed a purchase. Comparison of group averages, however, may not be representative of the actual savings, since categories of OTC drugs differ significantly with respect to cost. These inherent cost differences across OTC drug categories could be large enough to obscure the actual benefit, if any, provided to the patient upon averaging. This was addressed by calculating and comparing the differences between initial and final cost, expressed both as a dollar quantity and as a percentage of the initial cost, for each transaction individually. Using these paired differences, each participant served as their own control. Differences were calculated only for those participants who initially intended to make a purchase and completed a purchase. The only independent factor significantly associated with these cost savings was the final product selection, “brand” versus “generic.” A 2-group <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine clinical significant of this factor.</p>
<p>It was originally intended to perform a logistic regression of all demographic and continuous variables, such as duration of consultation and cost savings, against the likelihood of a participant seeking consultation in the future. The data, however, were not well conditioned for a logistic regression due to the relatively small proportion of participants completing the demographic survey. The analysis did, however, identify factors, discussed in the results section, which could be individually tested for association with the likelihood score.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A summary of the overall study results is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012465957">Table 1</xref>. A total of 559 participants were offered OTC consultation by the student pharmacists across all study locations. Of the total population, 24.7% (138) patients declined consultation. The remaining 421 participants that accepted are summarized by the type of encounter. The data confirmed that the percentages of participants receiving consultation at the request of the student pharmacist and those actively seeking consultation are equal (37.7% vs 37.6%). Furthermore, statistical analysis testing the equality of these proportions to 25% confirmed that participants actively seeking consultation were equally likely to approach the student pharmacist either in the aisle (21.5%) or at the counter (16.1%; <italic>P </italic>&gt; .11).</p>

<p>The demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012465957">Table 2</xref>. Most participants that received consultation, and all participants who refused consultation, chose not to complete the demographic sheet. Participants that did offer demographic information did not always complete the entire form but instead entered information selectively. On average, roughly 92 participants provided useful demographic data. The results, however, provided enough detail for statistical analysis.</p>

<p>The typical participant was Caucasian (92.3%) with a median household income of $60 000. Most were females (67.0%) between 40 and 64 years of age (43.5%), with at least 12 years of education. Essentially all patients were covered by health insurance (92.4%). The only demographic characteristic of the student pharmacists providing the OTC consultations, gender, also appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012465957">Table 2</xref>. Females represented the majority of this group (44 out of 50 students, 88.0%).</p>
<sec id="section7-0897190012465957">
<title>Benefits Provided By the Student Pharmacists</title>
<p>The tabulated survey results indicate that of a total of 419 participants (data points missing for 2 consultations), 162 (38.7%) selected a brand product prior to the OTC consultation, whereas 24 (5.7%) initially selected a generic and 233 had no product selected. Of the 162 participants who initially selected a brand OTC product, only 66 purchased a brand product after consultation. The remainder either switched to a generic (90) or did not purchase a product at all (6). Only 24 participants initially selected a generic product, but 18 (75.0%) of these participants maintained that intention following consultation, with only 3 changing their final purchase to a brand product. A majority of the 233 participants who had no initial preference selected a generic (134) or did not make a purchase following consultation (14).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the data using a chi-square test for association confirmed that the shift in proportion toward a generic product occurred in all 3 groups with respect to initial product selection (Prob &gt; ChiSq = .0427).</p>
<p>The results of the paired differences between initial and final OTC product selection cost are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190012465957">Table 3</xref>. The study included 164 transactions that met the criteria for testing. The average cost savings was $4.25 per transaction, or a savings of approximately 20%. The 95% confidence interval for the average savings was $1.75 to $6.75, or from 13.1% to 27.31% savings. These results are significantly different from a hypothesized value of zero (representing “no savings” or benefit) as calculated from a <italic>t</italic> test for paired differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The inference from this study is that the student pharmacist consultation resulted in a median savings of 27.31% across a broad range of OTC purchases, representing a significant financial benefit for the participant. The participants who purchased a brand OTC saved an average of 1.75%, as compared to the participants who purchased a generic product and saved an average of 31% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Next the participant likelihood to seek OTC consultation from a student pharmacist in the future was tested. The likelihood scores and variables for testing were converted to dichotomous values. For likelihood of seeking consultation in the future, the level “same or less” was used as a baseline, versus “more” as a measure of student pharmacist effectiveness. Two variables were discovered that associated with this likelihood at the .10 α level or less, which were the income level of the participant (&lt;60 000 or ≥60 000), and whether the participant had accepted or rejected the student pharmacist recommendation. Of the participants earning &lt;$60 000 per household, 54.3% indicated they were <italic>more</italic> likely to seek future consultation following their experience with the student pharmacist. This percentage increased to 75.0% in participants reporting income ≥$60 000 (<italic>P</italic> = .077).</p>
<p>A stronger association was observed between the likelihood of seeking future consultation and whether the participant accepted the OTC recommendation. Only 13.0% of participants who rejected the recommendation were more likely to seek future consultation, as opposed to 53.6% for those who accepted.</p>
<p>Duration of consultation was hypothesized to be a predictor of the effectiveness of the student pharmacist. Increasing duration correlated with increasing likelihood to seek future consultation, but there was no enough evidence for statistical significance.</p>
<p>The results of a general linear model procedure are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190012465957">Table 4</xref>. The <italic>t</italic> ratio represents the relative impact of each factor on duration. <italic>T</italic> ratios with probabilities &lt;.05 are statistically significant. The first 2 highlighted variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190012465957">Table 4</xref> (rationale code and income) are thus highly significant, but examination of parameter estimates for the model confirmed a relationship between participant education and income on the duration of consultation. The variable “pharmacy classification” represents whether the study pharmacy location was a chain or independent. As highlighted in this table, an independent pharmacy location was a statistically significant variable in the duration of consultation.</p>

<p>The parameter estimates provide a simple interpretation of variables that determine the length of a student pharmacist’s consultation with a participant. The only statistically significant parameters that need to be considered are highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190012465957">Table 4</xref>. The model predicts that the average length of a consultation at large would be 6.41 minutes (Intercept). The most significant variable affecting the duration was whether a rationale for recommendation code caused a switch in OTC product selection. If the code did not cause a switch, the consultation time was reduced by 5.18 minutes to 1.23 minutes. The second most significant factor was the type of pharmacy location. A consultation at an independent pharmacy would be expected to last approximately 3.84 minutes longer than one at a chain.</p>
<p>Participant income and educational background also affected the duration but to a lesser extent. Consultations with participants earning &lt;$60 000 were almost 3 minutes (2.66 minutes) longer than those with lower or higher incomes, whereas consultations with participants with &gt;12 years of education reduced consultation length by 1.31 minutes. The duration model measurement was able to account for 84% of the variation in duration model, which is excellent considering that the recorded duration values were rounded to the nearest minute.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was successful in investigating each of its 4 study objectives. The effects of student pharmacist counseling on OTC medication purchasing decisions and costs (objective 1) was shown by the change in product selection and documented cost savings. Demographic factors influencing patient purchasing decisions (objective 2) were collected through the third study instrument. Assessing whether patients will approach student pharmacists for OTC counseling or acceptance of consultation upon being approached (objective 3) was documented and discussed, as was participant likelihood to seek OTC counseling in the future following an encounter (objective 4).</p>
<p>While greater than 75% of participants who sought or were offered OTC consultation in this study accepted the student pharmacist’s help, only 37.6% of these encounters were participant initiated. This indicates that there remains much room for improvement in having patients recognize the importance of soliciting the help of a health care professional and the impact of pharmacist or student pharmacist recommendations regarding nonprescription medications. One reason for this low percentage of patient-initiated consultations in this study sample could be due to the rotation of student pharmacists throughout the year and lack of continuity of the same students present within the pharmacy. Some form of signage or advertisement of this type of OTC counseling service may help to increase the number of consultations performed.</p>
<p>A positive finding of this study was the impact of the student pharmacists on reducing participant cost, primarily through recommendation of a generic product. As described in the results, the students had a statistically significant impact on increasing the proportion of participants who switched to a generic product. Feedback from the students revealed that this was primarily due to lack of participant education on available generic equivalents. Rising health care costs and growing numbers of underinsured/uninsured patients make cost savings especially important to patients today. Furthermore, participants that accepted the student pharmacist’s recommendation were more likely to consult with a health care professional in the future, illustrating that student pharmacists can prove their competence and worth to patients while improving patient health outcomes.</p>
<p>The duration of the consultation at the chain versus independent locations was statistically significant. Consultations occurring at the independent pharmacy locations lasted approximately 4 minutes (3.84) longer than those at the chain pharmacy counterparts. While this may be due to a lower staff-to-volume ratio at the chain pharmacy locations, it is important to note that the consultations were performed by nonstaffing student pharmacists. In this case, an overall managerial approach to patient interaction may have been a variable. The time spent performing the consultations did not have an effect on the overall cost savings to the participant, although it can be assumed that greater time spent with the participant would lead to greater patient satisfaction on a customer service level.</p>
<p>This study was unique from other published OTC counseling articles in that the OTC consultations were performed exclusively by PY4 APPE PharmD student pharmacists on community rotations. These students can be an asset to any pharmacy attempting to enhance their patient interactions or OTC counseling services. Engaging student pharmacists in these types of interactions also increases their clinical experience and confidence in interacting with patients in the community pharmacy setting. Several of the pharmacist preceptors from this study have continued to use the first 2 study instruments (documentation sheet and rationale for recommendation sheet) as a teaching tool for student pharmacists providing OTC consultations. Under pharmacist supervision, students in this study proved capable of providing benefits to the participants in terms of cost savings. Additionally, the collected instruments showed measurement of prevented OTC medication-related adverse outcomes as a result of the student pharmacist intervention. While there was not enough data in this area to show statistical significance, this is another example of the student pharmacist’s positive influence on patient safety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0897190012465957">
<title>Limitations and Future Steps</title>
<p>The largest limitation to this study was the unwillingness by the participants to complete the demographic portion of the survey. Even those that opted to participate in this phase of data collection often did not complete the form in its entirety, which made statistical analysis of these correlations difficult if not impossible. We had hoped to investigate several correlations between participant and consultant demographics but were unable due to the low number of fully completed demographic surveys. Another demographical limitation was the lack of diversity between the student pharmacist consultants and the participants. The participating population was primarily Caucasian females and the consulting student pharmacists were also primarily female.</p>
<p>Additional limitations included the number of consultations performed at chain versus independent sites and the number of consultations that resulted in codes for safety reasons that provided evidence of prevention of OTC-related adverse events after consultation. Chain locations resulted in 374 completed consultations, while only 45 consultations were performed at the independent pharmacies. This discrepancy is in part due to the differences in customer traffic in these different settings, but had the numbers been more similar, results may have differed hypothetically.</p>
<p>Future steps include more specific measurement of student pharmacist impact on patient clinical outcomes, particularly with avoidance of potential or actual adverse drug events. Additionally, it would be interesting to study the implementation of specific OTC consultation service hours or advertisement of student pharmacist availability and its resulting impact on patients seeking OTC consultation. The authors plan to continue this project with the intention of capturing additional patient demographic information to help draw conclusions on the best ways to implement these types of activities in the future, as both a service and an experiential student teaching tool. Lastly, pedagogical research on student pharmacist’s attitudes toward patient OTC counseling and confidence following use of the OTC instruments would be another area of interest.</p>

<sec id="section10-0897190012465957">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study documents the patient need and acceptance of OTC medication selection consultations performed by PY4 APPE student pharmacists. This study demonstrates that student pharmacists in their final year of schooling are capable of providing recommendations that result in cost savings to a variety of patients. Patients are responsive to these recommendations by student pharmacists and show an interest in using the expertise of these students in the future. Pharmacies should, therefore, utilize their student pharmacists to perform these tasks that will result in enhanced educational opportunities for the student, as well as increased customer satisfaction and improved health outcomes to their patients.</p>
