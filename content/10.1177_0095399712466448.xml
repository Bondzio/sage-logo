<p>I have read with enjoyment the three responses thus far to my <italic>Administration &amp; Society</italic> (<italic>A&amp;S</italic>) Disputatio article on the 2007-2008 financial crisis. I respond to them in the order of their publication.</p>
<sec id="section1-0095399712466448">
<title>Response to Michael Potter: <italic>A&amp;S</italic>, 44, 367-373</title>
<p>There is only a little to contend with in Potter’s remarks. I agree with him that “the failures of public administration that contributed to the most recent financial crisis are not new, and they have been exacerbated by the new public management’s inability to communicate the importance of regulatory ethics to agencies and politicians” (p. 368). He argues that the field of public administration (PA) has ceded its role in defining effective regulation of the financial services industry to economists who he claims “have great difficulty understanding and accounting for problems of ethics in [economic] policy making and regulation” (p. 369). I agree that our field has ceded its role in defining effective regulation, but I think his indictment of economists for inability in understanding the ethics of economic policy is too broad. Many institutional economists and others who embrace more heterodox views of economic thought are well aware of the ethical implications of economic and regulatory policies. I would focus Potter’s indictment mainly on neoclassical economists whose ideas have dominated not only their own field but ours as well, especially regarding regulatory policy over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>The neoclassical idea that markets can automatically self-regulate if government does not interfere has been very persuasive in PA thought and practice, and its impact goes far beyond ceding the field of regulation to others. We have focused much of our attention on making PA more market-like in its practices, emphasizing more efficient delivery of services and actively searching for alternatives to regulation. Potter is quite right in referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712466448">Michael Brintnall’s (1991)</xref> critique of Political Science in the wake of the Savings and Loan crisis with the searching questions, “Did we lack access” and “Did we find nothing to say or no good way to say it?” The questions apply with even greater force to PA.</p>
<p>The rest of Potter’s response draws our attention to an alleged failing of the bipartisan commission report for “largely ignor[ing] some important aspects of financial services regulatory structure,” namely, the long-standing dual-chartering system and the method by which many financial regulatory agencies are funded—for example, through “fees that are paid by the very financial service entities they regulate.” These structural and funding flaws have indeed contributed to the ability of firms to choose their preferred regulator, meaning they continually choose the weakest of regulatory bodies, and play them off against each other, often inciting turf wars in the bargain. Although I only allude to these specific matters in my article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712466448">Green, 2012</xref>, p. 127), both the Commission report and the Senate report (unmentioned by Potter) illustrated in some detail how the evolving deregulatory environment “permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what became a race to the weakest supervisor” (Commission Report, p. xviii). The Senate report described these dynamics in sickening detail in their account of the Office of Thrift Supervision’s failures in regulating Washington Mutual (cf. Senate Report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712466448">2011</xref>, pp. 165-225). Both reports emphasize how pervasive conflicts of interests (including the fee system for funding regulatory agencies) played critical roles in undermining the governance by regulators and the firms themselves.</p>
<p>Potter is right though about the Commission Report not paying much attention to the dual bank-chartering system. Although this has indeed been a matter of concern to regulators and students of the American financial system since at least the time of our industrial revolution (mid-to-late 19th century), it is likely to remain as a central feature of our system because it is linked so closely to American federalism—to the dual sovereignty of our state and national governments. I suspect the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) commissioners were sensitive to this reality and could sustain their points without calling for a whole new unitary financial regulatory system. A great deal of consolidation and simplification of that system can be achieved without such radical measures. Indeed, it is apparent that we were able to successfully regulate the financial system with the New Deal reforms for about 40 years under the dual-chartering arrangement. Globalization of the financial system adds a new layer of complexity that certainly challenges that arrangement, but it is not a forgone conclusion that it is beyond adapting to and coping with them.</p>
<p>Finally, Potter argues that the Dodd–Frank reform legislation passed in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis is wholly inadequate and that discussion about reform has centered too much on the establishment of the controversial Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which does not address critical systemic issues. I agree that Dodd–Frank does not go far enough in its reform measures. It in fact provides only a skeletal infrastructure for reform that requires a tremendous number of its provisions to be filled out in subsequent years—something that is unlikely to occur if the current political climate persists.</p>
<p>I do, however, attribute much more significance to the CFPB because it is the only financial regulatory institution in the system that gives common people a voice and perhaps some teeth to go with it. As I emphasized in my article, the financial system is run entirely by professionals and wealthy elites, and they have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted to run the system for public good under the current structural arrangements. Despite that, the CFPB may well play a key role in forcing more transparency, simplicity, and accountability in and among the firms and their regulators. The CFPB can call attention to failings of the system that neither firms nor their regulators want known. Indeed, this has already happened with dozens of enforcement investigations and actions taken against firms by the CFPB, and as detailed by the Boston Globe, is prompting complaints by bankers and investment house CEOs that it is “deeming as illegal practices that were long acceptable to other regulators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712466448">Boston Globe, 2012</xref>). Clearly, the CFPB is listening to voices other than of financial elites, which means they give hope to common Americans for a fair shake in their financial affairs.</p>

<title>Response to Anne Khademian: <italic>A&amp;S</italic>, 44, 374-377</title>
<p>I agree entirely with Anne Khademian’s remarks. She nicely summarizes the thesis of my article and then raises logical questions about where we go from here.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What will we do to realize a financial regulatory system that is individually and systematically smart, properly motivated by the public interest, independent from regulated interests, yet connected sufficiently to be relevant and timely? We may reject the new public management model of regulatory practice and its various manifestations, but what is the replacement? And what is the role of public administration scholars and practitioners in bringing such a system to fruition? (p. 375)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is indeed a tall order, and she provides some important suggestions that I think beg more discussion and development in the field.</p>
<p>Khademian is right to emphasize the need for achieving a balance “between the need to control and the need to grow, the need for stability and the need for innovation” (p. 375). These things are far out of balance in the existing system, so much so that the financial industry continues to neglect its primary mission—its “reason for being.” It focuses more on producing complex financial instruments for its own proprietary trading than on its vital role of providing stable sources of credit and investment for farmers, businesses, home buyers, retirees, and governments. The recent loss of billions by JPMorgan Chase due to hedging with highly complex products and risk models adds yet more evidence to the case for serious rebalancing of priorities. The industry should exist first and foremost to serve others, not just its self. The recent suggestion by Sanford Weill, former chief executive of Citigroup, that the financial system should probably restore Glass–Steagall gives yet greater strength to this point.</p>
<p>In restoring balance to the system, politicians, appointees, and career service professionals must play significant roles in refocusing the industry on its traditional mission. For example, federal regulators are now drafting the “Volcker Rule” pursuant to provisions of the Dodd–Frank Act. The new rule is intended to prevent banks that receive government insurance for deposits from making high risk bets for their own gain. The big banks are of course fighting this effort tooth and nail and may well succeed in carving a large loophole in the rule that allows banks to continue hedging their risks with instruments like credit default swaps. This will enable them to continue betting against the very products they are selling (supposedly in good faith) to their own clients, and with government insured funds! There would be little left in the new rule to stop or even modestly restrain the banks from engaging in the same destabilizing, mystifyingly complex games. Innovation in this context will continue to be used to baffle and con investors. The leaders of our financial regulatory institutions should be aggressively calling attention to this in the press as well as to Congress, and our public service professional associations should join as well with strong statements against such loopholes.</p>
<p>Khademian makes an important point, however, that much of the progress in rebalancing this system is likely to come when the spotlight is not so bright—when public administrators are working the trenches, and, ideally, pursuing “persistent relationship-building” efforts with Congress, through which they can convey persuasively the need for “a robust regulatory system,” and maintain “a competitive edge in the regulation of securities markets” (p. 375-376). This is precisely the kind of institutional awareness and effort that I believe is lacking today among many agency leaders and managers at all levels. Khademian’s historical example of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) early relationship with Congress, as compared with recent experience, nicely illustrates the point. Timid, reactive regulatory agencies who lack the will to act with resolve and to “speak truth to power” in compelling ways cannot meet their statutory missions. Furthermore, the “important precedents [in history] for Congressional-administrator relationships that are enlightened by administrative expertise and experience” described by Khademian (p. 375) do much to impart the richness and nuance of political–administrative relationships as a vital aspect of administrative responsibility as well as effectiveness.</p>
<p>Finally, I applaud Khademian’s call for PA practitioners and scholars to pursue regulatory innovation. Using the “clever use of technology and innovative organizational operations” in agencies like the new CFPB is essential to gaining “better information and less dependency on the financial industry” (p. 376). I would add to this the need to think creatively about how to alter the patterns of incentives in the financial industry in ways that induce firms to innovate for simplicity and transparency rather than for complexity and opaqueness in their investment practices and products. At the same time, we need to develop and adopt measures that will focus rather than diffuse liability in the major investment houses, at least when they are leveraging with publicly insured capital. The incorporation of these firms in the 1980s allowed them to escape liability for their bad decisions and for violation of fiduciary obligations. Without such changes, there is little chance of reestablishing and maintaining the public trust that is so critical to the system.</p>

<title>Response to Larry Lynn: <italic>A&amp;S, 44, 754-755</italic></title>
<p>Despite its vitriol, I find Larry Lynn’s remarks interesting and engaging, and in some cases even convincing. It is the kind of rejoinder I had expected, and I hope it provokes a good deal more discussion. I wrote my essay as a polemic and Lynn has joined it with fervor and a rapier wit.</p>
<p>At root, Lynn’s comments take me to task for putting far too much blame on public administrators for the financial crisis that has precipitated the deepest recession since the 1930s. The gist of his argument invokes the two main reasons I believe help explain our silence as a field about the whole matter. First, although he concedes that public administrators (regulators) contributed to the financial disaster (even conceding that they “failed miserably”; p. 3) and “bear partial responsibility” for it (p. 2), he severely diminishes their role by invoking the “many hands” argument I referred to in my essay (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712466448">Green, 2012</xref>, pp. 10-11). The scope of the crisis involved so many actors and institutions, many of whom played much more significant roles, that we can overlook the failings of our weakened and subservient public administrators. And then in later pages, Lynn pushes the metaphor of public administrators as essentially innocent victims “tormented by the cross-pressures of accountability, [and] found bleeding in the wreckage of our financial system” (p. 8). He shifts his stance to one that holds PA (practitioners and scholars of the field alike) blameless, arguing that the regulatory arena of the financial system is the preserve of economists and business school graduates, not students of PA. “Leave economic regulation to the professions that are competent to confront the technical complexity of modern economies and finance” (p. 10).</p>
<p>I find Lynn’s line of argument quite troubling for several reasons. First, the financial disaster occurred in part <italic>because</italic> we left too much economic and financial regulation to these professionals. It is quite evident that many of them failed miserably, doing little if anything to check and balance the dynamics of the system. The fact of the matter is that many of these professionals were also public administrators, and they failed to govern. Governing is something we in PA can speak to—It is our stock in trade. We have a seat at the regulatory table and are responsible for bringing our competencies and values to bear as economic/financial policies and practices are developed and implemented. Indeed, as Anne Khademian indicates in her own work, we have vital roles to play in this regard. My sense is that we did not play those roles well at all, and that our “sins” have as much or more to do with neglect and acquiescence—sins of omission—as commission. I concede to Lynn that I did not make this point clearly enough in my essay but that understanding that point helps explain how indeed it is possible that being “ill prepared” and “inconsistent” in response to clear abuses in the system can contribute significantly to “key causes” of the disaster (see Lynn, p. 6).</p>
<p>Second, at page 5 of his remarks, Lynn makes a statement that I think goes to the heart of our differences about PA’s role in the financial disaster. He says,<disp-quote>
<p>In our Constitutional schema, administrators are not given the responsibility for defining the public interest. That is the role of the political branches: legislatures and elected executives. Public administrators take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution that empowers policy makers, not “unelected bureaucrats,” to determine and give expression to “the public will.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here is essentially a restatement of the Progressive-era version of the politics/administration dichotomy, which tells public administrators, “You do not make policy, you just carry it out.” I couldn’t disagree more with this formulation, but it clearly remains the dominant message and theory of PA’s role in government, and it radically reduces the culpability of administrators for just about anything governments do. It is this instrumentalist view of PA that also sustains so much of the belief that governments can and should be run like businesses. This view remains widespread in the field, despite Lynn’s earlier statement (p. 5) to the contrary. In related remarks, Lynn blithely acknowledges and then dismisses the significance of Lipsky’s “street-level bureaucrats” as policy makers in the financial regulatory context. In doing so, he dismisses an extant empirical literature on bureaucratic politics that effectively refutes this passive and instrumental view of public administrators. However, that literature only addresses bureaucratic behavior. Lynn also runs headlong into normative conceptions of PA theory developed by Rohr, Rosenbloom, and many others who put public administrators at the center of constitutional politics. Anne Khademian’s sense of much enhanced roles for public administrators working closely at the political–administrative nexus to build and maintain more robust financial regulatory institutions reflects this much richer body of theory. Lynn’s instrumentalist approach denies such roles to the PA along with diminishing its culpability.</p>
<p>Throughout Lynn’s response, he also ridicules me for suggesting that “new public management” (NPM) ideas played a role in the minds of the actors involved in the financial crisis. He argues that the NPM label was of European origin and had only very limited play in the George W. Bush administration, and “without … recognizable success” (pp. 4-5). But then he states that “some of NPM’s instruments, such as use of third-party agents, deinstitutionalization, and devolution of authority had been practiced at all levels of U.S. government going back many decades” (p. 5). I couldn’t agree more with this latter point!</p>
<p>I used the NPM label as the most current manifestation of a set of ideas, some or all of which have been present in a variety of management fads over many decades, including PPBS, MBO, ZBB, TQM, reinvention, and reengineering, and which were popularized in the presidential administrations of their day. Moreover, the NPM label has been used extensively by scholars appraising the directions and problems of management thought in our field. One need only consult selected works of scholars like Ronald Moe, Christopher Hood, Larry Terry, Guy Peters, Don Kettle, and David Rosenbloom for assessments of the NPM’s values, practices, influence, and limitations. Excerpts of their works are also published in various editions of the PA Classics readers in our field (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712466448">Shafritz &amp; Hyde, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The ideas underpinning NPM also transcend our field, many of them coming from economics, especially neoclassical economics as reformulated and refined by conservative intellectuals reacting to the policies of the New Deal, New Frontier, and Great Society programs. Strains of this economic thought, such as Public Choice theory (a la Kenneth Arrow, Gordon Tulloch, James Buchanan, and many others), heavily influenced the administrative reforms from the Carter and Reagan administrations to the current day.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ideas represented by the label “NPM” are pervasive, so much so that the FCIC and Senate reports that formed the centerpiece of my article abounded with them. I did not impute these ideas to the reports, they oozed with them, and often with critical insight. The reports detail how these ideas contributed to an antiregulatory ethos marked by perverse incentives, pervasive conflicts of interest, obfuscation through quantitative/analytical complexity, and lax regulatory practices. Malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance abounded in all corners of the financial system, including in the regulatory agencies. PA must therefore share some of the blame for the disaster and its consequences, but more importantly should seriously grapple with the governance issues, implications, and practices which need remedies that will help restore a sound and coherent financial system. I would not look to economists and business finance experts, as Lynn wants to, for a lot of insight into these matters. Many of them will admit that governance (corporate or governmental) is not their bailiwick.</p>
<p>On a related point, I do not subscribe to Lynn’s cute and dismissive ridicule reflected in his suggestions that we ban NPM and public choice ideas from our curricula. We do not ban ideas, we wrestle with them. As I stated at the end of my article, I am not opposed to these ideas per se. I agree with Lynn that many of them have value—in proper and limited contexts. The FCIC and Senate reports illustrated how such ideas can be misapplied in the wrong contexts. I admit that I did not make some of these points clearly enough in my essay.</p>
<p>Finally, I applaud Lynn’s call for grappling with the ideas of founding fathers like James Madison, and applying them in modern public life. He has attempted such in his more recent works and, in so doing, joins a conversation that should indeed play widely in our field. Unfortunately, it does not yet do so, but there is hope for such. The “constitutional school” mentioned in my essay is an appellation advanced by John Rohr and Stephanie Newbold (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712466448">Morgan, Kirwan, Rohr, Rosenbloom, &amp; Schaefer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712466448">Newbold, 2010</xref>) for a group of scholars who hold in common an interest in articulating how constitutional thought informs administrative practice in descriptive and normative ways. I welcome Lynn, whose work I have read with interest, to this conversation. In that spirit, I will close by suggesting that Lynn’s remarks on Madisonian politics in his impassioned response to my article are heavily tinged with animus against “arch-conservatives” and an errant Republican Party, suggesting that it may be impossible to “‘run a constitution’ when it’s in the hands of Grover Norquist, Antonin Scalia, Jamie Dimon, and Fox News” (p. 10). I am severely critical of these players as well, but it is also important to acknowledge that they too embrace some important founding ideas, and are therefore legitimate participants in our political heritage. As John Rohr remarked on many occasions, the Constitution was founded in unresolved struggle, and it is our fate and our responsibility to learn how to cope with that together. Without that attitude, civility will continue to break down and threaten the republic we all hold dear.</p>
