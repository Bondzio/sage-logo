<p>‘The national press which emerged from the Leveson inquiry presented a split personality, part St George, part jackal. Under the flag of free expression, David Cameron and the editors tried to close ranks as though it were beyond wit or common sense to disentangle the one from the other.’</p>
<disp-quote><p>– <italic>Tom Stoppard, writing in</italic> The Independent</p></disp-quote>
<p>‘During the Leveson debate, the Prime Minister said state regulation of the press was “crossing the Rubicon” and, quoting Winston Churchill, said: “A free press is the unsleeping guardian of every other right that free men prize.” The industry's Royal Charter – which, unlike the stitch-up between Hacked Off and the politicians, will now be subject to a full public consultation – provides the basis to deliver that.’</p>
<disp-quote><p>– Daily Mail <italic>leader</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘Editors and proprietors of some newspapers, defying the will of Parliament, have today launched a bid to block any kind of independent regulation of the press that would be capable of protecting the public from the abuses that made the Leveson inquiry necessary. They are unilaterally rejecting the findings of a formal public inquiry that condemned newspapers for “wreaking havoc in the lives of innocent people” …’</p>
<disp-quote><p>– <italic>Website of the Hacked Off campaign for a free and accountable press</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘The Royal Charter published on March 18 followed 21 weeks of discussion and has cross-party agreement. We want to see a tough, independent self-regulator implemented swiftly.’</p>
<disp-quote><p>– <italic>Maria Miller, culture secretary, opposing the alternative Royal Charter plan</italic></p></disp-quote>
<p>‘The Royal Charter implements Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations. It was supported unanimously by the House of Commons and had the full backing of the House of Lords. The important thing is that we get on with implementation.’</p>
<disp-quote><p>– <italic>Harriet Harman, Labour deputy leader, opposing the alternative Royal Charter plan</italic></p></disp-quote>
