<p>Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution caused by spirochetes of the genus <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Leptospirosis is a common disease, highly prevalent in human populations but most often unidentified. The International Leptospirosis Society estimates that disease incidence ranges are 0.1 to 1.0 per 100 000 in temperate climates and 10 to 100 per 100 000 in humid tropics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010393341">1</xref></sup> In India, outbreaks have been increasingly reported since 1980s, especially from the states of Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010393341">2</xref></sup> Outbreaks mostly occur as a result of heavy rainfall and consequent flooding, usually during monsoons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010393341">3</xref></sup> The clinical manifestation of leptospirosis varies from inapparent infection to fulminant fatal disease. Pulmonary complications for patients with leptospirosis are also relatively common, reported in 17% to 70% of patients in several large studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010393341">4</xref></sup> Although these manifestations are usually mild, recent studies suggest that pulmonary involvement is frequently the most dramatic feature of leptospiral infection. Accordingly, severe pulmonary manifestations of leptospirosis are becoming more prevalent, with pulmonary hemorrhage being the most predominant cause of death in leptospirosis. The hemorrhagic potential of leptospirosis was first reported by Weil in 1886.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010393341">5</xref></sup> The intense intra-alveolar hemorrhages seem to be unique for leptospirosis. Previous literature on diffuse alveolar hemorrhage heavily emphasizes the causal role of vasculitides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010393341">6</xref></sup> Use of steroids is rarely reported in leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhages. Here, we report a case of leptospirosis with pulmonary hemorrhage that was successfully treated with a high intravenous dose of methylprednisolone.</p>
<sec id="section1-0091270010393341">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 45-year-old chronic alcoholic smoker was admitted to a southern Indian tertiary care hospital with complaints of high-grade fever and cough of 5 days duration and acute-onset breathlessness of 1 day duration. On examination, he was febrile and tachypneic. His blood pressure was low and he was initially treated with dopamine and noradrenaline infusion in the primary care center. His arterial blood gas examination revealed a very low partial oxygen saturation (60 mm Hg). Physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of bilateral basal crepitation. The patient was provided emergency care and blood pressure was maintained normal with inotropic support; his oxygen saturation did not improve, necessitating intubation and placement on artificial ventilation.</p>
<p>Admission biochemical parameters including liver function test (LFT) and renal function tests (RFT) were deranged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010393341">Table I</xref>). A serology test for leptospirosis was confirmed positive on the fifth day of hospitalization, whereas microbiological tests for other infectious agents including malaria, dengue, and typhoid were negative. Chest x-ray examination showed bilateral haziness and revealed acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pulmonary hemorrhage. Bleeding was observed in the endotracheal tube (ET) on the fifth hospital day, which was confirmed to be due to pulmonary hemorrhage. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started on hospital day 1 with intravenous tazobactam/piperacillin and levofloxacin; doxycycline was added orally from day 5. The patient continued to bleed through the ET tube for additional 2 days. Blood analyses of prothrombin time (PT), activated prothrombin time (APTT), and hemoglobin (Hb) showed significant derangement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010393341">Table I</xref>). In view of pulmonary hemorrhage, probably due to leptospirosis, intravenous methylprednisolone infusion was initiated from the sixth hospital day. Intravenous methylprednisolone was started at a high dose of 500 mg/d infused over 1 hour, and the dose was immediately tapered to 250, 125, and 60 mg/d on successive days; the patient was switched to oral prednisolone therapy 60 mg/d from day 10. Six pints of fresh frozen plasma and 3 pints of platelets were transfused in view of low hemoglobin level and low platelet counts. Our patient responded well to methylprednisolone therapy, and his Hb, PT, and APTT returned to normal; lung bleeding ceased and LFT and RFT improved. He was gradually weaned off the ventilator according to standard protocols and extubated on the sixth hospital day. Tazobactam/piperacillin combination and doxycycline were continued for 2 weeks and then stopped. Oral steroids were also slowly tapered and stopped in a 2-week period coincident with the patient’s improving clinical status and decreased febrile episodes. His oral nutrition improved as did his ambulation with the help of physiotherapy. As he was a chronic alcoholic and smoker, psychiatry consultation was sought in view of treatment for addiction. Alcohol dependence syndrome was detected, and haloperidol therapy was initiated to prevent withdrawal symptoms and acamprosate to prevent craving. As the patient symptomatically improved with this therapy, he was discharged with advice to abstain from alcohol and to return for review after 2 weeks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although leptospirosis produces several clinical findings, it generally manifests in 2 forms. One is less severe and generally nonfatal, often referred to as <italic>anicteric leptospirosis</italic>, and accounts for approximately 90% of cases. The illness commonly begins abruptly and includes headache, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion and other ocular abnormalities, fever, nausea, vomiting, rash, and meningismus. Epistaxis or other minor bleeding can occur, as can myocarditis. In addition to including these features, the more severe form of leptospirosis, referred to as <italic>icteric leptospirosis</italic> or <italic>Weil disease</italic>, causes jaundice, renal impairment, and major hemorrhagic complications. Pulmonary involvement is less common, generally associated with hemoptysis and bilateral reticulonodular infiltration on chest x-ray.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010393341">4</xref></sup> Recent reports suggest that the severity of the disease increases with pulmonary involvement, reflected by a 2-fold increase in mortality in patients with pulmonary involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010393341">6</xref></sup> Although the pathogenesis of the pulmonary manifestations is poorly understood, infectious vasculitis is believed to be responsible. This pulmonary vascular injury is probably attributable to a disseminated intravascular coagulation–like reaction to leptospira toxins mediated by tumor necrosis factor. Values of soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations are high and correlate with the clinical course of leptospirosis. Many case reports and case series have documented the frequent occurrence of hemoptysis and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010393341">6</xref></sup> As such, systemic glucocorticosteroid therapy would appear to represent targeted therapy by suppressing the disease-induced inflammation and resultant pulmonary hemorrhage. It is very possible that a reduction in cytokine and tumor necrosis factor-α production by pharmacologic doses of systemic corticosteroid attenuates or reverses the disease-associated vasculitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010393341">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010393341">8</xref></sup> Courtin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010393341">9</xref></sup> were probably the first to describe a good clinical response to systemic corticosteroid in the treatment of pulmonary leptospirosis. Trivedi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010393341">10</xref></sup> reported a favorable outcome following pulse glucocorticoid therapy using dexamethasone for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/d) for 7 days. Recognizing that clinically available, systemically administered corticosteroids at equipotent doses are all very similar in their anti-inflammatory activity and vary primarily in their duration of action and propensity for sodium retention, it would appear that there are no important advantages of one analog over another.</p>

<sec id="section3-0091270010393341">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The administration of a high dose of methyl prednisolone was found to be beneficial in treating a patient of leptospirosis with severe pulmonary hemorrhage. This report suggests that a high dose of corticosteroids may be beneficial in leptospirosis-induced pulmonary hemorrhage.</p>
