<abstract>
<p>Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) aims to reduce the number and size of skin incisions. The authors compared systemic stress and perioperative outcome of SILS and laparoscopic (LAP) cholecystectomy. Twenty-nine subjects (8 males and 21 females; mean age = 47 years; mean body mass index = 27) were included in the study. There was no statistical difference in mean operative time (LAP = 89 minutes; SILS = 113 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>), and no intraoperative complications were reported. There were no statistically significant differences observed in white cell count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α between SILS and LAP groups. The mean hospital length of stay (LAP = 1.8 days; SILS = 1.4 days) and Visual Analogue Scale scores for pain at 6 hours (LAP = 5.14; SILS = 4.46) and 24 hours (LAP = 3.9; SILS = 2.815) were similar with no perioperative morbidity. These results suggest that the systemic stress response in LAP and SILS cholecystectomy does not appear to be significantly different. SILS cholecystectomy appears safe with no perioperative morbidity or complications encountered in this series.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Attempts to optimize surgical technique during the last decade have lead to the development of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), which aims to reduce the number and size of skin incisions to a single scar usually made at the umbilicus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611420453">1</xref></sup> Theoretically, this brings about excellent cosmetic results and reduces surgical trauma.</p>
<p>It has been shown in previous studies comparing laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy that there is a significant reduction in the systemic stress as well as perioperative morbidity such as length of stay, infection rates, sick leave, and pain with smaller incisions and reduced parietal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611420453">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611420453"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611420453">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a search for a reliable test to evaluate the extent of surgical trauma, cytokines have been identified as a fast and reliable measurement. There is a substantial amount of evidence supporting the role of inflammatory cytokines in tissue response to surgical trauma and their correlation with postoperative clinical outcomes such as pain, mobilization, and duration of hospital stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611420453">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611420453"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611420453">7</xref></sup> The magnitude of the trauma and the degree of tissue damage has an impact on the trauma response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611420453">8</xref></sup> There is evidence that a more pronounced stress response may have adverse implications on the healing process and overall patient morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611420453">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611420453">10</xref></sup> Therefore, inflammatory cytokine levels may be used to predict perioperative morbidity.</p>
<p>On infliction of trauma on the body, several cytokines are released that play a role in the systemic inflammatory cascade. The role played by interleukin-6 (IL-6) is of particular interest as it is an endogenous pyogen that can act in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to increase the synthesis of acute-phase response proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) in hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611420453">11</xref></sup> The increase in levels of IL-6 during surgery directly causes an increase in plasma CRP levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611420453">12</xref></sup> A rise in IL-6 appears to increase the likelihood of developing wound site and bacterial infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611420453">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The length of surgical incisions in SILS cholecystectomy is reduced when compared with conventional laparoscopic (LAP) cholecystectomy; hence, the level of trauma induced on the patient is likely to be decreased. A comparison of the IL-6 and CRP responses induced by the 2 types of surgery can provide an interesting model to investigate the role of tissue damage in the acute-phase response.</p>
<p>We aim to determine if surgical stress response is altered by the abolishment of the 3 extra laparoscopic incisions used during conventional LAP cholecystectomy and to compare and contrast the clinical outcomes of conventional LAP cholecystectomy with SILS cholecystectomy in a nonrandomized controlled trial, with particular attention to the different surgical stress responses they produce. We hypothesize that IL-6 will raise proportionately less with SILS when compared with LAP and that this will correlate to a reduction in postoperative morbidity.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained for the study from St Mary’s Hospital Research Ethics Committee, and the project was funded by Imperial College NHS Trust (REC Ref: 08/H0712/146). Sponsorship and indemnity was attained from Imperial College Research Governance Office.</p>
<sec id="section3-1553350611420453">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>From the patients scheduled for an elective cholecystectomy due to symptomatic gallstones between February and May 2010, 29 patients were considered for this study. Subjects with comorbidities or complications that result in an increased baseline cytokine level were excluded such as those with acute infection, sepsis, malignancy, and acute or chronic inflammation. On admission, the medical team performed an evaluation and clinical examination to determine if the patient met the inclusion criteria. Written consent to enter the study was obtained from each participant after a full explanation was given, and an information leaflet offered. All those who were offered to participate in the study agreed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350611420453">
<title>Operative Details</title>
<p>Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and general anesthesia was standardized in all patients. SILS cholecystectomy was performed using a 2- to 3-cm intraumbilical incision. Transcutaneous traction stitches were used for mobilizing and manipulating the gallbladder. Dissection was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments. The wound was closed using a 2/0 Vicryl suture and infiltrated with local anesthetic (20-mL 0.5% Marcaine) in all patients. LAP cholecystectomy was performed using 4 incisions in the conventional manner. Intraabdominal cholangiography was not performed in any of the patients.</p>
<p>Operative time was calculated from the first skin incision to wound closure. The postoperative time was also calculated from when the incision was made and trauma induced on the body.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350611420453">
<title>Blood Samples</title>
<p>A 15-mL blood sample was obtained from a peripheral vein preoperatively as baseline measurement. A further 2 blood samples were taken from the patients postoperatively at 6 and 24 hours to assess the impact of the 2 operative techniques on the blood protein levels. Previous studies have shown the peak levels of IL-6 to be at 6 hours postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611420453">14</xref></sup> These samples were analyzed for IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, and white cell count (WCC). In some patients, the latter time point was not collected due to patient discharge, but where cytokine data are presented there are at least 2 data points (baseline plus 6 hours).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350611420453">
<title>Pain Visual Analogue Score</title>
<p>A visual analogue score (VAS) for pain was designed to assess the patients’ postoperative pain. This was taken at periods of 6 and 24 hours after the operation. All patients received local anesthesia in theatre as well as postoperative analgesia as required as per institutional postoperative cholecystectomy protocols; however, differences were not recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350611420453">
<title>ELISA Procedure</title>
<p>Blood samples for IL-6 and TNF-α were spun, plasma removed, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C within 20 minutes of venepuncture. IL-6 and TNF-α were measured using high-sensitivity Quantikine immunoassay kits from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. All readings taken from the ELISA plates were standardized by assessing positive control values that were assayed in duplicate on each plate. All samples were assayed in duplicate and the standard curve ran from 10 to 0.156 pg/mL (IL-6) and from 32 to 0.5 pg/mL (TNF-α).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1553350611420453">
<title>Postoperative Follow-up</title>
<p>The length of stay (LOS) in hospital after the operation was recorded. Patients were followed-up by telephone consultation at 2 weeks and 2 months postoperatively to assess their postoperative recovery. Rates of wound infection, length of hospital stay, and morbidity were quantified. Patients who developed postoperative complications that may need further assessment were invited to attend a 15-minute outpatients appointment as per protocol. The patients’ GP notes were also examined with patient consent, to explore complications in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1553350611420453">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using statistical software (SPSS v16.0, Chicago, IL). Medians of nonparametric variables were compared using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Comparison of medians of several nonparametric groups were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test and ANOVA for parametric variables. Differences were considered statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. CRP &lt;5 mg/L was computed as 2.5.</p>

<sec id="section11-1553350611420453">
<title>Patient Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 29 subjects were included in the study. The SILS group consisted of 5 male and 11 female (mean age = 47.1 ± 16.9 years) subjects, and the LAP group included 3 male and 10 female (mean age = 47.6 ± 10.2 years) subjects (<italic>P</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>). The mean body mass index in the SILS group was 28.27 ± 6.3 compared with 26.3 ± 5.8 in the LAP group (<italic>P</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1553350611420453">
<title>Operative Outcomes</title>
<p>There was no significant difference in the mean duration of surgery for SILS cholecystectomy compared with LAP (LAP = 89.29 ± 19.0 minutes; SILS = 113.3 ± 33.7 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .139). Two cases (1 SILS, 1 LAP) had minor intraoperative bleeding from the liver bed. One case was converted from SILS to LAP by placement of an additional abdominal port, due to extensive adhesions and technical difficulties and was included in the LAP group. None of the patients in the LAP group were converted to open surgery.</p>

<title>Systemic Stress Response</title>
<p>There was no significant difference in the basal serum CRP levels in LAP and SILS groups (LAP = 3.3 ± 2.0 mg/L; SILS = 13 ± 21.7 mg/L; <italic>P</italic> = .13). However, both groups followed a similar trend between 6 (LAP = 3.6 ± 2.1 mg/L; SILS = 9.8 ± 16.2 mg/L; <italic>P</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>) and 24 hours (LAP = 39.9 ± 51.5 mg/L; SILS = 44 ± 69.1 mg/L; <italic>P</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>) as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611420453">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgery is a unique example of planned trauma, which allows for measurement and comparison of the systemic stress response. The systemic stress response refers to the systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines induced by trauma during surgery similar to the systemic response in an infective or inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611420453">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611420453">16</xref></sup> With the advent of minimal access procedures, we have witnessed a decrease in the level of acute-phase protein production and a correlation with better postoperative outcomes such as decreased postoperative pain, wound infection, postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stay compared with open surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611420453">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611420453"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611420453">4</xref></sup> This is thought to be due to the reduction in parietal trauma from open surgery to laparoscopic procedures.</p>
<p>This comparison reveals that there appears to be no significant difference between SILS and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of cytokine stress response induced by the parietal trauma. Both SILS and LAP groups follow a similar pattern in the plasma levels of IL-6, TNF-α, WCC, and CRP over the 24-hour period of study.</p>
<p>Consistent with published data, our study showed a similar peak in IL-6 at 6 hours postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611420453">17</xref></sup> The reduction seen in the IL-6 levels in SILS was not statistically significant compared with the LAP group between 6 and 24 hours. Although the mechanism of systemic IL-6 release after surgery is not clear, there is a significant correlation between the level of surgical trauma and a rise in IL-6 levels as defined by operation length and blood loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611420453">17</xref></sup> In our comparison there was no significant difference in operative time or blood loss between LAP and SILS groups.</p>
<p>There was no significant difference in the TNF-α levels measured in peripheral blood at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. The 6-hour postoperative levels of TNF-α show a dip and a slow rise by 24 hours. Both Grande et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611420453">18</xref></sup> and Chaudhary et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611420453">4</xref></sup> measured a peak at 12 hours, which showed a difference between open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, Sakamoto et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611420453">17</xref></sup> could only measure a transient rise of TNF-α in the drainage fluid 3 to 6 hours postoperatively and almost never in the peripheral blood. Our measurement of TNF-α could mean that we have missed the peak levels by measuring TNF-α at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively or that the rise was not significant in the peripheral blood, or the numbers of patients in the study were too small.</p>
<p>There was no difference found in the CRP and WCC plasma levels postoperatively between the 2 groups. Redmond et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611420453">19</xref></sup> and Halevy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611420453">20</xref></sup> also found no difference in CRP rise in laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy.</p>
<p>There is also no difference in the postoperative outcomes measured in this study, and similar results for postoperative pain, LOS, morbidity, and complications were observed.</p>
<p>The reduction in incision size and hence parietal trauma is significant when comparing open cholecystectomy and laparoscopic techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611420453">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611420453">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611420453">18</xref></sup> However, the similar outcomes between SILS and conventional laparoscopy are likely to be because minimizing incision size further from laparoscopy to SILS is only a minor step compared with the difference in trauma induced by a right upper quadrant abdominal incision of open cholecystectomy versus the laparoscopic approach.</p>
<p>The small sample size of our study could lead to a type II error. Although the sample size for our study was small and no pilot data were available to perform a power calculation for sample size, we have based the number of subjects that needed to be recruited on previous studies comparing open cholecystectomy versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which have found a significant difference with a similar sample size. Karayiannakis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611420453">2</xref></sup> found a significant difference in 41 subjects for IL-6 and CRP measured at baseline, 10 minutes after skin incision, skin closure, and 4, 8, and 24 hours postoperatively. Grande et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611420453">18</xref></sup> also had 41 patients with a difference measured in IL-6, TNF-α, CRP, and WCC at 12 hours postoperatively while Chaudhury et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611420453">4</xref></sup> used 40 patients to measure TNF-α and CRP levels but measured at baseline and 12 hours postsurgery. It is of course true that should there be a small difference in systemic stress between the groups, which was undetected in this study, this may have been revealed by examining a larger number of subjects during a longer trial period. Our laboratory staffs were blinded to the type of operation that patients underwent to reduce bias.</p>
<p>Larger, multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine the true benefit of this novel technique. The results of this study indicate that there is no difference in the systemic stress response between laparoscopic and SILS cholecystectomy due to the decrease in parietal trauma. Provided this is correct, a larger sample size would of course not reveal a difference unless there was a type I error. However, with this in mind, based on the differences in mean serum levels of IL-6 at 6 hours postoperatively (9.35 vs 7.5) and a common standard deviation of 4.21, a power calculation indicated the need for a minimum of 164 subjects for 80% power with a type I error rate of 0.05 in a larger randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest that SILS is a safe and feasible technique with favorable postoperative outcomes. Although SILS has a longer operative time in this trial, this is associated with a learning curve for the operating surgeon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611420453">21</xref></sup> Our study examines the short-term morbidity in SILS cholecystectomy patients, and longer follow-up may reveal a difference in long-term morbidity such as incisional hernia compared with conventional laparoscopy. There is little morbidity and postoperative pain and certainly superior cosmesis, which may play a key role in future patient choice.</p>
