<p>For language teaching and testing professionals, this volume represents an authoritative account of academic language proficiency testing in the UK. This volume serves as number 23 in the <italic>Studies in Language Testing</italic> series (Series Editors: Michael Milanovic and Cyril Weir). In this important contribution to the history of language testing, the author takes readers through the early development and use of the English Proficiency Test Battery (EPTB) in the 1960s, followed by the development and implementation of the English Language Testing Service (ELTS) in the 1970s and 1980s, leading up to the introduction of the then revolutionary International English Language Testing System (IELTS) in 1989.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into six sections. The first five sections detail the historical information about the assessment instruments under review, while the last section is a fairly comprehensive list of appendices relating to the tests described in the volume.</p>
<p>In Section 1, entitled ‘The 1950s and 1960s: The English Proficiency Test Battery’, Davies gives informative parallel descriptions of the language proficiency testing landscape in the USA, the British Commonwealth, and the UK at that time, paying particular homage to the role that the British Council played in the UK (through its project in collaboration with the University of Birmingham) in the initial development of the English Proficiency Test Battery (EPTB). The EPTB was developed between 1963 and 1965, and was used by the British Council’s overseas operations from 1965 to 1980. In a very interesting discussion, Davies elaborates on the EPTB designers’ decision to exclude the productive skills of speaking and writing and focus solely on the receptive skills of listening and reading in early versions of this test. The remainder of this chapter focuses on a general description of the individual sections and subsections of the test and how the cut scores were determined. Davies closes out this section with a discussion of the four versions of the EPTB, with a particular focus on Version D, which was a much revised version of the EPTB and which served as the basis for the English Language Testing Service (ELTS) test.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 chronicles the paradigm shift that resulted in the ELTS test. This shift to address changes brought about by the communicative language teaching movement began in 1975 with the formation of a joint consultative group representing the British Council and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). This chapter, aptly entitled ‘Communicative Interlude: The Story of ELTS’, describes the events leading up to the replacement of the EPTB with the ELTS in 1980. Probably the most important part of this chapter is the rationale for ELTS on page 34 of this volume. In this short section, the initial test specifications are briefly described, as are the principal criteria for the test (relevance, acceptability, comparability, and economy). For an active IELTS examiner such as myself, I found the description of the two general tests to be very interesting and informative. The remainder of the chapter describes the ELTS Validation Project and the impact that the ELTS had at the time. Particularly fascinating were the views that well-known figures in language testing (i.e. Hamp-Lyons, Weir, Skehan, and Henning) expressed at the time, which addressed for the most part the role of the assessment (as a screening/selection test or an assessment with a diagnostic function). These same testers pointed to a critical need for ELTS test developers to validate the test empirically before a worldwide administration.</p>
<p>The author starts Chapter 3, entitled ‘Retreat from Revolution: 1981–7<italic>’</italic>, by describing further plans of the ELTS Validation Project and focusing especially on internal and external studies that were underway at UCLES. After a short account of the main foci of both the internal and external studies that were to be conducted, Davies describes the changes that were to be introduced into the new ELTS. The highlight of this chapter for me was the detailed description of the steps followed by UCLES in conducting a major test revision. Not only was a wide variety of studies conducted to validate empirically various aspects of the test but throughout the process various stakeholders in the process were polled and their opinions and recommendations were taken into account for the revision of what is now known as the IELTS test. To put the revision further into perspective, Davies briefly describes three other proficiency tests (English Language Battery (ELBA); Test of English for Educational Purposes (TEEP); Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)) in order to, as he puts it, ‘indicate where IELTS could have gone’ (p. 70).</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Davies describes the changes to ELTS made on the basis of the ELTS Validation Study, and the subsequent revision leading up to IELTS during the years 1987–89. In this chapter the author shares with readers the revisions made to the test specifications and the content, format, and structure of the test. A major part of this chapter was describing the development and differences between the two modules of the ELTS (general training and academic).</p>
<p>On a historical timeline, Chapter 5, appropriately entitled ‘The Development of IELTS’, begins in 1989 when the IELTS officially became operational. In the beginning of this chapter, the author briefly summarizes the changes made as a result of the ELTS Validation Project. Interestingly enough, the IELTS test versions that were operational in 1989 are included in the appendix. Davies also explains how ELTS went to IELTS with the introduction of ‘International’ in the name of the test. He succinctly describes the roles of the triumvirate charged with creating and administering the IELTS worldwide: British Council, IDP Australia and UCLES (now Cambridge ESOL). For me this chapter was the highlight of the volume as the author describes the development of the IELTS from 1989 onwards, summarizing the 1993 and 2005 revisions to the test.</p>
<p>The last section, the appendices, consists of a variety of historical documents relating to the language tests discussed in this volume. The appendices, which constitute about 75% of the volume, are a treasure trove of useful information, ranging from test specifications to the 1989 versions of the IELTS test. I feel that the 50 years of history described in this volume are greatly enhanced by the wealth of information brought together in the appendix.</p>
<p>I am very much in agreement with the series editors in their introduction when they say that Alan Davies is ideally suited to tracing the development of the assessment of academic English proficiency from the 1950s to the 1990s because of his deep and personal involvement in its history. Indeed I feel privileged to have his ‘insider’ perspective on such an important period in the history of language assessment. Of interest to any stakeholder in the second language assessment arena, this volume is of particular relevance to language test developers and policy makers and those professionals wanting to know more about why and how the IELTS exam has had such a successful history.</p>
