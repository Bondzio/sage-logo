<abstract>
<p>This article creates a dialogue between Philo’s and Paul the Apostle’s interpretations of Gen. 15.6—specifically, their understandings of Abraham’s faith. Both Philo and Paul see Abraham as functioning in a formally analogous way: for example, Abraham’s faith identifies him as a representative or paradigmatic figure for those who follow him. Yet Philo and Paul develop their interpretations in remarkably divergent fashions. Accordingly, this article will seek to discern the hermeneutical fault line that allows two near-contemporary readers of the same text to construe it so differently. As will be demonstrated, Philo reads Abraham’s story as the narrative of Abraham’s becoming virtuous, and thus how one attains virtue is the key to Philo’s hermeneutic; Paul, by contrast, interprets Abraham’s faith from the vantage point of the Christ-event, such that the focus is on the incongruity between God’s gift and the human recipient.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to facilitate a conversation between Philo and Paul about the meaning and significance of Abraham’s faith in Gen. 15.6.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X12462658">1</xref></sup> As near contemporaries and fellow readers of the Jewish scriptures, Philo and Paul converge on a number of important points in their understandings of Abraham, but the contexts and implications of these convergences are deeply dissimilar. Both view Abraham as one whose belief in God represents a break with a past life without God, such that Abraham’s faith then establishes him as a representative figure. However, whereas for Philo, Abraham’s faith is definitive as the culmination of his progression in attaining virtue—the development of a specific internal nature—for Paul, Abraham’s faith is important solely as it relates to God’s future promise, with the narrative content of Abraham’s past life being unimportant in itself. Furthermore, Abraham’s position as the first of a non-ethnically determined group reflects another similarity-in-contrast: for Philo, Abraham’s status as model proselyte is based on the acquisition of virtue as a universal human possibility, while for Paul, Abraham’s fatherhood of Jews <italic>and</italic> Gentiles is the result of God’s act in the Christ-event. The simultaneity of topical continuity and exegetical contrast presses the hermeneutical question: why do Philo and Paul read the same text <italic>differently</italic>?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X12462658">2</xref></sup> By asking this question, this article will uncover the theological judgments and hermeneutical rationales that shape their respective readings of the Abraham narrative and thus clarify the role Abraham performs in their respective theologies.</p>
<p>I will begin by giving a reading of Abraham in Philo’s argument in <italic>De Virtutibus</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X12462658">3</xref></sup> perhaps Philo’s most concise and paradigmatic handling of Abraham and his faith,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X12462658">4</xref></sup> and then, turning to Paul, I will seek to let the reading of Philo guide what issues are covered most thoroughly in Rom. 4.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X12462658">5</xref></sup> As we will see, setting Philo and Paul in dialogue displays how formally close and yet materially divergent two readers of the same Jewish scriptures could be in their understanding of a figure like Abraham and his faith in God.</p>
<sec id="section1-0142064X12462658">
<title>Abraham in Philo’s <italic>De Virtutibus</italic></title>
<p>Philo’s interpretation of Abraham’s faith in Gen. 15.6 in <italic>De Virtutibus</italic> 212-19 is set in the context of his discussion of nobility—how being noble or ignoble is not a matter of one’s lineage or ancestry but is a result of how one’s own life is lived in relation to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X12462658">6</xref></sup> Accordingly, to Philo, having noble ancestors without living nobly is as useful as having ancestors with exceptional vision while being blind (193). Philo provides easy examples to buttress this claim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X12462658">7</xref></sup> On the one side, belonging to the ‘erring class’ (ἡ ἐπίληπτος τάξις)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X12462658">8</xref></sup>—that is, evil children from noble parents—the noble Adam begat murderous Cain; righteous Noah begat peeping Ham; and even Adam himself, the eternal God’s son, chose evil rather than the good (198-205). In Jewish history, Philo argues that, apart from Isaac, Abraham’s sons were essentially degenerates, and Esau was the rotten product of Isaac (206-10). It is clear that these wicked individuals gained nothing from their ancestors’ virtues (αἱ πατέρων ἀρεταί) but were harmed by their own countless evils (211). However, on the other side, unsavory parents can birth virtuous children, and Abraham is Philo’s first and paradigmatic example of this better class of humans (ἡ ἀμείνων τάξις). The point toward which the whole section drives is that each person is judged according to his own worth and virtue; judgment and reward are given appropriately to whomever they are due, based on the life lived and not on the merits of the person’s forebears (226-27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X12462658">9</xref></sup> In Abraham’s case, his progenitors were under accusation (ὑπαίτιοι) because of their wickedness, but Abraham himself lived a life that was full of good repute (ἀνάπλεως εὐφημίας ὁ βίος) and worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Hence, Philo begins in sections 212-13 by explaining the erroneous lifestyle and beliefs of Abraham’s ancestors as the milieu from which Abraham came.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12462658">10</xref></sup> As the ‘eldest member of the Jewish nation’ (τοῦ τῶν ’Ιουδαίων ἔθνους ὁ πρεσβύτατος), Abraham <italic>was</italic> (ἦν) a Chaldean whose father was an astronomer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X12462658">11</xref></sup> one who considers the stars, heaven and earth all to be gods (θεοί).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X12462658">12</xref></sup> Chaldean astronomers assume everything good and bad that happens to have proceeded from these gods, as they suppose that there is no cause beyond what the senses perceive (οὐδὲν ἔξω τῶν αἰσθητῶν αἴτιον).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X12462658">13</xref></sup> Locating causation in the created world is a grievous error for Philo, and he asks what could be more horrible (χαλεπώτερον) than having a knowledge of secondary and created causes (ἐπιστήμη τῶν πολλῶν καὶ δευτέρων καὶ γενητῶν) that leads to ignorance of the ‘one and oldest and uncreated Creator of the universe’ (τοῦ ἑνὸς καὶ πρεσβυτάτου καὶ ἀγενήτου καὶ ποιητοῦ τῶν ὅλων)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X12462658">14</xref></sup> God’s greatness already makes him incomprehensible, but Chaldeans stop before arriving at the point of even pondering God’s existence, much less his essence. Thus, in Philo’s estimation, the Chaldean search for knowledge and truth is brutally short: one sees the world and is done. And in their efforts to understand the created world, Chaldeans misconstrue reality poorly, because their construal itself precludes God’s existence. This is the context of godlessness in which Abraham is to be located.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X12462658">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sections 214-15 narrate Abraham’s ‘sojourn’ from Chaldea. Abraham’s journey <italic>is</italic> considered a physical departure from his homeland and family (καταλείπει πατρίδα καὶ γενεὰν καὶ πατρῷον οἶκον; cf. Gen. 12.1-9). As Donaldson states, ‘his migration was not simply a journey of the mind but also a real social translocation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X12462658">2007</xref>: 251).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X12462658">16</xref></sup> But for Philo, Abraham had to get away—somewhere—so that his mind would no longer be deluded by Chaldean thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X12462658">17</xref></sup> The attainment of virtue in knowing God towards which Abraham pressed was a moving towards God, not a new ethnic homeland, although, according to Philo, Abraham would actually physically have to leave Chaldea to clear his mind sufficiently enough to achieve this task.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X12462658">18</xref></sup> Philo abruptly states that Abraham received a conception of these things and was under divine inspiration (ἔννοιαν λαβὼν καὶ ἐπιθειάσας), and thus left his homeland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X12462658">19</xref></sup> The content of the ἔννοια and divine inspiration is not explicated,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X12462658">20</xref></sup> but presumably harks back to the conception of God as One and uncreated Creator that Chaldeans lack, which prompted Abraham’s departure, and is conflated with God’s declaratory promise to Abraham in Gen. 12.1-3. Genesis 12.1-3 is likely what is meant by the oracles (λόγια) that were given to him which fanned his desire to know the Existent One (τὸν πόθον ὃν ἐπόθει γνῶναι τὸ ὄν; 215).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X12462658">21</xref></sup> Thus equipped, Abraham knows that remaining in Chaldea with its polytheistic and materialistic errors (αἱ τῆς πολυθέου δόξης ἀπάται) makes it impossible for him to be filled with the truth of the one God, who alone is ‘Father of all things conceptual <italic>and</italic> sensible’ (νοητῶν καὶ αἰσθητῶν);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X12462658">22</xref></sup> leaving Chaldea is leaving error and making room for truth. In a statement that runs parallel to Paul in Rom. 1.25, Abraham’s departure means the ‘correcting of false thought into truth’ (μεθαρμοσαμένης <underline>τὴν</underline> <underline>ψευδῆ</underline> δόξαν <underline>εἰς</underline> <underline>ἀλήθειαν</underline>; Rom. 1.25: οἵτινες μετήλλαξαν <underline>τὴν ἀλήθειαν</underline> τοῦ θεοῦ <underline>ἐν</underline> <underline>τῷ</underline> <underline>ψεύδει</underline>). Compared linguistically with Paul’s statement, Philo’s Abraham does the exact opposite of the godless. Accordingly, Abraham’s sojourn is translated into a resolute search for the one God guided by divine inspiration, which does not conclude until Abraham receives a clearer vision of God (τρανοτέρας λαβεῖν φαντασίας)—not God’s essence(οὐσία) but his existence and providence (ὕπαρξις καὶ πρόνοια),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X12462658">23</xref></sup> which were exactly what Chaldeans were unable to imagine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X12462658">24</xref></sup> Abraham does not see God, but God appears to Abraham (Gen. 12.7): ‘Abraham apprehended only what God deigned to reveal of his nature’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X12462658">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>‘Therefore’, Philo declares, ‘he is the first said to have believed in God’ (διὸ καὶ πιστεῦσαι λέγεται τῷ θεῷ πρῶτος, 216).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X12462658">26</xref></sup> Abraham’s backstory culminates in Gen. 15.6. Philo recapitulates the cause of this belief that he has been narrating so far: Abraham was the first to have an ‘unswerving and firm notion’ (ἀκλινῆ καὶ βεβαίαν ἔσχεν ὑπόληψιν) that God is One and is the highest cause (ἓν αἴτιον τὸ ἀνωτάτω) who cares for the world and all that is in it. Because of this, Abraham ‘acquired faith’ (κτησάμενος πίστιν),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X12462658">27</xref></sup> faith being defined as the ‘most certain of the virtues’ (τὴν τῶν ἀρετῶν βεβαιοτάτην), and possession of all of the other virtues follows suit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X12462658">28</xref></sup> As Philo makes clear here, Abraham’s story—his progression towards God—<italic>prior</italic> to Gen. 15.6 is crucially consequential as it promotes the content of Abraham’s faith. Abraham’s faith is the culmination of his knowledge of God, conceived of as a virtue, and thus can be understood as the development or cultivation of his internal nature—faith is a noetic concept, a grasping of proper concepts about God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X12462658">29</xref></sup> Henceforth, faith is the motivation and impulse for further action. That is, as knowledge of God is a virtue that entails possession of the other virtues, knowledge of God results in virtuous living. Abraham’s faith in God makes him virtuous, so he lives virtuously.</p>
<p>Sections 216-17 remark on the respect and plaudits Abraham received from others because of his virtue, because of his greatness of soul rather than external appearance, an internal greatness that was more perfect than normal with humans (τελειοτέρας οὔσης ἢ κατὰ ἄνθρωπον), and his kingly nature that commanded honor from those around him (cf. Gen. 23.6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X12462658">30</xref></sup> Whenever Abraham was possessed by the ‘divine spirit’ (τοῦ θείου πνεύματος), everything about him changed to the better (πρὸς τὸ βέλτιον)—even his physical features—such that he received praise from those around him, because the divine spirit breathed upon him from above (ἄνωθεν καταπνευσθέν), dwelled in his soul, and adorned his body with a ‘special beauty’ (κάλλος ἐξαίρετον).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X12462658">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, in 218-19 Philo states that ‘this immigrant’ Abraham, although he was completely without family and friends, was of the highest nobility (εὐγενέστατος), because he desired kinship with God (πρὸς θεὸν συγγενεία) and worked intensely (σπουδάσαντα μηχανῇ πάσῃ) to be well known to God (γνώριμον αὐτῷ γενέσθαι). And he was of this highest rank—equal with the prophets and considered a king by his fellow humans—because he ‘had faith in nothing created above the uncreated Father of all’ (πιστεύσαντα δὲ μηδενὶ τῶν ἐν γενέσει πρὸ τοῦ ἀγενήτου καὶ πάντων πατρός, 218).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X12462658">32</xref></sup> As such a virtuous person, Abraham fittingly received kingly sovereignty not through physical, worldly means, but by God’s election (χειροτονίᾳ θεοῦ τοῦ φλαρέτου)—God who loves virtue, who ‘rewards (γεραίρω) the lovers of piety with absolute authority for the benefit of those who are around them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X12462658">33</xref></sup> Abraham’s faith made a sheer break with his past godless life as a Chaldean, and defined him solely in terms of his relation with God as a virtuous man—and appropriately God rewarded Abraham.</p>
<p>Thus, for Philo, Abraham’s status makes him the ‘standard of nobility for all proselytes’ (οὗτος ἅπασιν ἐπηλύταις εὐγενείας ἐστὶ κανών)—proselytes being those who ‘leave’ or ‘forsake the low birth that comes from strange laws and horrible customs that impart divine honors (ἰσοθέους ἀπένειμε τιμάς) to stones, trees, and altogether lifeless things’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X12462658">34</xref></sup> As Barclay states, in Philo’s view ‘any who join the Jewish community as proselytes have a lot of nonsense to unlearn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142064X12462658">1996</xref>: 176). Proselytes strive toward a truly living citizenship (πρὸς ἔμψυχον τῷ ὄντι καὶ ζῶσαν πολιτείαν), which has truth as its ‘guardian and overseer’ (ἔφορος καὶ ἐπίσκοπος ἀλήθεια).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X12462658">35</xref></sup> That is, proselytes do exactly what Abraham did.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0142064X12462658">36</xref></sup> Consequently, Philo sees his argument as proving that Abraham was virtuous because of his faith, unlike his ancestors; and his ancestors can be virtuous only if they live virtuously. As the logic of Philo’s argument necessitates, the group of which Abraham stands at the head is not defined exclusively by ethnic or filial lines (Abraham himself was Chaldean!) but by each person’s proper knowledge of the one true God—his or her faith—and thus the person’s virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0142064X12462658">37</xref></sup> Georgi remarks, ‘Abraham is meant to present a possibility’ that is ‘in general the true possibility of human existence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X12462658">1999</xref>: 58). Abraham is the ‘eldest member of the Jewish nation’ (211) and this possibility of being virtuous is one bound to Jewish monotheism, but Philo, nevertheless, still universalizes the particular promise by having those to whom the promise to Abraham is applicable be defined solely by virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0142064X12462658">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary: Philo interprets Gen. 15.6 by narrating Abraham’s backstory as his progression from Chaldea to the knowledge of God, which is the content of his faith and the development of his being as virtuous—and thus a fitting recipient of God’s gifts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0142064X12462658">39</xref></sup> Accordingly, the divine promise to Abraham is available to all, as living virtuously is a universal human possibility.</p>

<sec id="section2-0142064X12462658">
<title>Reading Abraham in Paul’s Argument in Romans 4—with Philo</title>
<p>Turning to Paul, we will see a number of intriguing, broad correspondences in his understanding and use of Abraham, but pressing past the similarities will reveal very distinct interpretations of Abraham and his faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0142064X12462658">40</xref></sup> In seeking to put Philo and Paul in conversation on issues pertinent to both thinkers, a number of important and well-worn interpretive issues in Rom. 4 cannot be touched on here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0142064X12462658">41</xref></sup> Thus, we will focus primarily on the following three points of contact between Philo and Paul: Abraham as an ungodly human, the relationship between Abraham’s faith in God and the inclusive group that follows in Abraham’s footsteps, and the hermeneutics of reading Gen. 15.6 in its narrative context. Furthermore, running through each point we will see that different understandings of grace confirm and animate their readings of Abraham.</p>
<sec id="section3-0142064X12462658">
<title>Abraham as Ungodly</title>
<p>First, like Philo’s, Paul’s Abraham is set in a context of godlessness. Although in Rom. 4 Paul does not paint a vivid portrait of the precise context from which Abraham comes, Abraham must be understood within Paul’s categorical assertions that ‘both Jews and Greeks are all under sin’ (3.9), that ‘there is none righteous’ (3.10), that ‘all have sinned and lack the glory of God’ (3.23) and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0142064X12462658">42</xref></sup> The specifics of Chaldean folly rest comfortably in Paul’s all-embracing argument in chs. 1 and 2, which sets Jews and Gentiles—all people—on equal ground as sinners and thus objects of God’s wrath and judgment (1.18, 24, 26, 28). Moreover, as Adams has shown, there are a number of interesting links between Paul’s argument in ch. 4 and 1.18-25 (1997: 48-54). For example, because of his faith Abraham ‘gave glory to God’ (δοὺς δόξαν τῷ θεῷ, 4.20), where Gentiles refused to glorify God (γνόντες τὸν θεὸν οὐχ ὡς θεὸν ἐδόξασαν, 1.21), the subject of God as Creator is found in 1.20, 25, and 4.17b, and Abraham’s recognition of God as δυνατός in 4.21 contrasts with the Gentile refusal to acknowledge God’s δύναμις in 1.20. Accordingly, as Adams states, the ‘appropriateness of the figure of Abraham as the reverse image of the picture Paul paints in 1.18-25 is plain to see’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X12462658">1997</xref>: 59).</p>
<p>The most notable link, however, is that in 1.18 God’s wrath is revealed against ‘all ungodliness and the injustice of humans’ (ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ἀσέβειαν καὶ ἀδικίαν ἀνθρώπων), while in 4.5 Abraham’s faith is in the one who ‘justifies the ungodly’ (τὸν δικαιοῦντα τὸν ἀσεβῆ)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0142064X12462658">43</xref></sup> and ‘reckons faith for righteousness’. The lexical connections are hard to miss: ἀσέβεια and ἀσεβής, ἀδικία, δικαιόω and δικαιοσύνη. The upshot is that because Abraham’s faith is in <italic>this God</italic> who justifies the ungodly, the reckoning of righteousness to Abraham in Rom. 4 is the justification of one such ungodly person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0142064X12462658">44</xref></sup> Abraham is a member of the set of the <italic>all</italic> who are not righteous (3.10) until justified by God. That is, in 4.4-5, we see that Abraham’s faith is understood within Paul’s faith-and-works dichotomy, such that Abraham’s being reckoned righteous rather than remaining godless is a divine act in recognition of Abraham’s faith instead of the result of something Abraham had done.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0142064X12462658">45</xref></sup> Abraham, as ungodly, is not able to do anything righteous before God. Accordingly, God’s justifying act is an act of grace (κατὰ χάριν) towards an ungodly and unrighteous Abraham who has no room to boast before God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0142064X12462658">46</xref></sup> It is fundamentally an unfitting gift from a God ‘who operates in grace without reference to the status or moral achievements of his beneficiaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12462658">Barclay 2011</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>Paul’s use of LXX Ps. 31.1 further explains and confirms what God’s reckoning righteousness means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0142064X12462658">47</xref></sup> Paul links v. 5 to v. 6 with καθάπερ, ‘just as’, showing that what David in the psalm says about God’s reckoning of righteousness apart from works (χωρὶς ἔργων) identifies the same reality as what happened in Abraham’s case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0142064X12462658">48</xref></sup> David claims that the person whom God justifies apart from works is blessed,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0142064X12462658">49</xref></sup> for God has forgiven their ‘lawless acts’ (αἱ ἀνομίαι), covered their sins (αἱ ἁμαρτίαι) and further, not reckoned sin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0142064X12462658">50</xref></sup> That is, in this context the reckoning of righteousness <italic>is</italic>—or at least includes—divine forgiveness or the acquittal of the ungodly object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0142064X12462658">51</xref></sup> Thus, for Paul, Abraham stands before God without merit or virtue,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0142064X12462658">52</xref></sup> as an object of God’s wrath whom God pardons solely as a gift because of his faith. As Bultmann states, the ‘paradox in “grace” is that it is precisely <italic>the transgressor, the sinner</italic>, to whom it applies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142064X12462658">2007</xref>: 282).</p>
<p>Hence, to repeat, God’s act of reckoning righteousness to Abraham because of his faith is an act of justifying specifically one who is ungodly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0142064X12462658">53</xref></sup> The justification is an act κατὰ χάριν. As with Philo, for Paul Abraham’s faith creates a break with a past life of ungodliness and is the establishment of a right relationship with God. Differently, however, Paul’s Abraham comes from a background of universal sin where there is no possibility of not being a sinner (cf., e.g., 5.12-21).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0142064X12462658">54</xref></sup> For Philo, the point is not that Abraham came from universal sinfulness but that he is an example of one human who overcame a godless background to have faith in God. Being ungodly is, in this case, more a result of Abraham’s location: Chaldea. Humanity might have sinful proclivities but is not ontologically sinful in a universal scope.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0142064X12462658">55</xref></sup> Thus, the sinfulness of all humanity is not axiomatic in Philo’s argument in <italic>De Virtutibus</italic>, as the other half of the argument is that godless and impious people can emerge from virtuous and god-fearing ancestors. For Philo and Paul the decisive factor is one’s faith in God, but that faith emerges from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>What is more, Philo’s and Paul’s Abrahams not only emerge from different backgrounds of distinctive severities of godlessness, but the manners by which they emerge are also dissimilar. As discussed above, Philo’s Abraham emerges from godlessness as the culmination of his departure from a godless place and people under divine inspiration. The emphasis falls consistently on Abraham as subject. Abraham’s life was ‘full of good repute’ and worthy of emulation (211); Abraham left his homeland and family (214); Abraham went forth in journeying to God without faltering; and Abraham was the first to believe in God because Abraham was the first to have a clear notion of God—thus, faith was something Abraham ‘acquired’ (κτάομαι), and this resulted in Abraham being treated like a king because of the greatness of his nature which shows through even his physical appearance as a result of the indwelling divine spirit. As Philo muses, Abraham was great because Abraham desired and strove by every means (ὀρεχθέντα καὶ σπουδάσαντα μηχανῇ πάσῃ) to be well known to God (218). Consequently, Abraham is the standard for proselytes because Abraham abandoned his ancestors’ ignoble laws and customs and settled in a better place. The emphasis in the text is on what Abraham did—and rightly so, because the key to Philo’s reading of the text is <italic>virtue</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0142064X12462658">56</xref></sup> But the end result is that Abraham’s faith is the culmination of Abraham’s action, and thus Abraham himself emerges from his past godlessness in continuity with his prior self. Abraham’s faith corresponds to Abraham’s right standing with God.</p>
<p>While Philo’s use of Abraham’s backstory might ultimately land his reading on the ‘works’ side of the Pauline disjunction, using Pauline criteria to judge Philo’s reading is misleading. The Pauline faith–works antithesis is un-Philonic: Philo’s Abraham <italic>believes</italic> and that is why he is rewarded, but his belief would be defined by Paul as a work. For Philo every human action—or indeed, ‘work’—must be understood within the context of divine causation and action because God is the sole cause of all things.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0142064X12462658">57</xref></sup> Or as Philo puts it, ‘It is necessary for the soul not to ascribe to itself its toil in behalf of virtue, but that it should take it away from itself and attribute it to God, confessing that not its own strength nor its power achieved the good, but the one who gave the love for it’ (ὁ καὶ τὸν ἔρωτα χαρισάμενος, <italic>Leg</italic>. 3.136).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0142064X12462658">58</xref></sup> Divine omni-causality is axiomatic, as indeed for Philo <italic>everything</italic> is a gift from God. Thus, to simplify something that is not simple, we cannot say ‘Paul and Grace, but Philo and Works’, as for Philo it is <italic>always</italic> God’s gifting which undergirds all virtuous human activity. Abraham emerges as virtuous from ungodliness but only through divine assistance and gifting. Indeed, from a Philonic viewpoint, we can look at Paul’s argument in Rom. 4 knowing that Paul has loaded his deck rhetorically by defining grace not only in opposition to works but also to any sense of worth or fittingness. For Paul, God’s grace is defined by and seen most clearly in the Christ-event as a gift given precisely to the unfitting, undeserving recipient, regardless of any status. As Paul states, sinful humanity is justified freely in God’s grace through redemption in Christ Jesus (3.24); Christ died at the right time for the ungodly (5.6); and the proof of God’s love is that Christ died for humans who were sinners, when in itself dying for a righteous person hardly makes sense (5.8). As the counterpoint to the sin of Adam, which resulted in a sinful humanity, God gives the Christ-gift precisely to sinners (5.15-19). For Philo, gifts are congruous with the recipient; for Paul, the gift is constituted by its incongruity to its recipient. Thus, Paul reads the Abraham narrative through this ‘pattern of incongruity’ seen in the gift of Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12462658">Barclay 2011</xref>: 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0142064X12462658">59</xref></sup> By contrast, Philo’s God acts <italic>wisely and rationally</italic> by giving to those who are fitting recipients;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0142064X12462658">60</xref></sup> Philo’s God is not an arbitrary Giver but rather an orderly Giver. God’s creation of the world and his endowment of humans with rational natures are acts of grace, and God’s gifts spur humans on to virtuous living that makes them worthy of further gifting. For Paul, grace is perfected by being an entirely unfitting gift; for Philo, grace is perfected as the prime cause of all that happens. Thus, if Paul places Philo’s understanding of grace on the ‘works’ side of his antithesis, then Philo places Paul’s understanding of grace on the ‘irrational’ side of his own antithesis. That is, Paul and Philo do not locate grace, worth and divine and human agency on the same spectrum, and their different emphases on agency have to be understood in relation to their understandings of grace. The God of one is not <italic>more gracious</italic> than the God of the other: Paul’s God is gracious <italic>differently</italic> from Philo’s God. For Philo and Paul, Abraham confirms their understandings of grace, while their understandings of grace also shape their readings of Abraham.</p>
<p>Thus, turning to Paul, the question ‘What did Abraham find?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0142064X12462658">61</xref></sup> might lead us to expect more focus on Abraham’s agency, but such is immediately ruled out by Paul’s statements on works, which have the effect of placing the stress on the God who justifies the ungodly as acting subject. To quote Moxnes: ‘The effect when this predication is added unto the antithesis between “work” and “faith”, is that Paul put the emphasis not on “faith” <italic>per se</italic>, but rather on <italic>God</italic>, in whom one believes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142064X12462658">1980</xref>: 110). Abraham as an unfitting recipient does nothing to warrant the gift. Genesis 15.6 is the hermeneutical key for Paul’s reading of Abraham’s story, and the one act of Abraham that Paul ever emphasizes is Abraham’s faith. As 4.4-5 shows, nothing Abraham does beyond believing affects his being reckoned righteous. Verse 4 begins to explain the quotation of Gen. 15.6 by explicating the use of λογίζομαι with other standard economic terms to argue that the wages appropriate to the action are paid to the person who works; they are not given as a gift.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0142064X12462658">62</xref></sup> Jewett states, ‘If a person has performed work, appropriate remuneration was an absolutely binding obligation that was not only universally accepted but also reinforced by law throughout the Greco-Roman world’ (2006: 313). In v. 5, however, Paul speaks not only of the ‘the one who does not work’ but also of ‘the one who believes’ (ὁ πιστεύων), thus merging the antithesis of the economic domain with the theological. Accordingly, Paul argues in 4.4-5 not that Abraham simply did not work, but that Abraham did not work yet believed, where the implied logic is that as Abraham did not work, faith is not reckoned κατὰ ὀφείλημα but κατὰ χάριν.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0142064X12462658">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no human work for Paul that corresponds to the divine work of justification. Abraham does not work (ἐργαζόμενος); Abraham does not emerge from ungodliness in any way but is justified precisely as one who <italic>is</italic> ungodly. That is, for Paul, faith itself is an act that points to God as subject,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0142064X12462658">64</xref></sup> where faith does not correspond with righteousness but is directed at a subject who reckons righteousness to the ungodly object by faith as an unfitting gift.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0142064X12462658">65</xref></sup> Faith is <italic>trust</italic> in God’s promise. Thus, Abraham’s justification is tied to God’s act of creating anew in the resurrection of Jesus (4.25), which was ‘for our justification’ (διὰ τὴν δικαίωσιν ἡμῶν), as Abraham’s faith is not simply in God but in <italic>God’s promise</italic> that Abraham would be the ‘father of many nations’, which is fulfilled in Christ and foreshadowed in the birth of Isaac from the deadness of Abraham and Sarah (4.17-20). One can then argue that Abraham’s move from godless to righteous is the result of a divine <italic>creative</italic> act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0142064X12462658">66</xref></sup> As Gathercole puts it, ‘God’s declaration of Abraham as righteous was not a descriptive word but the creative word of the God who calls “nonentities” into being as “entities”’ (2002: 243).</p>
<p>Thus, in their readings of Gen. 15.6, Philo’s Abraham would rightly be called righteous and his reward is fitting, while Paul’s reading shows a lack of correspondence between the ungodly object of justification and God’s justifying act such that God’s gift is incongruous with the recipient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142064X12462658">
<title>Abraham’s Faith and Abraham’s Inclusive Family</title>
<p>Second, for both, Abraham’s faith results in creating an ‘inclusive’ family. For Paul, Abraham had faith and was reckoned righteous while uncircumcised, and only then circumcision came as a seal of the righteousness reckoned to him in his uncircumcised state (σφραγῖδα τῆς δικαιοσύνης τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐν τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ). The purpose was that Abraham might be ‘father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness might be reckoned to them, and the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham while he was uncircumcised’ (4.11-12). Faith and therefore the forgiveness of sins came before circumcision; thus, circumcised and uncircumcised alike can believe and be forgiven.</p>
<p>But why does this faith exist? Faith exists because of God’s word of promise, as the promise both evokes and directs towards what God will do and who God is—which means that God is understood inseparably from the Christ-event in Rom. 4: Paul is ‘exclusively concerned with God <italic>ad extra</italic>, with God as he is to be believed in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X12462658">Gathercole 2004</xref>: 165). Thus, Abraham’s faith is in the God who ‘gives life to the dead and calls those who do not exist into existence’ (4.17)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0142064X12462658">67</xref></sup>—undoubtedly acknowledging, for Paul, that God is defined as the one who has acted in Christ, and Abraham’s faith is thus directed towards the God who fulfills his promise in Jesus’ being handed over for transgressions and raised for justification (4.24-25),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0142064X12462658">68</xref></sup> with the raising of Jesus, itself an act of creation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0142064X12462658">69</xref></sup> being prefigured by the act of creation that happens in the deadness of the aged Abraham and Sarah (4.19). The promise is by the righteousness of faith (διὰ δικαιοσύνης πίστεως), not the law, so that Abraham might be heir of the world, not of one ethnic group (4.13). Accordingly, Abraham’s belief is not recorded in scripture for his sake alone, as Paul says, but for Paul’s present readers as well, ‘to those who are going to be reckoned, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead’ (4.24). The Christ-event is the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that constitutes the family of Abraham as both Jew and Gentile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0142064X12462658">70</xref></sup> There is no distinction between Jew and Gentile in being sinful (3.22-23), and as a result of the Christ event—the manifestation of God’s righteousness—righteousness by faith in the God of the promise equally embraces Jew and Gentile (3.29-30). As Watson states, ‘Abraham, then, is a model for the <italic>convert</italic>, the one who has passed from ungodliness to righteousness by a transforming event whose divine side is the forgiveness of all past sins and whose human side is simply faith in the God who acts in this way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X12462658">2007</xref>: 265).</p>
<p>Consequently, as with Philo, Paul’s understanding of those who belong to or follow Abraham is in some sense universalized. For Paul, what comes from faith is the forgiveness of sins, because this faith is directed at the promise given by the God who gave Jesus Christ for sin and raised him for justification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0142064X12462658">71</xref></sup> The righteousness reckoned because of faith precedes circumcision with the result that Abraham can then be father of all who believe, with righteousness being reckoned to each who follows Abraham’s footsteps by believing in the promise. As Schliesser puts it, ‘The continuity between Abraham and the present believers is constituted and conserved by God himself, for he is and remains one and the same, the one God, who justifies the ungodly, who creates and gives life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X12462658">2007</xref>: 405). Faith is not simply universal, as if it were a virtue that defined a person in itself, but faith’s object is a God who fulfills a promise given to Abraham without ethnic qualification by an act with universal consequences (4.11-12, 23-25; cf. 3.30). And this event has universal consequences precisely as a gift given irrespective of all worth, status and even ethnicity. No one is righteous, no one is worthy, all are ungodly, yet the gift is given specifically to those who do not deserve it. In Philo’s interpretation, faith as virtue makes those who follow Abraham a universal group by nature of the fact that virtue is bound to no particular group of people but is a possibility for all of humanity. Faith as virtue defines the person as virtuous and sets the person in right relation to God. Thus, the logic of how the promise to Abraham is ‘universalized’ is different for each. For Philo, virtue is a potential achievement for all humans, such that the promise is open to any person who chooses to live virtuously; for Paul, the Christ-event is <italic>the</italic> unfitting gift given to Jews and Gentiles without qualifications, such that any may receive the gift.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0142064X12462658">
<title>Reading Genesis 15.6 in its Context</title>
<p>Third and finally, as faith is defined differently by Philo and Paul, both have different hermeneutical priorities as they interpret Gen. 15.6 in its narrative context. Philo prizes Gen. 15.6 as the culmination of Abraham’s story; it was important to tell what happened <italic>before</italic> Gen. 15.6 because Abraham’s story was the content of his faith declared in Gen. 15.6. Denunciation of Chaldean error and departure from his homeland allowed for a true conception and knowledge of the ‘one highest Cause who cares for the world and the things in the world’ (216), that is, faith. It is unsurprising then that nothing later than Gen. 15.6 is interpreted or cited in the passage in <italic>De Virtutibus</italic>. Genesis 15.6 <italic>is</italic> Abraham’s achievement that makes him worthy before God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0142064X12462658">72</xref></sup> Paul prizes it, however, as the hermeneutical key by which Abraham’s story is understood. For Paul, this has the effect of making Abraham’s backstory essentially moot for his argument in Rom. 4, as it would not fit with his argument. The reward (μισθός) of which God speaks in Gen. 15.1 appears in the Pauline context between the works–faith disjunction, such that since the μισθός was given because of Abraham’s faith and as a gift, it was not then given because of anything he had done or could do. The fact that ‘Abraham believed God and it was reckoned’ rules out the possibility that anything in Abraham’s life before the giving of the promise provided grounds for the reckoning, because the point is that Abraham was an unfitting, ungodly recipient of God’s justification. Genesis 15.6 is thus read as being about a forward-looking faith in a future promise, not the culmination of anything in Abraham’s backstory. This discrepancy is not incidental. To imagine Philo and Paul reading the Genesis text together, it is easy to envision Philo pointing to God’s telling Abraham, ‘Go … and I will make of you’ (12.1-2), and Paul pointing to God’s later declaration, ‘I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess’ (15.7). Both readings have hermeneutical merit in the text, but, as is clear, both see Gen. 15.6 relating to its context differently, which affects the content of their interpretation. Philo’s reading runs from Gen. 12.1 to its zenith in Gen. 15.6 because it focuses on Abraham’s progress, because being a proselyte means of necessity doing what Abraham did before Gen. 15.6. Oppositely, Paul’s reading takes Gen. 15.6 in connection with the promise of Gen. 17.5, which finds meaning in the birth of Isaac read through and pointing to the death and resurrection of Jesus, the event by which Abraham’s family is ultimately established—by faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0142064X12462658">73</xref></sup> Using the previous content of Abraham’s story to define his faith would be at cross-purposes with Paul’s argument, while for Philo it is essential.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0142064X12462658">
<title>Abraham in Philo and Paul: Conclusion</title>
<p>Abraham plays a roughly analogous role for both Philo and Paul, at least formally: he is the one who, by believing in God, broke free from a solely godless life and thus became the first or father of all who follow in his way. But each has a different hermeneutic by which they interpret the figure of Abraham. For Philo, virtue is the key that creates a proper relationship with God and makes one worthy to receive gifts from God. Because of this understanding, Philo reads the Genesis text as he does, focusing on Abraham’s past life, which culminates in his faith in Gen. 15.6. The promise, then, is a universally realizable possibility because all humans are capable of virtue. For Paul, the Christ-event is God’s act by which humans are made right, are justified, before God. And Abraham’s faith in God is interpreted through Paul’s understanding of God’s act in Christ. The Christ-event is thus the hermeneutical lens through which history is read, with Paul’s argument demonstrating that the God who gave a promise to Abraham is the God who has fulfilled the promise in Christ, such that hermeneutical priority is then set on what follows Gen. 15.6—how those who believe in the same promise become part of Abraham’s family. God gives to the ungodly and undeserving: Abraham was unworthy of justification, and the Christ-event is God’s gift given to those who are unfitting recipients, regardless of all worth, status and ethnicity. The gift is for Jews and Gentiles. Both Philo and Paul would likely have been able to make sense of the other’s understanding of Abraham, but both moved and thought in very different worlds, and would probably have viewed the other as making haphazard use of this great figure of their common heritage.</p>

<p>Gen. 15.6 is also important in Gal. 3, of course, but is employed for slightly different purposes and without having the same central importance for the passage as it does in Rom. 4. Gen. 15.6 bookends the argument of Rom. 4 (4.3, 23), with the entire passage explicating Abraham’s faith vis-à-vis works (4.4-8), Abraham’s status as uncircumcised and thus his fatherhood of all believers (4.9-13, 16-17), and the nature of the promise and Abraham’s trust in it (4.13-25). While nevertheless being important in Gal. 3, Gen. 15.6 <italic>begins</italic> an argument for the priority of the promise to Abraham over the Mosaic Law, where other important texts (e.g. Gen. 12.3; Hab. 2.4; Lev. 18.5) play just as essential a role as does Gen. 15.6.

<p>Besides the common tradition that designated Abraham as a Chaldean astronomer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X12462658">Knox (1935</xref>: 57) points out that astronomy as an explanation of the universe in the first century <sc>ce</sc> was in vogue since it could be traced back to the oldest religions of antiquity. Hence, as Knox notes, placing Abraham so close to such a popular religious option, only to have him abandon it for a better one, would be a huge point for Judaism. On Knox’s argument that antiquity itself was ‘one of the main grounds on which a cult could claim superiority to others’, see particularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X12462658">Boys-Stones 2001</xref>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Philo often aligns human piety and impiety directly with the person’s view of God as Cause (or not). Cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X12462658">Barclay 2008</xref>: 142: ‘God’s gracious causation of all that exists is of critical importance for Philo in distinguishing his philosophy from impious alternatives, and in motivating the central core of piety, gratitude to God’.

<p>Perhaps most importantly, the purpose of Abraham in Paul’s argument in Rom. 4 is a highly debated topic. The traditional explanation is that Abraham is an example of one who is justified by faith, while more recent interpreters—influenced especially by the New Perspective—argue that Abraham functions to show the inclusiveness of God’s family, now constituted by Jews <italic>and</italic> Gentiles (for this latter reading, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X12462658">Cranford 1995</xref>.)

My argument will seek to embrace both of these positions but will also argue that the issue is based on a false dichotomy. Rather, Paul’s emphasis in Rom. 4 is about Abraham’s faith <italic>in the promise</italic> fulfilled in the Christ-event, by which an ungodly Abraham is justified and an ‘inclusive’ family created, which can only be accomplished because of the fact that the Christ-event is an unfitting gift.</p>

<p>Philo can say similar things of God in his writings, though it is almost always limited to the act of the creation of the world or universe. For example, the creation of the world demonstrates that God is one who brings order to disorder, for God ‘called the things not existing into being’ (τὰ γὰρ μὴ ὄντα ἐκάλεσεν εἰς τὸ εἶναι, <italic>Spec</italic>. 4.187); similarly, God is the only true God and Creator because he ‘brought the things not existing into being’ (ἐπειδὴ τὰ μὴ ὄντα ἤγαγεν εἰς τὸ εἶναι, <italic>Mos</italic>. 2.100). Cf. also <italic>Mos</italic>. 2.267; <italic>Somn</italic>. 1.76; <italic>Migr</italic>. 183. Somewhat closer to the Pauline formulation—at least in its parallelism—is <italic>Her</italic>. 36 in which Philo calls God, ‘the one who bears the things which do not exist and gives birth to all things’ (ὁ τὰ μὴ ὄντα φέρων καὶ τὰ πάντα γεννῶν). In an interesting passage about God’s rewarding the virtuous, Philo says God would give spontaneously ‘from what is ready’ (ἐξ ἑτοίμου), for ‘it is clear’ (δῆλον γάρ) that it is easier to supply in abundance from the produce that exists (τὸ τὴν ἐκ τῶν ὄντων φοράν) rather than creating what does not exist (τὰ μὴ ὄντα εἰς τὸ εἶναι παραγαγεῖν, <italic>Opif</italic>. 81). For a list of other Jewish parallels to this passage, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142064X12462658">Hofius 1971</xref>.</p>

The question, however, is not whether Paul is using a Jewish framework or stock phrases, but how they function in reading the story of Abraham’s justification vis-à-vis the Christ-event in the terms of calling ‘those who do not exist into existence’. Cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142064X12462658">Moxnes 1980</xref>: 269: ‘The full meaning, both of the designation of God in 4:17 and of chapter 4 as a whole, can be grasped only when seen together with Paul’s conclusion in 4:23-25’.</p>
