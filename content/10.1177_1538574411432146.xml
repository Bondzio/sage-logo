<body>
<p>Turnaround time (TAT) for diagnostic tests is accepted as an important measure of the quality of care delivered to patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432146">1</xref></sup> Clinicians judge quality not only by the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tests but by the timeliness as well. Clinical decision support systems improve the clinician’s capacity to make sound and timely decisions. Turnaround time for vascular laboratory (VL) testing starts with the electronic order and ends with final availability of the report to the requesting physician. The wait time (WT) between the order and performance of the test and the physician interpretation interval (PII) are both significant links in the chain of events that leads to the referring physician being able to actually access the final report.</p>
<p>Although the Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) standard addresses the general timing of the final physician interpretation, most VL’s do not investigate the TAT or audit their WT and PII as part of their quality assurance program.</p>
<p>The object of this report is to focus on the WT for inpatients and outpatients as well as the PII as components of the TAT on weekdays (WD) and weekends/holidays (WE) in order to compare our findings with ICAVL standards and to look for areas of improvement in efficiency as part of our quality assurance customer satisfaction program.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538574411432146">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The database (Vascubase; Consensusmed, Richmond BC, Canada) in our VL was queried for 2 months of 2010 as to the interval between the performance of the test and the time stamp of the vascular surgeon signature as recorded by the software program. The type of test and the PII for weekdays versus weekends/holidays was also noted. The WT for outpatients to be scheduled for their VL test in October 2010 was obtained from the hospital outpatient department. The inpatient WT was calculated using the electronic medical records over a 2-week period for October 2010.</p>
<p>The data were collected as part our quality assurance and process improvement program and no institutional review board approval was required. All statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad InStat Software (La Jolla, California) and Microsoft Excel statistical functions (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574411432146">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The overall WT for all inpatients between electronic order placement and performance of the VL test was 12.48 hours (range 0.1-55.8 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574411432146">Table 1</xref>
). After excluding patients in whom the order was placed over the WE, the mean time during WD dropped to 9.81 hours (range 0.1-37.31; p value not significant).</p>

<p>The first available outpatient time slot for all noninvasive vascular studies was within 24 hours. The mean PII for the sample of 1695 tests in a 2-month period in 2010 was 3.23 hours (range &lt; 1 minute to 70.80 hours; standard deviation [SD]±7.40).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A “customer” is defined as “as anyone who receives the results of our work and makes a value judgment about services provided.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411432146">2</xref></sup> To our customers (clinicians and patients), “quality” is the ability of our VL’s to provide satisfactory service that satisfies their needs and expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432146">3</xref></sup> For clinicians, TAT is a very important factor in judging the performance and quality of any service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432146">3</xref></sup> The physicians requesting the tests are judging our accuracy, availability, cost, relevance, and timeliness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432146">4</xref></sup> The commonest complaint (80%) about clinical laboratories is about TAT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432146">5</xref></sup> From a patient perspective, quicker TAT is a transparent marker of efficiency and may also increase patient self-management behavior. Yet, there are few if any reports related to TAT or PII in VL’s. In reviewing the TAT as described in clinical laboratories and radiology, the factors we can control relevant to a VL are accuracy, availability, relevance, and timeliness. The accuracy of VL tests is part of ICAVL accreditation, which requires correlation of tests with a “gold standard.” Our current report deals with only a part, albeit an important part of the process, which is the timeliness.</p>
<p>It is recognized that there is a wide variation in TAT in different departments often at the same institution. The radiology industry, in a joint task force studying common document types TAT, reported variation ranging from almost immediate to 72 hours for transcription alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432146">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Benchmarking is the process of comparing an institutional performance measure against best practices within the same industry or a similar industry. In this case, since similar data as a benchmark in the VL industry are not readily available; one must look at similar industries such as clinical laboratories or radiological procedures. In a study of timeliness of early morning routine laboratory tests in 653 institutions, results were reported much earlier in teaching hospitals, smaller and more computerized laboratories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411432146">7</xref></sup> In a comprehensive review of TAT in clinical laboratories, a 90% completion time (sample registration to result reporting) of &lt;60 minutes for common laboratory tests was suggested as an initial goal for TAT. Nuclear cardiology reporting timeline guidelines suggest 1 business day for completed interpretation and 2 business days for final report transmittal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411432146">8</xref></sup> A report from Mount Sinai indicated an improvement in TAT of radiologists reading ultrasound tests from a median of 13.5 to 10.8 hours, an 25% improvement, following process improvement measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411432146">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>While there is literature reviewing the PII for clinical laboratory testing, there is hardly any meaningful discussion about the PII related to the VL. The ICAVL standard for Examination Interpretation and Reports 4.1.1.7 states “The interpretation by the Medical Director or a member of the medical staff must be available within two (2) working days of the examination” except when additional clinical information is needed for accurate interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411432146">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our VL adopted the traditional steps associated with a proper continuous quality improvement program. The Shewart or PDSA cycle (planning, doing, studying, and acting) was utilized by collecting data, identifying problems, making changes, and then acting by refining the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432146">11</xref></sup> Each step in the chain from the order entry to the electronic report getting in the hands of the referring physician has to be broken down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574411432146">Figure 3</xref>
). Prioritization of the type of test, the type of patient, or a protocol of reporting critical test results is all part of process improvement. Improving TAT therefore means reviewing each step from the time the test request is made to the time the final report is available to the clinician. The VL must have a strategy in place to dissect each link in the chain and address efficiency in the entire process which starts with the electronic order software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574411432146">Figure 3</xref>). With computerized provider order entry (CPOE), the request for the test is instantly routed to the scheduling personnel to review and put on the work list depending on the delay to availability of a time slot. The first available scheduling time slot in most instances is the chief reason for the delay in test completion. We have regularly monitored the timeliness of scheduling outpatient tests for instance. Our VL has markedly improved the first available time for an outpatient VL test from about 3 weeks in 2004 to an average of 1 to 2 days despite a yearly increase in volume. On the inpatient side, the interval between a CPOE and test performance is a mean of 9.81 hours on weekdays with a median of 5.2 hours. This has been accomplished by refining the process of reserving time slots for elective outpatient tests versus inpatients, extending regular work hours by staggering sonographer working hours, triaging tests by sonographers, prioritizing certain inpatient tests, assigning a sonographer to perform multiple portable tests during a single trip, and having variable staffing on the busiest weekdays (primarily Monday’s) to deal with add-on requests.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our report indicates an overall PII of 3.23 hours for weekdays and weekends with a significant difference between WD and WE (mean 2.30 vs 16.59 hours, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In addition, 99% of WD tests were read within 24 hours compared to 76.5% on WE (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). It appears that although the PII is reasonable for both WD and WE, there is room for improvement in the latter category.</p>
<p>A shorter TAT may or may not directly lead to shorter length of stay or cost savings but clinicians are under increasing pressure to deliver test results to patients expeditiously so that their families can make decisions quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411432146">7</xref></sup> In addition to physician and patient unhappiness, a long TAT often leads physician’s or their offices to respond with duplicate or unnecessary stat orders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411432146">12</xref></sup> There is also a disconnect between how clinicians and laboratory staff perceive TAT. Clinicians are concerned whether the time between ordering a test and final interpretation is prolonged, whereas the laboratory may be more focused on the interval between the time they received a request for the test and final test results.</p>
<p>Certainly, one of the main factors in reducing the PII is the rapid progress in electronic reporting, sophisticated software, and the ability of physicians to read from remote locations. The Vascular Division responsible for interpretation of all VL tests has remote desktop access from our offices as well as our homes using “secureID” and Citrix Access Gateway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411432146">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411432146">14</xref></sup> This allows rapid interpretation especially during after-hours or for urgent interpretation. The adoption of IPAD’s and personal digital assistants in conjunction with electronic health records are likely to enable physicians to interpret VL tests without being restricted to a desktop computer. The newer “tablets” process graphics at a faster rate with A5 dual-core processors and over 350 000 applications, which should accelerate access to medical images. The Federal Drug Authority also recently cleared (510k clearance or premarket notification) software, called Mobile MIM, which allows physicians to view medical images generated by ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411432146">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are circumstances where intervention is based entirely on the results of test interpretation such as peripherally inserted central catheter tip location, anticoagulation for acute deep venous thrombosis, a critical carotid lesion or placement of a vena caval filter. In these instances, delay in providing results to the treating physician could potentially have adverse consequences for patient care. Fortunately, most VL’s have a policy for reporting “critical” results expediently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411432146">16</xref></sup> Newer electronic technology should allow physician interpretation within minutes. Urgent physician interpretation for a critical test result requiring emergency intervention is communicated to the office receptionist who reaches out via phone or email to division faculty asking for a response.</p>
<p>Besides the demand for urgent interpretations, nonemergent test result availability in a timely manner is related to the quality of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432146">1</xref></sup> Computerized provider order entry integrated with other health care information technology applications has been shown to significantly decrease TAT in medication time and intensive care units, for instance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411432146">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411432146">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Referring physicians in our institution are able to obtain VL tests for their outpatients and inpatients in a timely manner. Our data also show a reasonable PII for tests performed on WD. There is room for improvement in the PII for VL tests performed on WE. With more emphasis on TAT as a measure of quality of care and customer satisfaction it is likely that ICAVL will require regular audit’s by accredited VL’s just as it does for accuracy.</p>
