<sec id="sec1-1471301211430647" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Until the later stages of a dementia disorder, the majority of people with dementia in the Scandinavian countries in general live in their own homes with assistance from family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430647">Edhag &amp; Norlund, 2006</xref>). Persons diagnosed with dementia disorders before the age of 65 are often referred to as ‘people with early-onset dementia’ or ‘persons with EOD’, the abbreviation used in this text. A review study of the literature on this subject has shown that persons with EOD need services and support during the whole course of the disease to reduce the suffering of the person with EOD and to lighten the family carers’ burden (Harris &amp; Keady, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211430647">Roach, Keady, Bee &amp; Hope, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430647">Skovdal et al., 2007</xref>). Both persons with EOD and their carers often have financial worries due to taking early retirement. In some cases, the persons affected by the disease will still have dependent children and family conflicts are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211430647">Luscombe, Brodaty &amp; Freeth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430647">Skovdal et al., 2007</xref>). As a consequence of these problems and the demands of everyday life, many of these families feel isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211430647">Brodaty &amp; Donkin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Persons with EOD are usually diagnosed in the later stages of the disease, and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in this group are more frequent than in the elderly population with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211430647">Harvey, Skelton-Robinson &amp; Rossor, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211430647">Koedam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211430647">Luscombe et al., 1998</xref>). These symptoms are closely associated with the burden of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211430647">Mittelman, Haley, Clay &amp; Roth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211430647">Riedijk et al., 2006</xref>). Other studies have shown that, compared to the carers of those with Alzheimer’s disease, carers of persons with EOD are generally more weighed down with care, and carers of early onset fronto-temporal dementia report less satisfaction with the available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211430647">Freyne, Kidd, Coen &amp; Lawlor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211430647">Riedijk et al., 2006</xref>). One reason for this may be that the main theme of recommendations for the provision of existing health care services has usually not been established to meet the needs of individuals but based on categories of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie, Daker-White, Gilliard &amp; Means, 2002</xref>). Psychosocial interventions for carers have been considered a promising approach as a means of reducing the burden on the carers of dementia sufferers in general. Recent studies have shown that persons with dementia should also be provided with psychosocial support with their own groups, and also families of persons with EOD should have their own groups. However, only limited research has been done into their experiences and the provision of guidelines for such groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211430647">Brodaty &amp; Donkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211430647">Droes, Meiland, Lange, Myrra &amp; Tilburg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211430647">Parker, Mills &amp; Abbey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>No prevalence study has been carried out in Norway but it has been estimated, based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211430647">Harvey et al. (2003)</xref>, that up to 1400 Norwegian citizens suffer from EOD. Following the recommendations of the Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs, they are usually examined within the specialist health care services, mainly at memory clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211430647">HOD, 2007</xref>). This is in line with recommendations from a review study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211430647">Roach et al. (2008)</xref>. According to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie et al. (2002)</xref>, persons with EOD and their families often fall through the net of services provided, as services for persons with dementia are in general set up to meet the needs of the elderly. Clearly, there is a need for better collaboration to increase the competence and experience of medical staff, so that they may detect and diagnose EOD at an early stage, as well as contribute to the development of an adequate range of services for persons with EOD. This is also important as the currently available drug treatment seems to have little effect on BPSD in persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211430647">Birks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430647">Courtney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211430647">Selbæk, Kirkevold &amp; Engedal, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies also show that those few services that have been established for persons with EOD are based on health personnel’s subjective thoughts about what persons with EOD need and are not necessarily in accordance with the subjective needs of persons with EOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie et al., 2002</xref>). It has also been documented in other studies that persons with dementia can express their various perceived needs as well as express what living with dementia is like; something that is also described through paintings and poetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211430647">Hunderi &amp; Hunderi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211430647">Roach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211430647">Willis, Chan, Murray, Matthews &amp; Banerjee, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to carry out this research to contribute to the development of services for persons with EOD, based on having discerned what their needs truly are and thus what services are most beneficial. This has been requested in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie et al. (2002)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211430647">Willis et al. (2009)</xref>, and also in more recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211430647">Baalen van, Vingerhoets, Sixma &amp; Lange de, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430647">Rose, Fang, Palmer, Richeson &amp; Burgener, 2010</xref>). Only a small number of studies of the direct experience of persons suffering from EOD exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211430647"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to find out how people experience living with early-onset dementia, and to assess the implications for practice and the development of further services for these sufferers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211430647" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and method</title>
<p>‘Grounded theory’ has been applied in this study. Classical grounded theory, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211430647">Glaser and Strauss (1967)</xref>, stresses that a theory emerges from the empirical data during the analysis of the basic processes. A constructivist direction of this method has also been established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211430647">Charmaz (2000)</xref>, who saw the studied phenomena as constructions, interaction between the collected data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin and Strauss (2008)</xref> reformulated grounded theory and this reformulated method (see ‘Analysis’ section) is particularly suitable for the study of people’s lives through processes and social interactions, making it appropriate as the chosen method for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). This approach is likely to provide new knowledge about how people with dementia perceive their lives.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211430647" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Four Norwegian Old Age Psychiatric hospitals/memory clinics in the south of Norway were contacted and asked to recruit participants for this study. The hospitals were chosen for practical reasons, such as the pressure of time and the cost of data collection. A number of health personnel from these hospitals recruited persons with EOD to participate in this study. They performed this task on the telephone or when the informants had a follow-up appointment at one of their hospitals. A total of 20 informants were interviewed (54–67 years, with a median age of 62 years), of whom one was working part-time, eight were female, and 15 were married or lived together with another person in a cohabiting relationship. Three of the informants had other serious diagnoses. The informants were interviewed during 2010–2011. Two of the persons who were asked to participate declined. All the informants brought different experiences of living with dementia to the interviews. The informants’ diagnosis had been made from four months to three years prior to the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211430647"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>The data were collected through qualitative interviews using a guide that comprised thematic questions focusing on the informants’ experiences of living with dementia. Depending on answers and reflections, new ideas by the informants raised further probing questions and were asked in order to obtain additional information. The interviews were carried out in a conversation-based form by one of the authors (AJ), lasted for up to one and a half hours, and were tape-recorded. All the interviews were carried out in the informants’ homes, which the informants chose to do, according to their preferences for time and date. A professional writer transcribed the complete recorded interviews verbatim within a week of each interview. One of the authors (AJ) performed a quality control check on the transcripts by listening to the tapes while reading the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211430647"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>The transcribed interviews were analysed by both authors in line with the reformulated grounded theory method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>), as follows. The transcribed verbatim interview protocols were subjected to three types of coding processes: open, axial and selective coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). In the open process the data were examined sentence by sentence and coded; the codes with similar content were then grouped together into concepts at a higher, more abstract level. As the interviews progressed, the comparison techniques allowed categories to be constructed. A process of axial coding occurred at this point, whereby the identification of links and dimensions developed each category systematically. Upon further data collection, additional categories and subcategories were subsequently explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>). In this process, the content of each category was completed when the data were saturated and two core categories had been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430647">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211430647"><title>Ethics</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Ethics in Medical Research, Southern Norway. The informants received oral and written information and gave written consent before they were included in this study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211430647"><title>Findings</title>
<p>From the body of the interviews two main categories emerged: (1) the process <italic>towards a dementia diagnosis;</italic> and (2) <italic>fighting for dignity</italic> after being diagnosed with dementia. The two main categories describe the persons with dementia’s experiences of the process <italic>towards a dementia diagnosis</italic> and their experiences of <italic>fighting for dignity</italic> in everyday life when living with dementia, knowing that they will reach a point with no return after being diagnosed, meaning that they are been aware that there is no recovery.</p>
<p>The core category <italic>towards a dementia diagnosis</italic> covers different experiences of life and has two subcategories describing <italic>changes</italic> and <italic>being diagnosed.</italic></p>
<p>The core category <italic>fighting for dignity</italic> describes the challenges in everyday life and how the informants try to maintain their own quality of life after having been diagnosed. It covers two subcategories describing the informants’ <italic>intrapsychic challenges</italic> and <italic>social challenges</italic>. Each of the categories will be described and illustrated below with excerpts from the interviews. The categories form a model of knowledge telling us what dementia means for the informants in everyday life. Most of the informants expressed great satisfaction with being given the opportunity to talk about their situation and their own experiences of dementia.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211430647"><title>Towards a dementia diagnosis</title>
<p>The subcategories of this core category describe the informants’ experiences of the <italic>changes</italic> they went through, the early symptoms of dementia and the subsequent consequences for everyday life. These experiences were viewed in parallel with the informants’ feelings about the process of <italic>being diagnosed</italic> and their encounters with the relevant health personnel.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211430647"><title>Changes</title>
<p>In this subcategory the informants described how they could not understand why their memory was failing them and why they were unable to find things. They expressed a feeling that something had to be wrong, as they had not had these problems previously in life. Some informants realised that everything had just come to a halt at work or that everything had started going wrong, and that they had subsequently been put on sick leave. Others discovered that something was wrong when they failed to cope with new tasks, changed jobs or were unable to face new challenges at work. A majority of the informants described early symptoms similar to those expressed by an informant<disp-quote>
<p>I have always been a person who could remember things. Suddenly I became aware that I did not remember this and that, and that I could not find things either. There were a lot of such instances, and memory loss is the symptom that troubles me the most. [Informant Number 8]</p></disp-quote>Informants described having received some assistance from people in their surroundings, but some felt they had been subjected to violations of their rights in the workplace as they were assigned to different work tasks from those which they had been doing, without being given any explanation. Some mentioned that they now thought that colleagues and close family members had discovered early on that there was something wrong, but that they themselves had not noticed anything at that time. Others could not remember the first symptoms. During these initial months when the symptoms were developing, informants described the consequences that followed. They were not able to cope with their work tasks and eventually took early retirement. Only one person had been assigned new work tasks, just one day a week. The informants stated that it was a relief not to have to go to work any more, but they also perceived the loss of a job as sad, because it meant an end to their working life, loss of colleagues as well as part of their social network. Furthermore, they stated that it was difficult to maintain contact with friends as becoming ill meant being left out of regular social life.</p>
<p>These early intimations of a disorder are well described by the following extract from an informant’s transcript.<disp-quote>
<p>It started when I was doing a lot of things wrong at work – I also felt that something was wrong. My colleagues at work experienced it too, as they told me that it seemed as if I was struggling and they asked me if I was tired. I felt tired also. [Number 20]</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211430647"><title>Being diagnosed</title>
<p>In this subcategory all the informants, in one form or another, described the process of receiving a diagnosis of dementia and their feelings in relation to this event. Many informants described how it could sometimes be difficult to get health professionals to understand what was wrong. Furthermore, they initially received a number of other diagnoses, such as being ‘burnt out’ or depressed. Some informants were not being believed and for several of them it was their spouses who pushed them to find out what was going on. Other informants stated that they had met health professionals who understood what was wrong, and further examinations were initiated at the nearest hospital. Going through all the tests gave some of them a sense of feeling stupid, and not all of them had understood that they had scored low on the tests. They also described how they generally met with kindness and care from health personnel in these situations; this was not always the case, however, as some felt they were not being listened to or treated with respect.</p>
<p>Getting the diagnosis and knowing that there could be no recovery was tough for everyone. For many it came as no surprise, but for some it came as a shock. Some said that they felt like ‘a second-class citizen’, that they were being branded or that it was like feeling a noose around one’s neck. As one informant said,<disp-quote>
<p>It was a shock and it scared me, because I know what is to come and it is quite terrible that I will suddenly turn out to be, ugly as it sounds, ‘a second-class citizen’. [Number 4]</p></disp-quote>Most informants stated that they had had a very difficult time after being diagnosed, and also that they had been in need of assistance during this initial period after receiving the diagnosis – something very few had received at this point. One informant had received advice and consolation from a professional friend shortly after receiving the diagnosis, and described how helpful it had been.<disp-quote>
<p>I had been a little bit prepared, though. It was not a big surprise, but it was still hard to be confronted with it, and what was very fortunate was that a friend helped me a lot that day and took away some of my self-pity. Now I feel that though the situation is as it is, my life is as good as I believe it can be. [Number 14]</p></disp-quote>Some of the informants had other serious diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. These other diseases had already had a major impact on their everyday life and especially would have an impact on their future life, and thus these informants were able to handle receiving a dementia diagnosis a little better, because they thought they might not live that long anyway, so the dementia would not have any impact on their life. Some were even not quite sure whether they indeed had been given a dementia diagnosis. The informants said they had been advised by health professionals to continue to live an active and normal life – advice they were trying to follow.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211430647"><title>Fighting for dignity</title>
<p>The core category <italic>fighting for dignity</italic> covered the two subcategories <italic>intrapsychic challenges</italic> and <italic>social challenges</italic> and describes the informants’ experiences of the process of being diagnosed with dementia, and their experiences of living with the disorder knowing that there can be no recovery, along with the informants’ experiences of society’s and other people’s attitudes towards the disorder and what this means for the informants.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211430647"><title>Intrapsychic challenges</title>
<p>In this subcategory many informants describe the difficulties they experienced of developing dementia at their relatively young age. The informants perceived dementia as a stigmatizing disease that affected their self-image, and they found it embarrassing to have dementia. The informants also stated that they felt themselves to be a burden on society after receiving the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Not going to work any more was a big transition for the informants, yet for many of them it was perceived as a relief not to have to work as much as before. The informants stated that they had continued to enjoy working with various things in the home, but they were avoiding stress and highlighted that it was also important to focus on one thing at a time and described their belief that stress affects coping. One of the informants still had a job after having been diagnosed with dementia; the job had been adapted so that the person could carry it out one day a week. The job was of great importance to the individual, despite the fact that the work was not at the person’s previous level of competence and skill. Other informants said they were still visiting their previous workplaces and frequently talked to their old colleagues and the colleagues were providing security by reminding the informants of their affiliation.</p>
<p>The informants described the memory loss and communication difficulties they were experiencing and many also stated that medication had been helpful and that they did not feel that the disease had progressed. Some of the informants said that they were more irritated at an early stage in the course of the disease and that this behaviour was related to a feeling of reduced capacity. Much time had been spent searching for various things. In some cases the informants could only remember fragments of a great holiday or birthdays of grandchildren, and also they stated that it was primarily their short-term memory that had failed. The informants had constructed systems to record appointments and other things that were important to the present day. Several described how they were preparing to cope by purchasing a simpler bicycle with fewer gears that was easier to manage, along with a GPS device so as not to get lost, which they had previously done and found quite frightening. Furthermore, the informants described a loss of their sense of initiative and the feeling that everything they should do was moving a little bit more slowly than before. The informants also felt more tired, troubled and, at times, restless. Some of them were experiencing anxiety and said that medication had sometimes helped. The informants expressed a feeling of being ‘outside themselves’, a feeling that could last for days or weeks. In one case, this person had lost his appetite. The informants said their brain had just stopped and they were sometimes unable to think of what to say or do. However, they also described how they had coped with these symptoms, and how they had related to this in everyday life by using time as an aid, because in time the problem would go away by itself. Other informants felt stupid when they could not remember what they were doing or what they were about to say in communication with others, and this had affected their self-image to varying degrees. The informants also described difficulties in socializing with a group of people, as it was difficult to follow conversations and they were afraid of repeating themselves. Suicidal thoughts were not uncommon for some informants during the initial period after diagnosis. Some had also experienced a lower tolerance of alcohol after developing the disease and consequently were cautious about drinking.</p>
<p>Most of the informants had previously known about the disease from newspapers, TV, films and older family members, and so had many presentiments about how life might turn out for them. Many informants wanted to know more about the disease and how long they had left to live, but some wanted to just take one day at a time. They advised us that information about the disease should not be given at the moment when the diagnosis has just been received, because it is too traumatic to deal with at that time. What they wanted to know – after they had digested the news – varied: some informants wanted to know more about possible genetic implications, and some were concerned about the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>The informants said that it took several months to learn to live with the disease and they were coping better now. They said they were planning to go on vacation and expected that new medications might be developed that could help them. The informants said that once they had become reconciled to the situation and realized that there was no cure, they had managed to live quite a good life, even though being ill could sometimes be lonely.<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes, my thoughts just stop, you know. But when I just think a little, then it goes fairly well somehow, I believe, but that is not perhaps what others think [laughter]. [Number 14]</p></disp-quote>The dementia disease had affected the informants’ lives in various ways. The informants said they were losing opportunities for participation in previous activities, because of their memory loss, communication difficulties, lack of initiative and difficulties with public transport on their own. They also had difficulties maintaining old friendships and making new friends. Some also described feelings of guilt as they had become unable to maintain contact with friends. Nevertheless, they said they were trying to keep fit by doing exercises, going for walks and keeping active. They mentioned helping other family members with repairs of different sorts, looking after dogs and sometimes babysitting. The informants also described an everyday life where the days were long and they wished they had something to do and someone to be with who understood their situation. One of them described the situation as,<disp-quote>
<p>When you end up in a situation where you are not able to have a job, you lose your network and friends. You lose your feeling of social cohesion, become a sort of ‘social outcast’, person on the outside of society and you sit there strong and fit in most ways – except for one thing, your memory loss, and this makes other people unsure. Still, I often help family members with practical tasks and they have a need for me and I feel happy when helping others. [Number 4]</p></disp-quote>Informants described how they were participating in seminars, went for trips to the city and had friends as before, but that in general there might have been a little less social interaction and stated their need of assistance in coping with these previous activities. Informants also said that it might have been nice to meet others in similar situations. Everyday life had also changed because they were financially worse off, and quite a few informants had problems related to the settlement of insurance claims.</p>
<p>For anyone who had had a driving licence, it was a great loss when they could not drive any more, or – if they still had a licence – they dreaded the day when they would no longer be able to drive a car. The informants complained that being unable to drive restricted their participation in various activities. Most informants had experienced not being able to drive any more or had felt unsafe to do so, while others had been told that they should not drive any more, poignantly expressed in the extract below.<disp-quote>
<p>I was on my way back home when I found myself driving in the wrong direction on the highway – the police came after me and I managed to avoid the whole thing, and they were very nice to me, but it was a depressing experience. It was the disease, though I was not aware of it at the time. [Number 16]</p></disp-quote>Some informants described their inability to drive their car as well as they did before, but said they continued in a more focused and cautious manner when driving. Some informants were avoiding driving in cities or in areas where there was a lot of traffic. Other informants felt that life would become hopeless if they could no longer drive and some solved the problem by letting their spouse be the one who drove the car.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1471301211430647"><title>Social challenges</title>
<p>In this subcategory, the informants described the taboo they perceived as surrounding the disorder, and how they perceived it as yet more stigmatizing when it strikes in midlife. Therefore, the informants to various degrees described how much they wanted to be open with others about their dementia disease. Some wanted to be open with everyone regardless, but others did not want to talk about the fact that they had dementia until other people reacted to something being wrong. Informants had deferred telling others about the disease, but found it positive when they had been open about their disease for the first time. The informants said it was important for them to come to terms with the situation before they could be open with others.<disp-quote>
<p>Actually, it is not like you give everyone a call … before you know more it is not the time to tell others, but you have no control over what others know about it, and on getting dementia you feel that you have suddenly become a lunatic. [Number 12]</p></disp-quote>In cases where parents were still alive the informants had protected them, but – within the family – openness about the disease was the most common policy. However, what it was like to have dementia was not a topic of conversation between family members.</p>
<p>The informants described the qualities and experiences related to health services that they were receiving or had received. The informants said the whole family, including the children, had received information from the hospital, which had been a positive experience for everyone. The family had been met by friendly people, whose names or occupations they were, however, not always able to remember. Some informants had been receiving help from health care professionals and felt that they were taking their time to talk with the informants. In some cases informants described health professionals as acting a bit sharply with them. The informants also said that health personnel visited them at home every day, that they brought food and medicines, yet the informants were sometimes not able to remember whether they had received a visit or not and thought the visitors they should have written down when they came and why.</p>
<p>Some of the health care services offered worked well and some did not. Informants who had been offered services at a daycare centre described what activities they typically participated in while they were there. They felt happy with this service; one informant even described it as ‘invaluable’. Another said,<disp-quote>
<p>It is very nice for people like me to stay at that daycare centre, no one is there every day. The health personnel there are young, positive and very clever at making us do different things. It is quite amazing what we are doing. We are often out walking and that is good and can be recommended. I am very happy that I have a place there, otherwise I would probably have lain down on the couch again and stayed at home alone all day. [Number 2]</p></disp-quote>To a limited extent, the informants described how they had considered the disease was affecting the family. In some cases, the informants remembered they had previously been quite irritated and thought how that must have affected their spouse, while others thought that their spouse had become accustomed to the situation. Some informants also described how the relationship between them and their spouse had been strengthened and that they felt safe, while others had not had any thoughts about whether their marriage had changed or not after being diagnosed with dementia. Those who were not in a cohabiting relationship had lost their partner and they felt that it was difficult to meet anyone new. Informants who had younger children said that they did not think the dementia disease had significantly affected their children’s lives.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1471301211430647" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main findings of this study reveal what persons with EOD have experienced in the process towards being diagnosed with dementia, knowing that there is no cure after being diagnosed, and how they see themselves fighting to maintain dignity in everyday life. According to earlier studies, these findings can contribute to the development and improvement of health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211430647">Baalen van et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430647">Rose et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211430647">Willis et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the findings of this study show that most of the informants felt that they were managing to cope with everyday life and had reconciled themselves to the situation of living with a dementia disorder some months after being diagnosed, but that many of the informants felt lonely and had lost their sense of social cohesion as a consequence of the disorder. Furthermore, the study shows that these people feel that their needs are not being met properly by health personnel and others. The informants stated that they had had a very difficult time soon after being diagnosed; some had had suicidal thoughts, and many stated that they had been in need of assistance during the initial period after receiving the diagnosis. Very few of them had received any kind of assistance at this point. The findings in this study also show that people with EOD, in spite of their cognitive impairment and memory loss, are able to speak about their experiences of living with dementia, their symptoms and coping strategies. They can describe in their own words, several months after receiving the diagnosis, the services they had received and what it is like to be diagnosed with dementia. Most of them can articulate what their everyday needs are as someone under 65 years old living with a stigmatizing disorder associated with old age.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the informants described the changes they had experienced in connection with living with a dementia diagnosis. For most of them, these meant various sorts of losses, such as not being able to drive any more, having problems that restricted them from participating in various activities and not having the possibility of going to work or being in daily contact with colleagues, which caused great sorrow. Some informants also said that they had lost contact with friends. These were losses they experienced in addition to the fact that they were struggling with cognitive impairment in different ways. The informants’ experiences of their cognitive impairment were in one way or another described as relating to problems of communicating with others because of memory loss and difficulties with conversation. As a consequence, the informants became fragile in terms of keeping in touch with society in the sense of belonging and feeling like they were part of society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211430647">Buber (1923)</xref> illustrates this in his description of human life; he says that being part of society and receiving confirmation of that through social interaction with others in an ‘I and you’ relationship gives meaningfulness in life. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211430647">Blackman and others (2003)</xref> also shows that ease of accessibility to public spaces and the physical environment affects the person with dementia’s functioning in their activities of daily living, and that, therefore, services should provide people with dementia with individual services to help them maintain activities and access public spaces, according to their capacity and cognitive impairment. This reinforces the view that receiving help to reduce stress in the public space is important, because stress influences a person’s ability to cope – just as some informants have said.</p>
<p>Another important consideration in providing for people with EOD is their experiences of being stigmatized because of their disease. Some felt that they were branded in some way after being diagnosed with dementia and this feeling had an influence on their degree of openness about their disease. A feeling of reduced capacity in everyday life made many of the informants feel unsure and less self-confident, causing some informants to avoid situations with which they might not be able to cope.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211430647">Koedam et al. (2008)</xref> also shows that people with EOD have a more aggressive progression of the disease than elderly people with dementia and it is, therefore, important to provide them with services of different kinds at an early stage, as well as the chance of keeping in touch with society, as their cognitive impairment makes them vulnerable. This is something many of the informants confirmed in one way or another. One informant described how being among many other people made it difficult to follow conversations; another problem was the fear of repeating oneself. Also, the findings in this study show that individualized, suitable work tasks adapted for people with EOD were rarely arranged for persons with dementia, and indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430647">Rose et al. (2010)</xref> confirm that EOD often results in early exit from the workforce. Only one person was still working part-time after having received the diagnosis in this study, while a number of informants would have liked to have kept working if the opportunity had existed.</p>
<p>Other services like daycare centres and being together with like-minded people were described as being of great value for some of the informants. They described the activities they typically participated in at the centre and the fun they were having. The informants’ experiences of services differ, but most of them described feelings along these lines combined with how they had been met by health professionals, even though they could not remember names and instances of meeting them. The informants had suggestions for services like an information book for health personnel and others to write in, so that the informants could keep track of both future and past visits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of the informants in this study said they considered that the disease affected their families only to a small extent and informants who have younger children claimed that the dementia disease had not significantly affected their children’s lives. However, this does not agree with the findings of other studies showing that being a child of people with EOD leads to high levels of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211430647">Allen, Oyebode &amp; Allen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211430647">Svaneberg, Stott &amp; Spector, 2010</xref>); and also in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211430647">Vliet van and colleagues (2011)</xref> it was shown that these children were burdened as a consequence of having a parent with dementia. Family conflicts are also frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211430647">Luscombe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430647">Skovdal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211430647">Vliet van et al., 2011</xref>), and as a consequence of these demands, many of these families feel isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211430647">Brodaty &amp; Donkin, 2009</xref>). Studies also confirm that many carers of persons with dementia (in general, rather than EOD only) develop health problems due to their carer obligations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211430647">Ulstein, Wyller &amp; Engedal (2007)</xref>, and other studies also confirm that carers are very burdened and distressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211430647">Brodaty &amp; Donkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211430647">Vugt et al., 2006</xref>). Families of people with EOD have even more difficulties than the family members of the elderly with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211430647">Arai, Matsumoto, Ikeda &amp; Arai, 2007</xref>; Luscombe et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430647">Skovdal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211430647">Svanberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211430647">Vliet van et al., 2010</xref>). Some informants were of the opinion that the disease must have affected their spouse to some degree, while others thought that their spouse had become accustomed to the situation. Some informants described the relationship between themselves and their spouses as having been strengthened and they felt safe, while others now had thoughts about their marriage having changed after receiving the diagnosis. This egocentricity in relation to others’ experiences of the effect of the disease on the relationship probably has to do with their lack of awareness of neurological changes, a problem which has also been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211430647">Allen et al. (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211430647">Vogel, Waldorff and Waldemar (2010)</xref>. This varying degree of loss of awareness as a result of the disease among people with dementia in general was also described by some of the informants in this study. They spoke, too, about their lack of understanding of the test scores and ignorance of their lack of driving competence.</p>
<p>There is very limited research on the experiences of persons with dementia. Until recently, the focus on experiences of dementia has been on medical and cognitive aspects and the impact on carers and their experiences. Qualitative methods (grounded theory) were used in the present study to collect and analyse the data. The choice of method was motivated by the lack of previous studies about the experiences of persons living with EOD and by the social process included. The qualitative method enables the researcher to focus on the informant’s point of view and the present study shows that the informants’ own descriptions and stories are worth taking into consideration when trying to understand the situation of persons with EOD. Experiences of living with dementia are difficult to cover with quantitative methods and qualitative methods are helpful in improving knowledge of phenomena in areas where little is previously known (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211430647">Dellve, Abrahamsson, Trulsson &amp; Hallberg, 2002</xref>). Even if the findings cannot be generalized in a statistical sense, we argue that our findings can be transferable to other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211430647">Malterud, 2001</xref>), such as to other people with EOD and also the elderly suffering from dementia, in spite of the fact that suffering from dementia also means that in many ways the persons with dementia lack awareness to various degrees. The lack of awareness shown by persons with dementia is also a predictor for more BPSD, and subsequently increased stress and burden for the carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211430647">Vogel et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, when developing and evaluating services, it is important to listen to the carers’ opinions and suggestions. However, the voice of people with dementia must not be overlooked as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430647">Beattie et al. (2002)</xref> have pointed out and as was confirmed in a review study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211430647">Baalen van et al. (2010)</xref> and in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211430647">Westius, Andersson &amp; Kallenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211430647">Bakker et al., 2010</xref>). Some of the informants did recognize this lack of awareness among people with dementia, such as the informant who stated that it was his wife who had helped him to receive a diagnosis.</p>
<p>In this study no formal theory was developed but rather a model of the experiences of people with EOD and what the dementia disease means to the informants. If this model, which may be the first step on the way to develop a theory, is further developed by other studies, it might in the end become a formal theory. It provides knowledge about what it means to people with EOD to be experiencing changes during the early development of a dementia diagnosis and eventually being diagnosed with dementia. Furthermore, the study explores the experiences of those living with dementia who know that there is no cure and their fight for dignity with respect to certain intrapsychic challenges and social challenges; this provides glimpses of how to develop further services in collaboration with the people with EOD, as has been requested in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211430647">Baalen van et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430647">Rose et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430647">Werner, Schvachman &amp; Korczyn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>When there is no existing theory, the grounded theory approach is particularly appropriate for the study of people’s lives through processes and social interactions, which is the purpose of this study. Saturation in grounded theory is a critical point and is closely related to the sampling procedures. In order to capture variations in experiences, we have tried to select a heterogeneous group in the open sampling and to saturate each emerging category through theoretical sampling.</p>
