<abstract>
<p>In 1971, Stephen Hearst, head of the BBC Music and Arts department, commissioned John Berger to make a television series on topics of his choosing. With Mike Dibb, then a young producer/director in the department, Berger made the four-part television series <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. Following its success, BBC Publications commissioned Berger and Dibb to turn the television programme into a book, a project for which Richard Hollis, a graphic designer Berger had previously worked with on the magazine <italic>New Society</italic> and his novel <italic>G.</italic>, was brought in. Together with script consultant Chris Fox and artist Sven Blomberg, this group produced the book <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, jointly published by the BBC and Penguin Books in 1972. In this conversation with Juliette Kristensen, Mike Dibb and Richard Hollis discuss the history of the making of the television series and the book, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Juliette Kristensen (JK):</speaker>
<p>How did <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> start? What was the initial conversation?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike Dibb (MD):</speaker>
<p>I don’t think anybody was in a room having a conversation. John [Berger] had done a lot of things for television before <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. He knew Huw Wheldon quite well and he’d done films for <italic>Monitor</italic>, most of them directed by Michael Gill, who directed <italic>Civilisation</italic>, and one on Picasso, directed by Peter Montagnon, who was <italic>Civilisation’s</italic> co-producer.</p>
</speech>
<p>It was Stephen Hearst, then head of the BBC Music and Arts department [who had overseen <italic>Civilisation</italic> and later became controller of BBC Radio 3], who I think wrote to John and said, ‘Would you like to do a short series of four films on topics of your choice?’</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Was the brief as open as that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes. As I remember, John originally came up with the idea of doing a series of films in which each one would begin with an archetypal European painting as the point of departure for an exploration of some aspect of European art.</p>
</speech>
<p>At the time, I was quite a junior figure in the department. I’d met John before and I was initially going to be researching the series, maybe directing one of the films. But very soon John Drummond, to his credit, said ‘Look, it seems to me that this relationship really works. You should do it together.’ So that’s how it happened.</p>
<p>But then when John and I got together, the original concept was put to one side as Walter Benjamin’s ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’ had just come out in English translation and it was John’s suggestion we should start with that text.</p>
<p>So the challenge for the first film became how to turn that dense essay into something playful and accessible. And it was in the process of doing this that the overall formal concept of the series was crystallized. It was decided that the second film should question the conventional representations of women, in particular ‘The Nude’; and that the third should focus on the materialistic tradition of European painting. John had written this essay about European painting in several different ways before so, in some way, it was a pre-existing text. One version formed the introduction to a Thames &amp; Hudson book about subjects and themes in European painting and this became the basis for the third film in the series. The text of the second film about representations of women was partly new and partly collated from bits and pieces from <italic>G.</italic>, the novel that John had only just finished; indeed that was why he was free to work on the television series. But we felt that John’s script should only sustain half the programme, as it would seem rather odd that there should be no women’s voices in a film about the representation of women. So we brought that particular group of five women together and the original discussion, which ran 50 minutes, was fantastic; I still have it on an old quarter-inch tape.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most difficult things for me in making that programme was condensing that discussion down to 12 minutes because it sort of broke it up. It was still interesting but it’s not the most satisfying element in the series for me because I felt it just didn’t really represent the richness and subtlety of the original conversation. But that’s what we had to do – we only had half an hour for the whole programme.</p>
<p>We didn’t know what the fourth film was going to be about. For quite a while we thought it was going to be some kind of deconstruction of the idea of national heritage; we even got into conversation with one or two political theatre groups at that time, in particular The Red Ladder Theatre Company. I knew Chris Rawlence at Red Ladder and we thought they would be good because Chris had been at the Courtauld and so was knowledgeable about art at the same time as being involved in political theatre. I remember we did have discussions about how one might do a sort of cartoon theatrical/filmic representation of national heritage.</p>
<p>However, those discussions didn’t get very far and so we were left with a problem. Then John, being a friend of Huw Wheldon [then Managing Director of the BBC], was invited out to Huw’s place in Richmond for Sunday lunch. At the end of that day, John phoned me, saying he’d been looking at the advertisements on the tube stations when travelling to Huw’s house and had had an idea about how so many aspects of the tradition of European painting were now entering the world of advertising; and that colour photography was carrying on the function of oil paint, insofar as it could render objects in the same very tactile way. At the same time, advertising was using classical paintings behind figures or figures were placed in a country house or put against a Greek statue or something similar, in order to invoke something of the authority of European art. So that idea became the fourth film which, I suppose, is the most original film because we started from scratch and there was really nothing much written on advertising then.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>There seems to be an echo or response to Roland Barthes’ ‘The Rhetoric of the Image’ in that programme.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Well, I wasn’t reading Roland Barthes; I don’t know whether John was – I was more inspired by the films of Jean Luc Godard. Anyway I felt we sort of began wherever we began on that and I just combed every magazine looking for images.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richard Hollis (RH):</speaker>
<p>And Posy [Simmonds, the cartoonist and graphic novelist, and wife of Richard Hollis] provided some from her copies of <italic>Glamour</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes – I’d known Richard because we’d both lived in Barnes. But we only worked together for the first time on the book of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<p>And so, with the fourth programme, wherever I went in London, I would always note down billboards, shop windows and advertising hoardings. Unlike now when you can just go out with your little camera and film everything for yourself, in the early 1970s you had to get a film crew. So you had to build up enough images you wanted to film, and then go with a crew to film here, there and everywhere. Working like this, we gradually accumulated all the images we needed.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>The commission from the BBC seems to have been wide-ranging, giving you free licence to go off and explore. In terms of reporting back to your BBC managers, how did that work?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>We didn’t have a line manager. What we had was John Drummond who was the assistant head of the department. It was John [Drummond, later to become head of BBC Radio 3 and the BBC Proms] who brought John [Berger] and me together; he was the presiding authority figure.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Was it John Drummond who signed off <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>There wasn’t such a formal thing as signing off or anything like that. John [Drummond] occasionally said, ‘How’s it going?’ And I’d say ‘Fine’, and tell him what we were doing. But no, there was very little strict supervision in that way. It was a time of enormous trust, so different from today. In fact I had edited the whole of the first film, right down to dubbing it before Stephen Hearst, the head of the department, saw it. Of course John [Drummond] had seen it by then and was okay about it, but Stephen hadn’t.</p>
</speech>
<p>When Stephen Hearst watched it, he didn’t say anything. I was just sitting there in this little viewing room with the film on a Steenbeck, thinking, ‘Oh God, he thinks it’s awful. I can’t bear it.’ After it finished, Stephen just turned to me and said, ‘Michael, congratulations.’ And left the room.</p>
<p>So it was an incredibly easy birth. There were no crises; there were no terrible conflicts.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>The BBC wasn’t as conservative an institution as maybe one would now think it was?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>No, not at all. There was a respect for diversity. I was given the freedom via John [Berger] because it was known what his politics were, it was known where he came from. John was given the space, as it were, as the author of the series.</p>
</speech>
<p>There was no real interference in the making of it at all. All the problems we had were problems that John and I found when our ideas weren’t working.</p>
<p>The only restriction on freedom was financial but that could work in one’s interest too. If you didn’t cost the BBC a lot of money, you were not a big risk. We were inexpensive because we didn’t travel anywhere outside of London – we went to the National Gallery, we hired very cheaply an electrical goods warehouse in Ealing where we bought our blue screen. Additionally, film editing was very inexpensive because editing was a below-the-line cost in the BBC. So there was no very fixed schedule in terms of how much editing we could do; our excellent film editor was David Gladwell who’d only just edited Lindsay Anderson’s film <italic>If</italic>….</p>
<p>What the BBC worried about on a budget was how much was going to be paid to people outside the BBC, and I don’t think John was paid very much. They weren’t particularly concerned by any internal costs because directors, editors and cameramen were all on the staff and were going to be paid anyway.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>While making <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, did you have a sense of how the four episodes would speak to one other? Or of how groundbreaking it was?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>No, not really. We just sort of followed what we were trying to do with a kind of conviction. But, at the same time as the BBC left us free to make it, they didn’t get behind it at the moment of its launch, to herald it or give it a great big send-off. I remember that, although the <italic>Radio Times</italic> did an interview with John, they didn’t publish it; they thought Malcolm Muggeridge [the journalist and media figure] was more interesting than John.</p>
</speech>
<p>In terms of its publicity for the series, it started with Elkan Allan who wrote the first preview column of any newspaper on the back of <italic>The Sunday Times</italic>. Of course now we’re so used to previews that it’s difficult to remember how different it was in 1972. At the time, we showed the films to TV critics in little BBC viewing theatres, and Allan came along. He gave the first film a rave preview, writing something like, ‘If you’re doing nothing you must have your set switched on on a Monday night.’ That was the first time <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was noticed. I think its popularity was much more through word of mouth, by the people who saw it; it was a slow burner.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p><italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was broadcast on a weekday night?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>It was a weekday night – something like 10 o’clock on BBC2.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>And it was scheduled fairly late in the evening?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes. It wasn’t prime time. But then <italic>Civilisation</italic> didn’t go out at prime time and if you look at its viewing figures, they’re not startling.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>In addition to you and John, who else worked with you? Were Chris Fox and Sven Blomberg involved at this stage?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Chris Fox was a student whom John had met and by whom he was very impressed. In fact John dedicated an essay to Chris. So Chris was employed for very little money as a kind of researcher on the television series. But research isn’t quite what Chris did. Because John was often in Geneva during the production, Chris acted as a wonderful sounding board – he was a very quiet, extraordinary, brilliant guy, who was very knowledgeable about European painting and he was somebody I could always talk to about anything, about ideas and whether some claim was really true. So he was a kind of script consultant.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>And in terms of making the series, from the initial commission to its broadcast, how long did it take to make <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know. It must have been over a year mustn’t it? I didn’t do anything else once I’d started on it and it went out in 1972.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Do you remember it as being quite an intense period of your life?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, of course. It was hugely important but I didn’t work on it thinking, ‘Wow, this is going to really knock people for six.’ At the time, all I was really thinking about was what was the best way of making it – the visual conception of the thing – which I suppose was more my responsibility than John’s. In making it, certain things were just accidental. For example, the blue screen behind John was there because of an idea we had that we might float in images behind him, using a technique called colour separation overlay which was really in its early days.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>To have images move behind his head, like a data flow?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes. But at the time video editing was very crude and the technology wasn’t very good at keying in images, particularly if you filmed it rather than had it electronically done in a studio. So soon it became obvious that that idea wasn’t really going to work. But by then we were lumbered with John against a blue background. And he was only wearing that striped shirt because if you wear a blue shirt against a blue background it’s no good. So John had to go out and buy himself two non-blue shirts.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>It’s absolutely dreadful. It’s the thing I most remember about the film.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>What is funny to me is how accidents are so often perceived as overly self-conscious things, deliberate decisions because they are solidified on film. So the criticism that John was filmed against a blue sky so that he looked like Moses coming down from the Mount with his tablets is ridiculous because the blue was in fact just circumstantial. And then the shirt was circumstantial too. John often just wears a blue shirt, which actually would have been much nicer if I hadn’t been thinking about putting images behind him.</p>
</speech>
<p>The essential thing we wanted to ensure was that it had to look as if John was ‘nowhere’, or rather in no locatable space. The fact that he was in an electrical goods showroom, that was just incidental.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>You mentioned that its reception by the previewer at <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> was incredibly positive. Was it generally received in such a positive way?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>The series itself did not get widely reviewed. I think George Melly reviewed one of the programmes, when he was <italic>The Observer</italic>’s TV critic. I do remember the <italic>New Statesman</italic> didn’t review it at all, which was strange given John’s history with that publication. I mean the <italic>New Statesman</italic> was where I first read John when I was a teenager. I was very taken by John’s writing in my youth. Certainly one of the nice things about making <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was that I was working with someone whose writing I had been so taken by when I was growing up. When you’ve been greatly influenced by a writer as a teenager, there is always the possibility of a terrible disappointment when you meet them – which, of course, you don’t always do. But actually we just got on terribly well and still do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Of course he had written film scenarios before <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, hadn’t he?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I hadn’t read any of those, but he had worked with [the Swiss film director] Alain Tanner.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Exactly, yes. What was the film he worked on with Tanner? The Salamander [<italic>La Salamandre</italic>]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>The Salamander, that’s right.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>It’s only as I see this laid out [one of the draft scripts from Mike Dibbs’s archive is lying on the table round which we are sitting], I can see that he would know how to set out a script.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>He probably wrote it like this because that’s the way he did it for his films on Giacometti and others with <italic>Monitor</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>So in a way he was a pro at making films. And as a journalist, of course.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>In an article on the design of the book <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> by your former student Lucy Sisman, you [RH] recount how when you worked as the illustrator on John Berger’s novel <italic>G.</italic> you would often ask him if he could ‘lose a couple of words’, and he would edit his work at your requests because, as you note, he was a journalist and understood the practicalities of the working relationship between writing, editing and design. What is also striking about this story of your collaboration is that it seems to be one characterized by generosity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I can’t remember what happened when John’s articles were submitted to <italic>New Society</italic>, although he would even lose several lines if asked, but I can remember Paul Barker, the editor, would often cut pieces to ribbons in the editorial process.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>That’s how I first met John, funnily enough – he was staying with Anya [Bostock, John Berger’s first wife] at Paul Barker’s house while Paul was away, and I had dinner with John and Anya, long before <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>. At the time, we were talking about doing a film about Brecht because he’d just done these wonderful translations with Anya of Brecht’s poems for the theatre. It was because of the poems he’d written that I first went to talk to him about the possibility of going to Berlin and doing a film on Brecht. But it never materialized into anything.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>How and where did the book come into the project?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>The series went out and then I think it was Peter Campbell, who did a lot of the designs and other things for the BBC, who suggested it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>He was the art editor, or production editor, of BBC Publications. He was wonderful because he let us get on with it and just made positive noises.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Was the television series broadcast, and then Peter Campbell saw it and came to you with a book commission?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes. John had already done a little bit of doctoring of the texts of the films because each episode was published every week in <italic>The Listener</italic> [the BBC magazine that expanded on or reproduced BBC broadcasts].</p>
</speech>
<p>In fact I saw a note about it in my file here [pulls out a blue folder with some of his archive documents from <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> and chooses a letter from John Berger]. This letter is from John just after we finished the series. [MD reads] ‘…. I’ve edited one or two and sent them off to Karl Miller [editor of <italic>The Listener</italic>]. I hope you feel better; I have flu too.’ I don’t know why I didn’t throw these letters away but I haven’t. I suppose because they are quite touching and personal.</p>
<p>Because the book was a collaboration between BBC Publications and Penguin Books, the other person involved was Nikos Stangos, the editor at Penguin Books. Nikos was a very nice man who edited a book of John’s essays for Penguin – I can’t remember whether that happened after <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> or before.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>How long did you take to produce the book?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>We were just given two weeks in some BBC premises in Hanover Square.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Was it as long as that? When all of us were together?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I think it was two weeks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>But after that …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>After that it was you and me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>How did Sven Blomberg become involved with <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Sven was a close friend of John’s, an impoverished artist whom John wanted to help and thought would add something fresh to the book.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>He was rather a confusion because he made these montages of various things. I remember Mike saying to him ‘Sven, I don’t quite understand what it is that this is trying to say.’ And Sven just said, ‘It’s fucking obvious!’ And then went and stood on the balcony.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Sven was doing these little visual essays that meant more, I think, to him than to everybody else. But in a funny way I think they do help in the book.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Because they’re informal.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes, informal. And they provide a sort of visual space and a kind of visual library.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Those collages were big. Sven produced them on sheets of sugar paper about this size [indicates size of paper with his hands].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>The visual essays do give a different pace and structure to <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> than you find in other art books of the period … A question about media and making: in a group that included a filmmaker and a book designer, how did you think about the process of translating the television series into a book? Because making the book after the television series is an act of translation, surely, from one media form to another?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I was very influenced by [the filmmaker] Chris Marker’s book <italic>Commentaires</italic>. I’d seen his films when I was in Paris, and with his accompanying book, it became clear you had, as it were, a voice speaking graphically – first you had the commentary, and then in came the image. Sometimes Marker has the same image with a different commentary to show how an image can be made to say quite different things. I found this idea – that you could have words going on almost at the same time like a voice-over – very influential.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Was the idea that the voices were held in the typography?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>We wanted to try to make the text as visually strong as the images. I can’t remember the <italic>Civilisation</italic> book, but in most art books often you can’t find the image being discussed or the image is far too big in comparison to the type. With <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, it is meant to have a sort of equal weight between the images and text so you weren’t distracted and just read on. That was the idea of it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>We wanted it to be a continuous argument, where the image came exactly at the moment where you wanted to refer to it. Of course this meant that the images were often rather badly reproduced. The National Gallery, I think but can’t be sure, said that they thought the images were so grubbily reproduced they would feel embarrassed to ask to be given money.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Images were often black and white which, in those days, you could get away with. We’re only just beginning to realize now that you just publish and be damned if you’re in black and white.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I found I still have an envelope containing some of the black and white images as you marked them up for scaling.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Then it was a much more complicated process [to design a book]. Now you can do everything in some program where you can scan the image, it’s the right size and you just drop it in; now you can control everything. But then, the design and typesetting of the book were separate from the author. Nowadays you could do it yourself, but at that time you had to instruct the typesetter to do it and, of course, it all cost money. So things that you can tidy up quite straightforwardly now, you couldn’t do then because the corrections were costing money. And of course it all had to be pasted up, physically.</p>

<p>Once the book was going, after this flurry of a fortnight, John went back to Geneva and Sven went back to Lacoste. Then it was Richard who had the hard job of taking all this work and making it fit as a book. And I was there whenever Richard needed me, to find extra images or advertisements, or clear rights, or get the actual, physical black and white photographs from the National Gallery, or whatever.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>You did produce the book very quickly.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>It was just what you did. You didn’t think of it being very odd. I would never have imagined sitting talking about it forty years later.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>And it was actually such fun.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>It seems like you got on tremendously and still do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I suppose we all had the same political outlooks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Yes, there were no ideological tensions. Also we had quite clear functions. Richard brought all his skills to the process of making the book; I got together all the material because I knew where the images came from. But it was fun, and I think we did have a sense with the book that it was trying to challenge the conventions of art books; we did have aspirations for it to be very different from other art books. Most importantly, we wanted it to be cheaper and for a while it was the cheapest art book available.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>It was priced at 60p, I think. And now, it is still one of the cheapest books on the market at £8.99.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>One of the interesting things is that my eldest son is the only person in our whole family who’s ever had a drawing reproduced. That [points to an image on the back cover of Hollis’s own recent edition of the book] is my son’s drawing of [the footballer] Allan Clarke because we are Leeds United fans. In fact, the first edition has quite a big collage at the back – but it’s been reduced to just that now [indicates back cover of a more recent edition].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>When the book was delivered for publication, I read that the Penguin editor threw it down the corridor and shouted ‘I don’t want this book anywhere near me.’ Do you know why he had such an extraordinary reaction to the book?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Penguin was full of design ideological battles between Hans Schmoller, a brilliant typographer in a very classical manner, and Germano Facetti, the editor of the covers. They were poles apart in terms of design, as well as politically. Penguin would never have let us design the book like this. It was the BBC who let us do it and I don’t know at what stage Penguin got involved.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I don’t either.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Presumably Penguin got involved because the BBC wouldn’t have done paperbacks – certainly not to a small format – and because Penguin were the expert publishers. I don’t remember it going through Penguin’s production department. It’s a good job that it didn’t, because it would have been sat on immediately.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Certainly the editorial driving force was BBC Publications. It probably just did a financial deal with Penguin because I don’t remember Nikos Stangos coming in on the thing.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>You [RH] had worked on <italic>New Society</italic> with John Berger when you were its art director and he was one of the contributors, and then you worked on his novel <italic>G.</italic>, which won the Booker Prize in 1972.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I had worked with John when he was writing fairly regularly for <italic>New Society</italic>. He got used to seeing what sort of images that I chose to go with what he was writing and so that’s one of the reasons why it was all quite easy to do <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> because we were used to working together.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Sisman also notes in her article on the design of the book <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> that John is ‘a writer who knows and respects images’ and you are ‘a highly literate designer’ so that in your working relationship on the book ‘neither side [was] overwhelmed [by] the other’. Can you talk a little more about this?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know what sort of visual sense John has because that’s really to do with taste, in a quite bourgeois way. One example of his visual sense, however, is that I remember visiting him in Switzerland with my wife and he took us swimming to a municipal open-air swimming pool just over the border in France. It had the most marvellous architectural design and I said to him ‘Isn’t it beautifully done?’ But he was, or had been, completely unaware of it. If he’s talking to you, he’ll be looking at you directly and rather intensely, and he’s like that with everything.</p>
</speech>
<p>But then he’s a visual person, if you know what I mean. I think there are a lot of different forms of visual literacy. For example, through my wife, we know a lot of writers and many of them are actually completely un-visual people – even if they collect paintings, or have friends who are artists. There’s some sort of visual knowing that people who’ve gone through art school have – it’s a different way of seeing things.</p>
<p>Of course, visual intelligence is to do with training because people like me who didn’t go to university, while we may have read well, we’re not intellectual in the sense of being very intelligent in holding an argument, for example. Writers don’t actually understand that. For example, their relationship to buildings is different. I remember a conversation I had with a well-known writer where I said ‘I thought how you described the paintwork around windows in that book was great. I could see the building.’ And he said, ‘I didn’t actually describe it.’ Then he said ‘Well, think of the house in <italic>Vanity Fair</italic>. Describe it.’ And so I did and he said, ‘It’s completely different to the one that I have in my mind.’ What he saw was partly in terms of architectural history, but it was more to do with its association with the people within it. It’s very different to my sense of the same building.</p>
<p>I think that literary intelligence is a completely different sort of intelligence to the visual one. Even if one tries as a designer to write stylishly, it is very different and I think each envies the other. That’s why the relationship between somebody like John and myself is more a sort of formal one – as a designer, you are formally organizing things because they have the ideas and you hope you can put them in such a way that their idea comes across. In a sense the designer is a go-between. Of course, they used to be the go-between between the person who is emitting the message and the reader, but then they were also working with the printer because of the amount of technical work involved. All that has now disappeared.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>It’s really interesting to see those draft scripts of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, with the sellotaped sections of text layered upon one another. There is a real sense of the materiality of the making process.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>That’s absolutely right because, for example, say 20 years ago, I would be sitting here with a drawing board with music playing and designing with set squares. I hoped I would be too old for learning to design on a computer but I soon realized that I’d have to adapt. Of course, designing on a computer has changed the relationship between the designer and the client because clients, particularly publishers or curators, know that they can change things. But then it was quite different. For example, when I was first teaching, there was a big hardback book by Nicolete Gray called <italic>The Russian Experiment in Art</italic>, published by Thames &amp; Hudson. The designer, who had been a student at the Bauhaus, used the wrong side of the type scale and so all this metal type was set too wide on the page of the book. If you think of the cost of that mistake, it was enormous. Then, you see, you were working in materials, actual physical stuff, whereas now, as you say, it’s all in the ether, it’s all in the memory of your machine.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>I wanted to ask more about that relationship between image and text, and how you work with that relationship.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Oh, to me it’s the most crucial thing. That’s what graphic design is about, words and images, and the way they interrelate. Because one will always change the other – the caption will transform the image, the image encapsulate the caption. When I was first teaching at the London College of Printing (before it was even called that), an advertising person came in to talk to the students and said, ‘You never put a picture of a monkey and put the word monkey underneath it because there’s no tension.’ And I think that’s the essential thing about graphic design, the tension.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Which means you need to understand the demands of the text and understand the demands of the image?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Yes, even if they’re quite simple things, it’s essential to understand how they relate to one another.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Do you remember the critical reception to the book when it came out?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>No, not really, but it sold very well. I think it sold 20,000 copies in a week, or so I understood at the time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>You must look at the first edition, though, because there is something very interesting in it. It contains the notice that ‘The text of this book is not copyright.’</p>
</speech>
<p>We believed ideas should be free. And in the very first edition we managed to slip this through, but it was picked up very quickly and then every other subsequent edition is copyrighted. But because the first edition says the text of the book is not copyrighted, I suppose technically anyone can take the text – although they couldn’t take the images.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>Incidentally there’s a French edition following the first edition about to be done by some young designers. They asked if it was okay to follow the first one and I said, ‘Yes, please do.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>It’s as if the first edition of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is open source text because there is no copyright on it, making it a source that designers and filmmakers can take and create new forms.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I think one should probably ask John if they could do it. I don’t know what the French publishers would have said but am sure they were quite sensible.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>One example of this, I suppose, was in one of his letters that he sent me, accompanying a script of programme two, in which he says something like ‘Do what you like with it: cut it, change it, alter it, whatever, as long as you just keep the idea, true to the idea.’ So in that sense he’s a very un-dogmatic collaborator.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>I think the quote, which was used in the 2005 Tate exhibition <italic>Ways of Seeing – Revisited</italic>, is ‘Criticise, improvise, change, improve, cancel out as much as you want or see how to, or we can even begin again. All I would stand by is the essential idea.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>That’s John at his very best, I think. Because he’s not precious about these things. In fact, often his statements are really like questions.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RH:</speaker>
<p>I can remember him at a long dinner table, where lots of the people were listening to him, and he would say something at some length, and then say, ‘No, no, no; that is quite wrong.’ In a way, he’s testing as he speaks whether what he’s saying is right, don’t you think?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I think that’s true. I think he often comes up with an idea you think isn’t quite right, but it knocks out your original idea. In itself, it isn’t the right idea either but by arguing it through you come to another idea which is better than the one either of you first thought of. And that is all collaboration can ever be – coming up with an idea and not pre-censoring yourself because you think people might think it’s silly. It might be a bit silly but it might also be a stepping-stone towards another idea that is often better than the first one.</p>
</speech>
<p>John’s an interesting mixture between being open and occasionally getting quite angry and tough. It’s not as if everything was an easy ride; there were moments of tension. I remember I’d suggest something he thought was a bad idea and I’d get terribly upset and worried about it. But then we somehow would work it through.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>In a creative project, especially like <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, there has to be tension.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>I don’t think we could have got from the text he first wrote to the final thing, with so many changes along the way, without quite a lot of discussion and argument about what would work and what wouldn’t work. But the crucial thing in all successful creative collaborations, of which film-making is a prime example, is that everyone involved must trust each other and share the same aim. And in the end practice trumps theory and what works wins the day.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>In relation to other films that you’ve made over your career, was <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> the most extreme case of how a film changed from the initial idea to its final form?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>No. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, for all its visual playfulness, was very much a series made around the particular way John writes and speaks. What happened was that John’s first drafts were never sacrosanct and so, during the process of developing the series, the texts were continually modified and refined.</p>
</speech>
<p>In fact, most of my films begin without any kind of script at all, just with questions I want to ask. The making of the film is for me a kind of elaborate answer to those questions. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was a one off. I’ve never done anything like it before or since, really. And although I have done other things with John, they’ve each been very different from <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>Can I ask you one last question, a somewhat heretical one? <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is an incredibly important television series and book, certainly in the field of visual culture. However, there is now a completely different media landscape to that of 1972. Do you think it’s possible to make a <italic>Ways of Seeing 2</italic>?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>No. Or certainly not by me. I wouldn’t want to, because there’s not much I’d want to change. Yes, if I was doing it with today’s technology I’d make it differently with different contemporary references, but I never think, ‘I want to update this.’ As we said at the end of the book: ‘to be continued …’ I think it’s up to others to take the ideas of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> further.</p>
</speech>
<p>The truth is that three years ago John and I decided we wanted to make a new film together and took the proposal to the BBC. But nobody would let us do it, at least not on our own terms. Rather than our own agenda, it was suggested we ‘re-visit’ <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> or make a film about John’s thoughts on contemporary British art, two things we couldn’t be less interested in doing. So nothing happened.</p>
<p>Then, more recently, Channel 4 offered us a small budget to do something but just before Christmas I was told that the offer had been withdrawn because More4, which was where the film was going to go, was now being rebranded as an exclusively leisure and lifestyle channel, as if every TV channel wasn’t already awash with cooking and property shows. So now both the BBC and Channel 4 options have gone down the drain, a sad index of just how much our broadcasting culture has declined and diminished</p>
<p>After all, John is one of the very few people, with David Attenborough, who’s been making films since the 1950s. He’s still in great shape and it’s very depressing that the BBC and Channel 4 between them can’t find just one hour of screen time for John and me to make a film of our choice on themes and subjects that matter to us now, even though <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is continually held up as one of the most influential TV arts series ever made, with the book still on every student’s reading list.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>I suppose my question came from thinking about the scalpel going through the canvas in the opening sequences of the first programme and how one deals with the ubiquity of digital media within that context – how the new digital landscape intersects with the arguments in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Of course, digital media has become so sophisticated in the way that you can play with images. But I think one of the things I like about <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is that it’s of its time but still feels fresh. In a funny way, the worst thing would be to try and modernize it. That would feel, I don’t know, a waste of time.</p>
</speech>
<p>What is also quite nice about <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is that I have had one or two students who’ve used the text and assembled other images around it. There was a film student from Manchester who did this – he was terribly worried that I would mind and I said, ‘No, I think that’s fantastic. If you want to take it and make another selection of images, I think that’s a way in which it’s still alive for you and I’d love to see whatever you do.’</p>
<p>Back in 1971 we never thought in terms of DVDs, or anything like that, and so <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was cleared for UK television with some international transmissions. Of course, this meant that at the time we paid almost nothing for reproduction fees. One of the problems the BBC may have now with making available a commercial DVD of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> concerns the issues surrounding copyright. Kenneth Clark went everywhere for the series <italic>Civilisation</italic> so the BBC hold the copyright for all the film of the paintings and cathedrals and buildings featured in the programmes. But because we were responding to the modern means of reproduction whereby the images can come to us, we are ironically now stymied by the fact that every reproduced image has a copyright attached to it.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>JK:</speaker>
<p>But the whole series can still be accessed online, through YouTube. It’s in the ether.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MD:</speaker>
<p>Unofficially, of course. But yes, that’s another irony. In a way, the most modern means of reproduction are coming to the rescue and it’ll be there to be downloaded forever. Except I’m told the quality of it on YouTube is awful.</p>
