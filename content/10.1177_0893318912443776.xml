<abstract>
<p>This article explores the function of the ubiquitous question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” in advancing particular meanings of work, higher education, and the work–higher education relationship. Analyzing 110 student descriptions of encounters with the question suggests that the colloquialism powerfully shapes student interpretations of work and education, cementing vocational understandings of higher education and perpetuating a linear view of careers. Such interpretations pressure students to make early commitments to particular identities and induce significant anxiety, particularly in those whose majors are not seen as preparing them for preferred forms of work.</p>

<p>Historically, organizational communication has focused on communication <italic>at</italic> work rather than communication <italic>about</italic> work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney, Zorn, Planalp, &amp; Lair, 2008</xref>). For instance, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912443776">Zorn and Townsley (2008)</xref> observe, the term “work” is not even indexed in the now decade-old <italic>New Handbook of Organizational Communication</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318912443776">Jablin &amp; Putnam, 2001</xref>). While organizational communication has always concerned itself with how communication informs—and even performs—work and work environments, only within the past few years has the discipline begun to devote attention to the role communication plays in shaping the <italic>meaning</italic> of work as a social institution as organizational communication scholars take up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912443776">Ashcraft’s (2007)</xref> call to turn our attention “back to work.”</p>
<p>Largely outside of the discipline, a parallel set of questions has emerged about education in general and higher education in particular. Increasingly, higher education has been subjected to the imperatives of the market, transforming education into a commodity to be consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318912443776">McMillan &amp; Cheney, 1996</xref>) and educators into an increasingly contingent and precarious workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318912443776">Ross, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912443776">Newfield (2008)</xref> observes, such changes are not exclusively economic, but rather a part of a broader cultural and political discussion about the meaning and purpose of higher education as an institution. Higher education’s role as a central front in the “culture wars” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912443776">Horowitz, 2007</xref>) is inextricably linked with its marketization, transforming the institution from one cultivating citizen-subjects into one producing worker-consumers.</p>
<p>Because one result of this contest is the increasing vocationalization of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912443776">Watkins, 2008</xref>), contemporary education debates are tied to the imperative to understand the meaning of work. Surprisingly, however, education as a site where the meaning of work is contested has remained largely absent from the developing agenda for organizational communication scholars. For example, educational institutions are notably absent from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney et al.’s (2008)</xref> list of discursive sites central to the growing interest in the meaning of work. In short, the work–education intersection, we observe, has been remarkably absent from the growing body of literature exploring the meaning of work from a communicative perspective.</p>
<p>This article places the work–education intersection on the organizational communication agenda by exploring how these domains are connected in everyday, colloquial speech. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912443776">Zorn and Townsley (2008)</xref> observe, such speech exerts a powerful influence on the meanings attributed to work (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912443776">Cheney, Lair, Ritz, &amp; Kendall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912443776">Clair, 1996</xref>). Inspired particularly by Clair’s analysis of student experiences with the commonplace, “a real job,” we explore how the meaning of work is shaped in and around higher educational contexts by examining student encounters with the frequently asked colloquial question, “What are you going to do with that major?”</p>
<sec id="section1-0893318912443776">
<title>The Contemporary Work–Higher Education Nexus</title>
<p>In turning to higher education as an institutional context in which the meaning of work is actively contested, we take up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912443776">Ashcraft’s (2007)</xref> call for scholarship that simultaneously “dislocates” the organization as a privileged site of analysis and “reworks” organization studies by privileging work itself as a central construct. Such a move, we argue, is particularly timely as the meaning of the work–education intersection is currently an active site of cultural and political contest, driven by the vocational pressures associated with a decades-long trend in the commercialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318912443776">Slaughter &amp; Rhoades, 2009</xref>) and corporatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318912443776">Tuchman, 2009</xref>) of higher education institutions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912443776">Bok (2003)</xref> points out, students are turning to universities in increasingly vocational terms, dramatically altering social understandings of the meaning and purpose of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912443776">Cox, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The work–education intersection is particularly salient in the wake of the ongoing global economic crisis, which has dramatically changed prospects for the future working lives of young people. Worldwide youth unemployment rose to a record high in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912443776">Allen, 2010</xref>), leading ILO Director-General Juan Samovia to flag youth unemployment as a “world priority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912443776">“World Jobless,” 2011</xref>, para. 10). Predictably, young workers with only a high school education (or less) were the hardest hit, but even recent college graduates received a disproportionate share of the impact, peaking at an unemployment rate (9.7%) nearly double that of college graduates over the age of 25 (4.5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318912443776">Shierholz &amp; Edwards, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even as unemployment rates for recent graduates begin to drop (down from 8.6% in November 2010 to 6.2% in November 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912443776">National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2011</xref>), the effects on young workers are pervasive and long term, depressing earning power for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318912443776">Kahn, 2010</xref>). As <italic>Atlantic Monthly</italic> reporter Don <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318912443776">Peck (2010)</xref> noted, “When you add up all the earnings losses over the years . . . it’s as if the lucky graduates had been given a gift of about $100,000, adjusted for inflation, immediately upon graduation—or, alternatively, as if the unlucky ones had been saddled with a debt of the same size” (para. 24). That metaphorical debt does not account for the actual debt that college students have incurred in an era of rising tuition costs: Average student loan debt is now US$25,000, and the total student loan debt held by U.S. students now exceeds 1 trillion dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318912443776">Lewin, 2011</xref>). Recent graduates are slower to get a start on independent lives, with a 25% increase in the number of young adults moving back in with their parents over the past 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318912443776">Thompson, 2011</xref>). So even as the economic conditions for recent graduates begin to show signs of improvement, evidence that inexorable damage has already been done has led many commentators—perhaps most notably in <italic>Business Week</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912443776">Coy, 2009</xref>)—to fear a “lost generation” of workers whose economic lives will be indelibly changed at great individual and social cost.</p>
<p>In response, questions have arisen regarding the value and purpose of higher education in a manner that brings together longer-standing concerns over the meanings of work and education. Such questions range from the “worth” of a college education as an individual investment to whether or not higher education and the current employment market are complementary. At the personal level, for instance, a 2011 Pew survey found that 57% of Americans say that a college education no longer offers a good return on value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318912443776">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912443776">Mishel (2011)</xref> argues that a narrative of a growing “mismatch” between job seeker qualifications and employer needs has become an increasingly popular—but economically questionable—explanation for persistent unemployment even after the recession officially ended. In other words, education—higher education in particular—has emerged as a culprit in a growing narrative that casts persistent unemployment, particularly among younger workers, as structural rather than cyclical. Certainly, the relationship between higher education and work has become an increasingly important site of cultural contestation.</p>
<p>This contest also points to a broader range of concerns, from the degree to which it links the university to trends in the contemporary division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912443776">Bousquet, 2008</xref>) to the occlusion of longer-standing university goals such as the production of a democratic citizenry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912443776">Newfield, 2008</xref>), making higher education an important institutional context in which the meaning of work is actively negotiated. And while education has remained largely absent from organizational communication scholarship on the meaning of work, the discipline has long noted the theoretical basis for such exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318912443776">Jablin (1985)</xref> laid the groundwork by naming <italic>vocational anticipatory socialization</italic> as a part of the organizational socialization process, and others have sought to detail the space and time in which such processes were seen as occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912443776">Smith &amp; Turner, 1995</xref>). Most notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912443776">Clair (1996)</xref> called for a more expansive understanding of the communicative processes shaping <italic>work socialization</italic>.</p>
<p>Where organizational communication research has sought to explore communication about work in “microsystems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318912443776">Jablin, 1985</xref>) beyond work organizations, the focus has been primarily on how communication in the family (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318912443776">Medved, Brogan, McClanahan, Morris, &amp; Shepherd, 2006</xref>) and the media (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318912443776">Hylmö, 2006</xref>) shapes views of work for children and adolescents. Educational settings in general, and higher education in particular, have been largely overlooked. While some recent research has begun to explore work socialization in education related to careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM; see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912443776">Kisselburg, Berkelaar, &amp; Buzzanell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912443776">Myers, Jahn, Gaillard, &amp; Stoltzfus, 2011</xref>), communication about the relationship between work and education in broader contexts has received little attention.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912443776">Ashcraft and Allen’s (2009)</xref> call for a reflexive move on the part of academics to consider “our own organizational settings as significant cultural sites that organize common notions and configurations of work” (p. 11), we explore student understandings of the relationship between work and higher education by considering how the commonplace question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” operates in and around higher education institutions, shaping and organizing student understandings of the meaning of education and its relationship to their future work lives. In our analysis, we focus on how students experience and make sense of their encounters with the question as well as the meanings of work, higher education, and the work–higher education relationship that are (re)produced through such conversations.</p>

<title>Colloquial Expressions and the Meaning of Work</title>
<p>Organizational communication scholars’ recent interest in the meaning of work stems from a desire to make sense of work as an institution in transformation, building upon several strands of research that have been developed over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney et al., 2008</xref>). These lines of research include explorations of work–life balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912443776">Duckworth &amp; Buzzanell, 2009</xref>), contingent forms of organizing labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912443776">Gossett, 2006</xref>), the communicative constitution of professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912443776">Cheney &amp; Ashcraft, 2007</xref>) and occupational identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912443776">Ashcraft, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912443776">Meisenbach, 2008</xref>), identity and organizations more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318912443776">Wieland, 2010</xref>), gender and difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912443776">Ashcraft, 2007</xref>), and representations of work in popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318912443776">Dempsey &amp; Sanders, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318912443776">Lair, 2011</xref>). The meaning of work focus that results is thus a new domain of inquiry grounded in an already substantial body of scholarship.</p>
<p>This domain draws scholars’ attention to communication not as it occurs in or by particular organizations, but rather as it constructs work across and beyond organizational contexts. Based on the idea that what counts as “good work” is socially constructed, scholars have found that work has been interpreted as meaningful based on a variety of material and nonmaterial benefits, including monetary rewards, satisfaction, recognition, stimulation, structure, and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney et al., 2008</xref>). Perhaps most important in the modern age, work provides individuals with a sense of self and has become a primary anchor on which identity is built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318912443776">Wieland, Bauer, &amp; Deetz, 2009</xref>) as occupational groups and work organizations become primary targets of identification. Because some organizations and occupations are perceived as more prestigious than others, individuals working in stigmatized jobs communicatively construct positive self-identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0893318912443776">Tracy &amp; Scott, 2006</xref>). As Cheney et al. write, “Communication studies are well situated to theorize not only meaning construction but the enactment and co-production of meaningful work” (p. 164). This emerging domain of organizational communication inquiry promises to “contribute to increased awareness and understanding of why and how we work and to actions that would enhance the quality of our work experiences and our lives in general” (p. 172).</p>
<p>Our analysis here focuses on how everyday colloquial speech shapes individual understandings of work. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney et al. (2008)</xref> identified everyday expressions as an important site through which the meaning of work is negotiated, few studies have focused on such speech. Examples include “it’s not personal, it’s business” and “just a job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912443776">Cheney et al., 2010</xref>), but to date the most prominent examination of a work-related colloquialism has been <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912443776">Clair’s (1996)</xref> analysis of “a real job.” As Clair argues, this colloquialism privileges certain qualities of work, particularly that taking place in “legitimate” organizations, with regular hours, and appropriate for the worker’s socioeconomic position. In short, the colloquialism crystallizes a set of generally accepted assumptions about <italic>appropriate</italic> work.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912443776">Clair (1996)</xref>, such expressions powerfully present taken-for-granted knowledge from a position of anonymous ubiquity—with no direct source, such “wisdom” is tough to question. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912443776">Billig and Macmillan (2005)</xref> observe, the transparency of everyday speech obscures its role in framing to frame the world in a subtle, but ideologically powerful, fashion. Accordingly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912443776">Cheney et al. (2008)</xref> observe, these expressions serve dual purposes—as a cultural repository in which deeply held but often implicit values, beliefs, and attitudes are sedimented and as <italic>topoi</italic> drawn upon to persuade. Recognizing the capacity of such expressions to contain particular meanings of work and to reinforce those meanings as they are deployed in the everyday, our investigation of the role played by the question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” is guided by two central research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0893318912443776" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How does the colloquial question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” function in students’ everyday conversation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What do student responses to the question reveal about dominant and alternative meanings of the work–education relationship?</p></list-item></list>
<p>In exploring these research questions, we argue that the question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” is positioned as a productive site through which to explore the ways in which the meanings of work and education are shaped by everyday speech.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0893318912443776" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To explore these questions, we solicited student narratives of encounters with the colloquial question by offering extra credit to students enrolled in public speaking at midsized private university in the Western United States. Students were asked to respond to the following prompt:
<disp-quote>
<p>Describe a time when you used or encountered the question, “What are you going to do with that major?” You may write about a time when someone asked you this question, when you asked someone else this question, when you overheard a conversation about this question, or any other circumstances in which you encountered the question. Please describe your encounter in as much detail as you can remember. Who was involved in asking/answering the question? Why was the question asked? How did the participants—including you—feel about the question? Your essay should be a minimum of three paragraphs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following this prompt, students were asked to provide basic demographic information, including major, year in school, gender, and socioeconomic background. In total, 132 students completed some part of the survey instrument. Twenty two students did not provide narratives of an encounter with the question, yielding a corpus of 110 narratives. The sample roughly approximated the institution’s distribution of students based on major, age, sex, and race and ethnicity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0893318912443776">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Student responses were coded in two stages. In the first stage, we conducted a content analysis of the narratives in order to provide an overview of the data. Each author independently read the narratives, paying particular attention to the characteristics of the narratives to inductively generate a coding scheme describing the conversational role of the colloquial question. This stage enabled comparison across the narratives, which varied widely in the level of specificity and narrative style. The coding scheme that emerged from this process was organized around three distinct questions:</p>

<p>After developing this scheme, we independently coded each of the 110 narratives. Disagreements in coding were then addressed collaboratively. Next, we randomly selected 25 narratives (23% of the corpus) to be coded by two trained, independent coders to assess the reliability of the coding scheme. A Cohen’s kappa test indicated substantial agreement, both between the independent coders (.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005) and between each coder and the researchers (.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005; .74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005), enabling us to characterize the general nature of the narratives reliably.</p>
<p>We then engaged in a second stage of coding, conducting a thematic analysis in order to develop more nuanced understandings of the meanings of work and education in students’ responses. This stage enabled us to develop the inductive analysis that is the focus of this article. Each author individually engaged in several iterative readings of the corpus while conducting open coding to begin to “identify, elaborate, and refine analytic insights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912443776">Emerson, Fretz, &amp; Shaw, 1995</xref>) from the narratives. We then discussed the results of this open coding, synthesizing the data into three meaningful themes: the conversational functions of the question, assumptions about what constituted an acceptable response, and student acceptance/rejection of the fundamental premises of the question. With these themes established, we returned to the data, individually and then collaboratively, for another set of readings where we engaged in focused coding in order to “[connect] data that initially may not have appeared to go together and . . . [delineate] subthemes and subtopics that distinguish differences and variations within the broader topic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912443776">Emerson et al., 1995</xref>, p. 160).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss our analysis of the corpus of student narratives in light of our central research questions by first explaining the conversational functions of the colloquial question and then exploring how work, education, and their relationship are inflected with dominant and alternative meanings, depending on how students seek either to answer appropriately or resist the question, respectively. Before doing so, however, we highlight two important characteristics of the corpus informing our analysis: widespread recognition by students of both the <italic>ubiquitous</italic> and the <italic>emotionally charged</italic> nature of the colloquial question.</p>
<p>The question is clearly experienced as ubiquitous. All students were familiar with the question, and only one student reported not having asked or been asked, relating instead how her friend—a communication major—is frequently challenged by the question. In addition, students referred to a wide variety of relationships between the persons asking and answering the question (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0893318912443776">Table 2</xref>). Although the most commonly identified questioners were family members (18%) and peers (12%), in 17% of the narratives the student referred to the question being asked by multiple individuals across categories despite instructions to narrate one particular encounter with the question. Similarly, 40% of the students discussed their experience with the question in more abstract terms rather than describing a particular encounter. One student, a freshman business major, highlighted the ubiquitous nature of the question as he resisted our request for a specific narrative: “To me, the importance and relevance of this question has not been based on any individual occasion of it being asked, but in the repetition and constancy with which it is asked.” In short, the colloquial question occupies a pervasive presence in conversations about higher education.</p>
<p>Second, the narratives demonstrate the emotionally charged nature of the question as well. Many respondents (41%) indicated a negative emotional response to the question, demonstrating the significant anxiety surrounding it. As one student explained, “I just don’t know at this point, so the question makes me very uncomfortable! I like to think I’m a driven person with goals and drive, but it makes me feel unfocused and unorganized.” Students frequently described their uncertainty as making them scared; for example, one student reported “having a mini heart attack” every time she is asked. Only 18% indicated positive responses to the question, typified by the math major who wrote, “I personally like being asked this question because it lets me tell people what I am going to do and I am proud of that.” The remaining students (41%) offered no direct indication of an emotional response. Significantly, however, many of these students framed their positive or neutral reactions to the question as “not negative” rather than positive or neutral in their own right. Several students, for instance, noted that the question “doesn’t really bother” them, while another noted, “I was not offended when asked this question.” Such responses indicate that students interpreted our prompt to reflect about how they feel about the question as anticipating a negative response, suggesting that students readily recognized the highly charged nature of the question. These two broad characteristics—the ubiquitous and emotionally charged nature of the question—serve as an important backdrop against which to understand the following discussion of the question’s conversational functions, as well as how student attempts either to answer appropriately or resist the question highlight its implicit meanings about work and education.</p>
<sec id="section5-0893318912443776">
<title>Three Functions of the Question</title>
<p>Our first research question asked how the colloquial question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” functions in everyday conversation. Student descriptions demonstrate three main functions of the question. First, the question fills out everyday <italic>conversation</italic> as a form of small talk. Second, the question serves as an <italic>exploration</italic> device for students seeking knowledge about themselves and others. Finally, the question expresses <italic>judgment</italic> of choices made about the relationship between work and education. These functions are distinct but related, and often invocations of the colloquial question perform the three functions simultaneously.</p>
<sec id="section6-0893318912443776">
<title>Conversation</title>
<p>Students reported encountering the colloquial question in a variety of conversational settings, from formal conversations with academic professionals in secondary and higher education institutions to informal conversations at family events, college parties, and workplaces. One student reported being asked by her grandparents while sitting on their patio. Another described how he and a female classmate used the question to flirt at a party. Others reported the colloquialism in social media conversations with friends or being asked at their workplaces by clients who were strangers. In short, students encountered the question in a wide range of contexts where the topic of conversation turned to what course of study they were pursuing.</p>
<p>A significant number of students—approximately one fifth—described the question as being used to break the ice or make small talk, in the sense that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912443776">Coupland (2003)</xref> identified as being understood—often pejoratively—in academic and popular circles alike as “a formulaic and superficial form of talk” (p. 1). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912443776">Coupland (2003)</xref> notes, however, such small talk should not be dismissed as inconsequential banter because it performs important social functions like relationship building and filling conversational gaps. In other words, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912443776">Coupland (2000)</xref> observes, small talk plays an important role in organizing conversations around “multiple interactional goals that go well beyond . . . the transmission and reception of factual information” (p. 8).</p>
<p>Student narratives indicate that they view the question as taken-for-granted conversational commonplace. One student described the colloquialism as a “common part of college small-talk, especially in the first few weeks of school or just meeting someone. You ask them their name, where they’re from, what they’re studying, and then of course—what are you going to do with that major?” Another described it as “generally one of the first questions people ask you, when first meeting them.” Underneath such descriptions is an assumption that the question is a natural, even inevitable, part of conversations about higher education. One student described the question as “perfectly normal,” perhaps interpreting our request for narratives as somehow marking it as a questionable practice. Another student captured the seemingly inevitable conversational logic of the question: “I guess they asked because that’s usually what people ask after ‘What’s your major?’” Each of these instances highlights the largely <italic>phatic</italic> role of the colloquialism as a conversational device. Students also noted the relationship between the conversational function and the <italic>exploration</italic> and <italic>judgment</italic> functions described as follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0893318912443776">
<title>Exploration</title>
<p>The question enabled exploration through the students seeking knowledge of themselves and others. First, some students said that the question provided them with an opportunity for broader self-reflection. A freshman majoring in finance said that it gave him an opportunity to “assess my life”; another student described it as helpful for “thinking about your future.” Several responses in this category referred to college professors asking the question, causing the student to consider seriously the question for the first time. While some reported that the question encouraged such general self-assessments, most students describing the self-exploration function of the question focused on how it helped them to explore specific career options. Some saw the question as helping them figure out their own answer to the question by exploring other students’ plans to use their majors. A sophomore with a general business major wrote, “I ask people all the time what they plan on doing with their major, mostly because I am searching for ideas on what to do with mine.” A freshman double-majoring in political science and international studies described a helpful encounter at her workplace in which a customer asked her what she wanted to do with her major. After she answered that she wanted to be an ambassador, the customer encouraged her to expand her options: “The reason why this is so memorable to me is because he was trying to explain to me what this major could lead me to like law school. Now I am thinking about law school.” A freshman majoring in real estate and construction management expressed his surprise at being asked the question on his first day of college because he had always assumed that the answer was self-explanatory. The student discussed how being asked opened his eyes to a variety of options for using his major.</p>
<p>The second way the question enables exploration is by helping students get to know others. One student explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>These discussions happened mostly during the first couple of weeks here as people were getting to know each other and get a better sense of who people were. . . . In a sense, a major is the focus of a person’s life and dictates who they are and what path they will follow in the future. (freshman, business administration)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many students indicated that the question was helpful in trying to understand and connect with others, grounded in the assumption that major and career plans are central to identity. As one student put it, “A major leads to a profession and certain professions speak of what a person is about and what their life could look like in the future.” Another described it as “like putting labels on people.” Here, the presumption was that major choice and future profession projects a sense of one’s identity. Thus, the colloquialism constructs one’s future work and one’s identity as closely tied. Student responses indicate that their encounters with this question caused them to reflect upon—and in many cases challenged—their future plans and their sense of self. In this way, the question and responses participate in the process of identity construction. As one reviewer of this article noted, while the students reported that the question functioned to help them explore their options, the ways they described their encounters indicated that it more often functioned to build identification with particular options. As we will discuss further in the conclusion, the question encouraged identity foreclosure by pushing students who were unsure of their answer to identify with a particular answer without fully exploring the options available to them. This tendency is likely because the exploration function of the question is most often eclipsed by the judgment function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0893318912443776">
<title>Judgment</title>
<p>Many students indicated feeling judged when asked the question, often mentioning that the act of asking, in-and-of-itself, conveyed judgment of major choice. As a senior finance major wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>There are certain majors that people feel are less credible for different reasons. People who have different backgrounds often downplay other people’s majors. For example a person who is in business may ask that question to a person who has say a psychology major with a negative connotation. . . . People can ask that question very respectfully; they can also insult people. (senior, finance)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to feeling judged by simply being asked the question, students also felt judged by reactions to their answers. An undeclared freshman wrote, “I often feel as though I am looked down upon for not knowing what I am going to do with my life.” A senior majoring in hotel, restaurant, and tourism management described a moment when one person responded to him, “You shouldn’t go to an expensive school for hotel, restaurant, and tourism management like that.” As such responses demonstrate, students often received unsolicited advice in such conversations.</p>
<p>Students responded negatively to the question primarily because they believed that both the asking of the question and the reactions their answers received delegitimized their choices and conveyed judgment. Students demonstrated that they had a clear sense that beyond simply having an answer to the question, their answer should be perceived as acceptable. Student descriptions of their encounters indicate that some answers were better than others and that they felt strong pressure to answer in a way that fit others’ expectations for the appropriate response. Because the colloquialism functioned to express judgment, it accomplished identity regulation, calling into question students’ identities and prompting them to engage in identity work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912443776">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Students often mentioned feeling judged even when the question was asked as a part of small talk. Such feelings were particularly tied to encounters with strangers but were also apparent elsewhere. A finance major described an interchange with a family friend:
<disp-quote>
<p>The conversation was awkward, fake, and drawn out. While most of these people do not really care about what I am going to do with my life, they still expect a high [school] graduate to know their major and in some ways know what they are going to do with that particular major.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the claim that the question often occurs during trivial conversation, the overwhelming conclusion by students who had negative reactions to the question is that their answers were anything but trivial. That is, students readily recognized their ability to answer the question—even when it functioned as small talk—as high-stakes and anxiety-producing, particularly given their clear awareness that some answers were seen as more acceptable than others. Whether the questioner intended judgment is irrelevant; what is significant is that the students felt that critique was embedded within the question. Even in small talk, the colloquial question powerfully shaped student senses of self and meanings of work and education.</p>

<sec id="section9-0893318912443776">
<title>Dominant Interpretations of Work and Education: The Appropriate Answer</title>
<p>Our second research question asks what student responses to the question reveal about dominant and alternative meanings of the work–education relationship. Students fell into two broad categories based on their response to the question. The first category included students who accepted the question and the associated dominant interpretations of the work–education relationship; the second consisted of those who resisted, constructing alternative interpretations of the meaning of that relationship. The majority of students fell into the first category, with many describing how they worked hard to provide appropriate answers. In this section, we will explore the elements of the appropriate answer more closely in order to understand what it tells us about dominant interpretations of the meanings of work and education.</p>
<p>Many students who indicated anticipating the reactions of others discussed framing their answers to mitigate negative reactions. An undeclared potential English major made this clear, noting “I quickly learned to formulate what I thought was the ‘proper’ answer.” Students often reported fabricating appropriate plans when they had none—such as a student who reported coming up with a plan on the spot to impress his girlfriend’s parents. Others sought to obscure their “unacceptable” actual plans, like the senior international studies major who wanted to work in international human rights but changed her answer when bartending: “I usually tell customers that I want to work for the government or be an ambassador so they will leave me alone.” Another student described in detail how he would tell his parents and friends how his psychology degree would benefit his future career in business because psychology is “the foundation of everything.” Despite this typical answer, however, the student commented: “Actually, I want to be a psychologist.” Students who reported engaging in deceit, regardless of the form, described their actions as motivated by seeking approval or avoiding reproach. That is, students either actively sought to impress their questioner or, at least, to avoid being judged by them. Considering what students described as the appropriate answer— demonstrating that the student had a sensible plan that promised the student’s future success—provides insight into the dominant meanings of work and education associated with the colloquialism.</p>
<sec id="section10-0893318912443776">
<title>Appropriate answers demonstrate a sensible plan</title>
<p>Answers were expected to indicate a sensible plan expressing a direct connection between major content and long-term (paid) work plans. As one psychology major put it,
<disp-quote>
<p>I was somewhat interested in philosophy, but my dad said that philosophy majors didn’t have as many job opportunities and that, “You’ll be asking ‘Do you want fries with that” if I were to choose it. . . . My parents didn’t like the idea of [psychology] either because it was something I would have to get a graduate degree in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Answers not directly related to paid work were deemed unacceptable (and almost entirely absent), as were answers indicating an indirect work–major relationship. One student observed that choosing a major first was “backwards”: “It is important for me to decide what field I want to venture into in before deciding what major I want. I needed to choose a major that would taxi me to the career I am looking at.” This response typifies a common view of education as tightly coupled with future work opportunities, where major choice locks students into a particular trajectory. A sophomore English major said that people find his plans of using his major in the Peace Corps to be “unfulfilling because I don’t have a larger career goal in mind.” As one student wrote, “When thinking about what you are going to do with your major it is important to think about what you are going to do with the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>A sensible plan must also be perceived as realistic, requiring students to walk a fine line, articulating specific goals that were not too precise. Too specific answers were deemed unrealistic. Responses that seemed to fit this middle ground included working for a pharmaceutical company or going to medical or law school. To be perceived as realistic, one’s plan should also be ambitious yet attainable. As a sophomore business major hoping to start his own business explained, “Many people think of my goal as ‘too lofty’ and unattainable, and I am always self-conscious of their judgments.” Similarly, a creative writing major hoping to write fiction or poetry refused to tell new acquaintances her plan because of negative responses, due not only to the ambitious nature of her plans—which made them insensible—but also because of the perception that writers struggle financially, violating expectations for student success. This expectation comprises the second criterion determining appropriate answers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0893318912443776">
<title>Appropriate answers promise future success</title>
<p>Students recognized that as they answered the question, others were judging them in terms of their potential to succeed—narrowly interpreted as financial success. One student described angst about selecting a major that would “provide me with a lucrative career,” noting, “Money is a big part of choosing a major.” An English major remarked that people often incorrectly assumed that she planned to teach “because they can’t comprehend what else someone could do with such a major and actually make any sort of stable money with it.” Another student described telling her father she would go to law school: “I answered this way because truly I felt he was really asking me ‘how are you going to make the most money with this major?’” Demonstrating one’s potential to succeed by getting a job and making money was key in crafting an acceptable response. Students primarily understood good work as that which provided economic rewards.</p>
<p>Student responses indicated that appropriate answers demonstrated that majors would not provide sufficient but <italic>substantial</italic> income, though this threshold was never discussed in concrete detail. This ambiguity led to a presumption that more was better. In this way, students’ future job plans were generally not informed by reflection about what constituted a decent living, what kind of quality of life students desired, or what “enough” might be. Instead, appropriate answers describing jobs that might lead to a merely sufficient income were seen as illegitimate, reducing the range of acceptable job possibilities to a narrow-yet-unspecified window of careers associated with “high-paying” future incomes.</p>
<p>This pressure to pursue high-paying careers was evident in student discussion of the need to be “practical” in their plans, which was often placed in tension with following their passion. Students wrestled with this tension in different ways, with most ultimately privileging practicality. One wrote, “Many students are majoring in areas where there are more realistic job opportunities, not necessarily where their passion lies.” A minority concluded that they should follow their passion, trusting that things would work out. For example, an undeclared student wrote, “I know that whatever I major in, I will still do what I love.” A third way of navigating this tension was through practical choices affording space for passion. For example, an art major decided to pursue a career in advertising or design because they were “real world jobs that could lessen the chance for me to be a ‘starving artist’.” She described seeking to account for both what she was capable of and “what the real world wants from me.” But whether students complied with or rejected the expectation for a practical answer, students readily recognized the overwhelming pressure to be practical in their choices. This recognition indicates that students understood the meaning of work—and subsequently, education—first and foremost in economic terms. To be perceived as acceptable, student answers needed to demonstrate a sensible plan that promised future success by looking to the long term, making close major–work connections and appearing realistic. These answers demonstrated the dominant interpretation of the work–education relationship as tightly coupled with major selection, leading individuals directly and more or less permanently into particular types of work.</p>
<p>Such a connection is not surprising, given the current economic situation, but it is worth noting that only two students mentioned their education in relationship to the contemporary economic crisis. One business student described having been asked the question by a client at his workplace:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is a very tough question for me to answer because I am unsure about using my major for anything corporate related because of all the obvious inner turmoil with corporate business. Also, I have lost very much faith in the ethics of capitalism in the U.S. Being asked such a question sometimes makes me uncomfortable because I am not proud of the social reputation my major of choice has earned.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An international business major reported being asked the question “somewhat sarcastically” by his uncle. This student dismissed what he perceived as the implicit challenge in his uncle’s question as stemming from the uncle’s “misconception that business opportunities no longer exist.” While these students offered different takes on the prospects of the business major in the economic crisis, what is particularly noteworthy is that they were the only students to acknowledge the influence of the crisis. We suspect that this is likely because the current economic situation has simply heightened the perceived urgency of the question rather than fundamentally altered dominant meanings of work and education.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section12-0893318912443776">
<title>Alternative Interpretations of Work and Education: Resisting the Question</title>
<p>While the overwhelming majority of students appeared to accept the question at face value, about 10% described resisting in some form. This relatively small number speaks volumes about the force the question exerts as taken-for-granted conversational commonplace. Moments of student resistance also cast light on possible alternative interpretations of the work–education relationship. In this section, we describe two forms of student resistance: refusal to engage and rejecting the premise of the question.</p>
<sec id="section13-0893318912443776">
<title>Refusing to engage</title>
<p>One way students resisted the question was by refusing to engage the situation. One student, for instance, said that he was willing to discuss the question with peers as a part of information-seeking small talk, but refused to tell adults his major in order to avoid the conversation. Several students described having rote answers to the question—ways, as one student described it, to “just answer the question to answer it” rather than to engage in meaningful conversation. Others reported leaving situations when they felt judged for their answer, and some admitted to ignoring the question when asked, such as the English major who reported, “I generally ignore this when new acquaintances ask me this question because it annoys me how often I receive an eye roll or a scoff in response.” Student refusal to engage the question can be understood as similar to the resistance strategy of organizational exit. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318912443776">Lutgen-Sandvik (2006)</xref> notes, the exit of the marginalized simply perpetuates the dominant system. While this resistance strategy provided students a way to push back, it does not reflexively challenge the meanings of work and education embedded in the question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0893318912443776">
<title>Rejecting the premise of the question</title>
<p>A second, more powerful strategy for resisting the question was to reject its fundamental premises and assert alternative interpretations of the work–education relationship. While most of the students implicitly consented to the pressure to map out their career plans and connect them closely to their major, several students expressly rejected this approach to major selection in particular and university education in general. Students rejected three relatively distinct premises of the dominant view: that one’s college major and future career are tightly coupled, putting the future of students without clear career plans in jeopardy; that students should expect to work in one career during their working lives; and that higher education should be primarily oriented toward career preparation.</p>
<p>First, students questioned the assumed tight coupling of major and future career and the requirement of that coupling for future success. One student, for instance, took issue with the presumed permanence of the education–work relationship, noting that “there are . . . so many unpredictable factors that finding the ‘perfect’ major to find ‘perfect’ job placements seems silly at this point in my life.” Another wrote, “I believe this reflects the societally accepted notion that all young people must choose a career then work towards an ultimate goal. It seems as though this is all that many people are concerned with.” An undeclared freshman rejected the idea that her future career is in peril because of her uncertainty:
<disp-quote>
<p>Even though I may not have a major, I do in fact have many interests and ideas of what I could major in. My interests include studying art, studio art, photography, environmental science/issues, and traveling. These are my passions. I am not too worried because I know that whatever I major in I will still do what I love.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While most students at least tacitly accepted the dominant assumptions about work and education embedded in the question, this small group of students preferred an alternative framing of the work–education relationship. They rejected the idea that college majors and careers were tightly coupled and the implication that they should decide now what work they would pursue throughout their lives. Instead, they saw their education as equipping them for a variety of careers and believed that decisions about work were not final.</p>
<p>Second, students rejected the question’s assumptions about the job market. One student wrote, “The work world is changing so we shouldn’t plan on one job.” Similarly, another wrote, “The business world is much too vast and continuously expanding for students with business majors to define their plans based solely on their major.” These students untangle the relationship between particular majors and jobs, preferring preparation for a wide variety of future jobs. As one student put it, “We have the chance to live and experience so much in this world, and go through a variety of work. I don’t want to follow a certain path of what my major will do for me, and work only in one area or one company. That is not the purpose of my pursuit in education and skills.” These students preferred an interpretation of education as equipping them to follow a variety of paths throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Finally, some students rejected the premise that higher education is primarily related to paid work, constructing alternative interpretations of higher education as connected to various aspects of life. One student’s suggestion to reframe the question as “What are you studying and do you love it?” demonstrates resistance to the dominant view of the relationship between higher education and work and reframes higher education as creating a variety of possible directions for students’ futures. These alternative interpretations of the work–education relationship helped relieve the pressure around major selection by emphasizing students’ potential to use education creatively to succeed over their long-term working lives. Such moments of resistance, while rare, demonstrate that students were not simply passively engaging the colloquialism but rather reflexively questioning its legitimation of particular meanings of work and education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As the results above demonstrate, the question, “What are you going to do with that major,” exerts considerable influence over how students (and others) interpret meanings of work, education, and their intersection. Our analysis suggests that the colloquialism functions through its ubiquitous presence in the lives of college students, who expect to encounter the question as a part of normal conversation. Students indicate a pervasive sense of anxiety surrounding the question; even in seemingly casual conversations, students feel judgment waiting for them if they fail to provide an appropriate answer. While the question certainly has its positive functions—spurring students to engage in useful reflection about the relationship between their major and their future working lives—our analysis demonstrates that the question is imbued with assumptions about the relationship between work and education that are problematic for reasons discussed as follows. Even when these assumptions are not intentionally invoked or are outright rejected, their attachment to the question is recognized and understood.</p>
<sec id="section16-0893318912443776">
<title>The Colloquial Question and the Meaning of Work</title>
<p>The question implicitly invokes particular meanings of work warranting critical attention. First, the potential for judgment highlights how the question elevates particular types of work by perpetuating narrow interpretations of what constitutes good work. High-paying, high-status work is privileged. Not surprisingly, students who felt that their major was preparing them for such work—particularly in business and engineering—were most likely to express comfort, while the question generated the most anxiety for students (mostly in the Liberal Arts) less sure of their major’s connection to work. Such views are predictable responses to the reality of the job market students see waiting for them upon graduation. For jobs requiring a college degree, graduates in education (71.1%), engineering (69.4%), and math and computer science (68.5%) exceeded the average national employment rate of 55.6% (the precise rate of employment for business graduates), while graduates in communication (51.1%) and the humanities (45.4%) lagged behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318912443776">Rampell, 2011</xref>). Rampell also reports that those majors followed a nearly identical pattern of distribution around the national median income of US$26,756 for graduates employed in jobs requiring a college degree. Responding to these economic realities, then, the colloquial force of the question functions much like the expression “a real job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912443776">Clair, 1996</xref>), loaded with implicit assumptions about what kind of work (i.e., requiring an education, offering substantial pay) is most acceptable for students to pursue.</p>
<p>A second manner in which the question appears to shape the meaning of work for students is by implicitly perpetuating a view of work grounded in the linear career model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912443776">Buzzanell &amp; Goldzwig, 1991</xref>) that does not accurately represent the working world students are likely to face. As mentioned, responses demonstrated that students primarily see major selection as tightly coupled with future work, indicating anxiety over the perception that decisions made in the present box them in, determining their future careers. In short, the majority of students indicated a direct and permanent relationship between college major and postcollege work. However, these assumptions do not align with the realities of the global economy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912443776">Buzzanell (2000)</xref> notes, the current social contract between employers and employees has shifted such that neither expects the relationship to be long term. Instead, individuals can expect to work in a variety of companies over the course of their working lives and, likely, work in a variety of different professions. The permanent view of career that is perpetuated through the colloquial question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” conflicts with what students are likely to experience postcollege, hindering students from approaching higher education in a way that will equip them better for the long term.</p>

<title>The Colloquial Question and the Meaning of Education</title>
<p>Our analysis suggests that the colloquial question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” plays an important role in cementing vocational meanings of higher education. “Doing” appears to be taken as synonymous with “working,” suggesting that the question enables discursive closure around the meaning of higher education, squeezing out possibilities for conceiving of purposes for education beyond the occupational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912443776">Deetz, 1992</xref>). Significantly, out of the 110 students responding to the survey, only one reported a nonvocational dimension to her plans, explaining to her boss how her major will
<disp-quote>
<p>help me with everyday conversation throughout the rest of my life. Being an international studies major, I explained that I will develop a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of global issues. I explained how, as a result, I would be able to have significant conversations about such issues with people throughout my life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, intelligent and informed conversation is framed as something that this student will be able to “do” with her major that is not directly tied to work—although the student did first mention how she hoped her major would position her for a career in the intelligence community. Beyond this singular example, however, no students expressed a potential for their major to enable them to “do” anything nonvocational. While equipping students to contribute vocationally is an important function of higher education, our findings demonstrate how vocational goals have replaced other goals as the focus of higher education, such as cultivating citizen-subjects or helping students to wrestle with questions of how to live a meaningful life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912443776">Deetz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912443776">Watkins, 2008</xref>). In our study, students viewed education as an instrumental means without indicating a sense that learning could be an enriching end in itself or that a college education would enhance other roles that they might play in society, such as citizen, parent, partner, volunteer, or community member.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the question—and surrounding conversations—perpetuates a very narrow view of vocational preparation. Students saw majors as providing vocational preparation if they were oriented around clearly identifiable skills that would directly apply to one’s future job. Majors—such as those in the liberal arts—providing students with more nebulous skills such as critical thinking and problem solving that could be applied in a variety of ways to future work were seen as less valid preparation for work. Students majoring in such subjects were expected to justify their major choice by connecting the dots for the questioner. The question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” constructs the purpose of education very narrowly in terms of directly translatable occupational skills.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>The considerable influence of the question reinforces the need for the intersection of work and higher education to occupy a prominent place for organizational communication scholars interested in exploring the meaning of work. While there has been a long disciplinary history of interest in education writ large as a socialization microsystem, this study demonstrates that colleges and universities serve as a crucial site in which meanings of work and education are negotiated. As higher education is seen in increasingly vocational terms, it becomes a progressively more important space where assumptions about what constitutes good work are being constructed, maintained, and, potentially, transformed, with long-ranging implications for students’ future lives—at work and beyond.</p>
<p>Our research demonstrates that the colloquial question functions as a form of identity regulation, calling into question students’ identities and prompting them to engage in identity work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912443776">Alvesson &amp; Willmott, 2002</xref>). We see this specifically in the ways that students perceive the question and others’ responses to their answers as indicating judgment. In their discussions of what the appropriate response was and how they worked to provide it, we see that students’ identity work was guided by a particular view of the ideal self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318912443776">Wieland, 2010</xref>). Having a response that fit this ideal reassured students that their identity was socially acceptable; failing to genuinely have such a response caused them severe anxiety.</p>
<p>This study also indicates that conversations in higher educational contexts around major selection encourage students to conceive of their identities quite narrowly, equating self with work. Given the close connection between identity and work, it is not surprising that students felt great pressure to have a solid response to the question. The relative permanence suggested by the question’s implicit invocation of a linear career model appears to pressure students to enter what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912443776">Arnett (2004)</xref> has described as identity foreclosure—a state in which they have not explored, yet have committed to, an identity. Students’ discussions of their encounters with the question, “What are you going to do with that major?,” indicate that the question exerts tremendous force in encouraging commitment to a work identity without full exploration. This force is especially problematic in an era in which they are unlikely to have linear careers.</p>
<p>While this study suggests that identity construction processes are stimulated by conversations around major selection, the nature of our data prevents us from fully exploring how students engage in the intricate process of identity construction. Future research should use in-depth methods such as qualitative interviewing to explore how the question prompts identity construction. Focusing on identity would better equip researchers to consider the intersections between everyday discourse and macro-discursive trends related to education and work. In-depth interviews would provide a deeper understanding of how the socioeconomic context shapes students’ identities related to work and education, providing insight, for example, into the implications of the current economic recession for meanings of education and work.</p>
<p>The implications of this current research are inevitably constrained by several key limitations. First, because the study focuses on traditional-age college students, it overlooks the experience of those returning to higher education institutions later in life, often to pursue new careers. Future research could productively explore these students’ encounters with the question in order to gain insight into how they make sense of education and work while living a nonlinear career model. Second, because the colloquial question at hand deals with students’ <italic>majors</italic>, this analysis necessarily sets aside student perceptions of the meaning and purpose of <italic>general education</italic>, suggesting another focus for future research. Third, the type and location of the institution that participants attended likely influenced the particular meanings attached to the colloquial question, given its location as a private institution in the U.S. academy, as notions of appropriate work are likely to be significantly different for students attending institutions serving different populations. Finally, a question not addressed by this study is how do higher education institutions seek more directly to shape students’ understanding of the relationship between work and education? Future, related research could more directly tackle this socialization process as it occurs through communication with students about the meaning of work and education <italic>by</italic> higher education organizations.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study suggests several important implications. Taken together, the pressure that students feel from the question to foreclose prematurely on their work identities (combined with a nagging sense of permanence attached to such decisions) and the seeming prevalence of the question outside of educational contexts suggests the importance for college and university educators to provide meaningful opportunities for students to understand, and reflect on, the relationship between their education and their future work lives. In an era when we repeatedly (and accurately) tell our students that they can expect to have multiple careers and many more jobs, it would seem imperative that we help our students think through the role that their education will play over the course of their professional, personal, and public lives, particularly in the face of everyday talk that encourages them to make early, and seemingly permanent, decisions about what to study and what to “do with their lives” as a result. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912443776">Ashcraft and Allen (2009)</xref> argue, organizational communication scholars are especially equipped to work with students “not only to critique and transform educational practices, but also to discover how the vocabularies they use and the ways they communicate influence their ability to do so” (p. 25). We suggest it is especially important to extend critical conversations about the meaning of work and education beyond the classroom to formal and informal advising and mentoring roles. As our analysis shows, students would benefit from conversations that help them confront sedimented meanings of work and education. Given that work is so central to their lives and well-being and that models of work are changing in a way that our everyday language may not yet reflect, organizational communication scholars have an opportunity to help students imagine alternative ways of constructing higher education, paid work, and the relationship between education and work.</p>
