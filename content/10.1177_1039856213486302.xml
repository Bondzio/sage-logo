<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The objective of this paper is to report on the development and implementation of a community-based perinatal and infant mental health day program for mothers with psychiatric illness. The program was initiated through interagency collaboration between adult mental health, infant mental health and community child health services in Queensland, Australia in response to calls for an integrated approach that could be delivered state-wide if successful. Preliminary results of the program’s evaluation are provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213486302">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>A pre-post survey design was used to assess the influence the program had on maternal mental and emotional well-being and the maternal-infant relationship. Twenty-one women receiving treatment for perinatal mental illness gave consent to attend the 6-week day program integrating three currently separate and discrete services: adult mental health, infant mental health and community child health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856213486302">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Clinically and statistically significant improvements were observed for maternal mental health, and parent-infant relationships following the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213486302">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>These findings support interagency collaboration between adult mental health, infant mental health and community child health services to deliver services to women with mental illness with newborns and their families. The utility of using a collaborative approach in a community setting endorses more comprehensive and longer-term evaluation of effectiveness and cost benefit.</p>

<p>Several decades of research has helped our understanding of the way in which early interactions and response to infant cues assist development of secure attachment relationships to key care providers in the early months of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486302">1</xref></sup> These relationships are critical to early brain development and infant mental health in the first 3 years of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486302">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486302">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately, mothers’ and, as more recently understood, fathers’, vulnerability to mental illness increases in the perinatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486302">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486302">5</xref></sup> Perinatal mental health conditions including depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder and schizophrenic illness can result in significant impairment of sensitive and responsive parenting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486302">6</xref></sup> Consequently, mental health services are interested in providing programs to ameliorate the effect that maternal mental illness can have on cognitive, emotional and behavioural functioning and parenting ability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486302">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486302"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486302">9</xref></sup> as well as infant mental health.</p>
<p>Unless maternal health, mental health and child health services are well integrated, women with mental illness necessarily engage with these services in isolation. Improving mental health service delivery in the perinatal period depends in part on improved collaboration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486302">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486302"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486302">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>For this study, a group of senior health professionals from three health services in Queensland, Australia recognised the need for interagency collaboration. Women with newborns had been refused admission to a residential Early Parenting Centre if severity of impairment could impede their ability to process and take on parenting information. Unfortunately, many of these women also did not meet the acuity criteria for admission to an adult mental health service.</p>
<p>In response, a brief community-based mental health day program for women with mental illness and their babies was developed. The initial aim was to establish whether interagency collaboration increased the capacity of diverse health services to provide early intervention and treatment to these women and their babies by sharing knowledge, expertise and resources.</p>

<title>Program description</title>
<p>The aim of the program was to provide treatment and early intervention to improve maternal mental health and emotional well-being, and optimise parent-infant relationships. Clinicians from adult mental health, infant mental health and community child health services delivered the interventions. The first author (JvH) was appointed program coordinator.</p>
<p>Participants attended between 10am and 3pm for one day a week for 6 weeks. Group-based and individualised psycho-education and therapeutic interventions were provided. An open group format allowed for prompt entry into the program following referral and intake. Group sessions provided the opportunity to reflect on feelings and share experiences in a supportive environment followed by a structured group discussion and provision of an education program. Session topics included: a) adjusting to parenthood, b) managing depression, stress and anxiety, c) communication skills, problem solving, d) bonding, attachment, factors that impact the parent-infant relationship and e) sleep/settling, massage, play, safety and nutrition. Individual sessions were offered to give focus to maternal mental health, child health and infant mental health. A family systems approach was employed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486302">11</xref></sup> and fathers were invited to an evening parenting/fathering session where information and support was provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213486302">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Mothers and their babies were recruited through existing referral pathways to adult mental health, infant mental health and community child health services from general practitioners and community-based non-government agencies. Between June and October 2009, 29 women were referred. Following a full mental health assessment, 21 eligible women were accepted to the program and gave consent to participate in the study. The inclusion criterion was: mothers with a mental illness giving primary care to an infant aged 6 months or younger. Mothers with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder, substance use disorder, intellectual disability or who could not speak or understand English were excluded from participation. Participants were women with a diagnosis of depression (12 women) or anxiety (two women) and anxiety and depression (four women) arising in the perinatal period, bipolar affective disorder (two women) and schizo-affective disorder (one woman). Women’s ages ranged from 18 to 41 years of age, with 40% between 30 and 34 years of age. Baby’s ages ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months at intake.</p>

<sec id="section8-1039856213486302">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethics approval was gained from each of the Human Research Ethics Committees, the former Royal Children’s Hospital and Health Service District, Prince Charles Hospital and Health Service District and the Royal Brisbane Women’s Hospital and Health Service District as well as the Queensland University Technology HREC. Participation in the program was voluntary and participants were made aware that they could withdraw from the program or its evaluation without penalty. Participants were assured that they could continue to attend the program even if they withdrew from the study.</p>

One mother said, “<italic>the combination of child health, infant mental health and adult mental health worked really well, my confidence has improved in all areas</italic>” and “<italic>I make more of an effort to play with and delight in my baby</italic>”. Mothers also highlighted how the program had impacted on their mood, “<italic>it helped to know that others also feel unsure and that parenting skills are learned. I am more able to relax and not be as anxious about my choices for my child</italic>” and “<italic>I now better understand my feelings, what triggers my low moods and how I can manage my feelings</italic>”.</p>

<title>Clinician feedback</title>
<p>Clinicians and referring agencies were interviewed at the conclusion of the program to evaluate the program more thoroughly. Twelve clinicians provided feedback.</p>
<p>Professional networks appeared to be strengthened. In particular, clinicians indicated that they developed a deeper appreciation of each other’s roles working with mothers and infants. For example the parlance of infant mental health practitioners was observed to be able to change the focus for mothers, enabling them to see from the infant’s perspective. Another unexpected result was that participating clinicians returned to their workplaces and shared such knowledge and experience with colleagues. Clinicians claimed it “<italic>was a positive experience</italic>”. They recommended the program could be improved with better sequencing and scaffolding of interventions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The collaborative effort of the services involved in the development and implementation of the pilot program addressed a significant gap in service delivery for mothers with psychiatric illness and their infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486302">12</xref></sup> This evaluation has shown promise in relation to significant improvements in maternal mental health and parent-infant relationships.</p>
<p>Taken together, the interventions contributed to positive outcomes for participating mothers and their families through significant improvement in mental health and emotional well-being, enabling mothers to respond appropriately to infant cues for love and attention. Integration of the participating health services allowed greater networking for clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486302">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>These preliminary results are promising and support findings reported in previous issues of this journal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486302">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486302">14</xref></sup> The ability to attract such a vulnerable group of new mothers into a regular day-program and deliver a collaborative program from three discrete services is now established. But it is acknowledged that the small sample size (<italic>N</italic>=21) did preclude more extensive analysis that might confirm the overall success of this approach. The study design would be strengthened by using a comparison group. Clinically significant change at the individual level was not measured and there is the possibility that the sample was comprised of particularly resilient women given their willingness to participate in the trial. Group level improvements may have been influenced by the result of extraneous variables such as facilitator attributes or medical interventions such as medication. Outcomes in relation to longer term benefits and cost-effectiveness need to be evaluated in future research. Additionally, the impact on service utilisation must be considered.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Improvements in maternal emotional and mental health and maternal responsivity to infants can be achieved through interagency collaboration. Cohesive case management, shared resources, increased networking and increased knowledge and capacity regarding perinatal and infant mental health had a positive impact. Data analyses and feedback from clients and clinicians alike support this assertion. Importantly, further research and evaluation is required to determine the cost effectiveness of an integrated approach to perinatal mental health, infant mental health and child health service delivery.</p>
