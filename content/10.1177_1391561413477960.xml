<p>In a more simple term, a self-help group (SHG) is a village-based financial intermediary usually composed of 10 to 20 local women. In this set-up, members make small regular savings over a few months until there is enough capital in the group to begin lending. Funds may then be lent back to the members or to others in the village for any purpose. In India, many self-help groups (SHGs) are linked to banks for the delivery of microcredit for their betterment.</p>
<p>Given to the development of the social mobilization and women empowerment, the present book undertakes a critical assessment of the growth of SGH movement in the country over the last two decades, the role and experiences of different actors and the various challenges faced by them, along with a study of the enabling factors and constraints to SHG development in the country.</p>
<p>The book broadly consists of nine detailed and comprehensive chapters, Foreword written by Vipin Sharma, CEO, ACCESS Development Services and Acknowledgements, extensively written by the author. The book is loaded with as many as 30 tables, box items, figures, list of abbreviations and appendices pertaining to the evolution and functioning of SHGs in India.</p>
<p>The first chapter ‘Overview’ highlights the dual objectives of the book. It undertakes both a substantive historical examination of the evolution of SHGs and their federations in India as well as a comprehensive review of ongoing issues and recent concerns related to their microfinance operations.</p>
<p>The overview points out that this comprehensive study focuses on three core issues pertaining to SHGs like development cost of SHGs and SHG-based institutions; the sustainability of SHG models and the impact of credit through SHGs in terms of poverty targeting, livelihood and income generation and gender and social empowerment. The chapter clearly states that the whole book is mainly based on secondary research.</p>
<p>The second chapter ‘Origins and Evolution of SHG-Bank Linkage’ traces the origin of SHGs and the different features and typologies of SHGs. This chapter looks at various village development groups piloted by various NGOs in India in mid 1980s, notably by MYARDA. These groups provided access to credit to their members. In fact, it was MYARDA that trained the group members and taught the importance of savings and giving loans to each other from savings. The chapter also presents the different types and characteristic features of SHGs in a very elaborate manner. Evolution of SHGs in India has been discussed in detail in this chapter.</p>
<p>A survey was led by NABARD in 1987 of the 46 SHGs spread over 11 states and associated with 20 promoting institutions including MYARDA. The study observed that most of the SHGs passed through an evolutionary stage with a very low base as most of the SHGs were dependent on NGOs. The absence of legal status of SHGs was seen as a major constraint in the development of linkages between SHGs and banks. It also raised one of the crucial points that whether SHGs could stand on their own after the withdrawal of NGOs. Later in 1992, with the consultation of RBI, NABARD in India set up a pilot project on the modalities for the linkages of SHGs to banks and provided the comprehensive framework for the operations.</p>
<p>Further, the chapter reveals that capacity building was the major challenge faced by NABARD for extension of the SHG-Bank-Linkage Programme (SBLP). However, when SBLP gained momentum after 1999 in southern part of India, SHGs became popular in most of the states as a cost-effective delivery system. Simultaneously, SHGs attracted the attention of state governments who also undertook major programmes of SHG promotion. Gradually, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh actively promoted SHGs through different bodies.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 entitled ‘Growth and Performance of SHG-Bank-Linkage Programme’ reviews the physical and financial progress under the SBLP over almost two decades since its inception. The SBLP was the major factor to provide bank credit to poor through SHGs in India. Since the inception of pilot project by SBLP in 1992, the SBLP gave thrust on two objectives, namely, outreach and access of the poor to institutional credit.</p>
<p>According to NABARD data, during the initial two years, 620 SHGs which were linked to SBLP disbursed credit to over 2.23 million SHGs cumulatively by March 2006, and by March 2011, over 4.78 million SHGs had outstanding loans. SHGs with savings accounts with banks numbered over 7.46 million as on 31 March 2011. Accordingly, 97 million families benefitted from financial services under the SBLP, which enjoys the status of the leading microfinance programme of the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the regional spread of bank linkage, it also states that southern states have been predominant in SHG-bank linkage. In fact, share of eastern region had also progressively increased to over 20 per cent. There was a significant decline in the share of the western region. Andhra Pradesh followed by Tamil Nadu emerges at the top in terms of the number of SHG loan accounts and the share in outstanding loans. It also gives the details on number of bank loans disbursed under SHG-bank linkage during the years 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 for the leading states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha. However, West Bengal and Kerala were the two states which appeared unscathed from this development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the chapter also raises some concerns for review regarding the outreach of the programme, the accuracy and authenticity of the estimates of bank linkage programme compiled by NABARD. To support this view, examples of Bikaner and Odisha have been put forth where actual number of SHGs credit linked represents an overestimate of the real picture.</p>
<p>Moreover, it also reveals that in India SBLP progressed at a great pace due to the massive network of institutions, including the commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperative banks and NGOs. This programme got further boost as state governments focused on SHGs promotion as part of their development process and even Government of India adopted the SHG model for implementing Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY).</p>
<p>The fourth chapter ‘NGOs and Community Organizations as Financial Intermediaries’ presents the evolution of SHG-based NGO and community models. It clearly states that innovation of SHG-bank linkage as a means of enabling access of the poor to financial services attracted NGOs as well as national and international donors.</p>
<p>One major development cited in the chapter, which had an impact on SBLP and the SHG movement in the country, was the advent of SHG federations. The objective of the federation building has generally been to scale up the SHG programme and enhance the collective bargaining power of the members. It has also been suggested that federations play an important role in SHG capacity building and conflict resolution. However, it also put forth the differences of opinion among the scholars regarding the need and role of SHG federations. At the outset, three major roles of federations have been identified like non-financial support services to SHGs; financial services to SHGs; and non-credit–related social and economic services. No matter whatever is the case, the SHGs federation model initiated by the NGOs achieved significant scale and widespread acceptance and was also adopted by government programme.</p>
<p>However, to understand the evolution of various models of financial intermediation, models involving SHG federations, the structures developed and institutions promoted by 10 leading NGOs working in different states have been thoroughly studied. These NGOs are PRADAN, DHAN Foundation, MYRADA, Association of Sarva Seva Farms, Chaitanya, SKDRDP, BWDA, Bharat Integrated Social Welfare Agency and Parivartan.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Government of India too recognized the importance of the potential of SHG model for income and livelihoods generation in alleviating poverty and for empowerment of women. ‘Government SHG Programmes’, Chapter 5, analyzes the role of SHGs under half a dozen government livelihoods programmes of different states. The SGSY allowed considerable scope to state governments to scale up NGO innovations in promoting SHGs and linking them to banks under the SBLP. Even some of the externally aided programmes like those funded by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Bank and Department for International Development (DFID) implemented by the state governments also gave impetus to the scaling up of the SHGs model in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In fact, Andhra Pradesh was the first state to promote federations of SHGs on a large scale.</p>
<p>In this chapter, various programmes implemented by state governments along with their diversified activities, strategies for poverty reduction and livelihoods development of the poor through community-based institutions have been discussed. It informs that in 1996, RBI had included financing of SHGs as a mainstream activity of banks under the priority sector lending programme. Following this in 2000, state governments also took interest in facilitating SBLP for the poor to access loans to address their consumption and production needs.</p>
<p>The functioning of Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP), Andhra Pradesh; Mahalir Thittam, Tamil Nadu; Kudumbashree, Kerala; Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal (MAVIM), Maharashtra; Mission Shakti, Odisha; Targeted Rural Initiatives for Poverty Termination and Infrastructure (TRIPTI), Odisha; Jeevika (BIHAR Rural Livelihood project), Bihar; promotion of SHGs by the Government of Rajasthan; and Stree Shakti Programme of Government of Karnataka have been discussed in detail. These are the success stories of development of SHGs and its linkage programme in India.</p>
<p>For the success of SHGs and its linkage programme, Government of India launched SGSY in 1999 as a key poverty alleviation programme which provided credit and capital subsidy through SHG as a priority to improve the economic conditions of the poor. The chapter clarifies that SGSY has been implemented by District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in collaboration with Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), banks and NGOs. A Central Level Coordination Committee (CLCC) has been set up for effective implementation of these programmes. Beneficiaries are identified by SGSY committees at the block level and beneficiaries in the villages are selected in the gram sabhas according to the BPL list. But a study conducted by RBI in 2003 in 14 states covering 35 districts revealed that in 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the cases, delay in receipt of subsidy from DRDA led to delay in release of loans to beneficiaries owing to cumbersome procedures of banks, poor performance of SHGs and lack of awareness of the scheme on the part of the bank and illiteracy of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Owing to the shortcomings of the SGSY, Government of India appointed a committee to examine credit-related issues. In return, in 2009 the committee in its report recommended the setting up of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM). The chapter describes the NRLM as the game changer which is proposed to be introduced during 2012. According to the chapter, while functioning NRLM would adopt three-pronged strategy—enhancing and expanding livelihoods options of the poor, building skills for the job market and nurturing the self-employed and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>‘Cost of Promotion of SHGs and SHG Federations’, Chapter 6, critically examines the research on costs of promotion of SHGs, sustainability and impact of SHGs and the economies of federation. The chapter reveals that the cost of promotion of SHGs is a debatable issue. Different stakeholders in SHG promotion have different objectives and varying resources available to them, and the nature and purpose of SHGs promoted and the period of support also vary greatly. This has implications for the inputs and costs involved. However, the estimates of such costs will vary for different projects and for region-specific and community-specific considerations. After a brief explanation of various issues involved in estimation of cost of promotion of SHGs in the sixth chapter, the processes of promotion have thoroughly been discussed. It states that SHG promotion is a process (range of activities) by which SHG members are motivated and mobilized to come together for their mutual benefit. An extensive review of literature on cost of promotion of SHGs has been critically analyzed in the chapter.</p>
<p>‘Sustainability of SHGs’, Chapter 7, examines the evidence, based on a host of studies, of organizational and financial sustainability of SHGs and the SBLP. The chapter itself raises the issue why SHG sustainability needs to be viewed in the context and objectives of their promotion. The organizational sustainability of SHGs has also been discussed and the experience suggests that after a period of three to five years SHGs in many regions are not equipped to engage directly with banks and other financial agencies. However, the chapter clearly mentions that sustainability of SHGs is clearly related to the quality of groups promoted through intensive training and capacity building by leading SHPAs.</p>
<p>Later, the chapter addresses the question of SHG sustainability in the Indian context at three different levels. At the first level, the evidence of the quality and performance of SHGs that have been promoted by leading NGOs and government under various development programmes has been reviewed. Secondly, the viability of lending by banks to SHGs under SBLP has been analyzed and also, the innovations and measures that are required to expand the provision of financial services by banks through SHG. Lastly, the sustainability of institutional innovations in the form of federations has been examined at length.</p>
<p>In order to assess the performance of SHGs, APMAS undertook a detailed survey of over 400 SHG federations in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan through a rating tool called GRADES. It was found that although governance was in order, mostly idle funds were available at SHG and federation level. Overall, it was found that federations that were doing only financial intermediation as against social and financial intermediation became self-sufficient within four to five years.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the impact of the SHG programme on the borrower members of the SHGs, Chapter 8 ‘Evidence of Impact’ tries to assess the results of the interventions. The chapter documented that as far as microfinance in India is concerned credible impact studies are non-existent. It observes that, over the years, donor support to NGOs for SHG promotion has declined which led to the decline of impact studies undertaken. Despite playing a major role in the SHG movement, state governments have not conducted any such studies on the overall impact of the SHG programme.</p>
<p>However, NABARD in one of its studies revealed that number of SHG members living below the poverty line declined from about 42 per cent to about 22 per cent in the post SHG situation. But, surprisingly, the 326 households out of the sample of 560 covered by the study (58.2 per cent) were already above the poverty line, which poses serious question whether the SHGs really covered mainly poor families. Further, standard of living index of sample households comprising of socio-economic parameters rose for both economic and social parameters. However, the impact was more pronounced on social aspects rather than economic aspects.</p>
<p>Desire to protest social evils, self worth, communication skills and decline in family violence are the major positive impact of the development interventions. Some studies are specific on women empowerment and gender relations. The author raised a very important issue in this chapter that an impact assessment in SHGs and its federated structures is still undeveloped, unless it is pressurized by donors to do so.</p>
<p>The final Chapter 9 ‘Future Directions’ summarizes the conclusions and prospects of the current situation in respect of SHGs and banks in financial intermediation, expectations of NRLM, the role of NABARD and the imperatives of strategy and design for the next phase of development of SHGs.</p>
<p>Role of NABARD and their limited support to the SHGs has been critically analyzed in the chapter. It has been observed that NABARD has not done much over the last 20 years and is not playing the pivotal role in the design and implementation of NRLM either. In fact, NABARD has virtually handed over the whole SHG model to the banks without any personal innovative measures. The chapter also documented the stakeholder’s views on next phase of SHG development. There was a consensus among stakeholders that sustained handholding and capacity building of SHGs and SHG-based institutions was required and the failure to provide this has been a factor responsible for the mixed results and outcomes. However, with the passage of two decades of SBLP, NABARD is revisiting its approach in order to launch a version 2 of SBLP.</p>
<p>On the whole, the book is comprehensive and at the same time socially and economically relevant at the grass-roots level for the researchers, bankers and policy-makers. It gives an in-depth account of growth and performance of SHG and gave some useful suggestions and policy recommendations to tackle the functioning of the SHGs. This book should serve as an important source as it provides a wealth of information about the existing impact of SHGs on social and economic empowerment of the members in India and for that a list of selected references has also been given by the authors at the end. However, it would have been more useful if the authors had given some practical and concrete suggestions to improve the functioning of SHGs as a tool for socio-economic empowerment of the chronically poor in India and strengthen the existing poverty alleviation programmes by adding new dimensions for better results.</p>
