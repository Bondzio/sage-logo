<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the effects of functional communication training (FCT) implemented with concurrent schedules of differing magnitudes of reinforcement in lieu of extinction to reduce inappropriate behaviors and increase alternative mands. Participants were four adolescent students diagnosed with severe emotional and behavior disorders (SEBD), and mild to severe intellectual disabilities. Functional analyses revealed inappropriate behaviors as escape maintained. During subsequent FCT, the reinforcement provided for inappropriate behaviors was escape from task for 30 s (S<sup>R−</sup>). The reinforcement for the alternative mand was a 30-s escape from task during which access to a preferred activity was provided (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA). Results for three of the participants who had mild to moderate intellectual disabilities were highly successful. Time on task and generalization data also were recorded for two of the participants All sessions were implemented in the participants’ natural classrooms by their classroom teachers, without the adverse side effects of extinction.</p>

<p>In 1968 Baer, Wolf, and Risley identified several important dimensions of research in Applied Behavior Analysis. It is applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic, effective, and results in some form of generalization. Behavior analysts need to study behaviors that society deems important to change as opposed to behaviors that are studied because they are convenient. However, society rarely provides easily manipulated settings and behaviors solely for the purpose of scientific replication; therefore, much applied research is conducted in analogue settings. Unfortunately, analogue settings remove the individual from the social environments that are supporting the behavior of interest. As a result, when behavior is changed in analogue settings, it may not generalize to the individuals’ social, educational, and vocational settings.</p>
<p>Functional communication training (FCT) is an effective, well-researched, technological procedure for replacing inappropriate behaviors with appropriate communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300711429597">Bird, Dores, Moniz, &amp; Robinson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300711429597">Carr &amp; Durand, 1985</xref>). Using FCT, an aberrant behavior can be eliminated while an individual learns an appropriate replacement behavior that maintains the same social effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300711429597">Durand &amp; Carr, 1991</xref>). FCT was introduced in 1985, and by the 1990s research teams began exploring the effects of FCT in analogue settings with different topographies of behaviors and subgroups of individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian, Fisher, Sullivan, Acquisto, &amp; LeBlanc, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300711429597">Wacker et al., 1990</xref>). This first-generation research in analogue settings was important for developing a technologically sound procedure. Although the technology has been shown to be effective, communication skills learned in these analogue settings do not always generalize to the natural setting, leading to second-generation research issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Typically, prior to FCT a functional analysis (FA) is conducted to determine the maintaining variable for the aberrant behavior and once the maintaining variable is ascertained, a more socially acceptable behavior is taught that produces the same reinforcement. However, functional relations identified in analogue FA settings may not match those that operate in the participant’s natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300711429597">Hanley, Iwata, &amp; McCord, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300711429597">Lalli, Casey, &amp; Kates, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300711429597">Martin, Gaffan, &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300711429597">Sturmey, 1995</xref>). Therefore, Hanley et al. encouraged practitioners in the field to find ways to engage in naturalistic FAs while maintaining experimental precision. A reasonable concern with conducing FA sessions in homes or schools is that complex natural environments may obscure contingencies leading to an extended number of FA sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300711429597">Hanley et al., 2003</xref>). However, the inconvenience and corresponding potential difficulties of extended FA sessions should be weighed against the benefits of conducting sessions within natural settings in order to ensure that appropriate treatments are selected based on accurately identified functional relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711429597">Derby et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, conditions in the classroom setting may serve as establishing operations (EO) for the occurrence of inappropriate behaviors; nevertheless, FCT sessions often take place in analogue settings. Analogue settings cannot replicate all of the conditions in the classroom, especially in a situation in which idiosyncratic establishing operations accompany academic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300711429597">McComas, Hoch, Paone, &amp; El-Roy, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300711429597">Brown et al. (2000)</xref> found that self-injurious behavior and manding varied as a function of EOs, and suggested that alternative responses that are reinforced in the classroom, or natural setting, are more likely to be related contextually to the function of the inappropriate behavior and therefore be functionally equivalent.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure functional equivalence during FA sessions and in subsequent FCT sessions, then, is to conduct both procedures in natural settings. Working within the natural setting supports the applied, behavioral, and generalization dimensions of applied behavioral research. Holding true to the analytic dimension of applied behavior analysis, simplification and separation of component processes within successful and complex interventions are of importance and add to the reliability of an applied study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300711429597">Baer, Wolf, &amp; Risley, 1968</xref>). When effective technology is developed, such as FCT, the efficacy of the technology may be enhanced when component parts are analyzed. Extinction is a component commonly included in FCT packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300711429597">Hanley, Piazza, Fisher, &amp; Maglieri, 2005</xref>), but it is not without limitation.</p>
<p>Extinction bursts are common during FCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300711429597">Iwata, Pace, Kalsher, Cowdery, &amp; Cataldo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711429597">Worsdell, Iwata, Hanley, Thompson, &amp; Kahng, 2000</xref>) and dangerous for participants with severely aggressive behavior and for the clinicians conducting their sessions. During an extinction burst, an initial increase in the frequency, magnitude, and/or duration of an inappropriate behavior may occur before a reduction in problem behavior. Extinction bursts are most problematic to individuals who exhibit high rates of dangerous and self-injurious behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711429597">Vollmer, Marcus, &amp; Ringdahl, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711429597">Fisher et al. (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300711429597">Northup et al. (1994)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300711429597">Wacker et al. (1990)</xref> all showed that FCT is effective in eventually reducing problem behavior when it is combined with the extinction component. However, in all three studies, when extinction was withdrawn after treatment, the authors observed a reemergence of the problem behaviors. This reemergence was in addition to an initial extinction burst suggesting the problem behavior was only temporarily suppressed.</p>
<p>Some attempts have been made to examine FCT without extinction, but most researchers have found it necessary to include extinction to achieve positive results for at least some of their participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711429597">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300711429597">Kelley, Lerman, &amp; Van Camp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711429597">Piazza et al., 1997</xref>). Fisher et al. investigated the effects of FCT with and without extinction, resulting in variable reductions of self-injurious behavior for three participants. Only one participant showed increases in the new communication response and decreases in destructive behavior during FCT without extinction, but once the participant returned to a natural setting, extinction had to be added to FCT to produce the same results.</p>
<p>In lieu of extinction, some researchers have turned to concurrent schedules of reinforcement during FCT. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711429597">Worsdell et al. (2000)</xref> provided reinforcement for appropriate and inappropriate behaviors. As reinforcement for inappropriate behaviors was thinned, however, extinction bursts occurred before appropriate behaviors increased and inappropriate behaviors decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711429597">Piazza et al. (1997)</xref> examined differing magnitudes of reinforcement during concurrent schedules of reinforcement in the form of a break for destructive behavior and a break plus access to tangible items for compliance. Extinction was not necessary until the implementation of fading procedures at which time multiple types of positive reinforcement, combined with extinction, produced desired levels of compliance and a decrease in inappropriate behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711429597">Hoch, McComas, Thompson, and Paone (2002)</xref> suggested that future FCT research that investigates concurrent schedules of reinforcement could possibly benefit from providing a more powerful and greater magnitude of reinforcement, such as negative reinforcement plus access to a preferred activity (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA), for alternative mands.</p>
<p>In addition to the applied, technological, generalizable, and analytic dimensions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300711429597">Baer et al. (1968)</xref> described the behavioral dimension of applied research. During a successful intervention, the participant’s behavior changes, as does the experimenter’s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711429597">Derby et al. (1997)</xref> observed a manifestation of this in their study of FCT in home settings and described the phenomenon as collateral responding. As parents were delivering reinforcement for new appropriate responses, they also were positively reinforcing other prosocial behaviors of the children such as appropriate talking, request making, and eye contact. This was due to the interactive nature of the FCT protocols in a naturalistic environment. As reinforcement for additional and appropriate behaviors was delivered outside of the FCT protocol, there was even less time for the children to engage in inappropriate behaviors. Eventually, and without thinning of reinforcements, the children learned to engage in a variety of appropriate behaviors to elicit the attention they once received for inappropriate behaviors.</p>
<p>Research on conducting FA and FCT in classroom settings remains limited as does research on the effectiveness of FCT without extinction. In this study classroom teachers conducted both the FA and the FCT in the students’ classrooms in order to capitalize on EOs and collateral responding effects during sessions. Because previous attempts at thinning the reinforcement schedule for problem behavior have been shown to be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711429597">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300711429597">Hanley, Iwata, &amp; Thompson, 2001</xref>) and functionally equivalent to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711429597">Worsdell et al., 2000</xref>), we did not apply thinning of reinforcement for inappropriate behaviors. Instead, we planned to thin reinforcement for alternative mands, when necessary, because of the potential of a high frequency of the appropriate behaviors interfering with instruction and because it may be inappropriate to provide the reinforcement so frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300711429597">Hanley et al., 2001</xref>) especially in the case of escape-maintained behaviors. We examined whether or not schedule thinning would be tolerated because of the development of naturally occurring contingencies within the classroom as students exhibited prosocial and academic behaviors that would produce reinforcement.</p>
<p>Some researchers have successfully demonstrated generalization across natural settings, tasks, and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711429597">Derby et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300711429597">Durand, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300711429597">Wacker et al. 2005</xref>), but none of these studies involved academic behaviors. Our goal was, through the use of concurrent schedules of differing magnitudes of reinforcement, to produce an increase in alternative mands and a decrease in inappropriate behaviors while also increasing the time spent on academic tasks.</p>

<title>General Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1098300711429597">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Participants included four students enrolled in a self-contained program of a public education system serving students who have a diagnosis of severe emotional and behavior disorder (SEBD). Each participant’s regular classroom teacher conducted all procedures in each participant’s natural classroom. The classroom teachers with no prior FA or FCT experience nominated students whom they suspected of engaging in inappropriate behaviors to escape from academic demands. Todd was a 17-year-old boy with limited verbal abilities with an eligibility for moderate intellectual disability services, autism, and SEBD. His inappropriate behaviors were screaming, throwing materials across the room, hitting others, crying, yelling, lying over his desk while refusing to move, and picking the skin on his hands, which left scars. Tony was a 12-year-old nonvocal boy with eligibility for severe intellectual disability services, autism, and SEBD. His inappropriate behaviors were running away, throwing materials on the floor, throwing materials on his desk, lying on one side and refusing to move, squealing, and wringing his hands. Mary was an 8-year-old girl with eligibility for moderate intellectual disability services, SEBD, cerebral palsy, and a feeding disorder. Her primary inappropriate behavior was extreme hitting of others’ faces with her closed fist. Eli was an 18-year-old boy diagnosed with SEBD and eligibility for mild intellectual disability services. His inappropriate behaviors were leaving the classroom, turning over furniture, and physical aggression toward staff. No participant had a previous FA conducted. Previous procedures in place to control behavior included time out and response cost procedures but not extinction because of the severity of inappropriate behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098300711429597">
<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>The participants’ classroom teachers rated the acceptability of the FA and FCT using two questionnaires designed by the researcher. Each questionnaire had four items rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale for a maximum acceptability score of 20. Both questionnaires asked if the procedures were worth the effort required, if the teachers would be willing to do the procedures again, and if they would recommend the procedures to other teachers. In addition, the questionnaire for the FA asked if the teachers would incorporate the findings into the students’ behavior intervention plans, and the FCT questionnaire asked if the FCT improved student communication skills. Teachers’ acceptability scores for the FA were 20 for Tony, Mary, and Todd and 16 for Eli. Teachers’ acceptability scores for the FCT were 20 for Tony and Mary, 18 for Todd, and 16 for Eli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1098300711429597">
<title>Procedural Integrity</title>
<p>The first author trained the teachers and staff to implement the steps of each procedure. Prior to the onset of each FA and FCT component, teachers were thoroughly trained in the protocols. During training, teachers and the experimenter reviewed detailed, written procedures for all of the steps and then practiced implementing the procedures with paraprofessionals serving in the role of students until teachers followed written protocols with 100% integrity. Although procedural integrity data were not collected, the researcher continued to review procedural steps with teachers before each phase began and was present monitoring procedural integrity during all phases of the research.</p>

<title>Component 1: Functional Analysis</title>
<sec id="section6-1098300711429597">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Each student’s classroom teacher identified the target inappropriate behaviors. During each FA session, the experimenter recorded the occurrence or nonoccurrence of target behaviors using 10-s partial interval recording, and reported the percentage of intervals in which target inappropriate behaviors occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1098300711429597">
<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>A staff member served as a second observer and independently and simultaneously collected data for 20% of sessions. Interobserver agreement (IOA) was calculated by dividing the number of interval agreements by the number of interval agreements plus disagreements, and multiplying by 100%. Mean IOA for inappropriate behaviors was 100% for Tony, and 89% (73%–100%), 97% (95%–100%), and 99% (99%–100%) for Todd, Mary, and Eli, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1098300711429597">
<title>Independent Variables and Experimental Design</title>
<p>All participants were exposed to an FA to identify maintaining contingencies for inappropriate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711429597">Iwata, Dorsey, Slifer, Bauman, &amp; Richman, 1982/1994</xref>). Assessments were conducted at the same time every day in the students’ natural classroom settings using a multielement design. Teaching assistants monitored the other students who were typically present and given independent seatwork while the teacher conducted sessions. The participants were exposed to four conditions—attention, tangible, demand, and play—based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711429597">Iwata et al. (1982/1994)</xref>. An alone condition was not included because students in this facility are never left alone because of their aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. Tangible was not included for Tony because a tangible reinforcer could not be identified in the time available.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300711429597">
<title>Component 2: FCT</title>
<sec id="section10-1098300711429597">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>During each FCT session, frequency data were recorded. The experimenter recorded how many times the inappropriate behavior occurred and how many times the alternative response occurred. The total number of occurrences of each behavior was reported for each session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1098300711429597">
<title>Interobserver Agreement</title>
<p>A staff member served as a second observer and independently and simultaneously collected frequency data for 20% of all FCT sessions. Interobserver agreement was calculated by dividing the smaller number of occurrences by the larger number of occurrences, and multiplying by 100%. The mean IOA for target behaviors was 100% for Tony and Mary, 99% (98%–100%) for Todd, and 96% (95%–100%) for Eli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1098300711429597">
<title>Procedures</title>
<sec id="section13-1098300711429597">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Participants first were exposed to a baseline condition during which negative reinforcement was provided for inappropriate behavior and there was no opportunity to perform the alternative mand. The next phase was a prompted alternative mand training phase, followed by an FCT phase during which inappropriate and alternative behaviors both received reinforcement on a concurrent FR 1 schedule. This intervention phase was followed by a return to baseline and then a replication phase of the FCT intervention. For each participant, sessions lasted either 10 (Tony) or 15 min (Todd, Mary, and Eli) and took place in each participant’s regular classroom during instructional times the teacher reported were usually associated with problem behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1098300711429597">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>A card with a picture indicating break time was used. The students placed the card in the hand of the instructor (alternative mand) as a means of requesting a break with the preferred activity. The break card was placed on the upper right-hand corner of the participant’s desk at the beginning of each FCT session and removed at the end of each session.</p>
<p>Todd selected his preferred activity each day. His normal routine was to pick a brightly colored toy each morning when he entered the classroom and to continue to play with it for the remainder of the day. During the course of this study, he had access to it only during FCT sessions. Tony’s preferred activity was sensory reinforcement. His teacher reported that a play item would not hold his attention long enough and that he might throw it across the room. Sensory reinforcement was delivered in the form of hand games, and ear tickling. Eli’s preferred activities were playing with puzzles and listening to music on his headphone. The puzzles were small and could be removed easily at the end of each break. Similarly, the headphones could be removed easily from his head. Mary’s preferred activities were playing with plastic straws and eating pudding from a cup. Each of the items was available to Eli and Mary during FCT sessions only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1098300711429597">
<title>Independent variables and experimental design</title>
<p>The independent variable was a concurrent schedule of reinforcement for inappropriate behaviors and for alternative, replacement behaviors. The reinforcement provided for inappropriate behaviors was escape from tasks for 30 s (S<sup>R−</sup>). The reinforcement provided for the alternative mand was a 30-s escape from tasks during which simultaneous access to a preferred activity (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA) was provided. Treatment effectiveness was tested using a withdrawal design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1098300711429597">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>For all participants, inappropriate behavior was a dependent variable. For Eli and Mary, time-on-task also was a dependent variable. During FCT with the first two participants, Todd and Tony, time-on-task was not specifically measured because their teachers indicated that increasing time on task was not an academic goal. However, prior to treatment, Mary and Eli never engaged in their seatwork, even when they were not engaging in inappropriate behavior, and therefore had the academic goal of increasing time on task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1098300711429597">
<title>Baseline (S<sup>R−</sup>):</title>
<p>No contingencies were in effect for the alternative response; the break card was not available to the student. A 30-s escape from tasks was in effect on an FR 1 schedule contingent on inappropriate behavior. For Tony, Mary, and Eli, sessions continued until stability of data was established using procedures described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300711429597">Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2009</xref>). All frequency data were within 50% of the average rate of baseline responding. During session 4, Todd’s inappropriate behaviors escalated to an unsafe level, after which his baseline phase was terminated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1098300711429597">
<title>Alternative mand training phase: Problem behavior (S<sup>R−</sup>), alternative mand (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA)</title>
<p>The participants were taught the alternative mand using prompting procedures similar to those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711429597">Worsdell et al. (2000)</xref>. Before the onset of a session, the participant was shown the break card and told that by placing the break card in the teacher’s hand, the student would earn a break from work and access to the preferred activity. Then the task was placed on the desk with the break card in the upper right hand corner of the desk, and the student was told “Begin your work.” If the student did not emit an inappropriate or the alternative response within 5 s of the onset of a session, the teacher physically prompted the student to perform the alternative mand (place the break card into her hand) and then provided a 30-s break along with access to the preferred activity (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA). Prompting was provided to ensure that the participant learned to perform the mand and come in contact with the S<sup>R−</sup>/PA reinforcement. Prompted or independent alternative behavior resulted in a break with access to the preferred activity. If the inappropriate behavior did not occur during five consecutive physically prompted alternative responses, the next prompt was delayed an additional 5 s and only a verbal prompt was provided. After five consecutive verbally prompted mands, the student was given an additional 5 s to independently perform the mand and if he did not do so he was once again verbally prompted to use the break card. This sequence continued until the student emitted five consecutive independent mands; then the FCT phase began during which only independently performed mands were reinforced. All inappropriate behaviors continued to be negatively reinforced.</p>

<title>FCT without extinction: Inappropriate behavior (S<sup>R−</sup>) and alternative mand (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA)</title>
<p>FCT sessions took place during the same instructional times as baseline sessions and included the same type of instructional tasks. The teacher first informed the student that placing the break card into her hand would result in a 30-s break with the student’s preferred activity (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA). Sessions began when the teacher placed instructional materials on the student’s desk and gave the direction “Begin your work.” On the student’s performance of the appropriate mand, a 30-s break was provided with simultaneous access to the preferred activity on an FR 1 schedule. As in baseline conditions, the inappropriate behavior was negatively reinforced with a 30-s break on an FR 1 schedule (S<sup>R−</sup>). After each 30-s break for inappropriate behavior or alternative mand, the student’s work was returned to his or her desk.</p>

<title>Functional Analysis</title>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300711429597">Figure 1</xref>, FAs revealed escape from tasks as the condition under which most inappropriate behavior occurred for all four participants. Todd exhibited inappropriate behavior most often during the demand sessions with low levels of inappropriate behavior during tangible and play, and no inappropriate behavior during attention sessions. Tony exhibited inappropriate behavior most often during demand with little or no inappropriate behavior during attention or play. Mary engaged in inappropriate behavior in all test conditions; however, she engaged in inappropriate behavior most often in the demand condition. During 20 FA sessions, Eli engaged in inappropriate behavior most often in the demand condition. There was a very high level of inappropriate behavior during one tangible session; however, inappropriate behavior occurred in only 2 of the 5 tangible sessions. There was almost no inappropriate behavior in the play and attention conditions.</p>

<title>Todd</title>
<p>During the first baseline, inappropriate behaviors ranged between 4 and 25, with a mean of 13. During a prompted alternative mand training session, Todd performed 11 alternative mands, 5 of which were independent, and inappropriate behavior did not occur. Only one prompted mand training session was necessary, and Todd was moved to the first FCT phase during which only independent mands received reinforcement. During the first FCT phase, alternative mands ranged from 5 to 7, with a mean of 6, and there was only one occurrence of an inappropriate behavior. During the second baseline phase inappropriate behaviors returned to a level similar to the first baseline. Only two sessions were conducted because of the ascending rate of severe behaviors. During the last FCT phase, independently performed mands occurred 4.25 times on average. Inappropriate behaviors decreased from the second baseline phase mean of 15.5 to a mean of 4.0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1098300711429597">
<title>Tony</title>
<p>During the first baseline, inappropriate behaviors occurred 12 and 15 times. During training, the alternative mand was physically prompted and then verbally prompted according to criteria set within the study. Inappropriate behavior decreased to levels of 3 and 0, whereas prompted mands occurred 7 and 9 times. During the first FCT phase, alternative mands ranged from 5 to 11, with a mean of 8. Inappropriate behavior ranged from 0 to 3, with a mean of 1.66. During the second baseline phase, inappropriate behavior increased to 13. Only one session was conducted because of Tony’s high level of inappropriate behavior. During the second FCT phase, alternative mands ranged from 2 to 7, with a mean of 5, and inappropriate behavior ranged from 0 to 6, with a mean of 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1098300711429597">
<title>Mary</title>
<p>During the first baseline, the number of inappropriate behaviors ranged between 17 and 21, with a mean of 19. During training, Mary emitted 6 prompted alternative mands, and inappropriate behavior decreased to 4. Only one prompted mand training session was necessary. During the first FCT phase, independent alternative mands ranged from 2 to 5, with a mean of 3, whereas inappropriate behavior ranged from 2 to 4, with a mean of 3. During the second baseline, inappropriate behavior returned to levels consistent with the first baseline range. During the next FCT phase, independent mands increased to an average of 8 (range 7–10), with no inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>Reinforcement thinning for alternative mands along with generalization procedures as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300711429597">Gast (2010)</xref> were implemented during the last five FCT phases. During the sixth phase, a 5-s delay was in place so that each time Mary executed the alternative mand the teacher waited 5 s before delivering the S<sup>R−</sup>/PA reinforcement. Alternative mand levels remained at the previous FCT levels with, a mean of 8, whereas inappropriate behavior remained at zero. When a 10-s delay was implemented during the seventh phase, mands ranged from 1 to 6, with a mean of 3, whereas inappropriate behavior remained at zero. During the 20-s delay phase, Mary’s requests for breaks decreased to zero with only one occurrence of an inappropriate behavior. After requests for breaks reached zero, generalization procedures were implemented along with FCT for the remaining two phases. Prior to generalization phases, Mary’s classroom teacher implemented all procedures one-to-one with Mary. During the ninth phase, FCT took place during group instruction, with the classroom teaching assistant providing the instruction and implementing FCT procedures with Mary. The group consisted of 4 students and was part of typical math or writing lessons. Although Mary’s break card was readily available to her in the usual place by her work assignments, she never requested a break or engaged in any inappropriate behavior. In the final phase, FCT took place during the same group instruction but with a substitute teacher assistant implementing all procedures. Levels of manding and inappropriate behavior remained at zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1098300711429597">
<title>Mary’s time on task</title>
<p>During the first five phases, Mary was never on task. When she was not requesting a break from tasks, and not engaging in inappropriate behavior, she was not on task but instead just sitting appropriately at her desk. When her manding levels were at their highest during FCT phases, she was receiving S<sup>R−</sup>/PA during much of the session, but even when reinforcement was not being delivered, she just sat quietly at her desk until the next time she handed the break card to her teacher.</p>
<p>During Session 15, in the sixth phase, her percentage of time on task increased from the previous level of zero to 37%. This phase was the first thinning phase and included a 5-s time delay in delivery of reinforcement for manding. During Session 13, which was the first session with thinning procedures, Mary’s level of manding increased in response to the delay. But, as can be seen in the next two phases, manding continued to decrease as she learned to tolerate the delay. During the seventh phase, Sessions 16 through 20, Mary’s time on task continued to increase. The percentage of time on task ranged from 39% to 100%, with a mean of 65%. This phase was the second FCT with thinning of reinforcement for mands phase with a time delay of 10 s in which manding simultaneously decreased. During the eighth phase, the time delay was increased to 20 s. Mary’s time on task decreased in Session 21 to 66% but returned to 100% in Session 22.</p>
<p>The last two phases were FCT with generalization. Mary’s time on task remained at 100%. Concomitantly, her levels of manding and inappropriate behavior remained at zero.</p>

<sec id="section29-1098300711429597">
<title>Eli</title>
<p>During the first baseline, inappropriate behavior ranged from 80 and 100, with a mean of 92. During the FCT training phase, Eli emitted 15 alternative mands and inappropriate behavior decreased to zero. Following the training phase, the number of independently performed alternative mands ranged from 9 to 12, with a mean of 10, whereas inappropriate behaviors ranged from 0 to 3, with a mean of 0.75. During the second baseline, inappropriate behaviors ranged from 1 to 65, with an increasing trend. During replication of the FCT phase, thinning of reinforcement for manding procedures began with a 30-s time delay, and independently performed mands ranged from 8 to 13, with a mean of 10, whereas inappropriate behaviors decreased to zero. During the final FCT phase, a 60-s time delay lapsed between mands and delivery of reinforcement. Alternative mands ranged from 3 to 5, with a mean of 4, which was fewer than half of the mean of the previous FCT phase. Inappropriate behavior remained at zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1098300711429597">
<title>Eli’s time on task</title>
<p>For the first baseline phase, Eli’s percentage of time on task was zero except for the second session, which was 10%. The second session also was when his level of inappropriate behavior dipped. During the FCT training session, his percentage of time on task was 42% while he executed 15 mands. When he was not receiving a break from tasks he was on task with his work.</p>
<p>Eli’s levels of time on task increased rapidly during the first FCT phase. The range was 52% to 92%, with a mean of 75%. Simultaneously, his levels of inappropriate behavior decreased to almost zero and his manding levels were moderately low.</p>
<p>Sessions 9, 10, and 11, which were a return to baseline phase, revealed a rapid decrease in time spent on task. The range was 27% to 88%, with a mean of 48%. Interestingly, Eli was on task during the ninth session 88% of the time and inappropriate behavior was at a level of zero even though no break card was available for his use during this baseline condition.</p>
<p>Sessions 12 through 14 constituted the second FCT phase. Even with a 30-s delay of reinforcement, Eli was on task 50%, 73%, and 75% of the time indicating an ascending trend. His requests for breaks decreased during this phase, and surprisingly he remained on task during the 30-s delay. Because he remained on task during the delay, when reinforcement was delivered his task was not removed and, equally surprisingly, Eli remained on task during most of his requested break time. In this way, he requested up to 13 breaks during this phase but was still on task up to 75% of the time.</p>
<p>The final FCT phase consisted of Sessions 15, 16, and 17. Even though the time delay to reinforcement increased to 60 s per mand, the on-task data trend from the previous phase continued to ascend. The levels were 74%, 80%, and 85% of time on task during sessions, whereas inappropriate behavior levels remained at zero. Similar to the previous phase, during the final three sessions Eli requested 5, 5, and 3 breaks, respectively, but still remained on task during much of his break time, allowing for the high levels of observed time on task.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study extends research on FCT without extinction by conducting sessions in classroom settings and including a more powerful reinforcer for the appropriate mand. FCT was successfully conducted in the classroom with existing idiosyncratic EOs, while simultaneously ensuring functional equivalence and avoiding the negative effects of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711429597">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711429597">Hagopian et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300711429597">Lalli et al., 1995</xref>). FCT with concurrent schedules of differing magnitudes of reinforcement, and without thinning of reinforcement for problem behavior, resulted in effectively decreasing escape-maintained inappropriate behavior and increasing appropriate mands for four students with SEBD. Moreover, no extinction bursts or reemergence of inappropriate behavior occurred.</p>
<p>Successful FCT without extinction is especially important for participants with SEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711429597">Vollmer et al., 1995</xref>). Target behaviors included hitting others, throwing objects, screaming, lying across desk, yelling, crying, picking the skin, and striking others’ faces. During FAs, students displayed these behaviors as much as 96% of instructional time. Extinction bursts or reemergence of these inappropriate behaviors could not be tolerated.</p>
<p>For Mary, Eli, and Todd, whose intellectual levels were in the mild to moderate range, FCT almost eliminated severe behaviors while increasing alternative behavior. In addition, Mary and Eli, for whom time on task was measured, demonstrated a dramatic increase in time on task, and Mary generalized her on-task behavior to another instructional setting and to other instructors. Thinning of reinforcement density for manding was implemented during Mary’s and Eli’s FCT in a successful effort to reduce the number of requested breaks during sessions and to further increase time spent on task. In Todd’s case, the inappropriate behaviors required more effort than the alternative mand, allowing him to earn a reinforcer of greater magnitude by performing an easier task. He did not perform the alternative mand at high rates possibly because of satiation effects and therefore no thinning of reinforcement for manding was implemented. Notably, during FCT sessions, Todd only used his break card after he completed a folder of independent seatwork.</p>
<p>Tony engaged in fewer inappropriate behaviors after FCT, and according to his teacher he spent more time on task. He learned to emit the alternative mand but only when the teacher delivered a verbal prompt to do so. The need for verbal prompting could be due to his intellectual functioning, which was in the severe range. More training sessions might have resulted in Tony learning to mand independently, as evidenced by his progression from full physical prompting to verbal prompting in relatively few sessions. However, the school year ended before we could determine this.</p>
<p>Mary’s behavior change was the most dramatic. She was the youngest participant with the most severely aggressive behavior and yet her dangerous hitting completely stopped and she eventually engaged in academic tasks 100% of the time during sessions. The skill generalized across an instructional setting and teachers. Her inappropriate behavior remained at zero for an entire phase prior to the onset of thinning. During the last three phases of thinning, Mary only engaged in inappropriate behavior once (Session 21), and she never requested a break even though her break card was readily available to her.</p>
<p>During Mary’s FCT program, we observed collateral responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711429597">Derby et al., 1997</xref>). When Mary performed the alternative mand, she received attention and praise from peers and staff. This praise was not part of the FCT protocol, but rather, a natural response of others, possibly further reinforcing manding. Also, peers and staff praised her and delivered reinforcement in the form of attention whenever she initiated any academic task-related behavior such as picking up her pencil, sitting at attention, or using a respectful tone of voice during earned break periods. Finally, as her engagement in appropriate academic behaviors increased, she had more opportunities to practice her writing, thereby increasing her writing proficiency, and thus decreasing her aversive responses to writing tasks.</p>
<p>Mary’s generalization results were equally impressive. FCT is an effective form of teaching appropriate communication to students but rarely are the results shown to generalize, thereby reducing the overall usefulness of FCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300711429597">Mildon, Moore, &amp; Dixon, 2004</xref>). As soon as Mary’s time on task, manding, and inappropriate behaviors were stable, stimulus generalization procedures began. Ultimately, the FCT sessions were conducted in the educational setting in which she is typically expected to have appropriate self-control and remain on task. By the end of Mary’s FCT, she was on task 100% of the time with zero inappropriate behavior during sessions that took place in group instructional settings with different teachers.</p>
<p>FCT also was successful for Eli. By the end of the study, he was on task as much as 85% of his session time and his inappropriate behaviors were not exhibited at all. According to his teacher, he was appropriately requesting breaks from tasks at a low and acceptable level. No extinction bursts were observed, and that was of particular importance with Eli because of his large physical size. His inappropriate behaviors often resulted in classroom damage and were dangerous to himself and others around him. No extinction bursts occurred even though thinning for manding was implemented quickly and in large increments of time. A possible explanation for his tolerance of accelerated thinning of reinforcement for manding is that he was functioning in the mild range intellectually, which was higher than the other participants.</p>
<p>This study systematically replicated procedures used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711429597">Hoch et al. (2002)</xref> in which they provided concurrent schedules of differing magnitudes of reinforcement (S<sup>R−</sup>/PA). The goal of their study was to increase task completion and decrease escape-maintained self-injurious behavior and aggressive behaviors for three students with Autism in a classroom setting. The concurrent schedules were effective enough that their participants chose to perform a more difficult task for the more desirable reward. This current study confirms their findings on differing magnitudes of reinforcement, and extends their successful results to FCT procedures with four students diagnosed with SEBD and mild to severe intellectual disabilities. The current study, which involved participants with lower cognitive abilities, differed from procedures by Hoch et al. in that we provided reinforcement for discrete alternative mands that ultimately lead to task completion as opposed to providing reinforcement at the end of a completed task.</p>
<sec id="section32-1098300711429597">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Students expressed preference for their preferred activity at the start of each school day. More effective preferred activities might have been employed if we had conducted systematic preference assessments to identify low- and high-preferred items and activities. This would be most applicable to Tony’s case where faster results might have been obtained. With the time available, a tangible reinforcer was not determined for Tony. Furthermore, faster results might have been obtained for Tony if it had been possible to withhold his sensory reinforcer outside of sessions.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is the lack of procedural integrity data during the FA and FCT sessions. However, during initial training the teachers practiced all protocol steps until they could perform them with 100% accuracy. In addition, teachers practiced steps with the researcher before the onset of each FA and FCT phase, and the researcher was present monitoring procedural integrity during all phases of the research.</p>
<p>The results of this study are very promising for individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities who exhibit frequent and severe inappropriate behaviors within a classroom setting as a function of escape from instructional tasks. However, generalization beyond this selection of students has yet to be conducted. Replications of this study would be beneficial to the efficacy and generality of FCT without the adverse effects of extinction. Future extensions of this study comparing the performance of students with moderate and severe intellectual disabilities, and conducting preference assessments prior to FA and FCT, would enhance the body of literature regarding FCT without extinction in applied settings.</p>
