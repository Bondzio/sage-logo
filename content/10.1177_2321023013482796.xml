<p>This book deals with party system change in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. This is a welcome addition to the literature on the party system and party politics in India since the focus of its research is on state politics. Even though India’s politics has been dominated by forces at the state level, little research had been done on the politics at this level, especially on post-1990 state politics.</p>
<p>The book analyses the new political forces that entered in the politics of Tamil Nadu after 1989. Thus, the caste based parties like the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Dalit parties; the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the new catch-all party Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) have been discussed in separate chapters. The framework of analysis focuses on understanding the agency of the ‘political entrepreneurs’ in creating, shaping and sustaining new political parties in the state. The author also analyses in detail the institutional and societal environment in the state.</p>
<p>After 1989, the political party system in Tamil Nadu underwent changes. The vigour in mobilization by the Dravidian parties declined—though they still hold a substantial share of votes in the state politics. This and the downward trend in the electoral and political strength of the Congress destabilized the earlier two and a half party system in the state, consisting of two main Dravidian parties and Congress as a ‘half’ party. This party system was replaced by the two electoral alliances led by two Dravidian parties. The parties constituting these alliances have been fluid. In fact, after late 1990s, for over a decade, PMK made smart tactical use of this fluidity to be a part of the ruling coalition and ministry in every government at the centre.</p>
<p>The emergence of the caste-based mobilization has been a significant development in the post-1990 political mobilization in the state. The geographical spread and grievances of the caste groups mobilized by the new political parties and their leaders have been delineated in the book. The case of successful mobilization of the Vanniar caste group in the north is contrasted with the relative failure in mobilization of the Thevar caste group in the southern part of the state. This has happened in spite of similar geographical spread of both the caste groups and their political engagement over the years. The author has analysed the political entrepreneurial skills of Dr Ramados in organizing Vanniyars. However, whether lack of effective leadership has been a cause of failure in Thevar mobilization is not made clear.</p>
<p>In the case of Dalit parties, the author mentions what in the situation of Dalits enables and hinders a leader wishing to carve out separate political space for Dalits. The hindering situation has been the relative lack of resources at the disposal of Dalits. And enabling condition includes the emergence of a small middle class who is not ready to take lightly the caste oppression in various forms. The author also discusses the tension between the aspiration of mobilizing Dalits as a whole but actually ending up mobilizing single caste amongst them. This issue has been dealt at length and the efforts taken by the leaders of these parties to tackle the issue have also been discussed. The efforts of the PMK to go beyond the Vanniyars and establish links with the Dalits are also mentioned.</p>
<p>The BJP tried to introduce the issue of Hindu-majoritarian religious nationalism into politics of the state. The party, along with the other Hindu communal outfits tried to organize people by undertaking several activities among different sections of population and attempted to encapsulate the all India Hindu nationalism into the symbols of Tamil nationalism. The BJP benefited from the alliances it made with the Dravidian parties in the wake of its emergence as the head of a significant political coalition at the national level. However, it was not possible for the party to enlarge its political influence beyond a certain miniscule point in the state. The reasons behind this debacle that are analysed in the book include the adoption of soft Hindutva by the main Dravidian parties and want of effective leadership in BJP.</p>
<p>The role of leadership is exemplified in the discussion on DMDK. Vijayakanth’s on-screen and off-screen image presents him as a panacea for all the problems in individual and social life of the masses. Following MGR’s leadership style, Vijayakanth attempted public theatricals. He has been trying to transcend various social cleavages basing his appeal onto his charismatic personality and various populist-welfare schemes for the poor. This discussion becomes even more interesting when the success of Vijayakanth’s mobilization is contrasted with the relative failure in the political career of Rajanikanth, another mega star in Tamil film industry.</p>
<p>The dominant perspective in understanding party system change takes sociological and institutional forces as independent variables and leadership as a dependent variable. This book aims to inverse this logic. It seeks to establish agency of the political leadership in changing party system. While doing this, it does consider the sociological and structural forces that might encourage or inhibit creation and sustenance of political party/ies. However, the author analyses in great detail the style and activities of the leaders of those new parties who actually use those conditions and shape the party system. In this exercise, the book has offered a rich information and analysis of the various social and political cleavages available in the state, the leadership profile of and strategies adopted by the political entrepreneurs and theoretical insights into the phenomenon of political party system change.</p>
