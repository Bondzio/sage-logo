<abstract>
<p>The work presented herein aims to investigate the in-plane properties of cross-plied unidirectional prepreg using the bias extension method. The study considers different generations of carbon fibre/epoxy material systems, and testing is performed at elevated temperatures to enhance the deformability. Using digital image correlation, the specimen deformation and fibre rotation is captured during testing. The study shows that most cross-plied unidirectional material deforms at different characteristic length scales as deformation continues: first seemingly continuous and later in the form of bands. Further, the different type of prepreg materials investigated behaves differently; for one type the pin-jointed net theory fit well, enabling simple estimation of the resulting fibre angle, while for the other two it did not. Different loading speeds and temperatures are investigated in order to pinpoint their influence on the deformability.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311412988" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aerospace composite manufacturers are always striving towards the highest possible quality at the lowest possible (affordable) weight. To achieve this, unidirectional (UD) carbon fibre prepreg (preimpregnated fibres) is one of the common choices of material. A manufacturing method still commonly used is hand lay-up, that is, placing each layer of prepreg onto a mould by hand; this is a very time consuming process. To lower the cost of composite components, attempts to automate parts of the manufacturing process are made. The automatic tape layer (ATL) offers interesting and promising solutions for manufacturing of fairly simple geometries. However, when it comes to producing laminates with complex shape, the ATL is not a stand-alone solution.</p>
<p>A promising manufacturing method for automated the shaping of thermoset composites with continuous fibres is sheet forming,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412988">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311412988">3</xref></sup> a method until recently mostly used for thermoplastics. The process can be described as the forming of planar sheets of pre-stacked laminates into more complex shapes, usually by using moulds or different kinds of tools. The pressure that forces the sheet to deform can be applied by, for example, matched dies or a compliant diaphragm. Since the process forces the pre-stacked and initially flat material to stretch, slide and consolidate to the requested geometry, the process raises new demands on the deformability of the prepreg material.</p>
<p>The deformation behaviour of dry woven fabrics is highly shear dominated and is commonly described as a pin-jointed net (PJN), meaning that it deforms through rotation at the crossover points between warp and weft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412988">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412988">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311412988">6</xref></sup> Cross-plied UD prepreg may show similar deformation behaviour to woven fabrics;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311412988">7</xref></sup> however, since cross-plies lack the physical links of a weave, the complete deformation is more complex. In previously published studies, the possibility of increased drapability of cross-plied UD prepreg compared to woven fabrics has been noted, but at the same time cross-plied UD prepreg is still often considered to undergo a deformation seemingly following the PJN approximation. Including slippage as a forming mechanism increases the forming limits of that material system; however, it also imposes difficulties in predicting forming limits and final fibre angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311412988">8</xref></sup> Since the forming limits will decide the feasibility of sheet forming as the manufacturing method for a certain geometry with a specific material and stacking sequence, it is important to be able to characterize these limitations. The final fibre angles will affect the cured mechanical properties and the possible shape distortion. This motivates further work in the area.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the in-plane forming behaviour of different generations of aerospace certified, UD prepreg material systems. These material systems have shown totally different forming behaviour in the workshop, but are similar according to their cured properties. The study is experimental and restricted to the in-plane behaviour of cross-plied UD prepreg. In parallel, the interply friction between the separate layers has been experimentally studied by the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412988">9</xref></sup> The fundamental aim of the work presented herein is to observe the mechanisms occurring during in-plane deformation and compare the behaviour of the three material systems considered. This will be done by a bias extension test in combination with a contact free measuring system called digital image correlation (DIC). The methodology enables measurements of the fibre angle rotation during deformation, synchronized with the load response recorded by the tensile testing machine. By studying the photos, the evolution of different deformation mechanisms can be followed until failure, such as, for example, prepreg wrinkling.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311412988"><title>Theory</title>
<p>In most drape predictions the reinforcement is assumed to be inextensible. Considering that the matrix in its uncured state is so much less stiff than the fibres, this can be seen as a valid assumption. Consequently, the deformation has to take place within the matrix, that is, inside and in between fibre tows and prepreg layers. The known deformation modes for a stack of prepreg with continuous fibres are interply (between layers), intraply or trellis (within layers), resin percolation and squeeze flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311412988">10</xref></sup> In this study the deformation is obtained without large pressure gradients perpendicular to the surface and considers resin starved (non-bleeding) prepreg materials, wherefore the level of resin percolation and squeeze flow is limited. The focus is therefore on the intra- and interply deformation.</p>
<p>The PJN approximation was initially proposed by Mack and Taylor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412988">4</xref></sup> and has thereafter been developed and widely used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311412988">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311412988">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412988">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412988">12</xref></sup> The theory includes the assumption that the fibres are considered to be inextensible and seen as lines, that is, with no thickness and width. In addition, there is no slippage allowed at crossover points, but the fibres can rotate freely. Implicitly this results in that there is no resistance to lateral bending, that is, the fibre can have different angles on each side of a crossover. Due to the restriction on slippage at crossover points, the area captured in between crossing fibres in the plane ideally goes to zero as deformation continues, which results in a compacting force on the material. This limits the maximum deformation allowed before wrinkling or other undesired out-of-plane deformations to appear. At this deformation level, the load to deformation is rapidly increasing. For weaves, a shear locking angle, also referred to as a maximum shear angle, can be defined as the limit of in-plane deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311412988">13</xref></sup> Moreover, for weaves the width of the fibre tows and the weaving pattern itself makes the crossover points well defined and fairly sparsely distributed. On the contrary, for cross-plied UD prepreg, the crossover points can be of several length scales and possibly change during forming. Examples of these length scales can be single fibre, fibre tow or even determined by the comb teeth used when producing the prepreg material. By increasing the distance between crossover points, a larger area can undergo compaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311412988">14</xref></sup> However, the energy required to overcome frictional resistance at crossover points increases with crossover area (due to higher preferential rotational velocities; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311412988">Figure 1</xref>). If each fibre is considered a crossover point, the area and preferential rotational velocity at the crossover point is negligible. It is therefore assumed that the dominating length scale during deformation of cross-plied UD prepreg depends on which deformation mode requires the least energy: interply friction for the larger crossover scales or intraply deformation as the crossover points are defined by the fibre or fibre tow size. Harrison et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311412988">15</xref></sup> models a weave with a constituent-based approach by using the rheology of a viscous textile. This continuum model describes the meso level of deformation both within fibre tows and the matrix. In addition, prediction of a shear locking angle can be made. According to this model, the most significant parameters are viscosity and fibre volume fraction. For cross-plied UD prepreg there is no equivalent to the shear locking angle of a weave; instead, the limit of deformation can be wrinkling or breakage of bonds between fibres.

<p>While several test methods have been developed to measure intra- and interply shear, for example, the picture frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412988">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412988">12</xref></sup> for pure intraply properties and the ‘interlaminar pull-out test’ or ‘lap shear test’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412988">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311412988">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311412988">16</xref></sup> for pure interply properties, the real deformation of a cross-plied UD prepreg is rather a combination of the two.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311412988">7</xref></sup> Comparisons between bias extension and picture frame test methods can be found in Lebrun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412988">11</xref></sup> and Harrison et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412988">12</xref></sup> where it is shown that the picture frame method is sensitive to fibre misalignment. The bias extension test is an off-axis tensile test that can be used to measure intraply shear properties, while allowing potential slip. Intraply slip can either occur as ‘crossover’ or ‘inter-tow’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412988">12</xref></sup> For the bias extension test there can be problems getting precision in the measurement of the fibre angle and low resin viscosity can make the test fall under its own weight. The bias extension test has been shown to be difficult to use for characterization of UD reinforced thermoplastics due to its low integrity at high temperatures, which results in large scatter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311412988">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>The bias extension test is herein used to characterize the forming behaviour of cross-plied UD prepreg; note that this test method corresponds to forming at tension in the plane. During hand lay-up, tension in the plane is one of the forces that introduce shear deformation to make the layer conform to the tool. In the case of diaphragm forming, the prepreg material is partly clamped in between flexible diaphragms and the friction transfers the force to the prepreg laminate. For sheet forming under a single flexible vacuum bag, the lamina is less clamped, but shear is still introduced by the diaphragm. In-plane shear deformation due to tension is important to characterize, as it enables forming of piecewise concave geometries.</p></sec>

<p>Two of the three studied materials are UD, aerospace graded carbon/epoxy prepreg: Cycom 977-2 with high tensile strength fibre from Cytec with a nominal ply thickness of approximately 0.14 mm and a fibre volume fraction of 58 ± 5% and Hexply/M21/35% with T700 fibre from Hexcel with a nominal ply thickness between 0.30 and 0.32 mm. The latter material has a volume fraction of fibres equal to 57%. The third material is Hexply 8552 with an AS4 fibre from Hexcel and a measured ply thickness of 0.15 mm. The material is commercially available with a volume fraction of fibres of 57%, but the herein tested material is specified by Saab Group AB and has a slightly higher volume fraction (not given due to company agreement). The three materials are herein referred to as 977-2, M21 and 8552.</p>
<p>One major difference between the prepreg systems studied is the fibre/matrix distribution within the prepreg. The distribution is partly determined by the type of tougheners used; M21 include thermoplastic particles, while 977-2 and 8552 use a liquid thermoplastic toughener. Due to the thermoplastic particles, the surface area that the thermoset resin needs to cover is larger for the M21 material, which gives that prepreg system a dryer feeling. Further, the particles in the M21 material make the interply interfaces (with particles) more resin rich, forcing a locally higher volume fraction of fibres within and between the fibre tows (see Norrby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup> and Larberg and Åkermo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311412988">19</xref></sup> for further details). This is valid when the overall volume fraction of fibres is kept constant.</p>
<p>An experimental investigation of the interply friction between two prepreg layers sliding relative each other has shown that the frictional resistance for M21 is approximately 10 times larger than for 977-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412988">9</xref></sup> Further, Jacob<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311412988">20</xref></sup> shows that 8552 has interlaminar frictional properties in the same range of M21, but a different trend according to changes in viscosity. An increased viscosity, that is, a lower temperature, gives an increased friction for 8552, whilst for M21 the friction seems almost constant. From the viscosity curves (given by the material suppliers) some approximate values are extracted and these show that the viscosity of 977-2 and 8552 are in the same order of magnitude for the temperature interval 60–85°C (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311412988">Table 1</xref>). M21 including particles has a significantly higher viscosity. These results indicate that the interlaminar friction is not only driven by the matrix viscosity, but also by the surface structure and ply architecture.

<p>An Instron 4505 machine equipped with a 5 kN load cell was used for all tests. The software used was Cyclic version 7.07.03 from Inersjö Systems AB. The specimen was held in place with pneumatic grips with a clamping force of 1 kN. To control the temperature an environmental chamber surrounded the test set-up. The environmental chamber is customer built by Elastocon AB to suit the Instron 4505 and can be used within a temperature interval of between –40 and 300°C.</p>
<p>To calculate strain and follow the rotation of fibres, an image-processing technique called DIC was used. For this, a software for optical three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) deformation analysis, Aramis provided by GOM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311412988">21</xref></sup> was used. The system is suited to measure 3D deformation and strain, but due to difficulties with the calibration through the glass window of the environmental chamber, only 2D deformation analyses were made within this study. For the present study, the facet size (a group of measuring points) was never less than 2.5 mm. The resolution of the camera used was 1.3 MP and approximately 8 pixel/mm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311412988"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Each specimen consisted of four cross-plied prepreg layers, [+45/–45]<sub>s</sub>. To achieve a well-controlled thickness the hand-laid pieces were vacuum consolidated at room temperature for at least 30 min at –1 bar pressure.</p>
<p>All specimens were of the same size and had an ungripped sample length <italic>L</italic> = 250 mm and initial width <italic>W</italic> = 50 mm. The effective length, <italic>L</italic><sub>eff</sub>, (the part deforming during the test) is 200 mm <inline-formula id="ilm1-0021998311412988"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0021998311412988"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; this is due to the ±45° lay-up and the triangles at each end that remain undeformed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412988">Figure 2</xref>). The test piece needs to have a length to width ratio larger than two to experience relatively uniform shear in zone A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311412988">6</xref></sup> The samples tested in this study had a ratio of five. The tested specimens had different thicknesses; the M21 specimen consisted of four layers of approximately 0.31 mm thick laminas, while 977-2 and 8552 had four 0.14 mm thick layers. After cutting, lines for visual inspection of the deformation were painted onto the surface (using a ruler and a white liquid pen) to mark out the middle of the specimen and the borders of the idealized shear zones, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311412988">Figure 2</xref>. To enable Aramis to register the deformation, a stochastic pattern called speckles was applied to the surface of the sample.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311412988"><title>Test series</title>
<p>In this first study, since the actual deformation modes are not known, testing temperatures were set based on experiences from the workshop during real forming operations (personal communication with Per Hallander). Therefore, 977-2 was tested at 70°C, a temperature known to provide good forming properties. According to experience, M21 requires a higher forming temperature than 977-2, hence it was tested at 85°C, but to be able to compare the systems, tests were performed at 70°C as well. Material 8552 was tested at 45°C and 70°C in order to see how the large change in viscosity affected the forming behaviour. In order to prevent non-preferred cross-linking (curing), no temperatures higher than 90°C should be used (personal communication with Per Hallander).</p>
<p>The influence of strain rates were investigated by performing tests at different cross-head speeds, providing a wide test range covering rates that it is possible to achieve in most forming techniques. The rate of 40 mm/min was chosen as the benchmark rate, since it represents a reasonable local strain rate that is possible during sheet forming. The cross-head rates tested were between 5 and 200 mm/min. All test combinations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311412988">Table 2</xref>.

The results were filtered with a Butterworth filter to get rid of the noise. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311412988">Figure 3</xref>, the low loads registered in the case of 977-2 result in a more noisy response compared to the much higher load levels for the 8552 material.

<p>Although the measured loads sometimes were fairly low and noisy, the results are remarkably repeatable. A typical example, the spread from four tests of 977-2 at 70°C and 40 mm/min, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311412988">Figure 4</xref>. The results are presented as load-displacement curves, representing the recorded values during the test. The strain can be calculated based on the deformations registered with the DIC equipment; however, large deformations and reflections in the surface of the specimen made it difficult for Aramis to keep track of the sample at large displacements. This resulted in a loss of measuring points, and it was not possible to obtain calculations after a certain distance (varying between tests).

<p>The fibre rotation during deformation was determined using the Aramis software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311412988">21</xref></sup> The fibre rotation was measured by marking two facets on either side on the central line and drawing an imaginary line in between them, representing the original fibre direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup> By following these facets (the line) during deformation, the change in fibre angle could be determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311412988">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>The automatically generated results obtained from the Aramis software were complemented with manual measurements, with ImageJ®, on the photos acquired from the tests. These photos were, for example, used to determine the wrinkling onset and the different deformation modes using visual inspection.</p>
<p>The manually measured sample width gives further information on the type of intraply shear occurring, that is, for deformation according to the PJN theory the sample width must reduce correspondingly. However, for samples undergoing partial slip, the degree of material compaction is less and consequently the reduction in sample width during deformation is smaller. Measuring the instantaneous sample width during testing thereby offers a mean to verify the automatically generated results obtained from the software. This has been used during the initial trials to verify the methodology.</p></sec></sec>

<p>The common flaws coupled to prepreg forming are fibre misalignment, in-plane fibre buckling, laminate wrinkling and an undesirable change in thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412988">1</xref></sup> Wrinkling was the most common flaw during bias extension testing of 977-2 and 8552, which is herein defined as visible out-of-plane roughness as the fibre bundles start climbing on top of each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup> The deformation at wrinkling initiation (for 977-2 and 8552) was determined by studying the pictures from the DIC. Wrinkling initiation is marked in the load-displacement curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412988">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311412988">7</xref>.

<p>For M21 the final deformation limit was splitting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412988">Figure 8</xref>), which occurs when the bond between fibres is broken. This seems to happen when the force required to rotate is larger than the friction between the layers.

<p>Most of the tested samples showed similar evolution during the bias extension testing. During the first phase, deformation was seemingly continuous and the sample centre line was neither tilted nor broken. Thereafter, the centre line was broken up into bands. Resulting band formations can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311412988">Figure 9</xref>. The onset of band formation was different between the material systems, where 977-2 was deformed continuously at a higher level of displacement. The 977-2 material showed band formation at approximately 13 mm (6.5%) of deformation, whilst the M21 broke up earlier. Material 8552 tested at 70°C formed wider bands than the other materials, although at approximately the same displacement as M21 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311412988">Figure 7</xref>). The exception was the samples of 8552 tested at 45°C, where no band formation occurred, but instead the fibres rotated more in the mid-region and less closer to the edges, resulting in an s-shape in the plane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311412988">Figure 10</xref>). The results for M21 can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311412988">Figure 11</xref> and for 977-2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412988">Figure 6</xref>, where the transitions are marked by symbols. The first transition is the onset of breaking of the line marked on the middle of the sample (shown by diamonds); the development of distinct bands is noted by the circles. Splitting of the sample (for M21, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412988">Figure 8</xref>) or wrinkling initiation (for 977-2 and 8552) can be seen as the limit of deformation and is marked by stars. M21 specimens showed splitting of bands at approximately 25% elongation and in several places at the same time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311412988">Figure 11</xref>).

<p>It is interesting to note the influence of deformation speed on the band width. For 977-2, the width of these bands depended on strain rate; a slower rate results in wider bands (see Norrby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup> and Larberg and Åkermo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311412988">19</xref></sup> for further details). Earlier published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412988">9</xref></sup> show that the interply friction coefficient increases with increased deformation rate for 977-2. Since wider bands results in higher preferential velocities at the interply area (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311412988">Figure 1</xref>), these results indicate a transfer in length scales in order to allow for interply friction. The band width varies from just 1–2 mm for the samples tested at 200 mm/min, up to around 7 mm for the ones tested at 5 mm/min. Further experiments and measurements of the developed length scales are needed to verify this behaviour.</p>
<p>M21 behaves differently and the band width seems to be constant and independent of deformation rate in the tested interval. Measurements on the interply friction of M21, presented by Larberg and Åkermo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412988">9</xref></sup> show that the friction is fairly constant with increased rate of deformation, whilst for 977-2 the load increases with increasing rate. Potter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311412988">7</xref></sup> discusses the influence of the resin-rich areas between the tows and claims that a great bulk of the deformation takes place there. The tow width for M21 is approximately 1.5 mm and the band width is probably a multiple of tows, due to the lower intraply friction between the tows. For M21 the width of the sample was split up into eight or nine bands, which means that each band probably consists of four tows.</p>
<p>The maximum elongation before wrinkling for 977-2 is in the interval 10%–25% (based on an effective deformation zone of 200 mm). As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412988">Figure 6</xref>, loading at a lower rate, a significantly higher deformation level could be reached before wrinkling initiation. Since a lower deformation rate results in wider slip-bands, the results indicate that the wider slip-bands are more forgiving and enable higher deformation before wrinkling. For M21, the effect of a change in the rate of deformation is smaller; the load is higher for a faster rate, but the band width and the limit of deformation are more or less unaffected.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998311412988"><title>Deformation loads</title>
<p>The force required to deform the bias extension specimens is shown to be strain-rate dependent: the higher the strain rate, the higher the load required. This holds for both 977-2 and M21 (for the strain-rate dependency see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412988">Figure 6</xref> and 11, respectively). Note that the 977-2 material is tested at 70ºC, while the M21 material is tested at 85ºC. However, the same trend could be seen for all tested temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The forming properties of 977-2 are known to be good. The material can even be formed at room temperature with successful results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311412988">19</xref></sup> Already from comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311412988">Figure 6</xref> and 11, it is obvious that M21 requires much higher loads to enable forming. As can be seen, the load is often more than three times higher for M21 compared to 977-2.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311412988">Figure 12</xref> it can be seen that an increased temperature will result in a reduced load. For example is the load level reduced by 25% when raising the temperature from 70 °C to 85 °C. This indicates that a temperature variation within the stack during forming can affect where the sliding starts and thereafter propagates. This can result in through thickness variation of the forming and cause initiation of wrinkles, for example in corners.

<p>When comparing the material systems load response, there is a significant difference in load level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311412988">Figure 13</xref>). Material 8552 shows the largest resistance to deformation and, as seen from the DIC measurements, the strain is not uniform. M21 requires less than half the load of 8552 to deform, but it is still around four times higher than 977-2.

<sec id="sec12-0021998311412988"><title>Fibre rotation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311412988">Figure 14</xref> shows a comparison between theoretical fibre rotation using PJN approximation and experimental measurements for the 977-2 prepreg material. The discrepancy is significant, meaning that the fibre rotation is approximately 30% less than that theoretically predicted by PJN. These results strongly indicate that deformation mechanisms other than fibre rotations are active when deforming the 977-2 material. Since the study considers only in-plane deformation and the samples remain symmetric around its vertical central line throughout the tests, interply slippage seems to play an important role.
<fig id="fig14-0021998311412988" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Fibre rotation measured at centre line, 977-2 at 70°C, compared to the theoretical pin-jointed net (PJN) rotation (including the standard deviation from four tests).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311412988-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>M21 shows a more predictable behaviour compared to 977-2 in the case of the fibre rotation and all samples tested follow the PJN approximation almost perfectly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311412988">Figure 15</xref>). Here only the first 20 mm is reported, due to loss of data points for the DIC. Manual measurements confirm that the correlation to the PJN theory continues up to 40 mm of displacement (20% elongation), whereafter the rotation is less than that theoretically predicted. Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311412988">Figure 15</xref> only shows the behaviour at one temperature; however, the same correlation between measured fibre rotation and the PJN theory could be observed for all other temperatures and lay-up methods tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311412988">18</xref></sup>

<p>Due to non-uniform strain fields when testing 8552 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311412988">Figure 16</xref>), the measurements were dependent on the initial point of measure and are not showing a consistent fibre rotation. The contraction of the width was shown to be less than that theoretically expected, whilst the fibre rotation could be both over and under that predicted compared to theory. The over prediction is not possible if the material would deform uniformly, which concludes that these samples behave non-uniformly. The very high volume fraction of fibres and tight packing give little space for compaction and could be reasons for this behaviour.
<fig id="fig16-0021998311412988" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>Strain field after 10 mm displacement for bias extension on 8552.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311412988-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It should be noted that these results holds for the [±45]<sub>s</sub> stacking considered in this study. Initial trials with other stacking angles indicate that the M21 material does not follow the PJN theory for all stacking sequences. This is currently under investigation in a related study.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311412988" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, the bias extension test method has been used to study the deformability of three different prepreg systems. The fibre rotation was followed by the use of DIC. This methodology gave good, comparative results for 977-2 and M21, but not for 8552. The strain distribution was in the case of 8552 non-uniform, with areas (along the fibres) of much larger strain, which made the measurements dependent on the measuring point. For one sample the difference was up to 100% when using the DIC. Manual measurements from photos gave in that case better predictions, but in general the difference was the same for manual and DIC-produced data. Given this, the non-uniform strain field invalidates the PJN-assumption. The very high volume fraction of fibres can be one reason for this behaviour.</p>
<p>By studying pictures from the tests, the evolution of deformation length scales and possibly also dominating mechanisms was detected; initially the deformation occurred seemingly continuously, but as deformation continued the deformation occurred in the form of bands with no further shearing of the material inside the bands. The theory implies that intraply shear dominates during the first stage, while interply friction plays an important role in the latter. The 8552 material tested at 45°C is shown to be an exception; here no band sliding is seen, instead the intraply deformation continuous. This is probably due to its large resistance to interlaminar motion at this high viscosity.</p>
<p>The results show that the degree of fibre rotation could not be related to the resistance to deform. The load response from the two different material systems looked similar in shape, although they differed significantly when considering fibre rotation. The behaviour of the prepreg with thermoplastic particles (M21) followed the PJN assumption, while the tested second generation of prepreg (977-2) differed by up to 30%. Slippage seems to be the explanation to the large discrepancy for the latter material system. These results show a more predictable behaviour according to final fibre angles for M21 than 977-2, which is of great importance when calculating the final strength and shape distortions of the component.</p>
<p>The study also showed a large difference in resistance to deformation: although having lower matrix viscosity the load response during deformation was significantly higher for the 8552 material than for the M21 material. This could be related to the 8552 high fibre volume content and therefore there being less space when it is exposed to shear deformation. The 977-2 material, with a viscosity in the same range as 8552, shows a much lower resistance to deform than both the M21 and 8552 materials. This concludes that it is not only the matrix viscosity that affects the forming behaviour.</p>
<p>In addition, the deformation modes and their limits were shown to differ between the material systems. Wrinkling was developed at approximately 25% of deformation for 977-2 and around 15% strain for 8552, but could not be detected for M21. Instead of developing wrinkles during deformation, the M21 material split up into bands. It was also noted that a slower deformation rate resulted in less wrinkling for 977-2. This can be an interesting parameter when choosing the forming speed for complicated shapes.</p>
<p>The temperature distribution during forming has been shown to be an important parameter affecting the degree of deformation. The results for M21 show that an increased temperature gives a lower load response. A rise from 70 to 85ºC lowered the load by approximately 25%. Temperature variation, both through the thickness and in-plane, can consequently obstruct the correct forming and thereby cause wrinkles, especially in corners. A too high temperature can, on the other hand, lead to uncontrolled slipping and result in unpredictable fibre angles.</p></sec>
