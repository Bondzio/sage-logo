<p><italic>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</italic></p>
<p>Joel B. Green, Jacqueline E. Lapsley, Rebecca Miles, and Allen Verhey, editors</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2011. 889 pp. $59.99</p>
<p>When a student or scholar embarks on a new study of a person or issue, reading a dictionary article can identify key components of the topic and provide a roadmap for additional research. Two commendable theological dictionaries are now available. The first, <italic>Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics</italic>, seeks to help readers navigate the complex and sometimes controversial issues that arise at the intersection of biblical studies and ethics. Three types of readers make up the intended audience of this dictionary: students, pastors, and scholars. The dictionary aims to (1) provide students with a survey of the literature and an introduction to the ethics of Scripture, the relevance of Scripture for contemporary moral issues, and the various ways one moves between ethics and Scripture, (2) help pastors understand the relation between Scripture and ethics for preaching, teaching, and pastoral care, and (3) assist biblical scholars and ethicists in understanding each other’s disciplines.</p>
<p>Three excellent introductory essays set the stage for subsequent entries: “Ethics in Scripture” (Allen Verhey), “Scripture in Ethics: A History” (Charles H. Cosgrove), and “Scripture in Ethics: Methodological Issues” (Bruce C. Birch). These three introductory essays are followed by alphabetical entries that address the relation of Scripture and ethics, ethics within Scripture, and particular issues in Christian ethics. There are 500 entries penned by more than 200 contributors. The entries are ecumenical in scope and written by theological and biblical scholars who represent a variety of denominations and a range of perspectives: Reformed, Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, evangelical, feminist, liberationist, and various combinations of the above. Princeton Seminary professors who contributed to the volume are: Ellen Charry (Happiness; Supersessionism), Chip Dobbs-Allsopp (Lamentations; Poetic Discourse and Ethics; Song of Songs), myself (Alcohol; Just Wage; Singleness), Jacqueline Lapsley (Emotion; Empathy; Moral Agency; Biblical Narrative Ethics; Priestly Literature; Ruth; Ten Commandments), Eunny Lee (Ecclesiastes; Isaiah), Gordon Mikoski (Practices), and Leong Seow (Job). One will also find several entries by Princeton Seminary professor emeritus, Max Stackhouse.</p>
<p>At nearly $60.00, the book is expensive, but not completely prohibitive and less expensive copies will inevitably be available online. This is a book that students and scholars would do well to have on their shelves.</p>
