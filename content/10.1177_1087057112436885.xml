<abstract>
<p>Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is an essential process in bacteria and is therefore a suitable target for the discovery of new antibacterial drugs. One of the last cytoplasmic steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is catalyzed by the integral membrane protein MraY, which attaches soluble UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide to the membrane-bound acceptor undecaprenyl phosphate. Although several natural product–derived inhibitors of MraY are known, none have the properties necessary to be of clinical use as antibacterial drugs. Here we describe a novel, homogeneous, fluorescence resonance energy transfer–based MraY assay that is suitable for high-throughput screening for novel MraY inhibitors. The assay allows for continuous measurement, or it can be quenched prior to measurement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most bacterial pathogens require continuous biosynthesis and remodeling of their peptidoglycan cell walls for survival. Some antibacterial drugs interfere with periplasmic/extracellular steps in this process, such as β-lactams (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins), vancomycin, and ramoplanin. Fosfomycin, which inhibits MurA, and D-cycloserine, which inhibits alanine racemase and D-Ala-D-Ala ligase, are the only existing antibacterial drugs that inhibit the cytoplasmic enzymes directly involved in peptidoglycan precursor biosynthesis. Recent attempts to discover novel antibacterial drugs have targeted many of these cytoplasmic enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112436885">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112436885">2</xref></sup> One of the last cytoplasmic steps in bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis is the attachment of UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (UNAM-pp) to the membrane-bound carrier lipid undecaprenyl phosphate (C<sub>55</sub>P) by the translocase enzyme MraY (E.C. 2.7.8.13), an integral membrane protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112436885">3</xref></sup> Several natural product inhibitors of this enzyme have been discovered that have antibacterial activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057112436885">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057112436885">5</xref></sup> such as mureidomycin, liposidomycin, capuramycin, and muraymycin, validating MraY as a target for antibacterial drugs. None of these natural product inhibitors has reached clinical practice in humans, however.</p>
<p>High-throughput screening of chemical compound libraries is one approach that could be used to search for new drug-like inhibitors of MraY as starting points for antibacterial drug discovery. Screening assays suitable for this purpose are required. Weppner and Neuhaus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057112436885">6</xref></sup> introduced the use of <italic>N</italic>-dansyl-UNAM-pp, the fluorescence intensity of which increases when it is translocated from the bulk aqueous phase to a lipid membrane or detergent micelle containing MraY and C<sub>55</sub>P. Stachyra et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112436885">7</xref></sup>showed how this technique could be used in a high-throughput screening format. Other investigators have reported radioisotope-based high-throughput-compatible MraY assays, such as scintillation proximity assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112436885">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087057112436885">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we report a novel, homogeneous fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)–based assay for the translocase activity of MraY in which the donor fluorophore is attached to UNAM-pp and the acceptor is embedded in detergent micelles containing MraY and C<sub>55</sub>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). The new assay has certain advantages over previously reported MraY assays. (1) It uses no radioisotopes, avoiding the difficulties associated with radioactive waste disposal and equipment contamination, as well as the high cost of scintillation proximity beads or assay plates. (2) The excitation wavelength of the FRET donor fluorophore is in the visible part of the spectrum rather than the ultraviolet, as with the dansyl label, reducing the interference from test compound light absorption and autofluorescence. (3) By measuring the ratio of fluorescence intensities of acceptor to donor fluorophores when donor fluorophore excitation is used, the FRET assay has greater precision than a single fluorescence intensity measurement. The FRET assay can be used in either continuous or quenched mode.</p>

<caption><p>Schematic of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for MraY activity. When detergent micelles containing solubilized MraY protein from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> membranes (blue) as well as C<sub>55</sub>P (gray) and FRET acceptor lipid (red) are mixed with UNAM-pp (purple) labeled with FRET donor (green), MraY catalyzes the transfer of the labeled UNAM-pp to the C<sub>55</sub>P, bringing the FRET donor into close proximity to the FRET acceptor. Energy transfer between the donor and acceptor (represented by lightning bolts) causes a reduction in donor fluorescence and, potentially, an increase in acceptor fluorescence. The increase in acceptor fluorescence may not be observed if the donor concentration is much lower than the acceptor concentration or if the acceptor is not fluorescent. In the method reported here, the FRET donor attached to UNAM-pp is BODIPY-FL (B-UNAM-pp), and the FRET acceptor lipid is Lissamine rhodamine B dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (LRPE).</p></caption>

<title>Cloning and expression of <italic>E. coli mraY</italic></title>
<p><italic>E. coli mraY</italic> cloning followed the method previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112436885">10</xref></sup> The <italic>mraY</italic> gene was cloned from chromosomal DNA of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655 using the polymerase chain reaction. Amplification was performed using High Fidelity PCR Master (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and the following primers (Eurofins MWG Operon, Huntsville, AL): 5′-AGGAACATGTCCCATCACCATCACCATCACATGTTAGTTTGGCTGGCCG-3′ and 5′-TAGGAGATCTTTA ACGTACCTTCAGCGTTGCC-3′.</p>
<p>The PCR product was digested with Pci1 and Bgl11 and then purified using a QuickStep 2 PCR Purification Kit (EDGE Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). The resulting fragment was then ligated to expression vector pET28b (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ), which had been digested with Nco1 and BamH1, producing the plasmid pET28b-mraY. The DNA sequence of the cloned <italic>mraY</italic> gene, including an N-terminal His6 tag, was confirmed by sequencing on an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Computer analysis of DNA sequences was performed with Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).</p>
<p>For membrane preparation, the plasmid was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3)ΔacrB and plated on Luria-Bertani agar containing 25 µg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. A single colony of BL21(DE3)ΔacrB/pET28b-mraY was inoculated into a 25 mL culture of 2XYT (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) with 0.2% glucose containing 25 µg/mL kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C. Ten milliliters of the overnight culture was added per 1 L of 2XYT with 0.2% glucose containing 25 µg/mL kanamycin and grown at 37 °C with aeration to the mid-logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.4). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 25 °C. Cell paste was stored at −20 °C.</p>

<title>Preparation of membranes from MraY-overexpressing E. coli</title>
<p>All operations were performed at 4 °C. The pellets from 2 L of bacterial culture were suspended in 40 mL of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were disrupted by passing them twice through a French press operated at 18 000 psi. The extract was centrifuged at 3500<italic>g</italic> for 45 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 150 000<italic>g</italic> for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended with 40 mL of lysis buffer and ultracentrifuged as before three times. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057112436885">11</xref></sup> The membrane preparation was stored at −80 °C. The MraY activity in these membranes was approximately twofold higher than in membranes prepared from cells lacking the MraY expression vector. MraY is a low-abundance protein, and no band having visibly increased thickness corresponding to MraY was visible by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of membranes from MraY-overexpressing cells.</p>

<title>Preparation of N-BODIPY-FL-UNAM-pp (B-UNAM-pp)</title>
<p>All operations were performed at room temperature. UNAM-pp was labeled on the free amino group of diaminopimelic acid by reaction with BODIPY-FL-sulfosuccinimidyl ester (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Four milligrams of UNAM-pp in 733 µL of 0.4M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was mixed with 5 mg of solid BODIPY-FL-sulfosuccinimidyl ester. After a 1 h reaction, the reaction mixture was passed over a 1 × 18 cm column of Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma) equilibrated and eluted with distilled water. Fractions of 1 mL were collected and analyzed by UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry. All experiments described herein were performed with one fraction that showed a single peak by HPLC and had the correct mass of 1468 Da.</p>

<title>Fluorescence measurements</title>
<p>MraY reactions were performed in triplicate at room temperature in 8 or 9 µL volume in low-volume, 384-well, black, polystyrene assay plates (Matrix Technologies). Fluorescence was excited at 485 nm, and emission was measured simultaneously at 520 nm and 590 nm with a Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC). The gain for both emission channels was 20. The focal height was 10.6 mm. Each reading usually consisted of 20 flashes. Measurements were made at 1 min intervals for 1 h. Triplicate time courses were averaged.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The principle of the MraY FRET assay is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Detergent micelles containing MraY protein, the lipid substrate C<sub>55</sub>P, and the FRET acceptor-labeled lipid LRPE are combined with the soluble FRET donor-labeled peptide substrate B-UNAM-pp. The translocase activity of MraY attaches B-UNAM-pp to C<sub>55</sub>P, bringing the FRET donor into proximity with the FRET acceptor. When the donor fluorescence is excited, energy transfer from donor to acceptor results in a decrease in donor fluorescence and, potentially, an increase in acceptor fluorescence. We used purified membranes from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells overexpressing <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY as the source of MraY, but the assay could also use purified MraY.</p>
<p>BODIPY-FL was selected as the FRET donor for attachment to B-UNAM-pp because it has very bright fluorescence; its excitation and emission wavelengths are similar to those of fluorescein, allowing standard filters to be used in assay plate readers; it resists photobleaching, making it suitable for a continuous assay that requires repeated exposure to excitation light; and it is available commercially as a water-soluble sulfosuccinimidyl ester at an acceptable cost for use in UNAM-pp labeling. LRPE was selected as the FRET acceptor lipid because it has a suitable degree of overlap between its absorbance spectrum and the emission spectrum of BODIPY-FL, it is available commercially at an acceptable cost, and it has saturated acyl chains, avoiding instability due to oxidation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows the measurement of MraY activity using the FRET assay with <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes from cells in which MraY was overexpressed. The LRPE concentration was varied with 2 µM B-UNAM-pp, 20 µM C<sub>55</sub>P, and 50 µg/mL membrane protein. The Triton X-100 concentration was 0.05%. Reactions were run with or without 5 mM UMP as a negative control. The MraY reaction is reversible, and the product UMP acts as an inhibitor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref> shows the time- and MraY-dependent reduction in B-UNAM-pp fluorescence at 520 nm due to FRET between B-UNAM-pp and LRPE when the system is exposed to 485 nm excitation. The essentially constant fluorescence in the presence of 5 mM UMP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>) has been subtracted. The 520 nm fluorescence decrease should be directly proportional to the consumption of B-UNAM-pp. The extent of the B-UNAM-pp fluorescence decrease was larger at higher LRPE concentrations because of the greater proximity of LRPE acceptor molecules to BODIPY-FL-labeled product molecules at higher LRPE concentrations. There was no further increase in the effect at LRPE concentrations greater than 24 µM, suggesting either that the capacity of the detergent micelles for LRPE had been reached or that no further increase in energy transfer efficiency between BODIPY-FL-labeled product and LRPE was possible. At the same time, there was an MraY- and time-dependent LRPE fluorescence increase at 590 nm due to FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>), on which there was only a modest effect of LRPE concentration, with a maximal effect at 16 µM LRPE. LRPE fluorescence is a combination of its own fluorescence due to excitation by 485 nm light and FRET-enhanced fluorescence. As the LRPE concentration increases relative to the B-UNAM-pp concentration, a greater proportion of the 590 nm fluorescence is not due to FRET and therefore does not respond to the MraY reaction. In addition, self-absorption of exciting and emitted light (inner filter effect) at high LRPE concentrations reduces the measured fluorescence. At 0.1 µM B-UNAM-pp and 16 µM LRPE, the 590 nm fluorescence is essentially constant during the MraY reaction because the contribution from FRET is negligible.</p>
<p>The presence of the LRPE FRET acceptor is not necessary for the MraY reaction to occur, although it cannot be detected by a B-UNAM-pp fluorescence intensity change. The B-UNAM-pp fluorescence anisotropy, in contrast, increased with time in the absence of UMP but not in its presence (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S1</bold>), as expected because of translocation of B-UNAM-pp from the aqueous medium to C<sub>55</sub>P at the micelle surface by the action of MraY. In principle, the B-UNAM-pp fluorescence anisotropy increase could be used for an MraY assay, although the size of the change may not be sufficient for screening purposes.</p>
<p>The change in the 590 nm to 520 nm fluorescence emission ratio as a function of MraY reaction time (without UMP minus with UMP) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>. This measurement is the difference between fluorescence intensity ratios, not the ratio of the differences, that is, Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>), not ΔF<sub>590</sub>/ΔF<sub>520</sub>. The ratiometric measurement has less noise than the individual fluorescence intensity measurements because it eliminates fluctuations that affect both measurements equally. The ratio change increased in size with reaction time and with LRPE concentration. The curves have a distinctly sigmoid shape (see below). The theoretical explanation for this behavior of the fluorescence ratio change in FRET assays has been given previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057112436885">12</xref></sup> It is due mainly to the fact that although the numerator may be constant or increase slightly, the denominator decreases in direct proportion to the fraction of substrate converted to product.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>, the fluorescence ratio change is shown with time at 16 µM LRPE with and without 5 mM UMP. With the inhibitor present, there is a negligible change in the fluorescence ratio, whereas without UMP, there is a large increase in the fluorescence ratio with time. The inhibitory effect of UMP demonstrates that the signal in the assay is due to the MraY reaction. The progress curve of the uninhibited reaction shows the characteristic concavity at shorter reaction times and then levels off at longer reaction times because the reaction slows down as the substrate is consumed and the products accumulate, resulting in a sigmoid shape.</p>
<p>The concave shape of the plot of Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) versus percentage of substrate consumed is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112436885"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> for the MraY FRET assay with 0.1 µM B-UNAM-pp and 16 µM LRPE.

<p>The response of the MraY translocase activity in the FRET assay to the concentration of activating Mg<sup>2+</sup> was investigated by varying the concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). MraY catalytic activity has been shown to be dependent on Mg<sup>2+</sup>, although it is also activated by a higher range of Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112436885">10</xref></sup>There was an initial steep increase of the rate with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations up to about 4 mM, with half-maximal effect at 0.65 mM. This probably represents the participation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> as a cosubstrate in the active site, interacting with the diphosphate moiety of UNAM-pp. The shallower increase of the rate with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations above 4 mM probably represents the activating effect of high ionic strength, which has also been observed with several other salts not containing Mg<sup>2+</sup>, none of which showed the steep phase of MraY activation at low salt concentrations (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S2</bold>). The Mg<sup>2+</sup>cosubstrate may be considered a possible target for competition by inhibitors, as has been suggested for the MraY inhibitor mureidomycin A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057112436885">14</xref></sup> but on the other hand, it may also form a complex with an inhibitor and thereby increase its potency. A prudent strategy, therefore, is to use a Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the assay similar to the activation constant for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.65 mM in this case, to balance the assay for sensitivity to both types of inhibitor.</p>

<p>First, with either readout, the IC<sub>50</sub> of tunicamycin increased as the B-UNAM-pp concentration increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>B</bold></xref>), whereas the IC<sub>50</sub> of tunicamycin decreased as the C<sub>55</sub>P concentration increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>D</bold></xref>). These results are consistent with competition by tunicamycin with B-UNAM-pp. Interestingly, the low-nanomolar tunicamycin IC<sub>50</sub>s with <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY are considerably lower than previously reported. Solapure et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112436885">8</xref></sup> reported an IC<sub>50</sub> of 360 nM in an assay containing 9 µM UNAM-pp, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and only endogenous C<sub>55</sub>P from the membranes used as a source of MraY. Stachyra et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112436885">7</xref></sup> reported an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 µM in an assay containing 50 µM C<sub>55</sub>P and 25 µM dansyl-UNAM-pp in 0.1% TX-100 and 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Brandish et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112436885">15</xref></sup> reported a K<sub>i</sub> of 0.55 µM from experiments in which each substrate (dansyl-UNAM-pp and C<sub>60</sub>P) concentration was varied at a fixed concentration of the other in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Several factors may contribute to the observed differences, including differences in the substrate, detergent, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and other salt concentrations. In our assay, for example, the IC<sub>50</sub> of tunicamycin was increased 2.2-fold when the Triton X-100 concentration was increased from 0.04% to 0.1% at 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 3.3-fold when the MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration was increased from 1 mM to 10 mM at 0.04% Triton X-100.</p>
<p>Second, IC<sub>50</sub>s measured with Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>C</bold></xref>) were lower than IC<sub>50</sub>s measured with ΔF<sub>520</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087057112436885"><bold>D</bold></xref>) by a factor of about 2. This effect is due to the concave shape of the curve of Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) versus reaction progress (see above), causing reductions in the amount of product formed to reduce Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) by a larger amount than ΔF<sub>520</sub>, which is directly proportional to the reaction progress.</p>
<p>Third, IC<sub>50</sub>s measured with Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) in most cases exhibited less increase than those measured with ΔF<sub>520</sub> as a result of extending reaction progress beyond the time during which the reaction was running at its initial velocity, which was approximately 10 min. This effect is also due to the concave shape of the curve of Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) versus reaction progress. We conclude that the use of Δ(F<sub>590</sub>/F<sub>520</sub>) is advantageous in comparison to ΔF<sub>520</sub>, offering a higher signal-to-noise ratio, twofold greater sensitivity to inhibition, and resistance to the loss of sensitivity to inhibition that accompanies running the reaction beyond its initial rate. The ability to run the reaction beyond its initial rate without significant loss of sensitivity to inhibition is valuable in that it allows for a larger signal-to-baseline ratio.</p>
<p>High-throughput screening runs may last for several hours, so it is important that the assay reagents be stable for the necessary amount of time. We found that there was a substantial loss of activity of the MraY assay reagents during storage as 2X solutions at room temperature during 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>) but that the activity could be stabilized by the inclusion of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>), a sugar that can stabilize proteins against thermal denaturation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112436885">16</xref></sup> with little effect on the rate of the MraY reaction. The time-dependent loss of activity of detergent-solubilized <italic>E. coli</italic> MraY was previously observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057112436885">17</xref></sup> A similar degree of stabilization was also observed with 10% to 20% (v/v) glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 6B</bold></xref>) and 50 µg/mL phosphatidylglycerol (PG) from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 6C</bold></xref>), but these substances inhibited the MraY reaction substantially. For example, 10% glycerol inhibited by 23% and 50 µg/mL PG inhibited by 42%, whereas 0.5 M trehalose inhibited by only 8%. Inhibition by glycerol may be due to increased viscosity of the solution, whereas inhibition by PG may be due to reduction of the amount of available detergent in the assay for solubilizing C<sub>55</sub>P and MraY due to the presence of the additional lipid. The observed inhibition by PG contrasts with the 5- to 10-fold stimulatory effect by 100 µg/mL PG observed by Brandish et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087057112436885">13</xref></sup> in an assay that contained 0.25% Triton X-100.

<p>To use the MraY FRET assay in a discontinuous format, the MraY reaction can be quenched by added EDTA in excess of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. With 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the reaction, 2 mM EDTA was sufficient to provide a stable quench, allowing the fluorescence measurements to be made at a later time. A slight loss in signal with time after quenching was observed during a 90 min period (<bold>Supplemental Fig. S3A</bold>), the reason for which is unknown. Based on these results, a satisfactory Z′ figure of merit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057112436885">18</xref></sup> of 0.8 can be calculated for the FRET assay in discontinuous format.

<p>Because the compounds in screening libraries are usually dissolved in DMSO, we tested the effect of typical DMSO concentrations on the MraY activity in the FRET assay (see the Materials and Methods section).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The selection of substrate concentrations to use when screening a compound library for inhibitors of a two-substrate enzyme should be based on knowledge of the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme and the kinetic constants of the substrates. These enable the calculation of the sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>/K<sub>i</sub>) of the assay to detection of inhibitors with various modes of inhibition using kinetic rate equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057112436885">19</xref></sup> It has not been possible to take this rigorous approach with the MraY FRET assay, however, because the kinetic mechanism is not known and one of the substrates, C<sub>55</sub>P, is not water soluble. Because C<sub>55</sub>P and MraY are dissolved in detergent and the binding of C<sub>55</sub>P by MraY occurs in the detergent micelle, the local concentration of C<sub>55</sub>P at the MraY active site can neither be assumed to be equal to the overall C<sub>55</sub>P concentration nor to be necessarily directly proportional to it over the entire concentration range. Therefore, neither the Michaelis constant nor the dissociation constant of C<sub>55</sub>P can be accurately measured. An additional complication is that the local concentration of C<sub>55</sub>P will be affected by the detergent concentration in the assay. Furthermore, minimizing the detergent concentration to minimize inhibitor sequestration by detergent micelles places an upper limit on the C<sub>55</sub>P concentration in the assay. We found that the rate of the MraY reaction was directly proportional to C<sub>55</sub>P concentration within the achievable range of C<sub>55</sub>P concentrations (100 µM with 0.1% Triton X-100).</p>
<p>Lacking the ability to calculate IC<sub>50</sub>/K<sub>i</sub> for inhibitors with various modes of inhibition for the MraY FRET assay as a function of the substrate concentrations, we instead examined how changing the substrate concentrations affected the IC<sub>50</sub> for tunicamycin, an inhibitor thought to be competitive with the water-soluble substrate UNAM-pp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087057112436885">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087057112436885"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). The results showed that the sensitivity of the assay to competitive inhibition by tunicamycin was maximized by minimizing the B-UNAM-pp concentration to 0.2 µM or less. In contrast, increasing the C<sub>55</sub>P concentration increased the sensitivity of the assay to inhibition by tunicamycin. Both results are consistent with various kinetic mechanisms in which tunicamycin competes with UNAM-pp, including the two-step (Ping Pong) mechanism originally proposed by Heydanek et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057112436885">20</xref></sup> and a one-step mechanism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112436885">3</xref></sup> such as steady-state ordered. These results provide guidance for the selection of substrate concentrations when using the FRET assay to screen for UNAM-pp-competitive inhibitors. The substrate concentrations may also be dictated to some extent by practical considerations, such as the cost and difficulty of obtaining the substrates in the necessary quantities.</p>
<p>When screening compound libraries for inhibitors using fluorescence-based assays, it is common to observe interference with measurements from the test compounds due to compound fluorescence, fluorescence quenching, or the inner filter effect (i.e., absorbance of excitation or emission light). Such interference causes errors in the measurement of percentage inhibition and IC<sub>50</sub>. The use of longer-wavelength excitation should reduce, but not eliminate, the sensitivity of the MraY FRET assay described here to these types of interference compared with the dansyl-UNAM- pp fluorescence assay. We previously described a simple method to correct for these types of interference and improve the accuracy of inhibition measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057112436885">21</xref></sup> The method requires a separate measurement of the magnitude and sign of the interference for each sample. For the MraY FRET assay, in which two fluorescence intensity measurements are combined to calculate a fluorescence ratio, this correction procedure must be applied to each of the fluorescence measurements separately before the corrected measurements are combined.</p>
<p>The MraY FRET assay described here, by virtue of its high signal-to-noise ratio, long-wavelength excitation, relatively low cost, simplicity, and high sensitivity to competitive inhibition, should facilitate the discovery of novel MraY inhibitors when used to screen collections of compounds and natural product extracts. Because of the high sensitivity to competitive inhibition, however, the assay may allow the identification of MraY inhibitors that are not potent enough to inhibit MraY within bacterial cells sufficiently under physiological conditions to prevent cell growth. Medicinal chemistry efforts beginning with the inhibitors identified from screening would then be needed to make more potent analogs with antibacterial activity that can form the basis of a novel antibacterial drug discovery program. Examples of successful efforts of this kind with the bacterial targets glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087057112436885">22</xref></sup> and DNA ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087057112436885">23</xref></sup> have recently been published.</p>
