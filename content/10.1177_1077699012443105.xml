<p>Corey Anton of Grand Valley State University has assembled and edited eleven essays that do just what the title promises—examine the very basis of media ethics, morals, and laws. Writers include Lee Thayer, Phil Rose, Stephanie Gibson, and Kathryn Egan, among others, generally a diverse—and brilliant—lot.</p>
<p>Kathryn Egan, beginning with Aristotle, points out that “technology is never neutral.” We had always thought of technology as being clay molded by humans for good or evil. But, Eagan argues, we must not assume that people who receive our messages are like ourselves. In fact, we must recognize how our regular “recipes for doing advertising, practicing public relations, and professional journalism must consider how digitization has altered the way we encounter others.” Indeed.</p>
<p>In his essay, Frank Macke looks at the relationship among intimacy, community, and nostalgia. Macke argues that it is communication at the speed of life. This book is part of the Hampton Press communication series on media ecology, and no less a luminary in the world of media ethics and journalism/mass communication education than Clifford G. Christians calls the book “phosphorescent.”</p>
<p>This book will challenge the social underpinnings of professors and students interested in more than how journalists gather, write, and edit news messages. But even if these are your interests, there is much to ponder. Thayer, in a discussion of “ethics unwired,” asks, “Is it ‘ethical’ to support an economy based mainly on credentialism and not on value added to society or civilization?” This question is difficult to shake as one continues through the rest of the essays, which add other provocative questions. What does journalism add to the quality of our public and private lives? How can we measure it? <italic>Should</italic> we measure it?</p>
<p>You will not forget this book.</p>
