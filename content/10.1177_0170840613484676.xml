<p>Organizational theory has been under attack recently, with serious scholars questioning its commitment to theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840613484676">Davis, 2006</xref>), its relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613484676">Pfeffer &amp; Fong, 2004</xref>) and ultimately its future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613484676">Walsh, Meyer, &amp; Schoonhoven, 2006</xref>). Institutional theory bears some responsibility for these claims of declining relevance, inasmuch as it dominates the agenda of the Organization and Management Theory (OMT) division of the Academy of Management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613484676">Davis, 2005</xref>) and has suffered its own claims of growing incoherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840613484676">Suddaby, 2010</xref>). But there is hope for organization theory, and perhaps even institutional theory, as evidenced by Westenholz’s masterful volume of studies on open source software.</p>
<p>Westenholz, who authors most of the contributions to this volume, organizes the book around a compelling combination of ethnographic and interview data that provides a rich and nuanced understanding of the emerging new world of software development. While the manifest content of the book pits the world of for-profit, commercial corporations against the self-organized, not-for-profit open collaborative communities, it is the <italic>latent</italic> content of the book that provides real impact. The latent message, of interest to both institutional and organizational theorists, is that the world of work is changing and that organizations (corporations, not-for-profits, universities) really don’t matter as much as they used to.</p>
<p>The guiding idea of the book is that the world of software development is torn between the past and the future. The past refers to traditional models of capitalism and corporate forms of organization. Software development was traditionally housed within organizations that most organization theorists would recognize – large, for-profit firms with an ideological commitment to private property. Westenholz, however, introduces us to the fascinating new world of open source communities, where very bright and creative people are no longer burdened by traditional assumptions of private property, of how work should be performed or how it should be organized. Out of this essential tension, between the old and the new, the past and the future, Westenholz and colleagues describe a new, sedimentary amalgam of old and new forms of organization that delicately negotiates between private property and communal ownership to create an interesting intermediate form of organization that most organization theory professors simply would not recognize.</p>
<p>The book is comprised of five chapters. The first, authored by Westenholz, describes the empirical and theoretical intent of the book. Empirically, the authors’ intent is to introduce the reader to the fascinating ‘small world’ of collaborative software development. Theoretically, Westenholz is interested in exploring the limitations of traditional neo-institutionalism, recognizing fully that the study captures a tension between old and new logics of capitalism but seeking to understand how this tension is resolved as a process of institutional work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840613484676">Lawrence &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>). In stating this, Westenholz joins the growing cadre of institutional theorists dissatisfied with the impoverished view of contemporary neo-institutionalism in which ‘logics’ and ‘agency’ are invoked without inhabiting institutions with individuals who can think and act. Instead, Westenholz seeks to and succeeds in offering an explanatory account of institutional change in which the institutions are populated by actual people who, with a high degree of reflexivity and agency, openly engage in processes of work designed to change prevailing institutions.</p>
<p>The second chapter, also authored by Westenholz, offers a fascinating account of the history of open source software development. The chapter describes the growing tension between traditional business models of software development, dominated by large corporations and the emerging open source movement, populated by individuals interested in maximizing the diffusion of their creation without traditional assumptions of private property, ownership or profit.</p>
<p>This community is elaborated more fully in the third chapter, authored by Westenholz, Benedict Brincker and Peter Gundelach, in which the reader is introduced to TYPO3, which perhaps best exemplifies the sedimentation of traditional capitalist models of organization by new, open source, forms of organizing. More than a simplistic pluralism or hybrid form of organizing, the authors describe this mix of old and new ideologies of software development as an ‘a la carte’ community. The phrase is more than an apt in that it describes a very deliberate, highly agentic and completely reflexive choice by individuals of elements of the old and new models of organizing on a purely pragmatic basis. This analysis succinctly puts to rest the traditional assumptions of neo-institutionalism which suggests that actors are only dimly aware of their institutional environment and are subject to murky ‘logics’ and pressures imposed on them by this environment. Instead, the authors present a story of highly intelligent individuals, fully aware of the constraints imposed on them by their institutional environment, and yet actively engaged in efforts to subvert those pressures. Unsurprisingly, some of their choices incorporate the traditional models of capitalism, but many do not.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, authored by Malgorzata Ciesielska, explores Nokia’s role in engaging with open source communities. The chapter describes an interesting and increasingly complex organizational ecology populated by for-profit behemoths, such as Nokia, Google and Microsoft, and a vast range of small open source communities. Ciesielska focuses empirically on the relationship between Nokia and GNOME, a small open source community that was highly suspicious of Nokia. To facilitate the collaboration, Nokia created its own entity called Maemo. The process described in this chapter offers a fascinating account of the range and creativity of institutional work emanating both from massive multinational corporations and small communities of individuals loathe to participate in traditional capitalist pursuits.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, Westenholz does her ‘due diligence’ in capturing these astounding empirical accounts in the context of traditional neo-institutional explanations of competing logics and institutional entrepreneurship. This is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the least compelling portion of the volume. Thankfully, Westenholz quickly moves to more process oriented explanations of this rich data, acknowledging that the open source movement and its collaboration with for-profit corporations, represents a profound example of institutional work in which exemplary organizations from the past (i.e. corporations) are forced to create new entities that defy the term ‘organization’, in order to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>The true brilliance of this volume arises from its latent content. The implicit narrative of this book is that traditional organizational theory and neo-institutionalism are becoming irrelevant because they have lost their engagement with changes that are occurring in the world. Traditional notions of ‘organization’ do not fully capture the ideology, structure and motivation of open source communities. While we might think that large companies such as Nokia are ‘co-opting’ open source communities, one might as easily read this book to arrive at the opposite conclusion – i.e. open source communities are cleverly and deliberately choosing particulate elements of traditional corporations that suit their purpose, and are discarding the rest. Similarly, traditional notions of neo-institutionalism, with its emphasis on vaguely defined logics that compel actors to conform to undefined social pressures, simply do not resonate in a context where very bright, highly reflexive and openly ambitious entrepreneurs engage in processes and practices designed to subvert the dominant ideology of capitalism.</p>
<p>Like Janus, the god of gates and doors, beginnings and endings, the future and the past, <italic>The Janus Face of Commercial Open Source Software Communities</italic> sets out a serious challenge for organization and institutional theory. The first challenge is empirical. We need a broader and better understanding of the new ecology of organizing that is unfolding in the world. Traditional models of organization theory are largely disconnected from this phenomenon. The second challenge is theoretical. Theories that imply that actors lack agency, that logics are imposed from undefined global forces and individuals lack awareness and agency over institutions are ill suited to this fascinating empirical world in which individuals actively engage in ideological debates about how to engage with institutions and generate institutional change.</p>
