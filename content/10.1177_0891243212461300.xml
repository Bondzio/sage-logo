<p>In this collaborative book project, authors L. Susan Williams and Michelle Bemiller investigate the global phenomenon of “gender parties,” which they loosely define as get-togethers of mostly women organized around the sale of products, such as cosmetics, sex toys, kitchenware, and other goods marketed distinctly to women. As its title indicates, <italic>Women at Work: Tupperware, Passion Parties, and Beyond</italic>, this book covers considerable ground, in which they present 12 unique field studies from contributing authors written with a focus on production or consumption within direct selling organizations such as Mary Kay and Pampered Chef, and even illegal parties selling counterfeit purses. The book includes some less obviously comparative gendered worlds of work like Brazilian street vending, Czech home-based work, and artisanal fair trade in Guatemala, as well as other gendered meetings that are not organized around selling products: book clubs, drag queen communities, and “kitty parties” in India, in which women pool assets to gift one another.</p>
<p>Tying these various empirical sites together are what the authors call “marketplaces of interaction,” a term introduced to describe sets of relationships that underlie economic transactions and incorporate “friendship, reciprocity, and loosely structured social networks” (p. 2). Such interactional forms occur within what they call the “party plan economy,” a piece of the global informal economy that combines economics and relationships, and ties the market (thought of as masculine and public) with socializing and parties (thought of as feminine, domestic, and private).</p>
<p>The authors situate gender parties between capitalism and patriarchy by showing how much of women’s labor goes both unrecognized and unpaid, two facts on which corporations capitalize by putting women’s domestic roles and emotional labor to work. Such work in the party plan economy is devalued both because of its location in the informal sector and because it is performed mostly by women. Taking inspiration from Dorothy Smith, the authors root women’s experiences at the center of their analysis, arguing that this invisibly of work is tied to a larger structure of inequality, where women misrecognize their poor pay, lack of benefits, long hours, and exploitative conditions, but emphasize instead the fun and gender bonding of the party. Part of the book’s mission is to expose the “capitalist agenda” of increasing sales at women’s expense, both at home where goods are bought and sold and in the globally connected markets where such goods are made.</p>
<p>And yet, the authors are cautious to note that in fact, as a number of their case studies show, women <italic>can</italic> find fulfillment, some economic advancement, and genuine social bonding through such an exploitative system. For example, lesbian women at a sex toy party are made keenly aware of compulsory heterosexuality, which reproduces the marginality of lesbian sexuality, but they also use such spaces to carve out opportunities to form woman-centered relationships.</p>
<p>In the end, the authors argue that seduction and exploitation exist alongside agency and resistance. This is a fairly worn thesis; the authors demonstrate that gender parties are yet another site to identify the coexistence of both exploitation and empowerment. Their larger interest, however, is in drawing global connections between women in seemingly disparate worlds of work to show the potential for women’s connectivity, which, they hope, will raise gender consciousness.</p>
<p>Such ambitious goals could be furthered with better attention to existing literature. In analyzing the structure of the party plan economy, Williams and Bemiller seek to bridge the traditionally masculine world of economics to the largely invisible (and feminized) work of maintaining social relations. The authors write that “traditional scholarship has neither language nor literature to deal with such a structure” (p. 2). Yet economic sociology since the 1980s demonstrates the social foundations of economic action, and research on markets, firms, and households repeatedly shows how intimacy and social ties both constrain and constitute economic life. The authors critique the false divides between masculine/public/economic and feminine/private/relational realms, or what Zelizer (2005) identified as the “separate spheres, hostile worlds” construction which wrongly assumes economic and social life are separate and incompatible. Such theoretical tools are useful but missing.</p>
<p>What the authors call “marketplaces of interaction” are what economic sociologists would simply call markets—few would think that any market somehow operates devoid of relationships and social interaction. By separating out gender parties as exceptional, the authors implicitly revive an outdated concept of markets as nonrelational, abstract entities.</p>
<p>Many of the case studies present rich empirical cases that will be useful teaching tools, but as a book, the result is seven choppy chapters that stray into unexpected directions, from the history of Black literature to the beauty myth to activism through drag performances. Much of the writing is likely too abstract for undergraduates; however, scholars will appreciate the book’s main contribution of both expanding and rendering visible women’s work.</p>
