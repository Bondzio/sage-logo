<p><italic>Background</italic>: For 40 years, parenteral nutrition (PN) has provided therapeutic benefits to patients unable to receive oral/enteral nutrition. Very limited published evidence exists to describe modern PN practices or characteristics of patients receiving PN. The aim of this article was to describe the characteristics of hospitalized patients receiving PN in 196 U.S. hospitals to define patient groups at risk for PN-related complications. This will provide researchers a baseline understanding about who is receiving hospital-based PN to maximize generalizability and validity of future research. <italic>Methods</italic>: Claims data from the Premier Perspective database, the largest inpatient clinical database in the United States, were used to evaluate hospital-based PN practices. Data gathered between January 2005 and December 2007 included a total of 106,374 patients receiving PN. A total of 68,984 adults (age ≥18 years), 34,307 infants (age &lt;1 year), and 3083 pediatric patients (age 1–17 years) were evaluated. Key variables such as admitting diagnosis, infection rates, in-hospital mortality, and costs were extracted. <italic>Results</italic>: Hospitalized patients requiring PN in the United States are older and more often white than the overall hospitalized population. Hospitalized PN patients are more likely to be admitted emergently and have a higher severity of illness. Bloodstream infection rates in adult PN patients (25.5%) were considerably higher than in pediatric (14.7%) or neonatal patients (1.7%) receiving PN. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: These findings are the first large-scale description of “real-world” hospital-based PN practices in the United States, helping set a baseline for future PN research.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Although parenteral nutrition (PN) is indicated when the enteral route cannot be used, the patient characteristics of those who receive this therapy remain unclear. Despite the availability of published guidelines, the current clinical practice is poorly understood. By providing insight into these patient characteristics, this report has the potential to guide future research and improve patient care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607112444448" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Limited published evidence exists on the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in the hospitalized or acutely ill patient. This is reflected in the wide-ranging recommendations given by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112444448">1</xref></sup> and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) PN intensive care guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112444448">2</xref></sup> Many of the studies used to support these recommendations had very small sample sizes, leading to recommendations that hold a low evidence-based grade (ie, grade C or D). These low-evidence grades are due to a historical lack of large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being performed. However, in the past few years, an increasing number of large, well-designed RCTs examining the optimal use of PN and PN supplements, such as glutamine, have been planned or are ongoing. These trials are increasingly being funded by the National Institutes of Health, industry sponsors, and other funding bodies in Europe, Australia, or Canada. Examples of this renewed interest in PN research include newly published RCT data on the use of supplemental PN in the intensive care unit (ICU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112444448">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112444448">4</xref></sup> and ongoing large PN trials such as the “TOP-UP Trial,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112444448">5</xref></sup> “GLND Trial,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112444448">6</xref></sup> and the recently completed “Early PN” trial of early PN use in the ICU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112444448">7</xref></sup> by the Australian/New Zealand Critical Care Trials Group (ANZICS). We would advocate that ongoing well-designed, large RCTs are essential to guide appropriate and safe PN use.</p>
<p>However, it is currently unclear how PN is being used in the clinical setting in the United States and what, if any, consistent standard of practice exists. Thus, data on the current clinical practice of PN prescribing, usage, and complications are needed to understand who receives PN, how it is administered, and what measurable outcomes (such as infection rates) these patients experience.</p>
<p>This study was undertaken to better understand the characteristics of hospitalized patients receiving PN in 196 hospitals across the United States. This analysis includes 68,984 adults (at least age 18 years), 34,307 infants (age &lt;1 year), and 3083 pediatric patients (age 1–18 years) admitted to the hospital between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. The analysis presented here is intended to describe the hospitalized PN population and provide data on the most common patient diagnoses, comorbidities, infectious complications, and PN treatment type. We believe describing baseline characteristics of hospitalized PN patients and recognizing those who appear to be at greatest risk for PN-related complications (such as infection) are essential to designing future RCTs of PN or PN-related nutrition interventions. Our primary aim was to provide a baseline understanding so future clinical trials can be targeted to the patients receiving PN in clinical practice and thus maximize their generalizability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112444448" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The characteristics of the PN inpatient population were explored using claims data from a nationally representative group of hospitals managed by the Premier healthcare alliance. The Premier Perspective database is the largest inpatient cost-based clinical and financial data warehouse in the United States. Because of exclusive agreements with healthcare facilities, Premier is able to capture patients’ complete billing and coding history during each hospital visit, providing greater detail than available through claims or public data sources. Premier is the only health data provider that has established a relationship with the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>All hospital inpatients in the database who received any PN between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, were included in the analyses. Administration of a PN product was identified when a patient had a claim for a hospital PN solution or premixed multichamber bag containing PN. Readmissions were counted as a new event. Excluded were all patients admitted with any <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) code for bacterial infection, hepatic dysfunction, hypoglycemia, acute cholecystitis, phlebitis, or thrombophlebitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112444448">Figure 1</xref>). These conditions were considered primary or secondary outcomes of this study, and hence patients with these conditions were not eligible for analysis. In an evaluation of complications that may be related to PN administration, it was essential to exclude individuals admitted with a diagnosis of bacterial infection because this could not be attributed to PN. Cost data were not adjusted for inflation.</p>

<p>Patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) (bacteremia or septicemia) were identified as those with a charge for an intravenous (IV) antibiotic <italic>and</italic> any <italic>ICD-9</italic> code of 038.2, 790.7, 999.31, or 996.62. Patients with any type of infection were identified by at least 1 <italic>ICD-9</italic> code used by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112444448">8</xref></sup> as indicative of infection. Malnutrition was identified by at least 1 <italic>ICD-9</italic> code of 260–269. Mortality refers to any death that occurred during hospitalization. All Patient Refined Diagnostic Reported Group (APR-DRG) classifications are widely used in health services, quality improvement, and economics research and are used by many states for public reporting. The APR-DRG software organizes about 20,000 clinical diagnoses and procedures into about 300 groups at 4 levels of severity (minor, moderate, major, and extreme). This study reports APR-DRG severity of illness estimates descriptively.</p>
<p>Three subgroup analyses—oncology, gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, and critical care—were conducted to determine if the use of PN varied in certain populations. Oncology patients were identified as having any primary or secondary <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnosis code of 140–208 (n = 19,661), gastrointestinal surgery patients had any <italic>ICD-9</italic> procedure code of 43.0X–46.9X (n = 33,102), and critical care patients spent at least 3 days in any ICU (n = 31,129). Categories for these subgroups were not mutually exclusive and included only adults 18 years and older. A complete description of the methods has been recently published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112444448">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and hospitalization characteristics were reported descriptively using means with standard deviations and medians with ranges for continuous variables and raw counts with percentages for categorical measures. In all analyses, statistical significance was evaluated at the 2-sided α = 0.05 level using <italic>t</italic> tests for means and χ<sup>2</sup> tests for categorical variables.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the more than 11 million inpatient admissions, 112,845 patients received PN. After excluding those admitted with a primary or secondary outcome of interest (such as bacterial infection as an admitting diagnosis), 106,374 patients receiving PN were included in the analyses. Data were sorted according to patient age: adults at least 18 years of age (n = 68,984), infants of younger than 1 year (n = 34,307), and pediatric patients between 1 and 17 years of age (n = 3083). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112444448">Table 1</xref> describes the characteristics of the adult patients on PN, compared with the characteristics of all adult Premier inpatients during the study interval. The average adult patient on PN was 66 years of age, older than all Premier adult inpatients, who averaged 54 years of age. More female patients (53.1%) received PN, but a higher proportion of PN patients were male (46.9%) when compared with all Premier adult inpatients (37.6%). Whites had a disproportionally higher number of patients receiving PN (73.1%) than any other ethnic group, even though they represented only 63.1% of all Premier adult inpatients. However, more white patients were admitted, we calculated the incidence of PN use compared with admissions. The incidence of PN use was 0.89% in whites and 0.66% in blacks. Most reimbursement for PN came from public sources (65.1%), including 58.6% from Medicare and 7.5% from Medicaid, followed by private payors with 26.4%. In 55.6% of cases, patients on PN were admitted to the hospital through emergency, a greater percentage than for all Premier adult inpatients (45.3%). According to the APR-DRG severity classification system, 46.3% of admissions who received PN were identified as “extreme” compared with 4.3% of all Premier adult inpatients. In addition, 6.5% of PN patients received PN prior to their admission.</p>

<p>Demographics for the 453 Premier hospitals that treated adult inpatients are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112444448">Table 2</xref>. Also described are the demographics of the 196 hospitals that treated the adult PN cohort. Adult PN data were not included from 257 Premier hospitals because they were either specialty facilities, such as pediatric and rehabilitation, or because it was not possible to reliably identify PN specifics through hospital coding. Nearly half (46.2%) of the patients who received PN were in hospitals with a bed size of 250–499. Large hospitals, with a bed size of 500–749, administered 31.5% of the PN, whereas small hospitals, with a bed size of 50–249, administered 12.5%. Inpatient distribution across all Premier hospitals was also highest in facilities with a bed size of 250–499 (46.0%). When compared with the hospital size, the incidence of PN use was highest for hospitals with 500–749 beds (1.07%), followed by 250–499 beds (0.78%), 750–999 beds (0.75%), and 50–249 beds (0.48%).</p>

<p>The characteristics of the pediatric and neonatal population in our survey were similar to the adult PN population with respect to gender and race of pediatric and neonatal patients receiving PN. The most common comorbidities in pediatric PN patients were malignancy (25.6%), renal failure (7.8%), and acute pancreatitis (6.0%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112444448">Table 3</xref>). Compared with adults, few neonatal PN recipients had reported comorbidities with the exception of 1.4% who had renal failure. At discharge, the APR-DRG severity class showed that most of the pediatric population had extreme illness (36.1%), whereas the severity in infants was balanced across all categories, with 23.1% extreme, 35.7% major, 26.9% moderate, and 14.1% minor (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>Regarding complications, overall 54.8% of adult PN patients experienced infection, and 25.5% experienced a study-defined BSI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112444448">Table 3</xref>). A complete analysis of the BSI data has been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112444448">10</xref></sup> The subgroup analysis of adult PN patients indicated that critical care patients experienced the most infections (68.3% any infection, 42.3% BSI), followed by GI patients (58.1% any infection, 27.2% BSI) and finally oncology patients (47.6% any infection, 22.6% BSI). Among pediatric patients, 46.3% experienced any infection and 14.6% had a BSI. However, infants had much lower overall infections and BSI (10.7% and 1.7%, respectively).</p>
<p>The top 10 primary diagnoses according to <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes among all adult patients and subgroups are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112444448">Table 4</xref>. Among all adult PN patients, the highest were primarily diagnosed with intestinal or peritoneal adhesions with obstruction, followed by acute pancreatitis, unspecified septicemia, diverticulitis of the colon, or acute respiratory failure. The PN patients diagnosed with intestinal or peritoneal adhesions with obstruction or acute pancreatitis had the longest use of PN (8.9 days on average), whereas of the top 10 primary diagnoses, the patients diagnosed with pneumonia (organism unspecified) had the shortest use of PN (6.1 days on average). Patient mortality among the top 10 diagnoses varied from 3.9% for those diagnosed with digestive system complications to 40.7% in patients diagnosed with acute respiratory failure. The average hospital stay among these patients varied from 14.8 days for patients diagnosed with digestive system complications to 24.6 days for patients diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of the native coronary artery. The ICU stay in all patients with a top 10 diagnosis ranged from 2.9–16.0 days. The average total hospital cost among the adult patients receiving PN varied widely, from $18,907 for patients diagnosed with unspecified intestinal obstruction to $83,573 for patients diagnosed with coronary atherosclerosis of the native coronary artery.</p>

<p>Eight of the top 10 diagnoses in adult oncology PN patients were related to malignancy. Intestinal or peritoneal adhesions with obstruction ranked eighth in oncology but first and third in surgery and critical care PN patients, respectively. There was no consistent correlation between any single diagnosis and a particular economic outcome. The highest mean total cost was seen in the subset of critical care PN patients with coronary atherosclerosis of the native vessel (U.S.$87,623), followed closely by the subset of GI surgery PN patients with acute respiratory failure (U.S.$86,059), who also had the highest length of ICU stay and overall hospital stay. Length of ICU stay and hospital stay tended to be higher in critical care patients, although the length of their PN therapy was similar to the other subgroups. These findings may reflect the minimum 3-day ICU stay used to define this subgroup. Mortality in all subgroups was highest in patients with unspecified septicemia.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148607112444448">Table 5</xref> lists the top 20 adult procedures among overall adult PN patients and the subgroup of emergency and nonemergency patients based on <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes. Among all the adult PN patients, the most widely used procedure excluding venous catheterization and infusion of parenteral infusion of concentrated nutrition substances was transfusion of packed cells. The mortality for patients varied widely from 10.7% for patients with lysis of peritoneal adhesions to 48.3% for patients receiving venous catheterization for renal dialysis. The hospital length of stay ranged from 18.5 days for patients receiving parenteral infusion of concentrated nutrition substances to 44.1 days for patients with a temporary tracheostomy. The ICU stay ranged from 5.3 days for patients receiving esophagogastroduodenoscopy with closed biopsy to 30.8 days in patients with a temporary tracheostomy. The average cost per patient varied widely from U.S.$40,990 for patients receiving parenteral infusion of concentrated nutrition substances to U.S.$138,335 for patients receiving the procedure of temporary tracheostomy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study represents the first large-scale description of PN use in hospitalized patients in the United States. These findings describe the most common populations and diagnoses for which PN was used between 2005 and 2007 in the United States and also describes PN use for different patient subgroups based on patient type and diagnosis. Using these findings, future researchers will have insight into whether PN use in their study population closely mimics current PN practice according to patient age, hospital size, geographic region, and/or diagnosis. Using these data, generalizable studies can then be designed to target relevant patient populations. These results may also aid funding organizations to allocate funds for studies of PN based on the most relevant patient populations.</p>
<p>In general, our data reveal that hospitalized patients requiring PN in the United States are older and more likely to be white than the overall hospitalized patient population. This is an area for future research because it is unclear if the disparity is related to whether PN use is dependent on ability to pay and other parameters. Hospitalized PN patients are much more likely to be admitted emergently (55.6%) and have a markedly higher illness severity then the overall hospitalized patient population. The APR-DRG severity class, determined at the time of discharge, confirms that 46.3% of PN patients were extremely ill compared with 4.3% of all inpatients.</p>
<p>Our data showed that 35.0% of patients did not have a catheter charge. There are a variety of reasons for this. First, although central venous catheter (CVC) insertions are reliably coded, peripherally inserted central catheter insertions at the bedside are less likely to be coded. Furthermore, placements that may have occurred in the emergency department may not have been coded. It is also possible that midline catheters were used. Finally, some patients may have been admitted with lines already in place that were not replaced.</p>
<p>BSIs in PN patients are reported in our data to occur in 25.5% of adults, 14.6% of pediatric patients, but only 1.7% of infants. The occurrence of BSIs was higher in critically ill patients in this study, which consisted mostly of adults. Previous reports have described catheter-related BSIs to occur in 1.3%–26.2% of PN patients with a CVC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112444448">11</xref></sup> The trend in overall catheter-related BSI rates in the United States appears to be declining thanks to efforts and support from several government agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112444448">12</xref></sup> The wide range in findings is possibly related to the criteria used to define BSI. Although there is similarity between these findings and our analysis, it is quite interesting to note the variation of infection rate with age. More adults than pediatric patients, and more pediatric than neonatal patients, had a BSI. Future research efforts attempting to understand the etiology for the increased rate of infection in adult PN patients vs pediatric or neonatal patients may explore the role of factors such as the increased comorbidities seen in adult patients as well as the types of adult diseases and immune-related changes that occur with aging. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore if different infection control practices are present in infants or pediatric patients receiving PN vs adult patients, possibly contributing to differences in infection rates (ie, maintenance of a dedicated PN line and/or variation in prophylactic antibiotic administration practices).</p>
<p>The most frequent primary diagnosis in adult PN patients, intestinal/peritoneal adhesions with obstruction, is consistent with the A.S.P.E.N./SCCM guidelines suggesting PN use in patients with intestinal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112444448">1</xref></sup> However, this is not true for all of the top 10 primary diagnoses. Many patients receiving PN had a primary diagnosis that appeared to have little direct relationship with the indication for PN in these patients. It is possible that complications resulting from the primary diagnosis or comorbidities caused GI dysfunction and resulted in the use of PN. However, it is also possible that many patients received short-term PN while enteral nutrition (EN) was instituted and advanced or that PN was prescribed inappropriately.</p>
<p>Another revelation in these data is that 28% of adult PN patients were transfused at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells during their admission. Whether in an emergent or nonemergent procedure, this was the third most frequent procedure behind venous catheterization and infusion of concentrated nutrition. Blood transfusion itself is known to increase the risk of infection and mortality in many settings, perhaps via immunosuppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112444448">13</xref></sup> The common occurrence of blood transfusion could potentially be another risk factor that contributes to a higher infectious morbidity in patients receiving PN.</p>
<p>Retrospective database analyses possess several limitations, and the Premier Perspective database is no exception. Although the Premier Perspective database is generally considered representative of the U.S. population of hospitals, a disproportionate number of hospitals are located in the southern United States. There are also a disproportionate number of urban hospitals. And although we were able to detail primary diagnoses and most common procedures, our data are limited to the <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes reported by hospitals. In reality, coding is often completed by chart abstractors with no actual connection with, or knowledge of, individual patients, a limitation that applies to all claims-based studies. For example, although BSIs were identified via <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes and use of IV antibiotics, this was not validated with patient records. Nonetheless, hospitals are highly motivated to provide accurate diagnosis codes in their patient records, particularly given the high percentage of patients funded through either Medicare or Medicaid. These federal medical insurance programs impose harsh penalties and fines for miscoded or misrepresented charges submitted for reimbursement when regular audits are performed. Thus, in the modern healthcare environment, great emphasis is placed by hospitals on the accuracy of these diagnosis codes. Another potential limitation is that these PN usage data were collected prior to the A.S.P.E.N./SCCM nutrition guidelines published in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112444448">1</xref></sup> It is possible these guidelines may have led to more appropriate and targeted PN use, particularly in the ICU patient subgroup in these data. Finally, it is a generally accepted practice to report infection rates as BSI per catheter days. Because we could not reliably identify the presence of IV catheters, we were unable to report BSI per catheter days. Fortunately, a significant amount of published literature reports simple infection rates to provide an appropriate context for our findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these data provide a description of PN prescribing practices in U.S. hospitals. Acknowledging the limitations of this database analysis, these data indicate that patients receiving PN are most commonly older, white, and severely ill patients admitted emergently with an oncologic and/or surgical diagnosis. They often spend time in an ICU, receive blood transfusions, and sustain nosocomial infections as part of their hospitalizations. Adult PN patients, who in our data commonly had a high acuity of illness and a significant number of comorbidities, sustained considerably more BSIs than pediatric or neonatal PN patients, who had fewer comorbidities. However, it is not clear whether frequent BSIs are due to the PN itself or to the independent risk associated with CVCs, the acuity of illness/comorbidities of the patient, disparities in antibiotic usage, or a combination of these or other factors. Future analyses are planned to evaluate these potential etiologies. The data presented here may help provide information to researchers planning clinical trials, such as the use of supplemental PN in high nutrition risk patients, studies evaluating PN-based supplements (such as glutamine and newer lipid emulsions), and studies evaluating the etiology of BSIs in PN patients. These data may be used to assess how well research populations mirror “real-life” clinical PN users. We hope these findings will inspire research questions and RCTs designed to optimize safety and clinical outcomes in patients who require PN.</p>
