<title>Background:</title>
<p>Media depiction of sufferers of mental illness is a widely viewed source of stigmatization and studies have found stigmatizing depictions of mental illness in Nigerian films. With the recent boom in the Nigerian home video industry, there is a need to know how often Nigerians are exposed to films that contain scenes depicting mental illness and how much premium they place on such portrayals as reflecting reality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011408544">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To assess the popularity of Nigerian home videos among Nigerian community dwellers and the frequency of their exposure to scenes depicting mental illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011408544">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to obtain socio-demographic data and to find out how often respondents see scenes depicting ‘madness’ in home videos, as well as their views about the accuracy of such depictions from the orthodox psychiatry point of view. Current home videos available in video rental shops were selected for viewing and content review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764011408544">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>All 676 respondents had seen a Nigerian home video in the preceding 30 days: 528 (78%) reported scenes depicting ‘mad persons’; 472 (70%) reported that the scenes they saw agreed with their own initial understanding of the cause and treatment of ‘madness’. About 20% of the films depicted mental illness. The most commonly depicted cause was sorcery and enchantment by witches and wizards, while the most commonly depicted treatment was magical and spiritual healing by diviners and religious priests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020764011408544">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Nigerian home video is a popular electronic media in Nigeria and scenes depicting mental illness are not uncommon. The industry could be harnessed for promoting mental health literacy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stigmatization of individuals with mental illness has been identified as a major impediment to better care and improvement of the quality of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408544">Pickenhagen &amp; Sartorius, 2002</xref>). Awareness about the need to develop long-term strategies to combat stigma is increasing by the day and one of the current focuses is to improve on the ongoing efforts aimed at disengaging mental illness from associated fears and anxieties. One of the suggested ways to achieve this is through improvement in mental health literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408544">Jorm, Korten, Jacomb, Christensen, &amp; Rodgers, 1997</xref>). But while we are striving to improve mental health literacy through direct public education on mental health issues, attention should also be paid to reducing any ongoing public misinformation.</p>
<p>The media is a powerful tool for social change it also has a tremendous potential as an agent of misinformation. The electronic media industry in Nigeria received a major boost in the last 10 years with the boom in the Nigerian movie industry, occasioned by a major leap in the ease of production and distribution of home videos. The advent in Nigeria of films that are shot cheaply on video rather than using capital-intensive celluloid technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408544">Haynes, 2007</xref>) has led to a significant reduction in production costs, thus attracting more small-time players. The distribution of these films in many Nigerian communities has also been enhanced with the advent of cheap video cassettes and CDs sold or rented in small kiosks, sidewalks, open markets and to occupants of vehicles in traffic jams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408544">Haynes, 2007</xref>). These films are also broadcast on television all over Anglophone Africa and are shown in theatres, small video parlours and even in rural villages, where daring exhibitors sometimes play these videos for a token to an open market audience.</p>
<p>This rather pervasive outlook of the Nigerian home video is further strengthened by the fact that some websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ukiri.com">www.ukiri.com</ext-link>) host hundreds of these videos for online viewing without the need to download anything or to register. Some satellite television providers also host dedicated channels for Nigerian home videos. Furthermore, it is instructive that a global cinema survey conducted in 2006 by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408544">UNESCO, 2009</xref>) ranked the Nigerian movie industry as the second-largest producing movie body in the world.</p>
<p>The overall impact of all these factors is that a large number of Nigerians, irrespective of their location, socioeconomic status and level of sophistication, have a reasonable level of access to Nigerian home videos. Given the ubiquitous nature of these videos, it can be said that the Nigerian movie industry is a powerful source of public information in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The role of the media in shaping attitudes of the general public cannot be overemphasized, but the media may also become an agent of public misinformation about mental illnesses if their depiction is incorrect, incomplete or obsolete. Media depiction of sufferers of mental illness is a widely viewed source of stigmatization and studies have found stigmatizing themes in the depiction of mental illness in Nigerian home videos. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408544">Aina (2004)</xref>, in a study of 163 Nigerian films, found that 25 (15.3%) contained scenes of psychiatric illness. The causative factors of the ‘illnesses’ depicted in the films were largely attributed to supernatural or preternatural forces. In the same study, the effective treatment or ‘healing’ of the illnesses were portrayed as arising mostly through magical means or traditional forms of care.</p>
<p>It is a known fact that the ways in which mental illnesses are construed, framed and presented in the media have a significant impact on the way in which the public thinks about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408544">Sieff, 2003</xref>). In fact, there are anecdotal reports from Nigeria that mentally ill patients and their relatives attributed mental illness to supernatural forces, quoting the films they watched as one of the sources of their information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408544">Aina, 2004</xref>). Also, content analysis of studies on negative framing of mental illnesses in the media have suggested that it plays a significant role in the perpetuation of the public’s negative attitudes towards those afflicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408544">Sieff, 2003</xref>). There is a need to know how the booming Nigerian home videos currently portray mental illness, how often Nigerians are exposed to films that contain scenes depicting mental illness and how much premium they place on such portrayals as reflecting reality. Such information can help us to estimate the potential of Nigerian home videos as a medium of perpetrating negative views of mental illness, as well as a medium for promoting mental health literacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011408544" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, all Nigerian home videos (shot in Yoruba language) that were on display in three video rental shops located in three different neighbourhoods within Ibadan metropolis were rented for viewing. The video rental shops and the neighbourhoods were chosen by convenient sampling method. The films were screened by previously trained volunteers among Yoruba-speaking medical students undergoing a psychiatry posting. They were instructed to sort films that contained scenes in which the director portrayed one or a group of persons as suffering from mental illness. As a guide, they were given a set of checklists that were adapted from words and behavioural or emotional states that have been documented as the most frequently used themes to describe sufferers of mental illness among Yoruba-speaking Nigerians (Ronzoni, Dogra, Omigbodun, Bella, &amp; Atilola, 2009). The decision whether a film contained scenes of mental illness or not was made by a consensus of at least two medical students. In the two occasions where a consensus could not be reached, the final decision was made by the authors. The films so sorted as containing scenes where mental illness was depicted were then viewed together by the two authors. The depicted aetiology and treatment of the mental illness so portrayed were recorded.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the study, which was carried out four weeks after the films had been sampled, a semi-structured questionnaire was designed by the author to obtain socio-demographic data and to find out how often respondents saw scenes depicting ‘madness’ in home videos, as well as their views about the accuracy of such depictions in the real sense. The key questions were: Did you watch any Nigerian home video in the last 30 days? Were there scenes of ‘mad person(s)’ in any of such films in the last 30 days? How well did the scene(s) you saw agree with your own initial understanding of the cause and treatment of ‘madness’? And how often do you think the scenes of Nigerian home videos agree with everyday reality?</p>
<p>The respondents were participants (aged 18–65 years) in the September 2009 version of the annual public health campaign of the Association of Resident Doctors of University College Hospital Ibadan, which was held in two consecutive locations within Ibadan metropolis in south-west Nigeria. Participants were interviewed by doctors (previously trained on the questionnaire) as they waited for their routine blood pressure and urine sugar tests.</p>
<p>Data collected were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16 (SPSS – 16) software. Results were calculated as frequencies and means. Comparisons were by χ<sup>2</sup> test. Values of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Depictions of mental illness in films</title>
<p>Twenty-one (20.4%) of the 103 films studied contained scenes depicting mental illness. A summary of the depicted causes and treatment modalities for mental illness as depicted in the films are as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764011408544">Table 2</xref>. The most common cause depicted was sorcery and enchantment by witches and wizards. In such scenes the director showed vivid images of fetish manipulations directed at the ‘victim’ for reasons that ranged from jealousy through rivalry to sheer wickedness (examples: <italic>Olopa isonu</italic>, <italic>Oba Elesan</italic>, <italic>Aja Meji</italic> among others). Afflictions by supernatural and preternatural forces as well as direct repercussion of evil deeds were also common. In the film <italic>Gan-gan-gan</italic>, the ‘victim’ was afflicted with mental illness when he ran into a roaming deity in the dead of night. Severe psychological stressor was the least depicted cause and in the two films where it was depicted (<italic>Sisi mi</italic> and <italic>Ayo ni mo fe</italic>) the sufferer took to poly-substance abuse before becoming apparently mentally ill.</p>

<p>As would be expected in view of the most commonly depicted aetiology, the most commonly depicted treatment was magical and spiritual healing by diviners and religious priests. Such treatments were depicted as very successful and dramatic, despite the observation that the depicted ‘victim’ had had several years of ‘untreated psychoses’. On the rare occasions (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 10% of cases) where treatment was depicted in a psychiatric hospital setting, no medication was seen to be given and full recovery still required some spiritual or magical intervention, which was with the tacit approval of the attending doctor (example: <italic>Ija ola</italic>).</p>

<title>Exposure to films depicting mental illness</title>
<p>All 676 respondents had watched Nigerian home videos in the preceding 30 days; 528 (78%) reported seeing films that contained scenes depicting ‘mad persons’; 472 (70%) reported that the scenes they saw agreed with their own initial understanding of the cause and treatment of ‘madness’ and 560 (83%) felt that scenes from Nigerian home videos most often agree with everyday reality. Female gender and a level of education not beyond elementary were associated with a higher tendency to agree that home videos portray mental illness in line with preconceptions, as well as with the likelihood of endorsing scenes from home videos as reflecting everyday reality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011408544">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides some evidence to support the assumption that Nigerian home videos are popular among community dwellers in Nigeria and that the viewers are regularly inundated with scenes depicting mental illness. One can infer from this study that scenes depicting mental illness are indeed not uncommon in Nigerian home videos shot in Yoruba language (the most popular genre in south-west Nigeria) and that the scenes so depicted are mostly unrealistic and sometimes stigma promoting, from the orthodox psychiatry point of view. The finding that most respondents believe that Nigerian home videos provide accurate depictions of mental illness and other issues of life raises much concern regarding the influence that the videos may currently be having on orthodox mental health literacy in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In traditional African societies like Ibadan, Nigeria, beliefs in the prominent role of supernatural and preternatural forces, including witches and wizards, in the causation of ill-health, especially mental ill-health, abound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011408544">Morakinyo &amp; Akinwowo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408544">Odejide, Oyewumi, &amp; Ohaeri, 1989</xref>), and perpetuation of these beliefs was evident in more recent studies in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408544">Gureje, Lashebikan, Ephraim-Oluwanuga, &amp; Kola, 2005</xref>). Depicting mental illnesses as being largely due to sorcery, enchantment and spiritual attacks and most effectively amenable to divination and spiritual cleansing, as seen in this study, to a willing and enthusiastic audience with such preconceptions can only strengthen and perpetuate such views. The implication of such a scenario, as shown in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011408544">Abiodun, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408544">Gureje, Acha, &amp; Odejide, 1995</xref>), is that delays in presentation for orthodox care and its associated complications (due to initial care seeking at divination and spiritual centres) by sufferers of mental illness may continue until specific and deliberate attempts are made to address the sociocultural factors perpetuating supernatural and preternatural views of the causation of mental illness.</p>
<p>In addition, the finding in the present study that women and the less schooled are more likely to endorse the depiction of mental illness in Nigerian home videos as accurate and realistic calls for worry among Nigerian psychiatrists if the scenes they were exposed to are the same as those seen during the content review of videos sampled from the rental shops. This is more so in view of reports that market (and probably less-schooled) women are at the demographic centre of the Nigerian home video audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408544">Haynes, 2007</xref>). The implication of this is that if earlier observations that Nigerian home videos show misleading and stigmatizing scenes of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408544">Aina, 2004</xref>) are still true, as the current study tends to suggest, less-educated community-dwelling Nigerian women may have been serving as a conduit for disseminating misinformation about mental illness to their children with the attendant perpetuation of stigma aboout mental illness in the community. However, it is not clear whether the preponderance of the less educated and females among those more likely to endorse preconception–portrayal congruence in this study was not simply because females are more likely to be the least educated. Even if this is so, the implication would not be less serious.</p>
<p>The authors’ however recognize that culture influences attitudes and specific behaviours, including health-seeking behaviours of the individual. We also recognize that orthodox psychiatry does not necessarily offer all the perspectives to mental illness; in fact, we are of the opinion that orthodox psychiatry practice in its pure form and its heavy leaning on western culture may not be readily acceptable in this setting because a little conflict is almost always expected when one culture is exposed to a different one. There is historical evidence that ancient Yoruba tribesmen believed in supernatural and mystical causes of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408544">Jegede, 2005</xref>) and this may have been passed down the generations in oral literature, folklore and possibly by the unorthodox healers themselves. There is research evidence to show that contemporary Yoruba Nigerians, irrespective of their educational or social status, also believe in supernatural and preternatural causes of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011408544">Morakinyo &amp; Akinwowo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408544">Odejide et al., 1989</xref>). These beliefs may even have a functional significance to Yoruba Nigerians in view of research findings that individuals who believe in supernatural causes feel less stigmatized than those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011408544">Wen, Jou, &amp; Yang, 1992</xref>), probably by absolving them of any responsibility and provoking empathy from others within the same culture.</p>
<p>In view of the level of popularity of the supernatural and preternatural dimensions of mental illness among the Yoruba Nigerians in this study, psychiatrists should recognize that a Yoruba Nigerian has his/her own preconceptions about mental illness that derive from the Yoruba culture at the point of contemplating health seeking. Those working in Yoruba-speaking communities should also be more sensitive to such beliefs. Patient education in such a setting should focus on orthodox explanations and reasoning but without necessarily dismissing their cultural views as irrelevant. Such recognition of patients’ cultures in orthodox mental healthcare may make services more acceptable and may improve treatment outcomes by promoting trust and adherence.</p>
<p>Given the important role that the electronic media have been found to play in shaping public attitudes towards mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408544">Francis, Pirkis, &amp; Dunt, 2001</xref>), the often misleading, damaging and stereotypic depiction of mental illnesses in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408544">Byrne, 1997</xref>), as well as the established power of audiovisual media to influence societal constructions of mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408544">Wahl, 1995</xref>), the findings of this study, however modest, have grave implications for the development of orthodox mental healthcare in Nigeria. It is instructive that as at the time of writing this report, other than sporadic appearances of some psychiatrists on local television stations in Nigeria, there is currently no well-structured, institutional-based strategy for tapping the potential of the Nigerian electronic media as a tool for promoting orthodox mental health literacy in Nigeria. This is also true of any well-established partnership with the Guild of Nigerian Film Producers (GNFP) or the Nigerian Association of Theatre Arts practitioners (ANTP), who are the major stakeholders in the Nigerian home video industry. In a resource-constrained country like Nigeria, where knowledge and attitude towards mental illness is poor and there is a widespread stigmatization of the mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408544">Gureje et al., 2005</xref>), efforts directed at mitigating any societal factors that can further perpetuate prejudices against sufferers of mental illness will not only reduce the financial burden of care in the long run but will also improve the quality of life of patients.</p>
<p>The popular and burgeoning Nigerian home video industry has a potential as a far- and wide-reaching medium for propagating orthodox mental health literacy in Nigeria. This is more so in view of research postulations that the use of films depicting people diagnosed with mental health problems may be a more efficient approach to reducing stigma and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011408544">Penn, Chamberlin, &amp; Mueser, 2003</xref>). In fact, recent evidence abounds to suggest that anti-stigma films can instil modest changes in specific areas of stigma such as social distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408544">Altindag, Yanik, Ücok, Alptekin, &amp; Ozkan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408544">Chung, 2005</xref>), which incidentally has been found to be particularly high among certain socio-demographic groups in Nigeria compared to the western world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408544">Adewuya &amp; Makanjuola, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In a recently published World Psychiatry Association (WPA) guideline on how to combat stigma of psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408544">Sartorius et al., 2010</xref>), it was recommended that national psychiatric societies should consider fostering good working relationships with the media by engaging them in ways appropriate for each country. Therefore, if the findings of this study can be replicated in larger-scale community surveys, then the Association of Psychiatrists in Nigeria (APN) may have found one appropriate medium for the large-scale promotion of mental health literacy in Nigerian home videos in line with the WPA guideline. It may be pertinent for the APN to consider urgently setting up an ad-hoc committee to draw up strategies for a mutually acceptable and sustainable partnership with the GNFP and the ANTP, with a view to using dedicated documentary home videos for promoting mental health literacy. The Government of Nigeria, through the Health Ministry and the Nigerian Films Censor Board, will also have a role to play.</p>
<sec id="section13-0020764011408544">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to examine the popularity of Nigerian home videos among community dwellers, the frequency of their exposure to scenes depicting mental illness, as well as their tendencies to internalize the schema of mental illness so portrayed. This report should be interpreted within the limitation of the risk of recall bias, the small and probably non-representative sample size and the assumption that the participants most likely saw the same set of films as the those sampled for viewing in this study. Also, while some measures, as described in the methodology section, were made to ensure the accurate selection of the films, it is still possible that a few films portraying mental illness may have been missed. Although the annual event that served as the setting for this study draws participants from a large catchment area, a multi-staged probability sampling technique from selected communities in Nigeria would have provided more representative results from which the conclusions of this study could be more reliably drawn.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provides some evidence that the Nigerian home video is a popular electronic medium in Nigeria and that scenes depicting mental illness are not uncommon in them. The findings, if replicated in larger-scale studies, could serve as a basis for advocating for an urgent need to partner with stakeholders in the Nigerian home video industry for the promotion of mental health literacy through films in Nigeria.</p>
