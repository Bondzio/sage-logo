<abstract>
<p>Recent advances in stem cell technology have enabled large-scale production of human cells such as cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons for evaluation of pharmacologic effect and toxicity of drug candidates. The assessment of compound efficacy and toxicity using human cells should lower the high clinical attrition rates of drug candidates by reducing the impact of species differences on drug efficacy and toxicity from animal studies. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) has been shown to reduce lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in skin fibroblasts derived from patients with Niemann Pick type C disease and in the <italic>NPC1-/-</italic> mouse model. However, the compound has never been tested in human differentiated neurons. We have determined the cholesterol reduction effect of MBCD in neurons differentiated from human neural stem cells (NSCs) and commercially available astrocytes. The use of NSCs for producing differentiated neurons in large quantities can significantly reduce the production time and enhance the reproducibility of screening results. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of MBCD on cholesterol reduction in human neurons and astrocytes were 66.9 and 110.7 µM, respectively. The results indicate that human neurons differentiated from the NSCs and human astrocytes are useful tools for evaluating pharmacologic activity and toxicity of drug candidates to predict their clinical efficacy.</p>

<p>Cell-based assays are commonly used in early drug discovery for high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify lead compounds. They are also extensively employed in secondary and tertiary screens to confirm the activities of compounds that are initially identified from HTS using biochemical assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087057112456877">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087057112456877">2</xref></sup> Currently, cells primarily used for compound screens are either immortalized cell lines or primary cells freshly isolated from tissues. Both primary and immortalized cells can be derived from various species, including rodents (hamster, mouse, and rat) and humans, as well as from distinct tissues such as brain, heart, liver, muscle, and skin. Although the compound activity data obtained from animal cells are useful for guidance of drug dosing in animal model studies, compound potencies determined from human cells are expected to better predict the drug efficacy and toxicity in human clinical trials. Immortalized human cell lines are commonly cancerous and/or have accumulated significant genetic mutations. Hence, these do not provide a valid model of the biological and pharmacological effects of a given compound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087057112456877">3</xref></sup> Human blood cells and skin fibroblasts are generally accessible; however, most primary cell types are not available in large quantities needed for drug screens or are prohibitively expensive. The recent availability of differentiated neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a new paradigm for the use of human cells to determine the efficacy and potential cytotoxicity of drug candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087057112456877">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087057112456877">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease is caused by mutations in either one of the two genes encoding the lysosomal cholesterol binding proteins NPC1 or NPC2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087057112456877">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112456877">7</xref></sup> NPC disease is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in many cell types. Lysosomal accumulation results from the impaired transport of unesterified cholesterols from the late endosomes and/or lysosomes to the plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network, and endoplasmic reticulum. The clinical manifestation of NPC disease includes progressive neurodegeneration and is often accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly. The onset of symptoms generally occurs in early childhood, leading to death within a decade. Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for NPC disease.</p>
<p>Cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes is a direct disease manifestation that can be used as a phenotypic screen to identify cholesterol-reducing compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112456877">8</xref></sup> Skin fibroblasts derived from NPC patients exhibit significant lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and thus can serve as a cell-based disease model for compound screens. A recent HTS using the NPC patient fibroblasts led to identification of several compounds that significantly reduced cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087057112456877">8</xref></sup> However, although neuronal degeneration is a major cause of death in NPC patients, cholesterol accumulation in skin fibroblasts does not directly contribute to the disease pathogenesis. Human neurons would thus be more desirable as a cell-based model for compound screens to evaluate activity and neuronal toxicity of drug candidates. Here, we report the application of human neurons differentiated from iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) as a model system to evaluate the pharmacologic activity and cytotoxicity of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD). Using a biochemical cholesterol assay, the potency of MBCD has been measured in these cells and compared with skin fibroblasts, astrocytes, and a neuroblastoma cell line. We propose that the human differentiated neurons can be employed as a new screen paradigm for evaluation of compound activity and toxicity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mature cells differentiated from iPSCs such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes are desirable for use in compound screens. However, the process of generating differentiated cells from iPSCs usually takes 6 to 12 weeks before the cells are ready for compound screens. Currently, the prolonged time and complicated procedure limit broad application of stem cell–derived human cells for drug discovery. We have explored the use of multipotent NSCs as the starting point to obtain differentiated neurons for compound screens, which significantly reduces the preparation time to obtain differentiated neurons. This approach begins with frozen iPSC-derived NSCs that can be plated into 96-well plates for continuous differentiation into neurons in the proper cell culture conditions. After 2 to 3 weeks of culture in differentiation medium, the cells are ready for characterization and compound screens. To validate this approach, we have examined the activity of MBCD on the reduction of cellular cholesterol levels in the differentiated neurons in comparison with the results obtained from primary skin fibroblasts, astrocytes and other cell lines.</p>
<sec id="section15-1087057112456877">
<title>Characterization of Neurons Differentiated from iPS Cells</title>
<p>In contrast to immortalized cell lines and primary cells, it is critical to characterize the differentiated cells to confirm the cell lineage before their use in cell-based and cytotoxicity assays. Molecular markers that are commonly used for characterizing neural stem and progenitor cells are Nestin, an intermediate filament protein, and Sox2 and Sox1 (transcription factors).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087057112456877">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087057112456877">11</xref></sup> We first performed immunofluorescence staining of neural stem cells using anti-Oct4 and anti-Nanog antibodies to test for markers of pluripotency. The lack of Oct4 and Nanog staining is consistent with a more restricted lineage status (multipotency instead of pluripotency) of neural stem cells compared with iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). The NSCs, maintained in media supplemented with bFGF (see the Materials and Methods section), were positive for Nestin and Sox1, two markers of early neuroepithelial cells, prior to directed differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Switching of NSC media to media containing 10 ng/mL BDNF and 10 ng/mL GDNF (instead of bFGF) resulted in the differentiation of the majority of cells to a typical neuronal phenotype with a dense network of neurites. The neural lineages of the differentiated cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using cell-type–specific markers. Phenotypically, these neurons were positive for β-tubulin III, microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), and neurofilament-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). No immunoreactivity was detected in the neuronal cultures for GFAP, an astrocyte cell marker (data not shown).

<p>We then employed an additional assay to confirm our findings—specifically, a biochemical assay to determine the cholesterol reduction effect of MBCD in both NPC1 and control fibroblasts. The cholesterol assay uses an enzyme-coupled reporting system that consists of cholesterol oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and Amplex-red dye that involves a cell wash step to remove cell culture medium before the assay. As predicted, MBCD reduced the cellular unesterified cholesterol levels in both control and NPC1 fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner, although a complete inhibition curve at the lower plateau could not be achieved because of the cytotoxicity of MBCD at concentrations higher than 300 µM. The EC<sub>50</sub> value of MBCD for reduction of cellular cholesterol level was 66.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>) in the control fibroblasts, which is similar to the EC<sub>50</sub> of 60.5 µM determined in the NPC1 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref>). Thus, the results indicate that normal cells could also be used to evaluate the cholesterol reduction effect of β-cyclodextrins or other compounds.</p>

<title>MBCD Reduces Cellular Cholesterol Levels in Differentiated Neurons and Additional Cell Types</title>
<p>Because NPC disease primarily affects the brain with neuronal degeneration as the cause of lethality, we wanted to examine the cholesterol reduction effect of MBCD in human neurons and, more desirably, in NPC disease neurons. In human neurons, the effect of β-cyclodextrins on cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes has not been studied because these cells are not generally available. An additional layer of technical difficulty applies to differentiated neurons, which are more fragile and may not be able to tolerate experiments that require multiple steps of cell wash, fixation, and dye staining included in the procedure of the Filipin staining assay. At this stage, iPSCs from NPC patients are not available, although attempts are being made to produce such cells (unpublished data). As an alternative approach, we determined the effect of MBCD in normal human neurons differentiated from iPSCs. Consistent with the data in fibroblasts, MBCD reduced the cellular cholesterol levels in differentiated neurons derived from normal human iPSCs with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 66.9 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087057112456877"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> values reported here are similar to that determined in patient-derived fibroblasts in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>) or reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112456877">16</xref></sup> In human astrocytes, MBCD also reduced cellular cholesterol levels with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 110.7 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). We then examined the effect of MBCD in a human neuroblastoma line, SH-SY5Y. The EC<sub>50</sub> value of MBCD in the neuroblastoma cells was 81.9 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087057112456877"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref>), similar to that found for the normal skin fibroblasts. Since MBCD is cytotoxic at concentrations higher than 300 μM, its activity in the cholesterol assay was not shown for these concentrations, thus resulting in an incomplete concentration-response curve that is missing the lower plateau. We also monitored the cytotoxicity of MBCD using an ATP content assay in parallel to the biochemical cholesterol assay to ensure the compound concentration used did not cause cytotoxicity.</p>

<p>Together, our results confirmed the activity of MBCD on the reduction of cellular cholesterol levels in human differentiated neurons and astrocytes. The data also demonstrated that human differentiated neurons (derived from NSCs) are a useful tool for confirmation of drug efficacy in human cells as well as for measuring compound cytotoxicity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In past two decades, HTS of molecular targets against large compound collections has become a major approach of drug discovery. Hits identified from the primary screen are confirmed in the secondary screens for target activity and selectivity. One or a few structurally appealing lead compounds subsequently undergo chemical optimization to improve potency and selectivity. The optimized compounds are then validated in the tertiary screens, which are more disease relevant and often use primary cells and cell-based disease models. Finally, a few top lead compounds are tested in the animal models before entering preclinical development for drug safety and ADME properties. A recent review of failed drugs in clinical studies revealed that overall, 31% of phase 2 and 61% of phase 3 trials failed because of lack of human efficacy (data from 2007–2011).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087057112456877">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087057112456877">18</xref></sup> These once promising drug candidates that have good drug efficacy in animal models may have a different effect in human patients, probably due to the species difference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087057112456877">19</xref></sup> Thus, the current animal models may not always be good at predicting human efficacy, especially for certain diseases such as cancer and neuronal disorders. Therefore, the use of human cells and patient-derived disease cells for drug screens and validation of lead compounds has emerged as an alternative method to animal models that may improve the success rate of drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>Dependent on the origins of iPSCs generated, there are two major types of differentiated human cells: normal cells and disease-specific cells. The normal human iPSCs are readily available from several commercial sources such as the National Institutes of Health–sponsored Coriell Cell Repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.coriell.org/stem-cells">http://www.coriell.org/stem-cells</ext-link>) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Normal iPSC-differentiated human cells such as cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons have recently become available. Although several disease-related iPSCs have been generated and have become available, there have been many difficult cases for generation of iPSCs from patient cells. For example, the iPSCs from NPC disease cells have not been reported. Even though the disease-related iPSCs have been made, many of them do not exhibit the disease phenotype in the differentiated cells. In addition, large-scale production of differentiated cells from disease-related iPSCs may not be feasible in many cases. Therefore, the use of differentiated cells from normal human iPSCs, as used in this study, is a more practical approach for drug screens until the issues associated with disease-related iPSCs can be addressed. Specifically, using frozen cells that are already at an intermediate stage of differentiation, such as NSCs, for continued differentiation in microtiter plates can reduce the technical difficulties associated with a 6 week or longer differentiation process in microtiter plates, in addition to potentially reducing batch-to-batch variability in the differentiation process.</p>
<p>The generation of large quantities of differentiated cells with reproducible properties poses considerable challenges. In addition, it is not easy to produce disease models using cells differentiated from iPSCs. Several approaches may be employed for the assay development of cell-based disease models. First, disease models can be generated by addition of toxins or chemicals that damage cells or block a specific pathway in cells. In neuronal cells, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087057112456877">20</xref></sup> serum deprivation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087057112456877">21</xref></sup> and toxins such as MPP+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087057112456877">22</xref></sup> are commonly used to generate a model for examining neuronal protective activity of compounds. Second, a gene expression or pathway reporter assay can be set up in differentiated cells for the measurement of compound activity. Third, the cellular level of a protein, lipid, or metabolite in differentiated cells can be used for the determination of a specific therapeutic effect of compounds. In this study, we used a biochemical cholesterol assay to measure the effect of compounds on reduction of cellular cholesterol levels in human neurons differentiated from normal iPSCs.</p>
<p>Neuronal degeneration and massive loss of Purkinje cells in the brain are closely related to the pathogenesis of NPC disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087057112456877">7</xref></sup> Although the enlarged liver and spleen are often observed in NPC patients peripheral symptoms are usually rare. Thus, relevant drug therapies for the treatment of NPC disease have to target the central nervous system as the pathophysiology of NPC disease mainly affects the brain. In addition, these drug candidates should be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to exert its pharmacologic action in the central nervous system. Although skin fibroblasts derived from NPC patients have been used for compound screens, neurons differentiated from human iPSCs may be more useful as the secondary assays for evaluating drug efficacy and neuronal toxicity, in addition to confirming the pharmacologic action of drug candidates.</p>
<p>MBCD, a β-cyclodextrin, was previously reported to reduce lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 fibroblasts and in the brain tissue of the <italic>NPC1</italic>-/- mouse model. The life span of these mice was also doubled after the treatment with β-cyclodextrins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087057112456877">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087057112456877">14</xref></sup> The mechanism of action of β-cyclodextrin on the reduction of lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids is linked to a calcium-dependent exocytosis of storage materials in the affected cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087057112456877">23</xref></sup> It has also been reported that β-cyclodextrin enters the cells through endocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087057112456877">16</xref></sup> Because the structure of β-cyclodextrin consists of seven sugars that are highly water soluble and impermeable to the blood-brain barrier, direct brain injection may be required for the therapeutic use of this compound in NPC patients. Our data demonstrate that 100 µM MBCD is nontoxic and reduces cellular cholesterol accumulation in human neurons differentiated from iPSCs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have developed an approach to use human neurons differentiated from normal iPSCs in a 96-well plate format to determine the efficacy of cellular cholesterol reduction and cytotoxicity of β-cyclodextrin compound. The application of starting neuronal differentiation from NSCs instead of iPSCs can significantly reduce the time required for cell differentiation and increase the reproducibility of cells used in a screen. As we demonstrate here for MBCD, the efficacy and potential cytotoxicity of compounds can be measured in parallel in human neurons differentiated from normal iPSCs, thus providing proof of concept that normal iPSC-derived cells can provide valuable information for the assessment of human efficacy and cytotoxicity of drug candidates and guide future clinical development.</p>
