<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pediatric head trauma is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED) with approximately 600 000 children evaluated in the ED yearly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812450508">1</xref>(pp132-134)</sup> Although the overall numbers of head injuries are high, the majority of cases fall into the category of minor or mild head injury. Currently, computed tomography (CT) scans are the modality of choice for diagnosing traumatic injuries of the brain and its use is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812450508">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that in children with head trauma, fewer than 10% of CT scans performed show traumatic brain injuries and even fewer scans identify injuries that require emergent neurosurgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450508">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812450508">4</xref></sup> Commonly included in a radiologist’s interpretation of these scans are findings unrelated to the chief complaint and not pertinent to the immediate patient care in the ED. These are classified as “incidental findings.”</p>
<p>Although CT scans are widely used diagnostic tests and are generally considered safe, their use has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812450508">5</xref></sup> When applied to the large number of children treated in the ED annually, the radiation risk becomes more apparent. Several evidence-based decision rules have been proposed to provide emergency physicians with tools to decrease the risk of undetected occult intracranial injury while limiting the number of CT scans performed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450508">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812450508">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812450508"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812450508">8</xref></sup> yet it is estimated that approximately 20% of children treated in the ED for a closed head injury receive a CT scan as part of their evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812450508">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The usage pattern of CT scans in adult patients with a closed head injury has resulted in the discovery of radiographic findings incidental to the patient’s traumatic injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812450508">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812450508">11</xref></sup> Whereas traumatic intracranial lesions commonly found in CT scans obtained after head trauma in children have been well described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812450508">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812450508"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812450508"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812450508">15</xref></sup> to our knowledge there are no reports describing incidental findings in children treated in the ED for head injuries.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to assess the incidental findings discovered in children with head trauma undergoing CT scan in the ED and to describe the clinical relevance associated with these findings.</p>

<title>Study Design and Patient Selection</title>
<p>This retrospective review was approved by our institutional review board. Our institution maintains 2 EDs in free-standing, urban, university-affiliated children’s hospitals that have a combined annual census of more than 80 000 visits per year. We used our electronic medical records system (CERNER, Kansas City, MO) data warehouse to identify all patients who were treated in the ED between June and December 2010 and received a CT scan of the head, regardless of the chief complaint.</p>
<p>Patients were included in this study if they had a CT scan performed as part of an evaluation for any International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes related to head injury (800-804.99, 850-854.9, 959.01). Patients were excluded from this study if they were found to be medically complex, have a history of preexisting bone disease, sustained a penetrating injury, or the injury happened more than 7 days prior to the ED visit. Children were determined to be medically complex if they were technology dependent or had a significant chromosomal disorder that resulted in severe developmental delays.</p>
<p>Patients were categorized into 2 age-groups, namely, 0 to 2 years and 3 to 19 years, during analyses for comparison of younger children, thought to be at higher risk for occult intracranial injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812450508">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812450508"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812450508">8</xref></sup> with older children.</p>

<sec id="section9-0009922812450508">
<title>Computed Tomography Findings</title>
<p>All CT scans were interpreted by board-certified pediatric radiologists. For the purposes of this study, we examined the radiologist’s final reports for any notation of incidental findings. CT findings indicative of injury (eg, skull fracture, intracranial injury, intracranial hemorrhages) were classified as trauma related. Findings unrelated to the chief complaint and not pertinent to the immediate patient care in the ED were classified as incidental findings. All findings documented in the radiologist’s report, including extracranial findings such as sinus and bone abnormalities, were considered in this study. Sinus opacification was considered as an incidental finding only if there were air-fluid levels described in the radiologist’s reading in an attempt to avoid including chronic conditions into the data analysis.</p>
<p>Computed tomography (LightSpeed, 16-MDCT scanner, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with 2.5-mm collimation was performed of the head. All imaging was performed without film, and the images were reviewed with a PACS (Fuji Synapse 3.1.0, Fujifilm Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) at a 3-megapixel resolution. Our institution adheres to ALARA (as low as reasonable achievable) principles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812450508">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to identify the population including frequency distributions for dichotomous variables such as gender and race, and mean (SD), median (range) for continuous variables such as age. Incidental findings were assessed for differences by age using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis or Fisher’s exact test. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were used for significance levels. Computation of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was performed for assessing the risk associated with each age group. All analysis was performed in SPSS V17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<p>During the study period, a total of 594 patients were treated in the ED and had received a head CT scan, with 524 (88.2%) patients identified as having met our inclusion criteria and had undergone CT scan imaging as part of the ED evaluation of head trauma. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812450508">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic and basic clinical characteristics of the study population.

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate incidental findings on head CT scans obtained in children treated in an ED for head trauma. In our investigation, more than 26% had a clinically relevant incidental finding reported by a board-certified pediatric radiologist.</p>
<p>Sinus opacification was by far the most common incidental finding noted in our study. This is in contrast to the findings of studies of adult patients with incidental head CT findings where neoplasm is much more common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812450508">11</xref></sup> Given the young age of our population and the frequency of upper respiratory disease in this age-group, it is not surprising that sinus opacification was the most common incidental finding. We only included patients with air-fluid levels associated with sinus opacification in this study in an effort to capture only clinically relevant findings, as opacification without air-fluid levels could be chronic, thus less relevant in the ED. In this study, patients with nasal drainage and facial pressure were significantly more likely to have an incidental finding, which also suggests that the findings reported by the radiologist were clinically relevant. Finally, because data was collected from June to December, less viral respiratory illnesses were presumably present in our community. This makes the possibility of allergies or a viral upper respiratory illness causing radiographic changes in the sinuses much less likely. It may be that sinus opacification is even more commonly found during winter months.</p>
<p>Our findings also show that approximately 5% of children who had CT scans obtained as part of the ED evaluation had a finding related to trauma (skull fracture or intracranial injury). This is similar to rates reported in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450508">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812450508">4</xref></sup> Of note, far more children had incidental findings than trauma-related findings. A possible explanation for this could be that most children in this study sustained a minor head injury as defined by validated clinical decision rules commonly used in our ED.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812450508">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812450508">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, we found that younger children with incidental findings were more likely to receive a prescription for an oral antibiotic than older children and were more likely to be referred to a specialist than older children. The reasons for this are unclear. Perhaps many ED providers are more guarded in treating this segment of the population and may treat sinusitis based on radiologic findings alone. The fact that it is easier to elicit a history of sinus-related symptoms in an older child may also lead many ED providers to decide not to treat radiographic findings of sinusitis if a patient denies any clinically relevant symptoms in the ED.</p>
<p>In our study, approximately 25% of children with incidental findings had an additional intervention (not trauma related) to their care in the ED. This is slightly higher than that described in adult studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812450508">17</xref></sup> in which the rate of incidental findings necessitating follow-up has been reported to be 15%. This situation poses a particular challenge to trauma services and their practice guidelines. The clinical follow-up of patients with incidental findings has not been widely studied in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812450508">18</xref></sup> and, to our knowledge, has not been studied in children. It is clear, however, that mismanagement of some incidental findings can have a potentially serious effect on patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812450508">19</xref></sup> While we do not suggest that providers alter any clinical decision to obtain imaging studies in children with closed head injuries, we do recommend that providers develop a process to ensure that incidental findings be addressed in the ED prior to discharge.</p>
<p>There were limitations to our study. Our data reflect patients seen at an urban level-3 trauma center and may not be indicative of results at other institutions. Because it is a retrospective study, we are limited to the variables collected and the accuracy with which they were collected. The potential exists for residual confounding from variables that were not included in our analysis. We did not contact families after the ED visits and therefore do not know if the prescribed antibiotics were actually used. We did not have access to all specialist referral follow-up documentation in children with incidental findings, thus we were unable to fully comment on patient outcomes. Some patients with incidental findings may have received interventions not documented in the medical record. The strengths of the study, however, were that we evaluated all children who received a CT scan of the head in the ED during the time period, regardless of final ED diagnosis. The time period selected for this study had fewer ED visits for upper respiratory illnesses, thus reducing other biases that can cause sinus changes on CT scan imaging.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As CT scan imaging in children with head trauma continues to increase, incidental findings will continue to be found. Clinicians should consider forming protocols to manage these findings consistently and appropriately, particularly the clinical relevance of sinus opacification. Clinicians should not alter their decision to obtain emergency imaging of children with closed head injuries, but they should consider the potential of discovering an incidental finding that may modify clinical management.</p>
