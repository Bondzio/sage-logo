We sought to characterize the relationship between a single or multiple measurements of early follicular phase urinary FSH and fertility. Women (n = 209), 30 to 44 years old with no history of infertility, who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months, provided early follicular phase urine. Participants subsequently kept a diary to record bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. A subset of women (N = 95) collected urine on cycle day 3 for up to 6 cycles. Urine was analyzed for FSH and creatinine (cr) corrected. Proportional hazard models were used to calculate fecundability ratios (FRs). Urinary FSH levels across cycles from the same woman were highly correlated (adjusted intraclass correlation = .77); within-woman variance was 3-fold lower than variance among women. Women with an initial urinary FSH level &lt;7 mIU/mg cr exhibited a nonsignificant reduction in the probability of pregnancy (adjusted FR 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-1.13), as did women with elevated urinary FSH (≥12 mIU/mg cr; adjusted FR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.46-1.32). Using the most recent or maximum urinary FSH value did not strengthen the association. In the general population, urinary FSH levels appear to be nonlinearly associated with fertility; however, broad CIs indicate a lack of statistical significance. Repetitive testing appears to be of little benefit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fecundability</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>follicle-stimulating hormone</kwd><kwd>ovarian reserve</kwd><kwd>urine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112459226"><title>Introduction</title><p>Women are delaying their attempts to conceive to later ages, increasing the prevalence of age-related infertility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459226">1</xref></sup> The American Society for Reproductive Medicine launched a campaign in 2002 to increase awareness of age-related infertility.

A number of commercial urinary FSH kits are FDA approved for this purpose and marketed to consumers.

English-speaking women between 30 and 44 years of age, who had been attempting to conceive for 3 months or less or were about to start trying to conceive, were eligible for participation in the study. Women with a history of infertility, polycystic ovarian disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, pelvic radiation, or with a partner with a history of infertility were excluded from participation. Women were recruited through community flyers, mass e-mails, and print advertising. Eligible women were enrolled and provided informed consent at their study visit, which was scheduled for the second, third, or fourth menstrual cycle day (first day defined as the first day of menses) following determination of eligibility. Women, who were determined to be eligible while contracepting, were enrolled in the menstrual cycle immediately following cessation of birth control.</p><p>At the study visit, women provided a baseline urine sample. A subset of this cohort agreed to collect first morning urine on cycle days 2 and 3 in each subsequent cycle for up to 5 additional cycles or until pregnancy was detected. For each cycle, urine samples were stored in the participant’s refrigerator for up to 3 days and then shipped via overnight delivery in a cooler with ice packs to the study center.</p><p>In the study center, all urine samples (5 mL) were transferred to polypropylene vials. To prevent degradation of FSH that otherwise occurs in frozen samples, glycerol was added to a final 7% dilution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112459226">14</xref></sup> The urine samples were stored frozen at −80°C until analysis. While trying to conceive, women completed a study diary, which was designed to collect daily information on vaginal bleeding, intercourse, pregnancy test results, and medication use. Participants were asked to complete the diary daily until pregnancy was detected or 3 menstrual cycles had passed, whichever occurred first. Women were given free home pregnancy tests (sensitivity = 20 mIU hCG/mL) and instructed to use them at the time of missed menses.</p><p>Women were instructed to inform study staff of a positive pregnancy test and were provided a free pregnancy ultrasound to encourage notification of pregnancy results. Women who did not report a positive pregnancy test were contacted at 3 and 6 months after the study visit. Women were followed until a positive pregnancy test or until 6 months of attempt following the study visit, whichever occurred first.</p><p>Urine samples were shipped frozen to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Reproductive Endocrinology Laboratory for endocrine analyses. Urinary FSH concentrations were assayed in duplicate using a noncompetitive, 2-site time-resolved immunofluorometric assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112459226">15</xref></sup> Urinary creatinine (cr) concentrations were measured using a Vitros 250 Chemistry Analyzer (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, New Jersey). Urinary FSH values were divided by the respective sample’s creatinine concentration to adjust for urine flow rate. All samples were measured in 1 assay per analyte. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were 3.5% for FSH and 1.1% for cr. When possible, the sample from cycle day 3 was selected for analysis. If a sample from cycle day 3 was not available, a sample from cycle day 2 or day 4 was analyzed. We previously showed high correlation between serum FSH and cr-corrected urinary FSH within our cohort (<italic>r</italic> = .85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112459226">12</xref></sup></p><sec id="section3-1933719112459226"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina), R 2.10.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459226">16</xref></sup>, and WinBUGS 1.4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459226">17</xref></sup> Initially, we evaluated the associations between the baseline urinary FSH hormone levels and fecundability using the full cohort (N = 209) using discrete Cox proportional hazard models to calculate a cycle-specific fecundability ratio (FR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112459226">18</xref></sup> These models accounted for both the right censoring and left truncation (due to women enrolling in the first, second, third, or fourth cycle of pregnancy attempt) present in the data. An FR less than 1.0 suggests reduced fecundability. Pregnancy was defined by the report of a positive home pregnancy test. Maternal age was classified into 3 categories for modeling (30-34, 35-37, and 38-44 years of age). To determine the most appropriate method to model cr-corrected urinary FSH, Kaplan-Meier plots were used to examine time-to-pregnancy by baseline FSH level (categorized &lt;6.0, 6.0-6.9, 7.0-7.9, 8.0-8.9, 9.0-9.9, 10.0-10.9,11.0-11.9, 12.0-12.9, and ≥13.0 mIU/mg cr). Visual inspection of the 9 curves was used to categorize FSH into 3 groups (&lt;7, 7-11.9 and ≥12 mIU/mg cr). The associated unadjusted FRs for the 9 categories illustrate the nonlinear pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112459226">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-1933719112459226" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Unadjusted fecundability ratios by level of baseline urinary follicle-stimulating hormone ([FSH] mIU/mg cr).

The model accommodates multiple acts of intercourse during the fertile window, assumes independence between acts of intercourse, and allows for both the right censoring and left truncation present in the data. Day-specific FRs were calculated using the subcohort of women who provided urine and daily diary data (“baseline urine and diary” subcohort, N = 172). Information from the diary on days of menstrual bleeding, days of intercourse, and results of pregnancy tests were used to estimate day-specific probabilities of pregnancy (probability of pregnancy given an act of intercourse on a fertile day). Ovulation was assumed to have occurred 14 days prior to first day of menses or first positive home pregnancy test, with the fertile window designated as extending from 5 days before to 3 days after day of ovulation based on the standard days method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112459226">21</xref></sup> Prospectively observed cycles were included in the model for up to 3 observed cycles or until pregnancy was detected.</p><p>To determine the intercycle variability of urinary FSH, data from the full cohort were subsequently analyzed, first using a mixed model with the cycle-specific urinary FSH value, a random intercept for each woman, and covariates (the pregnancy attempt cycle, body mass index, age, and menstrual cycle day of collection). Women with higher fecundability contributed fewer cycles to the analysis of variance, which we define as informative conception. To account for potential bias due to informative conception, a mixed model and time-to-conception model were jointly fit with a common random intercept (Guo and Carlin model),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112459226">22</xref></sup> also adjusting for pregnancy attempt cycle, BMI, age, timing of void, and menstrual cycle day of collection. The 2 models led to similar results, implying that informative conception had little effect on estimates. Estimates from the mixed model are presented.</p><p>To determine the value of repetitive urinary FSH testing in the assessment of fecundability, the smaller “repetitive urine” subcohort (N = 95), made up of those women who provided multiple urine samples, was used to determine the associations between (1) the baseline urinary FSH level, (2) the most recent urinary FSH level, or (3) the maximum urinary FSH level and fecundability using 3 separate, discrete Cox proportional hazard models that allowed FSH to vary over time. Time-varying FSH levels were included in the latter 2 models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-1933719112459226"><title>Results</title><sec id="section5-1933719112459226"><title>Participant Characteristics</title><p>A total of 209 women provided a baseline urine sample and completed follow-up; 95 of these women were enrolled in the repetitive urine collection protocol with 71 women providing more than 1 urine sample.

The full cohort and subcohorts did not differ significantly by age distribution, parity, race, male partner age, intercourse frequency, or distribution of baseline FSH levels (Supplemental Table 1).

The findings were strongest in the “repetitive urine” group, but this may be due to chance associated with the small sample size or composition of this group. While statistically significant in the “repetitive urine” subcohort, neither high nor low urinary FSH values were significantly associated with fecundability in the full cohort. Most studies of the relationship between FSH levels (urinary or serum) have not described reduced fecundability in women with low FSH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112459226">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112459226">26</xref></sup>; however, these studies are generally conducted in women receiving gonadotropin therapy for assisted reproduction. It is possible that negative effects of low early follicular phase FSH can be corrected with gonadotropin therapy.</p><p>There are a few studies of early follicular phase FSH levels in women trying to conceive without gonadotropin therapy. The largest study examined the relationship between early follicular phase serum FSH levels and the probability of a spontaneous pregnancy within 12 months of infertility workup among 3519 couples with unexplained infertility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112459226">27</xref></sup> The authors found a lower probability of pregnancy among women with serum FSH values over 8 mIU/mL. The relationship between low serum FSH and fecundability was not discussed; however, graphically the data suggested a small, nonsignficant decline in fecundability at lower FSH values. Li et al noted higher serum and urinary peak FSH levels in conception cycles compared to nonconception cycles among 14 women who conceived with donor insemination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112459226">28</xref></sup> However, others have not noted a relationship between FSH levels and conception following intrauterine insemination without ovarian stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112459226">29</xref></sup></p><p>It is possible that the women in our study with low urinary FSH values (&lt;7 mIU/mg cr, equivalent to &lt;4.5 mIU/mL in serum) exhibited hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian (HPO) axis dysfunction. Data from the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study suggest that low follicular phase luteinizing hormone levels are also associated with reduced fecundability among ovulatory women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112459226">30</xref></sup> The HPO dysfunction may lead to menstrual cycle irregularities. Although participants with low urinary FSH values were less likely to report menstrual cycle irregularity than others, their menstrual cycle lengths as calculated from their daily diaries tended to be longer and exhibit greater variability between cycles. A long menstrual cycle length and menstrual cycle irregularity have been associated with reduced fecundability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112459226">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112459226">32</xref></sup></p><p>Low FSH levels could result in anovulatory cycles or ovulatory dysfunction with lower oocyte quality. In a randomized controlled trial, a large dose of recombinant FSH at the time of human chorionic gonadotropin trigger (mimicking the LH surge) was associated with improved oocyte recovery rates and fertilization following in vitro fertilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112459226">33</xref></sup> Also, low FSH levels could be indicative of luteal phase deficiency. Regularly menstruating, exercising women with luteal phase defects have been shown to have lower urinary FSH levels during the luteal–follicular transition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112459226">34</xref></sup></p><p>Alternatively, women with lower early follicular phase urinary FSH levels may have advanced follicular development resulting in elevated estradiol levels and correspondingly suppressed FSH. Advanced follicular development has been attributed to lower inhibin levels due to reproductive aging. Recent hormone use could also suppress FSH levels and recent birth control pill use has been associated with reduced fecundability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112459226">35</xref></sup>; however, we adjusted for recent hormonal contraceptive use and the relationship between low urinary FSH and reduced fecundability persisted.</p><p>A general trend of reduced fecundability was observed among women with elevated urinary FSH levels. High FSH levels have been associated with diminished ovarian reserve in clinical studies. However, the association between high urinary FSH and reduced fecundability has yet to be established. A number of home urinary FSH kits are marketed to consumers as a fertility test. A positive test, and presumed reduced fertility, is observed with elevated urinary FSH levels. A positive test is noted when urinary values exceed the cutoff value equivalent to a serum value of 10 mIU/mL. Using our assay, the equivalent cutoff value would be 11.5 mIU/mg. Thus, all the women in our high urinary FSH group would have tested positive. While our point estimates would suggest that women with a positive test (high FSH) would exhibit reduced fertility (1) the confidence intervals (CIs) were wide and crossed one and (2) a woman with a negative test cannot be reassured about her fertility, diminishing its value as a “fertility test.” Given our study sample, our findings should not be generalized to women younger than age 30. Fertility tests would likely have poor predictive value in a group at low risk for reproductive aging.</p><p>As seen in previous studies, within a woman intercycle variability of FSH is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112459226">36</xref></sup> Previous studies have suggested that variability of FSH levels increases with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459226">13</xref></sup> However, younger women conceive in fewer cycles than older women, which could lead to bias due to informative conception (women with higher fecundability contribute fewer cycles to the analysis of variance). Our analysis, which accounted for informative conception, confirmed that variability of FSH increases with age.</p><p>Information from repetitive testing of early follicular phase urine for FSH does not appear to strengthen the association between urinary FSH and fecundability; FRs using the time-varying FSH models with the most recent urinary FSH value were not significantly different from those models using only the baseline FSH value. Sampling FSH values over multiple cycles and choosing the maximum FSH also did not strengthen the association. There appears to be little benefit to obtaining urinary FSH values over multiple cycles to predict fecundability.</p><p>In this study all baseline urine samples were non–first morning void urine samples, while 90% of the urine samples from subsequent cycles were first morning void urines. This could be viewed as a limitation in our study of the value of repetitive urinary FSH testing. Most protocols measure urinary FSH in first morning urine. However, we did adjust for cr in the samples, which should adjust for differing rates of urine production (and subsequent concentrations) between samples. In general, cr levels tend to be higher in first morning samples due to decreased urine production overnight. However, early follicular phase serum FSH levels appear to have some diurnal variation, with lower levels observed during sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112459226">37</xref></sup> Thus within a woman, one can presume that a first void urine sample would have lower cr-corrected FSH levels compared to a urine sample collected later in the day. To accommodate for differences in timing of collection in the urine samples, time of urine collection (first morning void versus later) was added to the model created to measure intercycle variability in urinary FSH. This did not alter our conclusions that multiple measures are of little benefit.</p><p>After adjusting for factors (such as age, contraceptive use, etc) which are correlated with urinary FSH levels, the CIs for the adjusted FRs from the full cohort crossed one, so that the observed effects of FSH may be driven by its relationship with these factors, particularly age. If this were to be true, our concerns about the validity of commercial urinary FSH kits would remain. Women with partners who had known fertility problems were excluded from the study, but no semen analyses were performed. We assumed that the prevalence of male subfertility will be equally distributed across urinary FSH levels. This study used models to measure the association between urinary FSH and natural fertility: Cox models and day-specific models, which adjust for frequency and timing of intercourse. Results from the 2 models were similar.</p><p>In summary, early follicular phase urinary FSH values appear to have a nonlinear association with fecundability in women between the ages of 30 and 44; both low and high values suggest reduced fecundability. However, the findings of reduced fecundability in both groups were not statistically significant, suggesting the need for larger studies. Due to the generally low intercycle variability in urinary FSH, repetitive urinary testing appears to be of little benefit. Future studies are needed to confirm and further explore the potential mechanism by which low early follicular phase FSH could lead to reduced fertility. In the meantime, a woman with a negative fertility test based on urinary FSH should not presume normal fertility.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Drs Allen Wilcox and Carmen Williams provided helpful comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.
