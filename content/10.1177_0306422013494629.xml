<p>When <bold>Ricardo Gonzalez</bold> and his colleagues received an anonymous death threat they refused to remain silent. It’s essential that human rights defenders continue to fight for protection and justice</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In April, the free expression organisation ARTICLE 19’s Mexico City office received an anonymous death threat. We had experienced other security incidents in the past and, acknowledging the fact that violent attacks against those working to protect human rights is on the increase and that there is a general decline in the health of these rights in Mexico, we decided to go public. Concerned over the safety of our staff as well as the impact the threat would have on our work, our sources and partners urged us to demand protection from the government. Since 2006, we have documented more than 900 violations against the right to freedom of expression and provided emergency assistance to around 100 journalists in distress, as well as to their families. It was widely believed that the threat came from someone who had been implicated in one of these crimes.</p>
<p>Over the years, thanks to the talent and commitment of our staff and supporters, we have created a methodology to protect free expression in such environments – where, at moments, the line between peace and armed conflict disappears. We learn, test and improve our operations every day and remain close to the needs of Mexican journalists. We were not the first human rights defenders receiving threats in Mexico and, sadly, we will not be the last. Yes, fear was more present than ever, but the expressions of solidarity from around the world reaffirmed our conviction that the work we do is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>The threat came at a key moment for ARTICLE 19 and myself, as I had recently been appointed the head of the new Global Protection Programme and my colleagues were stepping up to adapt to the changes that this decision implied.</p>
<p>The Mexican government immediately offered protection measures for all staff members under the newly created Protection Mechanism for Human Rights Defenders and Journalists; I could not help but feel guilty about other human rights defenders that had not received the same treatment before us and had been killed or forced to flee the country. Despite statements from numerous officials and the launch of the new protection policy, the safeguard of human rights defenders and journalists still relies on the political will of the government.</p>
<p>‘To speak is to think,’ the poet Octavio Paz wrote. During my work at ARTICLE 19, I have come to understand the profound discernment of the power and implications of speaking out. As head of the Protection and Freedom of Expression Programme at ARTICLE 19 in Mexico in the midst of an unprecedented public security crisis that has killed almost 60,000 people, I have been an eyewitness to the indolence and incapacity of a government eager to reduce the situation to a problem of perception and image. Yet I have the privilege to witness the courage and strength of those overcoming the loss of a loved one, dealing with the constant denial of justice and proper reparation. The protection team has drawn its strength from these experiences, speaking out against the spiral of violence, silence and impunity prevailing in many regions throughout Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world for media workers: since 2000, 74 journalists have been killed and 17 remain missing. In addition, 61 human rights defenders have been killed since 2006. Impunity seems to be the response of the state in every single case.</p>
<p>The democratic end to the 72-year-rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 2000 has had mixed results for human rights in Mexico. On one hand, we have seen the launch of a public policy and autonomous commissions to protect rights and liberties, and on the other, we have experienced the persistence of violence as a method to impose silence on the press. Although the last two National Action Party (PAN) presidential administrations accused organised groups of these crimes, evidence suggests that state agents continue to be the main perpetrators.</p>
<p>On the positive side, this crude contradiction has resulted in the strengthening of civil society and the professionalisation and proliferation of voices against injustice. PRI’s recent return to power has encountered a strong opposition against old autocratic practices from the past. There is an ever growing movement of people and organisations engaging with victims and demanding justice. It is clear for me that there is still room for hope – and change remains a realistic possibility.</p>
<p>Since I joined ARTICLE 19’s team in 2006, I have been inspired by the courage, dignity and uncompromised solidarity of so many colleagues, journalists and human right defenders, from all over Mexico. I am certain that we will continue our work in Mexico, as well as in our other regional offices, building stronger security protocols and even deeper commitment. We continue to adapt to the complexities and changes of the current environment. Our demands for justice will be met.</p>
