<abstract>
<p>This article argues that psychological factors determine the content of people’s work motivations but that social factors determine their relative importance. The author identified six universal human needs and corresponding rewards, orientations to work, organizational control methods, and types of involvement. The author used data from a public sector organization to illustrate these orientations. He used Randall Collins’s ritual interaction theory and Etzioni’s compliance theory to explain why ritual, utilitarian, and intrinsic rewards yield moral, calculative, and intrinsic forms of involvement. He concludes that motivation varies more in accordance with hierarchical rank, control methods, and occupation than it does with sectoral location.</p>

<p>The motivation of public sector employees is a key question for public management but one that has been largely ignored by public sector scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711412728">Wright, 2001</xref>). In this article, I will address this issue through a case study of a large public sector organization. My intention is to provide a conceptual framework for exploring this topic that identifies the primary motivations to work, their key organizational determinants, and their typical behavioral manifestations. I will do this by expanding the concept of “orientations to work” that was first advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe, Lockwood, Bechhofer, and Platt (1968)</xref>. Although Goldthorpe et al. distinguished three such orientations, this article will identify six. I will argue that with the use of these six orientations, we can synthesize the diverse and often contradictory literatures on work motivation. Research on the determinants of work motivation in the public sector can be classified into two major streams as follows: one that focuses on employee characteristics and the other that focuses on the organizational environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711412728">Wright, 2001</xref>). These two streams reflect the two dominant approaches to the study of work motivation, namely, the psychological approach and the sociological approach. Psychologists see motivation as the product of biologically based needs or drives or of the desire to maximize individual utility. Sociologists by contrast see work motives as the product of the social environment, including the work environment, the nonwork environment, and the social attributes of individuals. Sociologists have criticized psychological approaches to work motivation on the grounds that they neglect the influence of the social environment and overemphasize the role of biology and/or individual rationality as causative agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399711412728">Thompson &amp; McHugh, 1995</xref>). The result is that although psychological theories can explain what motives people hold, they cannot explain variations in the relative importance of such motives. As Goldthorpe et al. observed “wants and expectations are culturally determined <italic>variables</italic>, not psychological constants” (p. 178). Another problem with psychological theories is that they tend to have an individualistic and hedonistic bias, to stress the importance of clear and specific goals and of reward-performance expectancies for individual motivation, to emphasize easily observable and discrete behavior, to have a limited concept of intrinsic motivation, and to exclude values and moral obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir, 1991</xref>). A psychological approach to work motivation that sees it as being based purely on subjective expectations of personal utility in specific situations that are divorced from wider social contexts is therefore inadequate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir (1991)</xref> recommended that we adopt a “self-concept”-based theory to rectify these defects. Self-concept theory is based on the following assumptions: (a) behavior is not only goal oriented and instrumental but also expressive of feelings, attitudes, and concepts; (b) people are motivated to maintain and enhance their self-esteem and self-worth; (c) people are motivated to retain and increase their sense of self-consistency and can thereby obtain meaning; (d) self-concepts are composed of identities; and (e) self-concept behavior is not always related to clear expectations or to immediate and specific goals but sometimes to imagined possibilities and faith. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711412728">Perry (2000)</xref> has endorsed Shamir’s critique of motivation theory and argues that we need to recognize the role of normative conformity and affective bonding grounded in emotional responses to social contexts in addition to that of rational choice as foundations of motivation. In this article, I will draw on the neo-Durkheimian theory of motivation advanced by the sociological theorist Randall Collins. The assumptions that underpin Collins’s theory are the same as those of self-concept theory and accord with Perry’s recommendations for reconstructing motivation theory. This is because Collins argues that human behavior is moral and symbolic as well as pragmatic, that people are motivated by both symbolic and utilitarian rewards, that people seek to maintain their self-esteem, and that ritual social encounters generate emotional energy and moral ideals that motivate and guide human behavior.</p>
<p>Although psychological approaches have defects, they should not be discarded altogether. This is because sociological theories of motivation tend to overlook the psychological basis of conduct and to present us with an “oversocialized” conception of human beings. This is one in which motivations are seen to be solely the product of such social factors as family background, education, economic situation, and the workplace. There are grounds for doubting that this is the case though. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711412728">Fukuyama (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399711412728">Pinker (2002)</xref> have argued, the “blank slate” model of the human mind that has historically dominated sociology is questionable. For example, the fact that workers located in different social contexts typically nominate the same types of rewards as being desirable suggests that such reward preferences have psychological rather than social origins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711412728">Maslow (1943)</xref> argued that we can identify five universal human needs as bases of motivation. Other social scientists maintain that human beings possess universal needs that are innate rather than socially acquired (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711412728">Doyal &amp; Gough, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711412728">Etzioni, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711412728">Fitzgerald, 1977a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412728">Inglehart &amp; Welzel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711412728">Lane, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711412728">Saunders, 1995</xref>). Marx and Frankfurt school theorists such as Fromm and Marcuse also endorsed the notion of universal human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711412728">Fitzgerald, 1977b</xref>). Others similarly argue that needs for ontological security, meaning, and creative activity are intrinsic to the human condition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711412728">Argyris, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711412728">Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711412728">Giddens, 1984</xref>). Such needs typically figure in typologies of work motivation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412728">Fox (1971)</xref> argued that work provides a range of rewards, including spiritual salvation, intrinsic rewards, material rewards, status, security, and social relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399711412728">Rosenberg (1957)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711412728">Argyle (1972)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711412728">Bennett (1978)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399711412728">Thompson and McHugh (1995)</xref> likewise identified economic/extrinsic rewards, intrinsic rewards, and social rewards as separate bases of work motivation.</p>
<p>To understand work motivation, we need to combine psychological and sociological perspectives. In this article, I will argue that work motivations have both psychological and social foundations. Innate psychological needs determine the content or direction of work motivation, that is, the types of rewards that people seek to obtain from work, whereas the social environment determines the relative importance of such motivations, that is, the extent to which people will seek one reward as opposed to another. My concern is to identify the motivations of public sector employees, their key social determinants, and their behavioral manifestations. I will not address the question of what determines the strength of employee motivation, that is, how willing or “motivated” people are to undertake work. We can therefore identify three analytically distinguishable research questions in studying motivation: (a) What motives do people hold? (b) Why do people hold some motives in preference to others? and (c) To what extent are people willing to act on such motives? My concern in this article is with only the first two of these questions. The term “work motivation” refers to the factors that induce people to enter work, to remain in the job, and to engage in work. Each of these may differ, and work motivation accordingly represents an amalgam of such factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir (1991)</xref> maintained that a shortcoming of psychological theories is that they do not account for such enduring and broadly manifested work motivations as opposed to the motivation to undertake specific tasks in particular situations. It is with this general underlying motivation for work that this article is concerned. Such motivations may be either conscious or unconscious. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711412728">Giddens (1984)</xref> observed, we may distinguish unconscious motivations from the rationalization of action found in everyday practical awareness and in discursive consciousness.</p>

<title>Human Needs, Orientations to Work, and Organizational Control Methods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711412728">Maslow (1943)</xref> argued that human beings have five universal needs. These are as follows: (a) physiological needs for water, food, sleep, and sex; (b) safety needs for security, freedom from fear, anxiety, and chaos; (c) social needs for belongingness and love; (d) self-esteem needs; and (e) self-actualization needs for creative activity, cognition, and aesthetic experience. We can identify rewards that correspond to these needs in the sense that they typically serve to satisfy them. These are as follows: (a) economic, physical, and emotional security; (b) utilitarian rewards; (c) status; (d) group belonging and affection; (e) a sense of meaning; and (f) intrinsic rewards. The last two categories of rewards satisfy needs for self-actualization. Most of these rewards correspond to or incorporate the main sources of pleasure that have been identified by factor analysis. These are as follows: (a) eating, drinking, and sex; (b) rest and sleep; (c) spouse, friends, and other close social relationships; (d) success, promotion, and satisfaction with self; (e) physical activity, sport, and feeling healthy; (f) task performance and use of skills; (g) reading, music, TV, and other cultural activities; and (h) intense experiences, for example, aesthetic and religious. A sense of meaning also contributes strongly toward personal happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). A number of factors suggest the existence of such universal human needs. The first is that these needs figure in a range of institutional contexts, including work, the family, religion, education, and leisure. For example, desires for intrinsic and social rewards, status, and meaningful activity also underpin leisure motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). The second is that there is a high degree of consensus among people concerning the desirability of these rewards. For example, a representative sample of the Australian adult population ranked all of the following six attributes of a job (high income, job security, interesting work, importance and a sense of accomplishment, the chance to make friends, and the chance to use skills) as being at least moderately important. Hardly any used low importance response categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711412728">Reed, 1997</xref>). The third is that people in different cultures exhibit similar reward preferences and that these rewards are sources of happiness in different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412728">Inglehart &amp; Welzel, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals develop wants for these rewards to satisfy their needs. These wants underlie work motivation insofar as people undertake work to satisfy them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref> used the term “orientations to work” to refer to peoples’ wants and expectations of work. They identify three primary orientations to work, namely, the instrumental, bureaucratic, and solidaristic. These correspond to the desires for payment, career advancement, and social rewards, respectively. Goldthorpe et al. maintain that orientations to work are acquired prior to entry to work. Others see them as being the product of the experience of work. In either case, it is social rather than psychological factors that underlie these orientations. If human beings have innate needs, then their orientations to work may initially arise in response to such needs rather than as a result of social influences. The latter may simply determine the relative importance of such orientations for individuals. Such social determinants of orientations to work may include education, social class, culture, organizational incentives, and economic situation.</p>
<p>This article will focus on the role of one social determinant in particular, namely, organizational control methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711412728">Etzioni (1961)</xref> argued that the motivation displayed by organizational members reflects the kind of control method to which they are subject. Organizational members exhibit three different kinds of ego “involvement,” namely, alienative, calculative, and moral, depending on whether they are subject to control by means of coercion, material rewards, or normative symbols. The latter include symbols of status and normative symbols of love and acceptance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins (1988)</xref> has extended Etzioni’s compliance theory by identifying a range of additional control methods such as preselection and socialization, order giving and promotion possibilities, ritual participation, surveillance, inspecting outcomes, rules and written orders, information control, and environmental control. The first three of these control methods involve the use of normative symbols, whereas the remainder are largely associated with the use of coercion and material rewards. He also identifies specific compliance outcomes to which each of these control methods give rise. I will use the classification of control methods provided by Collins as the basis of my analysis. I will show that different organizational control methods yield the different compliance outcomes that Collins predicts and that each of these control methods yields a particular kind of involvement in Etzioni’s terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0095399711412728">
<title>Randall Collins’s Interaction Ritual Theory</title>
<p>To understand why different control methods yield different compliance outcomes, I will draw on Collins’s “interaction ritual” theory. He proposes that there are two kinds of rewards and punishments: ritual ones that come from participating in group rituals and mundane or secular ones that are usually experienced by the individual alone. Ritual rewards such as deference, group belonging, and compliance involve a deeper level of the self than utilitarian rewards and are potentially more powerful than the latter. Ritual rewards generate sentiments of group solidarity and feelings of obligation toward those involved, in contrast to mundane rewards. Collins sees purely economic exchanges as involving the provision of mundane or utilitarian rewards. These may be contrasted with symbolic-emotional (“gift”) exchanges. Collins sees such exchanges as being Durkheimian rituals inasmuch they involve emotional rewards of solidarity, belonging, status, and dominance that are intrinsic to the encounter itself rather than a deliberate exchange of rewards in a spirit of competitive self-interest. Collins distinguishes two kinds of rituals: deference and egalitarian. The former involves power relations of subordination, whereas the latter occurs between equals. Collins maintains that situations of domination provide greater ego rewards for power holders than they do for power subjects, who undergo ego loss, especially in situations involving coercion. Coercion and other deference rituals generate alienation from the moral ideals of power holders among power subjects but commitment to such ideals among power holders. Egalitarian rituals by contrast generate more uniform moral sentiments. Ritual rewards such as deference and social acceptance generate beliefs in the moral legitimacy of the group and its symbols. Ritual punishments such as coercion, order taking, social exclusion, and blocked mobility by contrast generate alienation from the moral ideals of the group. Ritual rewards and punishments underlie Etzioni’s categories of moral and alienative involvement, whereas utilitarian rewards underlie his category of calculative involvement. Social psychologists similarly distinguish between moral and pragmatic bases of social conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>I will argue that we can identify egoistic, altruistic, and idealistic involvement as distinct subcategories of moral involvement. These correspond to the ritual rewards of status, social acceptance, and meaning, respectively. Utilitarian rewards comprise material rewards and physical and economic security. Intrinsic rewards are neither ritual nor utilitarian in nature because they are obtained when performing an action for its own sake rather than for an external purpose and are normally experienced by the individual alone. We can therefore identify six universal human needs that are satisfied by six categories of rewards. The desire for these rewards is manifested in six orientations to work. These orientations are typically evoked by certain organizational control methods, and they yield particular types of ego involvement. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711412728">Table 1</xref> depicts these relationships.</p>

<p>Column 1 identifies six basic human needs. Column 2 identifies the rewards that satisfy these needs. Column 3 identifies the orientations that people display when they seek to obtain these rewards. For example, people seek to satisfy their safety needs by obtaining the rewards of physical, economic, and emotional security. When they do so, they display a defensive orientation to work. Column 4 identifies the organizational control methods that provide (or deny) these rewards. For example, the use of coercion as a control method typically gives rise to a defensive orientation. I have identified six orientations to work rather than the three that were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref>. These are the defensive, instrumental, thymotic, solidaristic, vocational, and expressive orientations. These six orientations correspond to needs for safety, physiological health, esteem, group belonging, meaning, and self-expression, respectively. The last two are different aspects of the need for “self-actualization.” The “bureaucratic orientation” identified by Goldthorpe et al. is an amalgam of three of these orientations, namely, the instrumental, thymotic, and vocational. Corresponding to these six orientations are six types of involvement (see column 5). Egoistic, altruistic, and idealistic forms of moral involvement correspond to the rewards of status, social acceptance, and a sense of meaning, respectively. “Intrinsic involvement” corresponds to intrinsic rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). The rewards listed in column 2 may be grouped into three primary categories, namely, utilitarian, ritual, and intrinsic. These correspond to calculative, moral, and intrinsic involvement, respectively. Moral involvement can be either positive or negative. In the former case, it involves commitment to moral ideals, whereas in the latter case, it involves an alienation from them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al., 1968</xref>). People exhibit the former when they obtain ritual rewards and the latter when they are denied such rewards.</p>
<p>The extent to which workers display these orientations to work depends on various aspects of their social environment, including their prework socialization, the nature of their work tasks, their economic and labor market situation, and the method of organizational control to which they are subject. These encourage or discourage workers to acquire particular orientations by increasing or restricting the availability of certain rewards. Under favorable conditions, people will seek to satisfy the full range of their needs, whereas under less favorable conditions, their motivations will be restricted to those that are realistically attainable. People may therefore have both high- and low-priority aspirations with respect to their work, the former being those that are actively entertained and pursued, whereas the latter are those that are less strongly held because they seem unrealistic or beyond reasonable hope of realization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412728">Fox, 1971</xref>). Although the six orientations listed above are analytically distinct, workers usually display a number of them in combination. This is because workers typically seek to obtain a range of rewards from their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711412728">Brown, 1992</xref>). In this sense, the six orientations to work are ideal types.</p>
<p>This article draws on two sources of data. The first is data that I have collected from a particular organization, namely, the Australian Public Service (APS). The second is data from various studies of work, organizations, and human motivation. The APS employs 130,000 employees and is the single largest employer of wage and salary earners in Australia. Its members perform a diverse range of white-collar tasks, including professional, managerial, and clerical work. In total, 72% of APS staff are employed in the “clerical/administrative” classifications. In all, 85% of staff are “administrative service officers” (ASOs), 14% are “senior officers,” and 1% are members of the senior executive service (SES). Data on the APS were obtained from the following sources: (a) 12 staff surveys, including service wide surveys conducted in 1975 by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>) and in 1992 by the Management Advisory Board-Management Improvement Advisory Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412728">MAB-MIAC, 1992</xref>); (b) in-depth, semistructured interviews with 20 former and serving APS employees obtained by means of incidental and snowball sampling; (c) academic studies, including the survey and interview data on Australian Taxation Office (ATO) staff collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans, Frazer-Jans, and McMahon (1989)</xref>. This includes a 93-page document (<italic>The Tax Office Speaks</italic>) containing 1,314 comments made by 768 people who constituted one third of all the respondents to a sample survey of ATO staff; and (d) documentary sources, including newspapers, official reports, and studies by academics and public servants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095399711412728">
<title>Coercion and Job Insecurity: The Defensive Orientation</title>
<p>The first orientation is the “defensive.” It arises when people seek to avoid risks to their physical, economic, or emotional security. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412728">Inglehart and Welzel (2005)</xref> argued that when survival is uncertain, the entire life strategy of people is shaped by the struggle to survive. People under such conditions adopt “survival values” that express a preference for economic and physical security over self-expression and quality of life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711412728">Norris and Inglehart (2004)</xref> argued that the core idea of “human security” connotes freedom from various risks and dangers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711412728">Maslow (1943)</xref> observed, people have “safety needs” for security and for freedom from fear, anxiety, and chaos. The defensive orientation arises when workers experience high levels of insecurity, whether this is of an economic, physical, or emotional nature. Workers under these conditions seek to minimize these insecurities by avoiding economic, physical, and emotional risks. Peasants for example, usually live at subsistence level and face insecurities that arise from predatory landlords, wars, droughts, floods, pestilences, and diseases. Peasant culture is accordingly characterized by distrust, fear, and risk aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711412728">Kautsky, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399711412728">Rogers, 1969</xref>). For workers in modern society, insecurity of employment is the major source of work-related risk, although this is mitigated by the provision of social welfare. Nonetheless, economic security remains a highly valued feature of a job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711412728">Brown, 1997</xref>). Another source of insecurity for workers is the use of coercion by employers. In preindustrial societies, workers often faced the prospect of physical punishment or even death if they failed to comply with the demands of their overlords. Although workers today no longer face such threats, they may, nonetheless, be punished through dismissal, demotion, and denial of promotion. Such insecurities are more commonly experienced by blue-collar workers. For example, Collinson (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711412728">Littler, 1990</xref>) found that a fear of redundancy was a constant preoccupation of the manual workers that he studied. This led them to impose strict limits on their cooperative and productive efforts, a compliance outcome that Etzioni’s theory of control predicts.</p>
<p>The public sector has traditionally sought to offset the lower salaries that it offers in comparison with the private sector by providing greater job security. This can yield a defensive orientation among workers. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA (1976)</xref> found that security of employment was the second most important reason why people remained in the public service and was the most important reason why they had joined. Leaving a job can entail financial penalties such as a loss of superannuation entitlements in addition to the risk of unemployment. The RCAGA found that “too much to lose by moving outside” was seen as being a very or somewhat important reason for remaining in the public service by 62% of respondents. Most workers are subject to a degree of economic coercion inasmuch as they need to engage in paid employment to support themselves and their families. This compulsion is greatest for those workers who experience insecure employment, have few marketable skills, earn low incomes, have limited assets, and extensive economic liabilities. Such conditions are most commonly encountered among the working class. Working-class men, for example, are keenly aware of the fact that their option of leaving work is restricted once they have married and acquired children and mortgages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711412728">Donaldson, 1991</xref>). One informant maintained that his workmates “just worked there to pay their mortgages.” Another commented that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There were people who’d got themselves into . . . mortgages and marriages and could force themselves to go to work every day no matter what, to do jobs that they hated . . . People needed the money and they were just resigned to it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, work for most people is undertaken primarily out of economic necessity. For example, only one third of workers in Britain would continue in their present employment if it was financially unnecessary for them to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). Collins notes that rewards can be used coercively when authorities threaten to take them away. For example, one informant observed that supervisors “held the whip hand” because they could withhold the reward of promotion from their subordinates. Diminished promotion opportunities within the APS in the late 1980s and early 1990s reduced the scope for using promotion as a control method. Accordingly, official recommendations were made that more use be made of punitive measures such as the withholding of incremental advancement and “classification regression” as well as of alternative rewards such as performance pay, as means of motivating staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711412728">Australia, Public Service Commission, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins (1988)</xref> maintained that organizational members controlled by coercion will react by resistance and if possible, by avoiding the coercing situation and finally, if lacking other alternatives, by dull minimal compliance. The last of these responses is the most common among APS staff. Informants reported that many of their workmates would do only what they were told and would exercise no initiative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al. (1989)</xref> likewise reported that tax officers “tend to be wait to be told to do things rather than using their own resources to solve problems” (p. 65). Minimal compliance is also manifested in indifference toward the job and work outcomes. For example, 31% of staff in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE) were unwilling to agree that: “it’s important to me how well DPIE performs” whereas 37% were unwilling “to put in effort to help DPIE” (unpublished data). Jans, et al. found that 30% of ATO staff had low organizational commitment and that organizational commitment positively correlated with hierarchical rank. Those in the “low commitment” category were “uncommitted or alienated from the ATO” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711412728">Jans &amp; Frazer-Jans, 1990</xref>). Low commitment in this instance could be attributed to junior organizational location and blocked mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al., 1989</xref>). These findings confirm Collins’s proposition that taking orders and blocked mobility generate alienation from authority. Both of these situations yield compliance outcomes that resemble those produced by coercion because they entail ego loss for subordinates.</p>
<p>Collins argues that order takers acquire a “backstage” personality in which they ignore or privately criticize the ideals of order givers in their backstage group although outwardly displaying deference toward their superiors. For example, informants reported that their workmates would often ridicule or denigrate senior management in private and that many harbored feelings of resentment toward authority. One informant reported that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You’d talk to someone over the phone and you’re just treated like a dogsbody . . . I know that there was one lady that used to ring up and say “I want this file on my desk” and hang up. We felt like not doing it, when you get commands like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711412728">Donaldson (1991)</xref> maintained that the working class is engaged in a constant “fight for dignity” or a strategy of resistance directed at coping with the indignities of subordination within the workplace. He maintains that the most common form that this takes is an attitude of complete disinterest in work or of uncooperativeness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711412728">Collins (1975)</xref> similarly argued that for lower class members in situations of coercion without the opportunity for rebellion or escape, being noncooperative is the only means left for retaining subjective legitimacy.</p>
<p>Resistance, avoidance, and minimal compliance are ways of buttressing one’s self-esteem. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711412728">Collinson (1992)</xref> observed, the defense of the self is a major preoccupation of workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711412728">Fukuyama (1996)</xref> maintained that all human beings believe that they have an inherent worth or dignity and will react with anger where this is not adequately recognized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711412728">Watson (1995)</xref> saw leaving the job, absenteeism, instrumentalism, humor, aggressive masculinity, rule breaking, and demeaning others as means by which workers seek to salve injuries to their sense of self-worth. These forms of behavior resemble those that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins (1988)</xref> identified as being the product of coercion. Alienative involvement with its feelings of anger toward those who have affronted one’s dignity differs from calculative involvement inasmuch as the latter is emotionally neutral. Collins maintains that showing disrespect to the self and other sacred objects is likely to evoke righteous anger. Such anger is not a calculated decision based on utilitarian calculations of what damage the violator has done but a spontaneous reaction that is “symbolic” inasmuch as it is designed to hurt the violator. Alienative involvement is the antithesis of moral involvement because it involves an absence of ritual solidarity and of a sense of moral obligation. The defensive orientation therefore comprises two kinds of involvement, namely, alienative and calculative. The former arises when workers are seeking to protect their self-esteem in coercive situations, whereas the latter is utilitarian in nature and arises when workers are motivated by the prospect of financial, physical, or emotional security.</p>

<title>Material Rewards: The Instrumental Orientation</title>
<p>The instrumental orientation to work arises when people have satisfied their needs for safety and security and seek out material rewards to satisfy other needs. In such situations, people engage in work to obtain monetary rewards and other utilitarian rewards such as promotion, fringe benefits, holidays, good working conditions, job security, and convenient working hours. Etzioni maintains that material rewards are the primary means of control within “utilitarian organizations” such as factories and offices. Survey data confirm that such material rewards as the salary, job security, and the possibility of a career and promotion are the most important reasons why people join the public service and remain employed there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>). All of these rewards were rated as being very or somewhat important by at least two thirds of respondents. As Collins notes, control by the paycheck is so central in modern government agencies that there is little difference between them and private business organizations in this respect.</p>
<p>Collins maintains that the use of material rewards typically results in a narrow form of compliance in which workers focus on the rewards and comply only with those demands that are rewarded and only to the extent that rewards are linked to their behavior. For example, APS employees have traditionally been paid for their hours of attendance at work rather than for what they produce. As a result, many have attended work conscientiously but neglected to perform their work tasks. Complaints about such “time serving” recur constantly in <italic>The Tax Office Speaks</italic>. The Task Force on Management Improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399711412728">TFMI; 1992</xref>) likewise reports that “Staff from all classification levels in regional consultations noted the serious problem of ‘deadwood’ in their agencies” (p. 188). Informants also reported that many of their workmates exerted little work effort. Collins maintains that the use of material rewards generates a nonintrinsic relationship to the product of labor because workers focus on obtaining the rewards rather than on the requirements of the task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al. (1989)</xref> used a measure of “job involvement” when surveying ATO staff (p. 6, 31). This incorporated “intrinsic motivation” or the desire to perform well in the job for its own sake rather than for the sake of extrinsic rewards. They found that only 24% of ATO staff scored high on job involvement, whereas 48% of staff scored low.</p>
<p>Promotion is also a material reward. Its use as a control technique therefore fosters a calculative orientation in which workers balance the prospective rewards and costs of promotion against those of immobility. Many informants reported that their workmates were often unwilling to seek promotion because of the additional workload that it would entail. It was folk wisdom among my workmates, for example, that ASO 6 positions were the most desirable because they were both relatively undemanding and well paid. The use of promotion tends to yield a similar compliance outcome to the use of payment. This is because it involves the provision of material and status rewards that are extrinsic to the work itself. As a result, people focus narrowly on these rewards and the behavior that is required to obtain them rather than on the broad requirements of the job. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412728">Kanter (1977)</xref> has noted, “success” in organizations is defined purely in terms of upward mobility inasmuch as people come to value movement rather than the actual job. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0095399711412728">Williams (1992)</xref> reported that ATO staff were attracted to new multiskilled jobs “more by the perceived opportunity to gain advancement by acquiring new skills than by the work itself” (p. 280). Informants reported that many staff sought to gain work experience in high-status areas even though the work was often routine and uninteresting because such experience would improve their promotion prospects. Some of my workmates acquired a reputation as “professional applicants” because they devoted much of their work time to applying for jobs and preparing for interviews. We may conclude that the use of material rewards yields the predicted compliance outcome, namely, calculative involvement and a narrow focus on the behavior necessary to obtain the rewards at the expense of the requirements of the task itself. The extent to which workers exhibit an instrumental orientation depends also on whether their work provides additional rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711412728">Marshall, Rose, Newby, &amp; Vogler, 1988</xref>). When symbolic emotional and intrinsic rewards are unavailable, workers are more likely to exhibit an instrumental orientation. For example, senior officers, whose jobs provide high levels of intrinsic rewards, place less importance on material rewards than do junior officers, whose jobs provide fewer intrinsic rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>).</p>

<title>Status: The Thymotic Orientation</title>
<p>Although work is an economic necessity for most people, it is not undertaken solely for economic reasons. Most people say that they would continue to work even if it was financially unnecessary for them to do so. One of the most important noneconomic reasons for undertaking work is to obtain social status. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711412728">Fukuyama (1996)</xref> has noted, work is frequently undertaken for the sake of recognition rather than for material enrichment. He calls this the “thymotic” motivation for work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711412728">R. Pahl (1995)</xref> likewise observed that work can be undertaken in a “search for glory” (p. 83). Indeed, material rewards are often valued primarily because they symbolize status rather for strictly utilitarian reasons. Research confirms that workers seek to obtain status rewards and that work is important in maintaining a sense of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1972</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412728">Jans and McMahon (1988)</xref> found that 83% of ATO staff scored high on an item designed to measure the importance of work to their self-esteem. Normative controls involve the provision of symbolic-emotional rewards such as group belonging, status, and meaning. In terms of Collins’s ritual interaction theory, status rewards are the product of deference rituals, whereas group belonging rewards are the product of egalitarian rituals. Those who obtain status rewards from their work exhibit “egoistic” involvement in the sense that their work is a source and expression of their self-esteem. Collins argues that order givers exhibit self-assurance, pride, or arrogance and tend to identify with the ideals of the organization in whose name they exercise authority. They tend to regard the organization and its ideals as extensions of their own egos because they must make a strong commitment to such ideals if they are to represent them in a ritual. They also need to make themselves look impressive and in control when giving orders and obtain ego rewards from doing so. For example, order givers who receive high levels of deference, such as aristocrats and senior managers, tend to exhibit pride, self-confidence, and assertiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711412728">Jackall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711412728">Kautsky, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399711412728">Powis, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Collins argues that in contrast to order givers, order takers tend not to identify with their role and with their organization’s ideals because this is the sphere in which they suffer ego loss. As a result, order takers conform externally but are privately alienated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref> similarly maintained that alienative involvement is generated by blocked mobility and the inability of workers to identify with management. Survey data show that hierarchical location and organizational commitment among APS staff strongly correlate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711412728">Department of Finance [DOF], 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711412728">Department of Industry, Technology, and Commerce [DITAC], 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711412728">1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412728">Jans &amp; McMahon, 1988</xref>). Senior APS officers tend to exhibit pride, self-confidence, and assertiveness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711412728">Caiden (1990)</xref> identified condescension and arrogance as distinctive traits of senior officials in Australia. Self-confidence verging on arrogance is also a characteristic of senior French and British civil servants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095399711412728">Wilks, 1990</xref>). The same is also true of CEOs in the private sector. As De Sola Pool observes, “The head of a firm is more often than not a man of extraordinary aggression. In conformity with other stereotypes he is often cocky, self-confident, loud, domineering, sometimes even a tyrannical ego-maniac” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711412728">Davies, 1980</xref>, p. 91).</p>
<p>In addition to order giving, Collins identifies preselection and socialization, promotion possibilities, and ritual participation in the group as forms of normative control. Promotion constitutes the primary form of normative control within public sector organizations. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA (1976)</xref> found that promotion was rated second only to salary among 15 reasons for remaining in the public service. Other research confirms the centrality of promotion as a reward for white-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711412728">McNally, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711412728">J. M. Pahl &amp; Pahl, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399711412728">Prandy, Stewart &amp; Blackburn, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins (1988)</xref> maintained that the underlying mechanism is a process of anticipatory socialization in which the expectation of becoming an order giver leads people to internalize the order givers’ culture. Furthermore, employees need to demonstrate their commitment to be promoted. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412728">Kanter (1977)</xref> observed, organizations demand of managers a diffuse and unbounded loyalty. Survey data show that ATO staff who perceive good career prospects are much more likely to exhibit high organizational commitment (Submission No. 29 to JCPA, 1992). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al. (1989)</xref> found that the most important determinants of organizational commitment among ATO staff were job level and career satisfaction, the latter of which included perceived career opportunities.</p>
<p>Normative motivations are strongest among senior staff. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA (1976)</xref> found that salary and promotion opportunities were comparatively more important incentives for junior officers than they were for senior officers. For the latter by contrast the “importance of the work” was a more important incentive. High-ranking organizational members embrace normative ideals because they formulate the organization’s policies and represent it in public. Consequently, they can identify their personal goals with those of the organization in a way that junior employees who have no hand in goal setting find difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412728">MAB-MIAC (1992)</xref> survey data show, for example, that SES officers have a sanguine view of the efficacy of the public service reforms over which they preside, whereas the lower ranks are far more skeptical. These data confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins’s (1988)</xref> contention that order giving is a ritual in which order givers become committed to official ideals but in which order takers conform externally but are privately alienated.</p>
<p>Collins maintains that blocked mobility generates a similar response to order taking. This response is identified in the literature on careers as “ritualism” or one in which workers do the bare minimum necessary to retain their jobs and simply “go through the motions” without enthusiasm or genuine commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412728">Kanter (1977)</xref> labeled this response “nonresponsibility” because people withdrew from responsibility, did only what they were told, and took no initiatives. Many middle-ranking public servants have reached a career plateau (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412728">Jans &amp; McMahon, 1988</xref>) and accordingly display ritualism. One informant labeled this “the terminal class 8 [ASO 6] syndrome.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al. (1989)</xref> found that self-reported work effort and performance among ATO staff was primarily determined by organizational commitment, which was in turn determined by career satisfaction and job level. Surveys show that APS staff who have spent 10 years or more at the same level are more skeptical about public service reforms than other staff. They are also the least likely of all demographic categories to believe that treatment of individuals is fair, that sufficient effort is made to get the opinions and thinking of workers, that staff are recognized for doing a good job, and that they are encouraged to come up with new and better ways of doing things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412728">MAB-MIAC, 1992</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0095399711412728">
<title>Social Acceptance and Respect: The Solidaristic Orientation</title>
<p>The solidaristic orientation arises when individuals undertake work to obtain the rewards of social acceptance and respect. Respect differs from status inasmuch as it is a product of egalitarian rituals involving mutual recognition rather than of one-sided deference relationships. For example, it is possible for individuals who are low in social status to obtain the respect of their peers and to thereby maintain a sense of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399711412728">Saunders, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir (1991)</xref> noted that we may distinguish a sense of self-esteem based on competence, power, or achievement from a sense of self-worth grounded in norms or values concerning conduct. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399711412728">Stevens and Price (1996)</xref> have noted, human behavior manifests two great archetypal systems: that concerned with attachment and affiliation and that concerned with rank and status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711412728">Blau (1964)</xref> likewise distinguished approval/friendship/group belonging from esteem and compliance as types of rewards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711412728">Kemper and Collins (1990)</xref> similarly distinguish power relationships involving dominance and involuntary compliance from status relationships involving willing deference, acceptance, and liking. Social acceptance and respect enables people to maintain a sense of self-esteem. Research shows that social rewards are a major source of work motivation. For example, an American survey found that 31% of those who maintained that they would continue working even if it was financially unnecessary for them to do so, reported that this was because of their relationships with people at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1972</xref>). A survey of APS graduate recruits found that supervision and interpersonal relationships rated highest out of 14 potential sources of job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399711412728">Smith, 1978</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA (1976)</xref> likewise found that 61% of respondents saw “the people you work with” as being either a very or somewhat important reason for remaining in the public service.</p>
<p>The social rewards obtained in the workplace may be incidental to work or form part of a deliberate strategy of control used by employers. Collins maintains that “ritual participation in the group” is a form of normative control within organizations. For example, APS management has sought to generate normative commitment among staff by fostering social events such as staff lunches, morning and afternoon tea breaks, barbecues, sporting contests, and corporate “team-building” exercises. One department reports that the social club (and its associated activities such as happy hours, theatre nights, quiz nights, and sporting events) “aims to build esprit de corps within the department” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711412728">DITAC, 1992</xref>, p. 110). Such rituals may fail to serve their intended purpose though if workers treat them simply as opportunities to avoid work. As Collins observes, the ideals that are upheld by participants in such rituals can be either those of the informal, alienated, or acquisitive group of lower members or those of organizational controllers. As he notes, group ritual is a two-edged sword for this reason because it can be used either for or against the interests of controllers. Although rituals involving subordinates and superiors are deferential rather than egalitarian, they can generate normative commitment in those instances where superiors are paternalistic. Such solicitude provides ego rewards for subordinates who may repay this with grateful loyalty. Paternalistic employment practices may, for example, underlie the high level of organizational commitment displayed by Japanese workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref> maintained that solidaristic workers may identify with either the local work group or with their employer. Normative sentiments in the former instance are directed against the employer. They argue that in both instances ego-involvement in work is strong and that social relationships at work constitute the primary reward. These propositions are consistent with Collins’s argument that group ritual is a two-edged sword and that ritual rewards, of which group belonging is an instance, engage a deeper level of the self than utilitarian rewards and are more potentially more powerful.</p>
<p>Local work groups can facilitate organizational control if they enforce standards of work output set by the group to ensure that all members carry an equal share of the workload. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711412728">Littler and Salaman (1984)</xref> have observed that workers may impose management controls by engaging in self-policing. In this situation, those who meet group output standards are rewarded with social acceptance and respect. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412728">Jans and McMahon (1988)</xref> found that tax officers “work hard to keep the respect of others.” One informant likewise reported that “You sort of felt . . . you did work as a team, and . . . you didn’t want to let the team down. Well I didn’t, I personally didn’t feel like I wanted to let the team down.” Senior officers are expected to conform to professional norms of conduct. One informant observed that there was “pressure to perform” placed on senior officers because “if you slacked off you would get a bad name.” For example, one SES officer maintains that “the foremost thing that drives me . . . [is] the professional respect of peers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711412728">Campbell &amp; Halligan, 1992</xref>, p. 217). The presence of such social norms can be explained in Durkheimian terms as the product of group solidarity. Unpublished data from DPIE, for example, show that staff are much more willing to exert work effort on behalf of their local work group than they are on behalf of the department as a whole.</p>
<p>Collins argues that to achieve such internalized control, organizations need to minimize the conflict that is generated by the order-giving hierarchy. This can be accomplished through considerate styles of supervision and the cultivation of personal ties between supervisors and workers, as the “human relations” school recognized. Unpublished survey data from one APS department show that staff have a great deal of trust and confidence in their immediate supervisor but much less in top management. We can explain this in terms of the fact that relationships with immediate supervisors are generally closer than those with top management. Greater social intimacy and the ego rewards that this provides generate normative compliance among subordinates. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399711412728">TFMI (1992)</xref> reported that “In discussions with staff at all levels and from a variety of agencies one topic surfaced repeatedly as the critical ingredient to both motivation of staff performance and the achievement of organizational goals—effective leadership” (p. 457). As a tax officer observes “It’s not the work you do that is most important but the people you work with and for. I will do anything for someone who knows how to treat you fairly” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al., 1989</xref>, p. 38).</p>
<p>The fact that public servants are contractually obliged to work is another source of the solidaristic orientation and normative commitment. Although the contract of employment is ostensibly a utilitarian exchange, there also exists an “implicit contract,” which is based on the element of noncontractual solidarity noted by Durkheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399711412728">Watson, 1995</xref>). Collins locates the origin of the sense of obligation found in the case of gift exchanges in the ritual solidarity that is engendered by interactions between the parties. Such normative motivations are strongest among the senior ranks, both because they give orders and also because they enjoy more egalitarian relationships with their supervisors than do the lower ranks. Survey data show that SES officers enjoy better social relationships with their superiors than the lower ranks do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711412728">DITAC, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711412728">DOF, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399711412728">TFMI, 1992</xref>). At senior levels, the implicit contract involves high trust. For example, senior officers are not required to fill out attendance records, unlike the lower ranks. Such forms of normatively based self-control can be elicited if workers are given a high degree of autonomy and participate in egalitarian groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711412728">Barker (1993)</xref> argued that self-managing teams engage in “concertive control” inasmuch as workers comply to maintain the respect of team members. Such teams enjoy a high level of autonomy and internalize management values. The use of such egalitarian rituals ameliorates the conflict that is generated by the order-giving hierarchy and thereby generates more uniform sentiments.</p>

<title>Meaning: The Vocational Orientation</title>
<p>In addition to status and group belonging, work provides people with a sense of “meaning” or purpose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399711412728">Shamir (1991)</xref> maintained that most theories of work motivation omit this aspect of human behavior, notwithstanding evidence that one of the major functions of work is to connect individuals to broader social purposes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711412728">Frankl (1967)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711412728">Csikszentmihalyi (1991)</xref> argued that through work, leisure activities, social relationships, and the pursuit of ideals, people can confer a sense of meaning on their lives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711412728">Maslow (1943)</xref> identified a need for meaning as an element of self-actualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711412728">Fitzgerald, 1977b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins (1988)</xref> argued that ritual encounters provide individuals with intense and meaningful experiences that are a source of emotional energy. They also sanctify group symbols and create moral norms. These symbols and the ideals that they embody can motivate people to work by providing them with a sense of meaning. In such instances, we encounter the vocational orientation. People here undertake work out of a sense of moral commitment to an ideal rather than to obtain material, status, or social rewards. Work ordinarily provides us with a sense of purpose because it links us to other people and is undertaken to accomplish a task or objective. Where work is performed for idealistic reasons, this feeling is intensified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711412728">Reed (1997)</xref>, for example, argued that we may identify a “vocational orientation” where work is undertaken in pursuit of transcendent professional, religious, social, and intellectual ideals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711412728">Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, and Tipton (1985)</xref> have argued, people can have three distinct relations to their work, namely, jobs, careers, and callings. The first and second of these correspond to the instrumental and bureaucratic orientations, respectively. The third corresponds to Reed’s vocational orientation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0095399711412728">Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, and Schwartz (1997)</xref> found that people displayed these three orientations in roughly equal numbers and that they were independent of each other.</p>
<p>A sense of vocation can be found among the members of professional, political, and public service organizations. For example, professionals such medical doctors, scientists, and academics idealize their job as a “calling,” a contribution to some larger goal rather than a way of making a living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412728">Collins, 1988</xref>). The same is also true of high-ranking officials. For example, surveys of senior APS officers have detected evidence of a service ethic or sense of vocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399711412728">Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, 1990</xref>). A vocational orientation is most likely to emerge in what Etzioni calls “normative organizations” such as those of a medical, religious, educational, scientific, and political nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711412728">Mintzberg (1979)</xref> likewise argued that “missionary organizations” have a shared ideology, which their members acquire through indoctrination. APS staff who work in ideologically driven policy reform areas, for example, often exhibit such a missionary outlook. The pursuit of career advancement can also yield a vocational orientation inasmuch as it confers a sense of direction and purpose on one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711412728">Goffman, 1952</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711412728">Gellner (1992)</xref> argued that the idea of progress is a secular theodicy deriving from the bourgeois experience of career. He notes that the “meaning of a bourgeois life” is to be found in career advancement. Where workers obtain a sense of meaning from their work, they exhibit “idealistic” involvement. In this instance, work is regarded as a moral obligation and is undertaken in pursuit of transcendent goals. An example of this is the Puritan notion of work as a “calling” in which work is valued as a means to spiritual salvation. Careers can likewise confer on an otherwise mundane job a sense of meaning insofar as career progression becomes the dominant purpose of one’s life. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711412728">Dahrendorf (1959)</xref> maintained that the “supreme social reality” for bureaucrats is their career. The “bureaucratic orientation” identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref> is also one in which the career forms peoples’ central life interest. The pursuit of career advancement may also become a moral obligation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711412728">Jackall (1988)</xref> observed, strong moral imperatives for success exist among managers.</p>
<p>Organizational careers provide not only the symbolic emotional rewards of status and meaning but also utilitarian rewards. They therefore yield a mixture of calculative and normative involvement. For example, the bureaucratic orientation identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412728">Goldthorpe et al. (1968)</xref> comprised a mixture of vocational, thymotic, and calculative orientations. However, the requirement for individuals to compete for promotion can undermine the emotion of ritual solidarity that group belonging rewards generate. As Collins notes, the predominant form of control in the private sector is not participation in egalitarian rituals but individualistic incentives such as offering promotion opportunities. His conclusion that some normative atmosphere emerges among groups of managers but is simultaneously undermined by the competition among them is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711412728">Jackall’s (1988)</xref> ethnographic study of corporate managers. The system of competitive promotion that is found in Western corporations may be contrasted with the system of lifetime employment that is found in Japan. Here, payment is linked not to individual efforts but to group performance and seniority and symbolic rewards are as important as monetary ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711412728">Clegg, 1992</xref>). This minimizes competition among managers. The higher level of organizational commitment that is exhibited by Japanese workers when compared with those in Western countries may be explained in terms of the fact that such rituals generate sentiments of group solidarity rather than a mood of personal ambition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711412728">Ouchi, 1981</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0095399711412728">
<title>Intrinsic Rewards: The Expressive Orientation</title>
<p>A different orientation to work arises where workers perform work to obtain intrinsic rewards such as using skills, a sense of accomplishment, and mental stimulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399711412728">Reed (1997)</xref> argued that an “expressive orientation” arises where work provides an opportunity for intrinsically rewarding activity such as using skills. Survey research shows that “interesting work” is second in importance to pay and security as a source of work motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0095399711412728">Wilpert, 1997</xref>). Even where work yields few intrinsic rewards, it, nonetheless, enables individuals to avoid the boredom that stems from inactivity. For example, the most common reasons cited by respondents who maintained that they would go on working even if it was financially unnecessary for them to do so were “to avoid boredom,” “would be upset if didn’t work,” and “would go crazy if no work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>, p. 42, 33). Intrinsic rewards differ from utilitarian rewards inasmuch as they are yielded by the work itself rather than by external rewards. They also differ from ritual rewards inasmuch as they are obtained from performing a task rather than from social interaction. Intrinsic rewards, therefore, form a third category of rewards alongside ritual and utilitarian rewards. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711412728">Davison (1977)</xref> has noted, social relationships, creative activity, and sensory pleasure are the three primary sources of happiness. Unlike utilitarian rewards, but in common with ritual rewards, intrinsic rewards engage the deeper levels of the self. For example, the level of human happiness bears little relationship to the level of wealth and income once we get above subsistence level but a great deal to both the quality of social relationships and the quality of work and leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399711412728">Storr (1989)</xref> maintained that leisure interests and creative pursuits can be as effective as social relationships in sustaining human happiness and in providing people with a sense of meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711412728">Marx (1964)</xref> also maintained that humans needed to engage in self-expression by means of creative activity if they were to realize their “species being.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412728">Inglehart and Welzel (2005)</xref> argued that human beings have an inherent need to express themselves and that this aspiration is universal. Their cross-national survey data, for example, show that people who are driven by intrinsic motivations are happier than those who are driven by extrinsic motivations and that individual autonomy is related to feelings of well-being.</p>
<p>Workers who obtain intrinsic rewards exhibit “intrinsic involvement” or a concern with the requirements of the task itself rather than with obtaining external rewards or fulfilling moral obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1987</xref>). Intrinsic involvement therefore differs from alienated, calculative, and moral involvement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711412728">Deci and Ryan (1980)</xref> discovered that intrinsic motivation is reduced by external rewards and that it is greater for a task that is freely chosen. The inability of most bureaucratic employees to select their work tasks is reflected in a predominance of extrinsic and normative motivations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412728">Kanter (1977)</xref> found that interest in job content was the least frequent reason given by managers for performing extra work, with workload and commitment to the company being the most frequent. Many tasks in the APS, especially at junior levels, provide few intrinsic rewards and accordingly fail to generate intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>As we ascend the organizational hierarchy, the degree of choice that individuals have over the content of their work increases because they are more involved in goal setting and have a greater capacity to delegate unwanted tasks. For example, many APS department heads will pursue “pet projects” or those policy issues in which they have a personal interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412728">Kanter (1977)</xref> likewise reported that a top manager was given a private laboratory or “playroom” in which he could pursue his interests. Unlike the other kinds of motivation, intrinsic motivation does not correspond to a specific method of organizational control because it is elicited primarily by work tasks rather than by a control method. It tends to arise where people perform tasks that enable them to make full use of their skills and where they have the capacity to choose their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711412728">Csikszentmihalyi, 1991</xref>). Accordingly, we find that professionals and managers exhibit stronger intrinsic work motivations than do lower white-collar workers and blue-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711412728">Kalmijn &amp; Kraaykamp, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have argued that work motivation has both psychological and social foundations. Psychological needs determine the types of rewards that people will seek to obtain from their work, whereas social factors determine the relative importance of these rewards. Rewards sought from work may be divided into three broad categories: ritual, utilitarian, and intrinsic. Ritual or “symbolic-emotional” rewards can be further subdivided into those of status, social acceptance, and meaning. Corresponding to these three subcategories of rewards are three types of involvement, namely, egoistic, altruistic, and idealistic. Coercion, order taking, and blocked mobility generate alienative involvement because they entail ego loss for subordinates. This leads them to salve injuries to their sense of self-worth through resistance, trying to avoid the coercive situation and dull, minimal compliance. Material rewards such as payment and promotion yield instrumental involvement. This involves focusing attention on the behavior that is needed to obtain the rewards rather than on the requirements of the work itself. The use of ritual or symbolic-emotional” rewards such as status, social acceptance, and meaning yields voluntary, self-motivated compliance based on a sense of moral obligation rather than the dull, minimal compliance that is elicited by coercion or the narrow, highly specific compliance that is elicited by material rewards. Order giving, promotion opportunities, and egalitarian rituals are the control methods that organizations use to elicit normative compliance. The first two of these methods can generate either moral commitment or alienation, depending on whether one gives or takes orders or experiences upward or blocked mobility. Both order giving and promotion provide individualistic status rewards and generate egoistic involvement. By contrast, egalitarian rituals produce altruistic involvement because they generate more uniform sentiments among participants than deference rituals do. Moral commitment under such conditions tends to be to the ideals of the local work group rather than to those of hierarchical superiors. Organizations must therefore ameliorate the ego loss that is sustained by order takers if they are to obtain their commitment. A vocational orientation arises when people undertake work in pursuit of an ideal. The reward that is obtained under such conditions is a sense of meaning. An expressive orientation arises when workers seek intrinsic rewards. Under such conditions, workers are more concerned with the requirements of the task itself than they are with obtaining extrinsic rewards or with fulfilling externally imposed moral obligations.</p>
<p>Workers usually exhibit a mixture of these motivations because they would ideally like to obtain a variety of rewards from their work and because organizations use a mixture of control techniques. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA (1976)</xref> found that salary, job security, the interest of the work, having too much to lose by moving outside, promotion and the possibility of a career, and the people at work were all seen as being very or somewhat important reasons for remaining in the public service by a majority of respondents. Other survey data show that workers would like to obtain a variety of rewards from work and that they accord all of them a high value. This fact, together with the fact that workers regret the absence of such rewards when they are not available (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412728">Fox, 1971</xref>), suggests that work motivations have a psychological as well as a social basis. Workers are unlikely to exhibit all motivations in equal strength though because their social environment usually restricts their ability to obtain the full range and extent of rewards.</p>
<p>Collins’s theory predicts that the relative strength of these motivations will vary according to the extent of coercion and, hence, of ego loss that people undergo, the availability of material rewards, and the extent of order giving and promotion possibilities. This is indeed the case. Those APS staff members who enjoy career opportunities (such as recent recruits and the junior ranks) are more likely to value career advancement than are those who face blocked mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412728">Jans &amp; McMahon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>). The level of organizational commitment also varies according to the extent of order giving and promotion possibilities, as Collins’s theory predicts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al. (1989)</xref> found that among ATO staff, the most important determinants of organizational commitment were job level and career satisfaction (the latter of which includes perceived career opportunities). Organizations seek to gain the compliance of workers through the use of rewards and penalties. Workers tend to exhibit the corresponding motivations because they find that only certain rewards can be obtained, they tend to self-select for jobs, and organizations select workers who have the appropriate motivations. The fact that the members of different social classes perform different kinds of work and are subject to different control techniques means that they possess different orientations to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711412728">Argyle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412728">Fox, 1971</xref>). Working-class people typically exhibit stronger defensive, instrumental, and solidaristic orientations than middle-class people because they are subject to a greater level of economic compulsion, obtain fewer intrinsic rewards from their jobs, and prefer egalitarian encounters with their workmates rather than deferential encounters with their superiors. Middle-class people exhibit stronger thymotic, vocational, and expressive orientations because they are more likely to have careers, to give orders to others, and to perform jobs that provide a sense of meaning, status rewards, and intrinsic rewards. The motivations of individuals are then shaped not only by work factors such as job characteristics, organizational incentives, and the work environment but also by nonwork factors such as their cultural background, class, age, generation, gender and education and by individual characteristics such as their abilities and competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711412728">Perry, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests that there are few differences in the motivations of public and private sector employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711412728">Wright, 2001</xref>). This is not surprising given that employees in both cases have the same human needs, possess similar social characteristics, and work in organizations that rely primarily on payment and promotion as control methods. Differences in motivation are linked more with hierarchical location than they are with sectoral location. Survey data show that lower and higher ranking jobs in the APS vary considerably in terms of the opportunities that they provide for obtaining autonomy, a sense of purpose, and intrinsic, status, and social rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412728">Jans et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>). The higher ranks accordingly exhibit stronger expressive and vocational orientations, whereas the lower ranks exhibit stronger instrumental and defensive orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399711412728">RCAGA, 1976</xref>). The key work-related factors that shape work motivations then are hierarchical level, control methods, and work tasks. This is the case because it is these factors that determine the kinds of rewards that individuals can obtain from their work. The public and private sectors do not differ much in respect of these factors and accordingly we encounter few differences in the work motivations of their employees.</p>
<p>Given that the public sector has the ideal of public service as its goal, one might expect that it would be conducive to the emergence of a vocational orientation. However, the environment of public sector work tends to discourage such motivations. Task fragmentation, the stressful demands placed on street-level bureaucrats, the reliance on monetary rewards and promotion to motivate staff, and the ego loss that is entailed by taking orders and confronting blocked mobility tend to weaken idealistic motivations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399711412728">Wright (2001)</xref> observed, the very structure of public organizations hinders the realization of altruistic or higher order needs. Such motivations are present among higher level staff who have a greater hand in goal setting and who, by virtue of their role as order givers and their ability to obtain a strategic overview of the organization, can more easily discern its goals and identify personally with them. Among lower ranking staff, we encounter a preponderance of instrumental, defensive, and solidaristic orientations centered on the local work group. By contrast, higher ranking staff exhibit stronger thymotic, vocational, and expressive orientations. We may conclude that variations in motivation are associated more with hierarchical location within the organization, organizational control methods, and occupation (and with the level of national economic development, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412728">Inglehart &amp; Welzel, 2005</xref>) than they are with sectoral location because it is these factors that determine the availability of various rewards and accordingly the types of motivations that workers will tend to acquire.</p>
