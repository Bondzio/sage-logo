<title>Compassionate Citizenship via Music</title>
<p>David J. Elliott’s [September 2012 <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic> (<italic>MEJ</italic>)] article on music education’s role in social justice (or vice versa) affected my thinking on many issues within the classroom. However, when I revisited the article recently, I found that it had new meaning in light of recent events.</p>
<p>I was deeply moved by the acts of violence in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, and I am sure many readers had similar reactions. After watching these parents, students, and teachers grieve and try to cope with the shattered sense of reality, I began to ask myself: What can I do as a music teacher to make things better? How can I work to create a greater sense of community in my own classroom? I turned to Elliott’s article and gained a new perspective on the meaning of artistic citizenship.</p>
<p>Elliott’s position builds on a long tradition of sociological perspectives, such as in the works of Paulo Friere, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault. The beliefs of these writers show that they regard individuals such as teachers—and institutions such as schools—as catalysts for societal change. Music education began addressing social justice in the more recent past, but the field has often struggled with maintaining music as the focus while still working for change. The December 1987 <italic>MEJ</italic> featured the words of Mary Futrell as she stated that music was “emotion rendered articulate” (p. 52) and stressed that music was an essential part of community building through shared emotional experience. Twenty-five years after Futrell wrote these words, we are still dealing with the same issues. Elliott’s idea of artistic citizenship provides a wonderful launching point to begin the discussion of how our music-making could bring about a cultural shift.</p>
<p>I think that one of the greatest challenges to overcome on this issue is to be cognizant of how our daily interactions affect our students. The small decisions that we make each day about our choices of words, repertoire, and classroom environment can have profound effect on our students. It is challenging to be constantly mindful of making these interactions align with our ultimate goals for our students. In other words, we must work to make sure that the citizenship that we want our students to achieve is put into practice in our classrooms daily.</p>
<p>It seems as though many news stories lately have dealt with teens or young adults who have felt isolated from society—so much so as to be driven to immoral and unethical decisions. Elliott addresses many of those emotions in this article, dealing with issues of race relations and sexual orientation. Research has shown us that an understanding of others’ differences leads to greater acceptance of those differences. Perhaps it is time to put that research into action and to help students feel accepted as a part of the music classroom community.</p>
<p>So what can I do for my students today? After reexamining Elliott’s writing, there is much that I can do. I can teach my students that they are accepted and valued for who they are. I can create an environment in my classroom where they aren’t afraid to be themselves. I can help them learn to respect the differences of others. But most of all, I can give them an experience where they feel that they are contributing toward a greater good—that their membership in my chorus is vital to the success of the group as a whole. And I can make sure that at the heart of all of this is what brought us together in the first place—our mutual love of music.</p>

<title>Great Teachers <italic>Don’t</italic> Do It All!</title>
<p>This is in response to a letter to the editor by John A. Venesile in the December 2012 issue of <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic> that encouraged music teachers to “Prepare to Handle Multiple Roles.”</p>
<p>While I have found the preparation for being a music teacher does need to be unified—that is, we either get certified in vocal music alone or vocal music and band both—I do not feel that any teacher should be asked to teach all genres in order to have a place in the job market. I believe by focusing on our area of expertise—general music, voice, band, orchestra, drama, etc.—we are better qualified to teach that subject than by knowing a little of it all but not being the highest-level professional in every area.</p>
<p>I will use the example of a physical education teacher or coach to explain my position. Do we ask a teacher to coach track, wrestling, basketball, tennis, swimming, football, and so forth? No—even in the smallest schools there are separate coaches to cover the various athletic activities, whether these individuals are hired as coaches or are teachers who coach the sport on the side. Not every person is knowledgeable or best qualified to coach all the sports a school offers, and he or she doesn’t have to. Why, then, is a music teacher expected to direct the choir, conduct the band/orchestra, lead the musical, not to mention teach general music and any other miscellaneous classes such as piano, guitar, jazz, and madrigals? I agree doing it all saves the school money, but does it give the students the best possible teacher for covering those genres?</p>
<p>It is criminal, in my opinion, to ask music teachers to be qualified to do everything rather than focusing our training on the area in which we are the most proficient. Doctors receive general training, but in the end patients choose specialists to cover certain medical issues, not a general practitioner for all medical symptoms. And aren’t we glad there are doctors who focus on their specific areas of expertise?</p>
<p>I believe it is asking too much to think that music teachers must know a little bit of all areas of music just to get a job. Don’t our students deserve the best specialist to teach them choir/jazz/orchestra/band/musicals? Why is getting a music teaching job only about saving the school money rather than about giving our best in our area of expertise?</p>
<p>Also in the December 2012 <italic>MEJ</italic>, music education philosopher Bennett Reimer makes this point in “Another Perspective: Struggling toward Wholeness in Music Education,” where he says on page 28, “Each music specialization is challenging and arduous in its own ways, needful of long absorption in its intricacies if it is to become integrated in thinking and acting, enabling the teaching of it to be as well-grounded as it must be.” Our students deserve teachers who have invested the time and effort in an area of specialty so each subject can be taught with the knowledge and passion it deserves.</p>

<title><italic>MEJ</italic> Academic Editor Patrick K. Freer Responds:</title>
<p>The idea that music educators can do it all (and then some!) has indeed burdened many teachers, especially in smaller public and private schools. The point of the original author, however, was to encourage future music education professionals to make themselves as attractive as possible to future employers by offering a wide variety of marketable skills. In essence, the author’s intent was not to promote monetary savings, but to make new teachers more readily employable. In the end, most music educators work toward some type of specialization and eventually earn a reputation for excellence in a relatively focused area like ensemble performance, general music instruction, or staged productions. Following specialized preparation at the collegiate level, continued professional development and classroom experience may help teachers to refine their capacities and decide their area of focus.</p>
<p>Broad-spectrum training is already a part of many music education degrees, and many job-seekers will already have followed the author’s advice. Your point, however, is well taken. To become exceptional at a teaching area, educators need to invest substantial amounts of time and not feel themselves pulled in so many directions that they don’t have the energy to hone their expertise in the area or areas to which they feel called.</p>
