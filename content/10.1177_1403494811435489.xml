<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Definitions of medication errors vary widely in the literature, and prevalence from 2–75% in part because of this lack of consensus. Thus, clarification of the concept is urgently needed. The objective was to develop a clear-cut definition of medication errors and specify relevant error types in the medication process. <italic>Methods</italic>: Based on existing taxonomy and through a modified Delphi-process consensus of definition and error types were reached among Danish experts appointed by 13 healthcare organisations and the project group. The experts prioritised five definitions of medication errors and score the relevance of 76 error types. Based on explicit criteria, the project group settled non-consensus cases. <italic>Results</italic>: The panel consisted of 12 physicians, seven pharmacists, and six nurses. Consensus was reached for the definition “An error in the stages of the medication process – ordering, dispensing, administering and monitoring the effect – causing harm or implying a risk of harming the patient”. Moreover, consensus for 60 of 76 error types was achieved. Applied to a historic dataset the definition reduced the number of medication errors from 34% to 7%. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Experts deemed a definition using harm or risk of harm as cut-off point as the most appropriate in Danish hospital settings. In addition, they agreed on a list of 60 error types covering the medication process. Interestingly, a substantial lower occurrence of medication errors was found when applied to historic data. The definition is in accordance with international taxonomy, thus is assumed to be applicable to modern healthcare settings abroad.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Medication errors constitute a serious problem in hospitals around the world resulting in harm and death in up to six per 100 admissions to hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435489">7</xref>]. In addition, they are associated with enormous extra costs due to prolonged in-hospital stay and additional treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435489">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435489">10</xref>]. However, the vast majority of medication errors results in minimal or no consequences, which questions the rationale and benefit of current terminology. Furthermore, a multiplicity of terms has been used to describe circumstances that lead to wrong or omitted medication such as errors, medication errors, adverse drug events, and drug-related problems. Although striving to describe the same processes, the clinical and functional meaning of these terms varies. For clarification, this paper considers an error to be preventable and defines it in accordance to human error theories as “a planned action that failed to achieve their desired consequences” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435489">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The occurrence of medication errors essentially depends on the definitions, criteria used for classification and methods of detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435489">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435489">14</xref>]. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is, currently, no agreement on a clear-cut definition to measure the occurrence of medication errors, which contributes to poor and unreliable comparison of findings across studies, clinical settings, and countries. Studies of medication errors in hospital settings have revealed prevalence from 2–75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435489">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435489">18</xref>]. In addition, one to 38 error types have been included to detect medication errors indicating a worldwide lack of clarity in defining and measuring medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435489">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435489">19</xref>]. This supports findings and conclusions in a previous study of medication safety terms, in which the need for uniform and operational medication error terms based on an interdisciplinary approach was emphasised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435489">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In the terminology of adverse drug event (ADE) defined as “an injury resulting from the use of a drug” – all preventable and potential ADEs are considered as medication errors due to the nature of these events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435489">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435489">21</xref>]. Whereas an ADE is determined by harm, the general comprehension of a medication error is an avoidable event in the medication process that may or may not result in harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435489">21</xref>]. Thus, with regard to the current terminology of medication errors only few attempts to distinguish between harmless and harmful medication errors have been made, so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435489">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435489">23</xref>]. Moreover, no overall agreement concerning the clinical range of definitions has been achieved, i.e. whether harm, potential for harm, and rule violations should be included, which can be illustrated in the following examples of definitions of medication errors:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494811435489" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“An error in the process of ordering, dispensing or administering medication, regardless of whether an injury occurred or whether the potential for injury was present” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435489">2</xref>];</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Any error in the process of ordering, dispensing and administering drug and discharge, which contain rule violations as well as errors” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435489">24</xref>];</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“A failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435489">22</xref>].</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Considering the increased awareness on reducing medication errors, it is important to focus on errors that have a negative clinical impact on patients. New cut-off levels in the taxonomy regarding medication errors based on an interdisciplinary approach are therefore needed in order to identify the crux of medication errors and further to prioritise interventions and strategies. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop an interdisciplinary definition of medication errors that separates minor errors from serious medication errors and, further, to define relevant error types for the main stages in the medication process, namely ordering (decision-making, communication of drug prescriptions), dispensing, and administration and monitoring. The definition is initially developed for use in hospital settings.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Definitions and error types identified in a previous systematic literature review were categorised due to analysis of content. Through several processes, 45 generic definitions were grouped into identical definitions and allied definitions (definition with same functional meaning, but different wording). Categorisation of allied definitions were based on clinical range: i.e. use of limiting or expansive terms such as harm and potential for harm or rule violation and deviation; use of key words to describe medication error e.g. error, event, deviation or failure; and finally, use of errors in general or selected errors such as dose or drug. Eventually, five definitions representing simple as well as complex definitions were derived (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435489">Table I</xref>).</p>

<p>Classification of error types was based on a tree-model structure exploring different levels of error types from root level, i.e. meta-terms such as dispensing errors, to leaf level, i.e. specific error types such as wrong fluid. In total, 282 different expressions of error types distributed at ordering, dispensing, and administering and monitoring medication were identified in the overall review of 203 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435489">18</xref>]. These were individually assessed for similarities in wording and functional meaning, e.g. unauthorised drug was interpreted as unordered drug. In addition, each error type convergence with error types at higher levels was determined, e.g. omission of route is part of ambiguous prescription. This classification resulted in a detailed and exhaustive list of 76 contextual (related to the situation or task) and behavioural (omission, commission, repetition, and insertion) error types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435489">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435489">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435489">26</xref>]. Subsequently, forward and backwards translation of all included definitions and error types were conducted separately by authorised Danish–English translators.</p>

<title>Expert panel</title>
<p>Sixteen Danish healthcare organisations representing authorities, professional organisations, medical scientific organisations, and patient safety organisations, e.g. the Danish Medicines Agency, were asked to appoint one expert to the Delphi process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435489">Table II</xref>). Subsequently, the project group appointed an equal number of experts. In accordance with responsibility in the medication process, half of the experts should be physicians and the other half equally divided between pharmacists and nurses.</p>

<title>Delphi method</title>
<p>A modified Delphi method was used for the consensus processes and access to an electronic Delphi system at Pennsylvania University, USA (HeroDelphi system) was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435489">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435489">28</xref>]. The experts were asked to participate in two voting rounds for definitions and two rounds for error types. Consensus of a definition was a prerequisite for assessing error types due to an anticipated association between the experts’ choice of error types and the definition for medication errors. Experts as well as one investigator (ML) were blinded during all consensus processes with regard to comments and scorings. The clarity and interpretation of error types as well as the user friendliness of the electronic Delphi system was tested by four clinical pharmacologists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435489">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>In the first round the experts had to prioritise five definitions of medication errors ranking from 1–5, of which the three with the highest priority went forth to a second round. The definition with the highest priority was sent to the experts for final agreement and consensus was considered if more than 60% agreed on this definition. After each round the experts received comprehensive written feedback by e-mail consisting of a summarised overview of all the experts’ priorities of the provided definitions; a summary of the comments and any suggestions to clarify or improve the definitions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494811435489">
<title>Error types</title>
<p>The experts assessed the relevance of 76 scenarios of error types: 40 for ordering (19 in decision-making, 21 in communications), 18 for dispensing, and 18 for administering and monitoring medication – on a scale from 1–9 (9=totally agree, 1=totally disagree). Between each round the experts received feedback describing the median and interquartile range for each error type and summary of the comments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435489">
<title>Test of definition</title>
<p>To estimate the clinical impact of the definition, it was applied to a previous study of medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. This study investigated the number of errors related to the medication process in a medical and surgical department in a Danish university hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. In addition, assessed the potential clinical consequences of detected errors in prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, and administration (excluding errors in discharge) using a 4-point scale – potentially non-significant, potentially significant, potentially serious, and potentially fatal, which would enable application of definitions with different cut-off levels. Due to the size of the dataset (67 patients), no harm from the detected errors were observed. In total 1.065 errors were found in 2.467 (43%) opportunities for errors and, when excluding errors in discharge summaries, the amount of errors were 665 errors in 1.942 (34%) opportunities for errors. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. Therefore, the test of the definition developed in the present study was limited to the potential consequences of errors detected in the medication process – excluding discharge summaries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435489">
<title>Statistical methods and criteria</title>
<p>Priority of definitions was described as proportions and error types as median and interquartile range. Consensus for inclusion of error types was considered if the median score and interquartile range was in the range from 7–9; for exclusion, if the median score and interquartile range was in the range from 1–3 and non-consensus if the median score and/or interquartile range were in the range of 4–6. The latter was sent forth to a second round for reassessment. Finally, non-consensus error types were included or excluded by the project group in accordance to predefined criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435489">Table III</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-five experts participated in the Delphi process, 11 appointed by 13 healthcare organisations (two experts each represented two organisations; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435489">Table II</xref>) and 14 by the project group. The panel consisted of 12 physicians, seven pharmacists, and six nurses, and represented managers, consultants, clinical experts, risk managers, and researchers in medication errors. All experts participated in the final round of definitions and the majority participated in the two rounds of assessing error types. However, the number of missing responses increased during the last two rounds to an average of 15 (min/max=13/16) responses per error type.</p>
<sec id="section10-1403494811435489">
<title>Definition</title>
<p>Consensus was reached for the following definition “An error in the stages of the medication process – ordering, dispensing, and administering and monitoring the effect – causing harm or implying a risk of harming the patient”. This definition had the highest priority in both rounds and when sent for final approval more than 80% of participants accepted it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494811435489">
<title>Error types</title>
<p>Consensus was reached for 61/76 (80%) error types. However, the error types “Pro re nata meaning (p.r.n.) without an indication” and “omission of indication for treatment” were subsequently merged to one error type resulting in an index of 60 error types. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494811435489">Figure 1</xref>, consensus was reached for 17/40 (43%) error types in prescribing (decision making and communication) compared to 17/18 (94%) in dispensing, and 15/18 (83%) error types in administration and monitoring. In 11/76 (14%) cases, the experts didn’t reach consensus after the second round and the project group therefore excluded six and included five error types due to predefined criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494811435489">Table IV</xref>).

<title>Comments from experts</title>
<p>During all voting rounds, the experts had the opportunity to write comments. In general these could be divided into clarification of term, explanation of scoring, and suggestions for changes. For example, the word “failure”, which was used in one of the definitions, prompted comments such as imprecise expression, value-laden word, and associated with blame. These comments along with quantitative measures were used to settle non-consensus error types. In addition, they were used to clarify and improve definitions and error types between each round.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1403494811435489">
<title>Test of the definition</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, the occurrence of errors in the historic dataset used for testing the definition was 665/1.942 (34%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. Compared to the list of error types that the experts reached consensus of all error types in the historic dataset were encompassed, thus allowing a direct application of the definition. The definition that the experts agreed on used harm or risk of harm (potential) as the cut-off level to distinguish between errors and medication errors, which corresponded to the categories potential serious and potential fatal in the severity scale used in the historic dataset. Hence, summarising the number of potential serious and potential fatal errors in the dataset lead to an occurrence of medication errors of 144 in 1942 (7%) corresponding to a relative reduction of 79% (from 34% to 7%).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1403494811435489" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first interdisciplinary consensus-based definition of medication errors covering several stages in the medication process as well as defining explicit error types in ordering, dispensing, and administration and monitoring. The experts reached consensus of a definition of medication errors that included harm and potential risk of harm. In addition, an index of 60 error types in the medication process was developed.</p>
<sec id="section15-1403494811435489">
<title>Definition</title>
<p>The present definition raises the bar for what constitutes medication errors considerably in favour of patient outcome. In addition, it breaks with current concept of medication errors by making a clear-cut distinction between errors and medication errors with harm or potential for harm as the critical dimension. As previously stated, an error or medication error is assumed to be preventable. However, not all harmful outcomes related to drug treatment are preventable, e.g. unknown allergy to a drug, which requires maintenance of the term ADE with respect to classification of adverse drug reactions as well as non-preventable adverse drug events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435489">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite use of different terminologies, i.e. error/event and medication/drug, the terms “preventable adverse drug events” and “potential adverse drug events” seem to be the most frequently used terms to distinguish minor medication errors from harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435489">2</xref>]. However, a parallel distinction to the present definition has been used in a UK definition, in which a medication error was defined as “a failure in the treatment process that leads to or has the potential to lead to harm to patients” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435489">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435489">26</xref>]. Moreover, this definition proved to be the most robust, when evaluated against different medication error scenarios, which strengthens the appropriateness of the definition derived from the Delphi process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435489">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides contributing to the clarification of serious medication errors, the present definition is considered to be both operational and efficient in reducing the number of medication errors. The definition that the experts agreed on had the highest priority in each round of the Delphi process and was approved by the vast majority of the experts. Purposely, the experts were provided with definitions that reflected the diversity in current literature, including complex as well as operational definitions, which unintended might have lead to preferences towards operational definitions. For instance, according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435489">Table I</xref>, the first definition was assessed as too narrow and insufficient for the medication process, whereas the last definition was found too wide and imprecise. Interestingly, the experts found the third definition, which has been developed by National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention, to be complex, awkwardly phrased, and non-exhaustive, as the detailed list of included elements seemed to draw attention to what was not included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435489">29</xref>]. Consequently, the selected definition might have been considered as being more operational and adequate for clinical practice.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the present definition is its ability to decrease the number of medication errors. When tested on historic data, the definition resulted in rejection of three out of four medication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. Despite the magnitude of this reduction, the reclassification was considered to be correct, as medication errors in the present definition ultimately correspond to preventable ADEs and potential ADEs. A similar reduction can be found when applying present definition to a US study in which 530 medication errors in 10,070 orders (5%) were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>]. In this study five medication errors were originally assessed as preventable ADE and 35 as potential ADE, which would lead to an approximate frequency of medication errors at 0.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435489">1</xref>]. However, these findings have to be confirmed in prospective studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1403494811435489">
<title>Error types</title>
<p>The experts in the Delphi panel found the majority of the stated error types relevant for the definition. Based on current international terminology these error types should be perceived as an exclusive and exhaustive index of possible error types to be considered in future studies. Previously, it has been suggested that errors originate from a few psychological mechanisms and, therefore, should be explained by psychological theory, i.e. mistakes (errors in planning an action) and skill-based errors (errors in executing correctly planned actions), rather than by describing terms as used in contextual and modal classification systems, which is relevant for changing cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435489">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435489">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435489">26</xref>]. However, this approach requires an additional investigation of the involved persons’ intentions and actions in order to make a correct classification. It, therefore, seems more reliable and operational to use describing error types in epidemiological studies of medication errors.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the frequency of medication errors is associated with the applied definition as well as included error types. Including a relative large number of error types in the present definition might, therefore, seem contradictory to the aim of the study. However, factors like morbidity and the toxicity of involved drugs have to be considered in order to determine whether an error constitutes a medication error, which might restrict such effects. To illustrate, a study in a paediatric setting using five different types of dosing errors revealed a frequency of 5.7%, of which a fifth was assessed as potential harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435489">30</xref>]. In comparison another study covering all stages in the medication process and which included more than 20 different error types found an overall frequency of 43%, of which 20% were assessed as potential harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435489">5</xref>]. Despite considerable differences in number of included error types, the percentage of potential harmful outcome was equivalent in these two studies suggesting that the present definition is less sensitive to number of error types included. Moreover, although some error types are associated with an increased likelihood of harming patients, such as dosing errors, many types of errors can result in medication errors depending on the specific situation; thus, supporting the relevance of a comprehensive list of error types.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1403494811435489">
<title>Methodological issues</title>
<p>The strength of the present definition is the interdisciplinary approach as well as the experts’ qualifications and interest in medication errors, which might reduce the risk of indiscriminate answers compared to a non-expert panel. Moreover, the blinding of the investigator (ML) during the whole process limited the risk of making preferences and interpretations in line with leading experts’ opinions. Despite some minor limitations, it can be assumed that using an anonymous consensus process like the Delphi method is more likely to reflect true uninfluenced opinions, compared to face-to-face methods, which implies a risk of reflecting the leading expert’s opinion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435489">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Consensus of the present definition was achieved among clinical and scientific experts in Denmark, which might diminish its generalisability. However, the included definitions and error types were based on a profound review of international taxonomy and a thorough translation by professionals in medical English. It can therefore be assumed that the applicability of the present definition goes beyond healthcare systems in Denmark.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An interdisciplinary expert panel appointed by influential scientific and healthcare organisations in Denmark reached consensus of a definition of medication errors that distinguish errors from medication errors with harm or risk of harm as the crucial cut-of point. Moreover, a comprehensive index of 60 error types covering the main stages in the medication process was provided. Based on existing taxonomy, the implication of this definition is a direct measure of harmful and potential harmful medication errors that are less sensitive to the number of included error types. In addition, the present definition leads to a substantial reduction of medication errors when applied to historical data. In future, studies validating the clinical range of the present definition as well as interventions targeting medication errors in accordance to present definition should be launched.</p>
