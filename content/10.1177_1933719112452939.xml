<p>Laser microdissection (LMD) is a selective cell isolation technique that enables the separation of desired homogenous cell subpopulations from complex tissues such as the testes under direct microscopic visualization. The LMD accompanied by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) represents an indispensable tool in quantifying messenger RNA (mRNA) expression among defined cell populations. Gene expression is temporally and spatially regulated at 3 sequential phases of mitotic, meiotic, and postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. The present study demonstrates a short modified LMD protocol based upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Stage-specific LMD success was validated by the use of mRNA profiling of “marker genes” which are conserved across species and are known to be differentially expressed during spermatogenesis. <italic>Magea4</italic>, <italic>Hspa2</italic>, <italic>Cox6b2</italic>,<italic> Tnp1</italic>, <italic>Prm1</italic>, and<italic> Prm2 </italic>are used to differentiate among the microdissected cell populations, namely spermatogonia (group I), spermatocytes (group II), round and condensing spermatids (group III), and elongated and condensed spermatids (group IV), respectively.

The current study suggests that LMD can successfully isolate cell subpopulations from the complex tissues of the testes; and establish cell stage-specific basal expression patterns of selected stress response genes and proteins. It is our hypothesis that the baseline expression of stress response genes will differ by cell stage to create discrete stage-specific vulnerabilities to reproductive toxicants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The identification, isolation, and analysis of individual cell populations at the molecular level from complex and heterogeneous tissues have been a challenge for many years. Laser microdissection (LMD) has made a significant contribution toward cell separation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112452939">1</xref>
</sup> and thereby enabled the rapid and reliable isolation of specific cell types from complex tissues, while maintaining the integrity of DNA, RNA, and protein. However, LMD can be technically demanding. The varied LMD platforms, combined with the preceding and the subsequent downstream applications, each have the potential to introduce multiple variables that can either optimize or compromise the integrity of DNA, RNA, and proteins. The LMD was initially employed in cancer tissues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452939">2</xref>
</sup> and successfully extended to study gene expression in several tissues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112452939">3</xref>
</sup> such as the complex epithelia of the kidney glomeruli,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112452939">4</xref>
</sup> neuronal subtypes,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112452939">5</xref>
</sup> and breast cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112452939">6</xref>
</sup> Entire cross sections of rat seminiferous tubules were captured using the Arcturus PixCell II laser capture microdissection<sup>7</sup> (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, California), to result in aggregate cellular signals from the complex cell population. The Arcturus manual PIXEL, the automated Arcturus AutoPix, and the Biorad Clonis are pure infrared (IR) systems which do not allow the capture of single cells. In a subsequent work, the Zeiss PALM laser catapulting LCM system was used to capture regional zones of the rat seminiferous epithelium known to be populated by the selected cell stages (basal, mid section, and luminal) rather than discrete germ cell populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112452939">8</xref>
</sup> However, the interwoven sertoli cell and germ cell contact would be expected to result in sertoli cell contamination. While the ultraviolet (UV) LMD systems (Leica LMD 6000, 7000, and 7500, the Zeiss PALM, and Molecular Machines CellCut) allow single cell dissection,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112452939">9</xref>
</sup> it would also greatly increase the time spent in LMD with the potential to compromise the integrity of RNA.</p>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a tightly regulated and complex biological process of cellular differentiation that results in the production of haploid male germ cells. The spermatogenic cycle is divided into 14 spermatogenic stages in the rat and 12 stages in mouse. The 12 stages of the mouse seminiferous epithelium are defined according to changes observed in the Golgi region of the spermatids and the preponderance of cell types in a particular developmental stage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112452939">10</xref>
</sup> For the purposes of this study, the stages were grouped into early stages I to V, middle stages VI to VIII, and late stages IX to XII. In addition to morphology, the spermatogenic cells were further elucidated by the expression of stage and cell-specific marker genes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112452939">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112452939">12</xref>
</sup> Unlike other tissues, the migrating and differentiating male germ cells maintain cell-to-cell connection through cytoplasmic connections, and direct contact with the Sertoli cells via the interwoven cytoplasmic projections, thereby compromising efforts to investigate cell stage-specific nucleic acids and proteins. Consequently LMD promises to advance the understanding of spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112452939">13</xref>
</sup> However, very few studies address the isolation of individual male germ cells based on cell-specific marker genes using LMD,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112452939">14</xref>
</sup> and there are no published reports, or LMD methodology for the characterization of germ cell-specific proteins.</p>
<p>Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to optimize a short LMD protocol for the successful identification, isolation, and characterization of the 4 spermatogenic cell types using cell-specific marker genes namely: melanoma antigen, family A, 4 (<italic>Magea4</italic>), heat shock protein 2 (<italic>Hspa2</italic>), cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb polypeptide 2 (<italic>Cox6b2</italic>), transition protein 1 (<italic>Tnp1</italic>), protamine 1 (<italic>Prm1</italic>), and protamine 2 (<italic>Prm2</italic>). This was accomplished by the optimization of a short hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining protocol which was consistent with the LMD principles of maintaining acceptable morphology, within the context of preserving the quality and quantity of nucleic acids for downstream applications. Qualitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was complemented by Western blot (WB) of the LMD samples, immunohistochemistry, and confocal localization of the corresponding proteins. The secondary aim was the extension of the validated LMD protocol, combined with qRT-PCR and protein analysis, to the cell stage-specific expression of selected stress response genes to include heat shock protein 90, alpha (cytosolic), class A member 1 (<italic>Hsp90aa1</italic>), glutathione peroxidase 4 (<italic>Gpx4</italic>), uncoupling protein 2 (mitochondrial, proton carrier <italic>Ucp2</italic>), superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic>Sod1</italic>), and superoxide dismutase 2 (<italic>Sod2</italic>). It is our hypothesis that developmental differences in the regulation of stress response genes will confer unique cellular responses by spermatogenic cell stage when exposed to male reproductive toxicants. Thus, the present study is the first to establish a modified LMD approach which was validated by cell stage-specific marker genes, and complementary protein analysis, which was further extended to the constitutive expression profiles of selected stress response genes. As a result, this LMD protocol will translate to future toxicology applications that seek to elucidate gene expression data from exposed and nonexposed cell stage-specific subpopulations.</p>

<p>Eight- to ten-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were used as the animal model. The mice were housed, and the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the humane and ethical treatment of animals.

<title>Tissue Preparation and H&amp;E Staining</title>
<p>Tissue preparation and staining procedures were specifically modified from earlier LMD protocols,<sup>

</sup> and optimized to isolate germ cells from the mouse testis. Experimental mice were euthanized, the testes were removed, and the tissues were processed under RNase-free conditions. Tissues were frozen within 1 minute in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, California) and stored at −80°C for less than 1 month, if not used immediately. Cryosectioning was performed at 8-μm thickness for RNA isolation and at 12 μm for protein extraction. The sections were placed on UV sterilized 2.0 μm polyethylene naphthalate membrane slides (Leica Microsystems Deutschland, Bensheim, Germany) and were fixed for 1 minute using ice-cold acetone maintained at −15°C. The sections were then stained with CAT-hematoxylin (Biocare Medical, Concord, California) for 3 minutes, slowly rinsed twice in RNase-free distilled H<sub>2</sub>O to remove the excess hematoxylin, followed by eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) staining for 5 seconds, and dehydrated through 70%, 95%, and 100% alcohol grades for 30 seconds each. Finally, the sections were transferred to xylene for 3 minutes and subsequently air-dried for 1 minute. By quickly moving the slides between the solutions, this short staining protocol was completed in &lt;10 minutes to preserve tissue morphology, protect RNA integrity, and maximize RNA yield.</p>

<title>Laser Microdissection</title>
<p>Laser microdissection of the H&amp;E-stained testis sections was carried out using the ×40 objective, coupled with the draw and UV cutting system of the Leica LMD 6000 (Leica Microsystems). Cell-specific labels for spermatogonia ([SG] group I), spermatocytes ([SC] group II), round and condensing spermatids (group III), elongated and condensed spermatids inclusive of luminal spermatozoa (group IV), and Leydig cells were applied to the cross sections of seminiferous tubule (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112452939">Table 1</xref>). Corresponding stage-specific labels were applied to the microdissected cell collecting tubes which held 50 μL of extraction buffer (Arcturus, Life Technologies, Foster City, California). Considering the complexity of the seminiferous epithelium, the cell types were not microdissected as either circular zones, or circumferential seminiferous tubule cross sections as described in earlier studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112452939">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112452939">8</xref>
</sup> Instead the discrete cell types were dissected as clusters based upon cell morphology, size, density, and positional alignment within the seminiferous epithelium. To minimize Sertoli cell contamination, cuts were made at 90° angles to the lumen of the seminiferous tubule from an area of approximately 50 000 μm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452939">2</xref>
</sup>. Laser microdissection was completed within 1 hour and processed on the day of capture. The entire protocol from tissue collection through RNA quantitation required about 3 hours.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and immunolocalization</title>
<p>Paraffin sections (5-μm thick) of Bouins fixed and processed testes were used for immunohistochemistry and immunolocalization. In brief, the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and antigen unmasking was carried out using 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0). Sections were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder (NFDM) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature and incubated at 4°C overnight with specific primary antibodies. Spermatogenic cell stage-specific proteins included mouse monoclonal MAGEA4, 1:50 (SC-101223); goat polyclonal PRM2, 1:50 (SC-23104); COX6B2, 1:50 (SC-79412 [Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, California]); rabbit polyclonal HSPA2, 1:500 (12797-1-AP [ProteinTech, Chicago, Illinois]); and TPI, 1:500 (17178-1-AP [ProteinTech, Chicago, Illinois]). Following overnight incubation, the sections were incubated with either horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit, goat-anti-mouse, or donkey-anti-goat secondary antibodies (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. The slides were then washed and the color reaction carried out using the DAB kit (SK-4100 [Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California]). The sections were subsequently counterstained with either hematoxylin or eosin, dehydrated through alcohol grades, cleansed in xylene, and mounted using cytoseal-XYL (Richard Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Michigan).</p>
<p>Sample preparation for confocal localization of selected stress response proteins was completed as described above. Overnight incubation with the primary antibodies was completed at 1:50 dilution unless otherwise stated. The primary stress response antibodies included mouse monoclonal GPX4 (SC-166120 [Santa Cruz Biotechnology]); SOD1 (SC-271014), SOD2 (SC-133254), goat polyclonal UCP2 (SC-6526), and rabbit polyclonal HSP90αα1 1:200 (MA5-14866 [Thermoscientific, Rockford, Illinois]). Following overnight incubation, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat-anti-rabbit, goat-anti-mouse, or donkey-anti-goat secondary antibodies 1:400 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, Oregon) for 1 hour, and counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide dye 1:500 (Molecular Probes) for 5 minutes. Fluorescence was visualized using confocal microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E800; Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan).

<title>Western blot analysis of LMD samples</title>
<p>Individual testicular cell types such as SG, SCs, spermatids, and Leydig cells were captured via LMD into 40 μL of RIPA buffer containing 0.1 mol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Indiana) in a 200 μL PCR tube cap. Laser microdissection was performed within 2 hours for each cell type. The samples were stored at −70°C and pooled together prior to processing. To maintain the uniformity of the LMD extracted proteins, equal square micrometer (μm<sup>

The proteins in the cell lysates were subsequently separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using 5% NFDM in 1× TBS for 1 hour. The blots were then incubated in 1% NFDM in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4°C with following antibodies; anti-MAGEA4, anti-PRM2, anti-COX6B2 1:1000, and anti-HSPA2 1:1000. The blots were washed with TBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit, goat-anti-mouse, or donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies 1:10 000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. The cell-specific marker proteins MAGEA4, HSPA2, COX6B2, PRM2, and the reference protein β-tubulin were detected using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Chemiluminescence Substrate (Thermoscientific). The protein samples were normalized to β-tubulin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Laser microdissection was recently developed as a cell-purification technique that facilitates the isolation of individual cell populations from complex tissues. However, testes architecture coupled with several methodological barriers present distinct challenges when working with complex tissues such as the testis. The quantity of RNA from LMD samples is typically low (about 5-20 pg/cell) and fragmented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112452939">21</xref>
</sup> Previous reports demonstrated that RNA extraction from Stieve, GR fixative and formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue resulted in low yield and poor quality of RNA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112452939">13</xref>
</sup> Likewise, past studies advocated the staining of LMD sections with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain, peanut agglutinin lectin, methylene blue, or Mayer hematoxylin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112452939">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452939">22</xref>
</sup> However, our initial attempts at performing LMD with these dyes proved unsuccessful and resulted in either poor tissue morphology or poor capture success due to bleaching and compromised tissue integrity. Immunostaining techniques using specific marker proteins as suggested by prior work<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112452939">23</xref>
</sup> were not employed in this study. The prolonged exposure to aqueous solutions would be expected to compromise tissue morphology and nucleic acid integrity. However, our LMD protocol was designed to maximize and preserve the quantity and integrity of the nucleic acids; while securing acceptable tissue morphology to ensure LMD success. We modified the conventional H&amp;E staining to a shorter protocol of &lt;10 minutes duration using CAT-hematoxylin with a brief exposure to aqueous solutions and using xylene as the final dehydrant. This modified H&amp;E staining maintained the integrity and morphology of the seminiferous epithelium while protecting the quality and quantity of RNA. RNA quantity per cell stage ranged between ∼200 and 400 ng from approximately 50 000 μm<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452939">2</xref>
</sup> of the seminiferous epithelium, with a 260/280 ratio of ≥1.8. Because of the variability of size and ploidy of the differentiating male gametes, equal square micrometer (μm<sup>

<p>During spermatogenesis, multiple cell stages maintain direct sertoli cell contact. Sertoli cells have an enormous surface area that allows them to sustain a vast number of developing germ cells at a Sertoli-to-germ cell ratio of ∼1:50 in the adult rat testis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112452939">24</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, the intricate sertoli cell and germ cell associations make it difficult to isolate pure germ cell subpopulations. Past work either dissected entire cross sections,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112452939">7</xref>
</sup> or described zonal dissection of the seminiferous tubules known to be populated by the target cell populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112452939">8</xref>
</sup> Using the Acturus PIXEL LCM, Sluka et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112452939">7</xref>
</sup> captured entire cross sections of rat seminiferous tubules to result in aggregate cellular signals from the complex cell population. Cells captured would have included leydig cells, myoid cells, sertoli cells, and male germ cells in various stages of development. The Arcturus manual Pixel, the automated Arcturus AutoPix, and the Biorad Clonis are pure IR systems that do not allow single cell LMD. In comparison, the UV systems (Leica LMD 6000 and 7000, the Zeiss PALM, and Molecular Machines CellCut) allow single cell dissection, making the UV system ideal for dissecting differentiating male gametes. While single cell LMD would certainly produce pure germ cell populations, it would also greatly increase the time spent in LMD with the potential to compromise the integrity of RNA. As previously noted, regional zones of the seminiferous tubules known to be populated by the selected cell stages (basal, mid section, and luminal) were collected<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112452939">8</xref>
</sup> rather than discrete germ cell subpopulations. However, the cytoplasmic bridges which connect the differentiating cell stages, suggested cluster LMD as a viable option to isolate pure cell subpopulations, maximize the quality and quantity of nucleic acids, and minimize somatic cell contamination. Semiquantitative RT-PCR detected minimal <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in SG and SCs which suggested limited Sertoli cell contamination, while the absence of <italic>Sox9</italic> in the subsequent cell stages supported the absence of Sertoli cell contamination. For these reasons the draw and cut feature of the Leica MLD 6000, was the ideal platform for cluster LMD which enhanced our capacity to isolate specific germ cell populations within the construct of maximal RNA quantity, reduced time, and the protection of RNA integrity. Technologies such as flow cytometry with immunostaining may be well suited to the segregation of cells in suspension. However, these technologies disrupt adherent cells and profoundly alter gene expression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112452939">9</xref>
</sup> In addition, methods such as sedimentation or percoll gradients can purify only 1 meiotic cell type at a time but with few exceptions fail to yield sufficient purity of cell subpopulations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112452939">25</xref>
</sup> As a result, LMD has been noted to be the only technology that allows the isolation of cell subpopulations from complex tissues without disturbing the cell’s bimolecular signature.<sup>

<p>Laser microdissection was previously employed in the study of gene expression during mammalian spermatogenesis.<sup>

</sup> However, this is the first time that LMD, followed by qRT-PCR, immunolocalization, and WB was applied to the characterization of male germ cells at different stages of development using cell stage-specific marker genes at both the mRNA and protein levels, as a method of validating LMD cell stage-specific success. Qualitative RT-PCR using relative quantitation (2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup>), normalized to β-actin and the calibrator sample (group I SG), revealed developmental differences in the expression of <italic>Magea4</italic>, <italic>Hspa2</italic>, <italic>Cox6b2</italic>, <italic>Tnp1</italic>, <italic>Prm1</italic>, and <italic>Prm2</italic> during the stages of spermatogenesis which was consistent with the functional roles and conformed to the published data. The purity of the group I sample for SG was validated by the differential expression of the cancer/testis gene, <italic>Magea4</italic> which was found to be significantly higher in SG, and to a lesser extent in SCs than in any of the other cell types or stages. This was complemented by immunolocalization of MAGEA4 on SG in the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. The unique expression pattern of <italic>Magea4</italic> in SG and its abundant activation in several solid tumors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112452939">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112452939">28</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112452939">29</xref>
</sup> and is highly expressed in meiotic SCs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112452939">30</xref>
</sup> This current study reported maximal <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA expression in SCs which was subsequently supported by immunolocalization. HSPA2 staining was absent in SG. However, intense HSPA2 staining was present in SCs with a gradual decline in spermatids which is consistent with prior published data.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112452939">33</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless the varying protein expression by WB and immunolocalization may represent nonspecific staining. Qualitative RT-PCR analyses of <italic>Tnp1, Prm1</italic>, and <italic>Prm2</italic> demonstrated mRNA expression specific to round and condensing spermatids (group III), and elongated and condensed spermatids (group IV). Interestingly, the maximal <italic>Prm2 </italic>expression appeared in both the condensing (group III) and elongated (group IV) spermatids. While this supported the overlapping nature of these nucleoproteins,<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112452939">37</xref>
</sup> whereby protamines replace nuclear histones during spermatozoa reorganization. Protamines contain numerous cysteine residues that stabilize the chromatin structure and protect the DNA from reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup>

<p>In accordance with prior published data of differential spermatogenic cell stage sensitivities to physical or chemical agents,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112452939">39</xref>
</sup> our hypothesis suggests that the constitutive expression of stress response genes will differ by cell stage to create stage-specific vulnerabilities to reproductive toxicants. To establish a foundation for this hypothesis, the current LMD protocol was combined with qRT-PCR and protein analysis to establish baseline cell stage-specific expression patterns of the selected stress response genes. Oxidative stress that disrupts testicular steroidogenesis<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112452939">42</xref>
</sup> Consistent with our hypothesis regarding the potential stage-specific expression of stress response genes, the current study reveals that the level of <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> mRNA was higher in SCs as reported by prior published data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112452939">39</xref>
</sup> However, this is the first report of <italic>Hspa2 </italic>and<italic> Cox6b2 </italic>expression patterns that were similar to <italic>Hsp90αα1.</italic> These observations concur with previous findings by immunoelectron microscopy<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112452939">42</xref>
</sup> Similar to <italic>Hspa2</italic>, the higher level of <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> in SCs suggests that the protein is indispensable for synaptonemal complex disassembly and/or progression through the pachytene checkpoint. <italic>Hsp90aa1</italic> is also a member of a highly conserved pathway to protect cells from physical and chemical stress.<sup>

<p>UCP2 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is essential in the prevention of the production of excess ROS and mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization.<sup>

</sup> Consistent with prior work<sup>

</sup> our study demonstrated the maximal <italic>Ucp2 </italic>expression in SG (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>T</sub> 25-30), and exclusive UCP2 protein localization to the elongated spermatids. Among the various proteins protecting the male germ cells against ROS, SOD1, and SOD2 are among the most important antioxidant scavengers. Lasso and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719112452939">54</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1933719112452939">55</xref>
</sup> With the exception of the marginal increase in <italic>Sod1 </italic>expression in spermatids, our work documented <italic>Sod1</italic> in all cell stages. <italic>Sod2</italic> expression was significantly higher in SCs and paralleled SOD2 protein localization. This finding was consistent with prior reports that found SOD2 to be negligible or absent in spermatids.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719112452939">56</xref>
</sup> Taken together, these findings suggest that the antioxidant defense system has been vividly demarcated between the premeiotic and postmeiotic germ cells in the testis.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study comprehensively demonstrated a short LMD protocol, combined with qRT-PCR, and confocal microscopy to characterize the differentiating male gametes via stage-specific marker genes. Furthermore, it provided a window into the cell stage-specific constitutive expression of selected stress response genes by cell stage. The understanding of gene expression at the level of transcription, translation and posttranslational modifications is essential to fully unravel its functional significance under varied biological conditions. As a result, a methodological foundation was established to elicit the cell stage-specific effects of male reproductive toxicants on the differentiating male gametes.</p>
