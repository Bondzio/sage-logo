<p><bold><italic>Climate change is the greatest public health disaster facing us today. Sucharita Yarlagadda, Premila Webster and Elizabeth Haworth from the University of Oxford suggest that only with firm and decisive action now can we hope to avert or mitigate an impending public health catastrophe</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457308">1</xref></sup></bold></p>

<p>While there is a scientific consensus that the global climate is changing, with increasing climate variability and extremes, rising temperatures and sea levels and increased frequency of natural disasters which impact on human health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912457308">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912457308">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912457308">4</xref></sup> against a backdrop of persistent world economic pressures, the role of the specialty of public health in responding to environmental and climate change is not clear and needs to be defined.</p>
<p>Many governments, including those of the UK have committed to tackling climate change through adaptation and mitigation and carbon abatement measures. The Climate Change Act 2008 sets a legally binding target for reducing UK greenhouse gas emissions by at least 34% by 2020 and by 80% by 2050, using the 1990 baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912457308">5</xref></sup> The NHS has shown leadership in this area through the Good Corporate Citizenship model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912457308">6</xref></sup> the NHS carbon reduction strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912457308">7</xref></sup> and the NHS Sustainable Development Unit’s route map for sustainable health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912457308">8</xref></sup> These aim to, at least, meet government targets and demonstrate early success with a 10% reduction of the 2007 NHS carbon footprint by 2015.</p>
<p>Since April 2010, a new mandatory emissions trading scheme has come into force, requiring increased efforts by NHS organizations to meet government carbon targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913912457308">9</xref></sup> Alongside this is growing evidence of substantial financial and health benefits of low carbon business models in response to climate change and sustainability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912457308">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913912457308">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>As recommended by the Lancet and University College London a new Public Health movement is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912457308">4</xref></sup> The time to act is now. However, there still seems to be a huge gap between knowledge/ evidence and coordinated public health action.</p>
<p>To clarify the public health role, a UK-wide internet based survey of public health departments (service public health, academic public health and the health protection units) was conducted in April 2010. It sought to allow an assessment of climate change as a public health problem, identify actions and innovations already taken, and to promote a coordinated public health response.</p>
<p>The preliminary results were presented at the 2010 Faculty of Public Health Conference. The response rate of 32% overall was disappointing, despite a reminder. Over 90% of this considerable UK public health workforce who responded agreed that climate change is an important health problem requiring public health action. Many respondents highlighted the need for a stronger NHS mandate and prioritisation, such as through the NHS operational framework. Most believed that further training and development is essential for effective action, but the urgency is sidelined by current restriction of financial resources to deal with this problem.</p>
<p>Although the public health workforce believes that action is needed and there is a public health strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913912457308">11</xref></sup> and encouraging response by primary care trusts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913912457308">12</xref></sup> neither an overarching plan nor effective coordination exists. What is good for the planet is also good for health and policies and structural drivers to mitigate and adapt to climate change would have a large positive effect on population health, for example the health co-benefits of walking or cycling to work that both reduce emissions and improve health and wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913912457308">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Emergency plans must be improved, kept up to date and include an effective service response to unpredictable weather patterns because of climate associated disasters and problems. These include floods and related water contamination incidents, droughts, heat waves, food shortages, as well as the problem of emerging diseases such as arthropod-borne infections and other environmentally linked diseases such as skin cancers and cataracts due to reduction/loss of the ozone layer. The health emergency response should specifically target inequalities in health, both in the UK and globally. The catastrophic weather in Australia, particularly the Queensland floods and cyclone Yasi, the number of damaging earthquakes around the world, including that in Christchurch New Zealand, which may be linked to climate change, floods in Pakistan and Thailand and famine resulting from droughts in Africa are a salutary jolt for action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913912457308">14</xref></sup> Coordinated research and programmed public health action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912457308">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913912457308">15</xref></sup> are needed, with targeting of health inequalities.</p>
<p>A coordinated public health programme developed with key stakeholders across the NHS, other relevant disciplines and departments, and globally is required to enable the sustainable improvement of population health. This could result from applying the NHS Sustainable Development Unit’s route map for sustainable health, standardised and coordinated health impact assessments across the country and the following recommendations derived from the survey:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913912457308" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>to set up an active special interest group/network on sustainability in public health to enable continued engagement and sharing by public health specialists and all public health groups;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to continue advocacy for this issue to remain a priority for planned interventions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to educate and train staff so that they have the knowledge and skills for effective population based interventions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to strengthen the evidence base by research and development for effective interventions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to develop a resource of the necessary tools for the public health workforce to deliver on sustainability objectives; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to improve surveillance by developing health information systems to collect share and disseminate information rapidly, using electronic means and mobile phone technology.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Worldwide, protection and improvement of the health of the public have to be delivered as a low carbon service with fewer government resources and more public involvement. Cost effective and linked interventions that are beneficial for the planet and human health should enable us to act fairly, responsibly and effectively.</p>
<p>It is important that whatever the public health system in place, action for sustainable development and the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change remain public health priorities.</p>
