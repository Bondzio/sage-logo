<p>Although most standard arguments about Colombia and Venezuela have pointed at their similarities (p.1), in “Precarious Democracies” Bejarano offers a different point of view; she demonstrates that the contexts, opportunities and hurdles that appear as their democratic processes evolve, reveal divergent trajectories of stability and regime change. To sustain such claim, the author carefully unpacks the elements of full democracy (chapter 1), and recovers each country’s history of institutional evolution. Colombia and Venezuela have often been portrayed as similar cases of regime endurance because of their shared history of military dictatorships, pacted transitions, democratic stability and recent turmoil. Nevertheless, devoting each chapter to highlight the role of historical legacies, sociopolitical coalitions and institutional architectures, Bejarano persuasively demonstrates why Venezuela and Colombia have followed divergent paths. The timing and patterns of consolidation of the state and the party system are crucial to explain differences in the emergence and erosion of these regimes. Military rule ended with pacted transitions in 1957 in Colombia (National Front pact) and a year later in Venezuela (Pacto de Punto Fijo). How does the author explain these transitions? Bejarano opens up the discussion with a critique of structural accounts that explain regime change in terms of socioeconomic factors (oil and coffee). Although she acknowledges that there is a place for structural factors in the explanation of how democracy comes about, in chapter 1 she emphasizes strongly that resource driven explanations are insufficient: “whether or not a specific commodity leads to democracy depends on the interaction between socioeconomic structures, and institutions such as the state, and the political parties” (p. 36). Chapter 2 frames this claim in terms of “the importance of political institutions in translating socioeconomic realities into political outcomes” (p.45). The author sustains that the timing and sequence of the emergence of the state and the parties can explain patterns and outcomes of democratic transition. The reason why sequence matters has to do with the fact that “the establishment of a central state is considered a prerequisite for the consolidation of competitive party politics” (p.45). In that regard, Bejarano claims that divergent institutional sequences explain democratic transition experiences in Colombia and Venezuela. Part 2 provides a rich account of Bejarano’s “yet compelling but simple conclusion: not all pacted transitions are created equal” (p.79). Although Venezuela and Colombia underwent arrangements among opposition forces to eliminate autocratic rule, in substance these pacts were very different and therefore had dissimilar consequences for democratic consolidation. Pacts differed in terms of the number and range of actors that participated, the scope of the restrictions they imposed, the duration and entrenchment of these restrictions (chapter 3). Colombian agreements were restrictive and long lasting. They established shared government only between the Liberal and Conservative parties for a period of 16 years. The Venezuelan were more flexible, broader, less obstructive (they opened competition to leftist parties) and short-lived (one presidential period). Bejarano shows that the differences of these pacts stem from the tasks facing the parties at the moment they were created. Venezuelan programmatic and broadly based parties were concerned with achieving trust and consensus to maintain future competition. Colombian clientelistic and elitist parties were interested in overcoming a century old tradition of violent mutual exclusion. Bejarano describes the divergences in the process of democratic institutionalization post-transition in part 3. In the years that followed the rise of democracy, Colombia and Venezuela had challenges to overcome. Political leaders were mostly concerned about subduing the military to the civilian rule, neutralizing leftist armed contenders and advancing the consolidation of the party system (chapter 4). Long term structural (the economy, the consolidation of the state and the party system) and immediate legacies (pacts) shaped the incentives and opportunities of political elites to surpass such hurdles. In Colombia, the rigidity of the pacts, and the tradition of “mutual exclusion” that characterized electoral competition between the Conservative and Liberals hindered the institutionalization of democracy as the “only game in town”. In Venezuela, although pacts were more flexible and party competition less restrictive, democratic institutionalization was truncated in the late 80s due to the incapacity of the main parties to adapt to pressing demands. Colombian and Venezuelan political parties and party systems are discussed in chapter 5. As an advocate of the comparative historical institutional framework, Bejarano strongly suggest that “In addition to focusing on institutionalization of the party system, as proposed by Mainwaring and Scully (1995), we ought to reconsider the party’s history, organization, degree of internal coherence, and capacity to adapt to exogenous change” (p. 197). The empirical implication of such claim is strong. Many scholars have portrayed Colombia and Venezuela as having a well institutionalized party system (based on institutionalization indicators such as regularity of interparty competition, party roots in society, acceptance of parties and elections and stability of party’s internal rules); however a closer look reveals differences and weaknesses only evident when considering their organization, political history, and flexibility. Behind the façade of institionalization, Colombia has had a very fragmented, exclusionary, unorganized system. Venezuela, on the other hand, has had an inclusionary, highly centralized, organized, vertical and disciplined two-party system that later became unable to accommodate to social transformations and emerging social cleavages (chapter 5). Much of these differences according to the author, are attributable to their history of institutional evolution. Bejarano concludes chapter 5 with another provocative argument about political parties: recent trends seem to favor “lax, highly decentralized organizations, functioning only on the basis of informal mechanisms of negotiation and bargaining” (p.215). The theoretical implications of this claim are robust. Bejarano invite us to rethink not only the role but the structure of parties in the political system. Several questions follow: Should we conceive parties as bridges between the population and their elected representatives or should we conceive them as mere vehicles that facilitate electoral success? Does decentralization of political parties improve the prospects for democratic consolidation? How much flexibility should we allow them? What role should party leaders have in the selection of their own candidates? Bejarano does not address any of these questions, but it is clear that this book will influence the debate around the current role of political parties. Despite efforts for consolidation, Venezuela and Colombia are portrayed as “two unhappy democracies”. The last chapters of the book present a detailed explanation of such unhappiness. In the late 1980s, after years of being showcased as stable democracies, Colombia and Venezuela started to crumble (chapter 5 and 6). High levels of leftist and drug related violence, growing voter abstention, atomization of party system, have shaken the Colombian regime. In Venezuela maladies are associated with economic struggles, military coups attempts and with the inability of the main parties to adapt and cope with new economic and social challenges. The sources of the problem for democracy in Colombia lie in the weakness of the state to guarantee civil rights and the incapability of the electoral institutions to organize the party system. In Venezuela, the author suggests that the end of competitive democratic rule and the rise of Chavez to power obey to a “severe crisis of representation followed by the collapse of the party system” (p.246). In general, Bejarano’s merits lie not only in her ability to connect institutional evolution with relevant concepts and theories of democracy (and democratization) but also in her insight to challenge some of the existing paradigms in the literature. In that way, particularly interesting is her critique of “resource driven explanations of democracy” in chapter 1. The coexistence of democratizing tendencies in oil rich Venezuela during the 80s and the democratic debacle that followed in the late 90s, suggest that oil revenues may not have “antidemocratic”, or even “prodemocratic” properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012452248">Haber and Menaldo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012452248">Dunning, 2010</xref>). In fact, oil revenues could be considered as stabilizing elements that in particular circumstances help to sustain different regimes. Chapter 5 lays down an equally compelling argument: “pacts are neither beneficial nor dysfunctional to democracy; their success depends on both the context and the extent of the restrictions they impose” (p.83). The implication of such argument is strong. Pacted democracies might have not been more conductive to democracies than transitions that are forged from different mechanisms. Finally, just as important are her insights about the endogeneity of institutional designs and policy outcomes. Her work clearly reveals how political leaders shape institutions and policies according to their institutional historical legacies. “Precarious Democracies”, delivers what was promised. Bejarano has presented a consistent account of the different factors that explain the unhappiness of democracy in Colombia and Venezuela. She uncovers why despite of the similarities, these two countries profoundly diverged in their pacted transitions and posterior struggle to consolidate their democratic regimes. The major scholar contribution lies in her theoretical approach being the “first systematic comparative analysis of the emergence and evolution of these two increasingly troubled South American Democracies” (p. 250). This book not only will be a reference point for scholars interested in Venezuelan or Colombian politics but will also certainly influence the debate around the effect of the state, the parties and the party systems on the consolidation of democracy.</p>
