<p>Reading Matthew Hannah’s latest book, I felt as if I was being taken for a ride in a ‘time machine’. His analysis of the (West) German census boycotts of the 1980s is more than just a glimpse into the abyss of the ‘dark territory in the information age’. In many ways and especially from the viewpoint of the young student I was back in those days, it is a very vivid retrospect of a ‘dark age’ for leftist perspectives during the first decades of West German post-war history as well as for the uprising civil movements bound to change the political climate at that time.</p>
<p>What makes the book particularly outstanding is the depth of its mostly historiographical and ethnographic analysis that emerges from an impressively intensive engagement with the topic. Drawing on data of various forms and origins, it combines empirical findings with deep knowledge of the general political and social conditions as well as the lived-in worlds of the research subjects (including fluent command of their language). The controversies around the German census were political events that triggered massive public protest in West Germany during the 1980s. The manifold activities of people’s movements were able to delay the census for several years, and the census-verdict of the Federal Constitutional Court deriving from this context is still considered one of the milestones of data privacy within the country.</p>
<p>Hannah convincingly works out and presents the controversies around the then contested population census and the resistance of civil society movements. This is already indicated by the introductory chapter which sets the scene through reconstructing the historic circumstances of the census controversies. Hannah carefully traces the political fault lines which gave way to the formation of resistance movements during the first decades of post-war West Germany. One is the emergence of a critical leftist scene which articulated itself within a broader public during the student protests in 1968. Another is the successive intensification of state security measures and surveillance technologies. This was not only rooted in a rather diffuse fear of communism enshrined in cold war geopolitics – including practices such as the decree against communists (<italic>Radikalenerlass</italic> 1972) and occupational bans (<italic>Berufsverbote</italic>) – but was also nourished by RAF terrorism during the so-called ‘German Autumn’ (<italic>Deutscher Herbst</italic>). Within this framework of homeland security, larger databases and statistical population records were utilized for dragnet investigations for the first time.</p>
<p>The main chapters of the book are dedicated to a detailed analysis of the population census controversies and the boycotts of 1983 and 1987. From the plethora of interesting details, only a selected few can be highlighted here. Against the background of the institutional, political and constitutional circumstances of the census presented in the first part, the main focus is laid on identifying the lines of conflict, the pro and con arguments and the practices of protagonists with differing power potentials, ranging from political parties to administrative institutions, from constitutional courts to the media and to the manifold semi-formal and informal organizations within civil society. In his analysis, Hannah pays special attention to ways of resistance including the census boycotts, whose vehemence illustrates in retrospective why it became such an important focal point for civil movements of the 1980s.</p>
<p>In all these cases, Hannah manages to delve deeply into the events, providing a comprehensive, well-balanced, clear and critical reconstruction based on historical sources. He shows that the debates prior to the resistance against the census were not solely aimed at the legitimacy of the census and the form or amount of data collected. Especially for the second phase of controversies (1987), he demonstrates how the processing and multiple usage of data by third parties was equally contested. The debate concentrated on problems of anonymization, the way data was saved and swiftly passed on to other departments (e.g. registration offices, police) as well as questions of data replication and recombination. Hannah’s reconstruction thus coherently discloses the opponent’s fear of the ‘transparent citizen’ and the apocalyptical Orwellian Big Brother scenario developing from the allegedly innocuous ‘statistical’ acquisition process once it will be connected to the broader context of national security politics.</p>
<p>The key question of the boycott was to which degree a state actually has the right to ‘all-encompassing statistical knowledge’ about its population, or respectively to which degree the constitutional ‘right of informational self-determination’ was actually safeguarded with regards to handling and usage of personalized information. Hannah discusses this point in offering convincing examples of informational ‘dark territories’. These included, for example, ‘residential communities’ (<italic>Wohngemeinschaften</italic>) or semi-formal social micro-milieus of migrant enclaves, which national security institutions were trying to control while the affected citizens tried to circumvent this. Hannah’s differentiated analysis successfully avoids being trapped in abstraction. He shows that even within the said groups and institutions the census was neither consistently endorsed nor uniformly rejected but rather that differentiated positions and opinions prevailed.</p>
<p>Theoretically the empirical analysis is grounded in Foucault’s governmentality studies, which enables Hannah to characterize, for example, the surveillance measures taken by the then director of the Federal Criminal Agency (<italic>Bundeskriminalamt</italic>) in a Foucauldian reading as biopolitical and securitization technologies targeted directly at the population. The role of the census as a form of intervention of ‘the police’ (in terms of Rancière) exceeding its statistical and documentary purpose is clearly illustrated. Hence, from the perspective of governmentality studies, it can be regarded as a technology of disciplining and control enforcement. Despite these references to broader theoretical debates, the relations between theory and empirical findings are articulated rather subtly throughout the analysis, and readers with a deeper interest in theoretical debates might have wished for some more explicit links between the two. However, as Hannah states himself, ‘fading out into the deeper waters of theoretical debate is something [he has] deliberately resisted doing’ (p. 221) and given the immensely rich empirical analysis this should clearly be respected.</p>
<p>In addition to being a vigorous account of a historical and instructive phase of civil society’s development in (West) Germany, Hannah also uses his findings to advance recommendations associated with civil actions against current political handlings of personalized data subjected to the terms and conditions of a globalized information society. Learning from the West German census controversies, Hannah develops an ambitious political perspective, offering proposals on a more critical society in the information age that is building its own institutions, mechanisms and techniques ‘from below’, in order to safeguard and provide a responsible and anonymized handling of personalized data in the future.</p>
<p>At this point, it would have been interesting to combine the arguments made within the book with ongoing public debates about data handling and digital exhibitionism in modern ‘facebook-societies’, which often enough show pretty much the opposite of ‘critical sensitivity’ towards questions of data access, disclosure and storage. In this sense, Hannah’s book not only provides an excellent historical account of the debates around the German census boycotts of the 1980s but also opens the floor to further debates about the biopolitics of data usage with enormous relevance to our societies.</p>
