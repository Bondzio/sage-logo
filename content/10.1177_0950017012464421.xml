<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the wake of ongoing crisis largely attributable to neoliberal policies, neoliberalism has nonetheless remained politically dominant, as illustrated by the enforcement of various austerity programmes cross-nationally. These three books examine a series of interrelated questions arising from the neoliberal political-economic ascendancy and the crisis. First, Colin Crouch addresses neoliberalism’s remarkable resilience as a framework for economic management and public policy, despite its divergence in practice from an ideal model of free, competitive markets. The neoliberal era has produced unprecedented growth in the wealth and political influence of major corporations: Crouch evaluates the potential for a reinvigorated civil society to challenge the combined dominance of corporations, states and markets.</p>
<p>The concentration of political and economic power under neoliberalism is also examined by Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy. Focusing on the US origins of the crisis, they analyse neoliberalism as a distinct social order through which a dominant alliance of capitalists and managers has accumulated massive wealth. They assess the longer-term consequences for the USA’s political-economic structure and its international hegemonic position, going on to investigate the possibilities for a post-neoliberal order, both domestically and internationally – although they envisage few prospects of any left alternative or a return to an earlier social-democratic compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, the waning of Keynesian-era macro-corporatism provides Mark Anner with a setting within which to discuss union responses to global restructuring in Latin America. The neoliberal expansion of corporate power has been accompanied by a decline in the political role of organized labour, while the greatest impact of neoliberal globalization has been borne by workers in restructured industries. Anner evaluates the effectiveness of left and moderate union responses in two such industries – apparel and automotive production – in four Latin American nations, to explore their potential for contesting neoliberalism and corporate power. Therefore, these issues – the continuing ascendancy of neoliberalism and the possibility of viable alternatives – provide consistent themes for this brief review essay.</p>

<sec id="section2-0950017012464421">
<title>Unravelling the mystery: neoliberalism’s continuing ascendancy</title>
<p>The title of Colin Crouch’s book, <italic>The Strange Non-Death of Neoliberalism</italic>, captures the paradox of neoliberalism’s continuing political-economic ascendancy. How has this continuation been possible? The growth of corporate political power provides one source of explanation. While acknowledging that major corporations are here to stay, Crouch explicitly questions the ‘comfortable accommodation’ of state, markets and corporations (pp. viii–x). Contrary to an idealized competitive market with large numbers of firms and extensive consumer choice, neoliberalism has led to the dominance of a few giant corporations, with consumer choice reduced to a paternalistic ‘consumer welfare’. This important change, one of the book’s main themes, has gone largely unnoticed in a public debate largely framed around a state-market opposition (pp. 7–17).</p>
<p>Crouch’s overall judgement on the neoliberal era is negative, but he acknowledges certain achievements: reduced government control and greater choice for ‘ordinary people’; addressing problems of over-centralization and associated remoteness; and the remarkable ‘flexibility of the neoliberal paradigm’, its capacity to accommodate other political positions and ideologies (pp. 22–3). Neoliberalism’s equation of the private sector with efficiency has led to amoral market judgements being presented as superior, according huge power over what is consumed, where and how, to major firms. Therefore, for Crouch, areas where principled decisions are made need to be defended (pp. 24–7). The power of major corporations and the concentration of wealth have undermined markets and democracy: he identifies the neoliberal use of ‘free markets’ as code for ‘freedom for big business’ (p. 52). The oligopolistic firms who benefit most from neoliberalism’s regulatory permissiveness are, as Crouch argues, also those who flout neoliberal theory through their incessant lobbying of politicians and their aides.</p>
<p>The neoliberal legacy is encapsulated for Crouch by four main features: the replacement of consumer choice by ‘consumer welfare’; the assertion that wealth creation, regardless of who acquires it, is legitimate; the demise of the ideal of a competitive market dominated by small and medium businesses; and a failure to resolve the ongoing reality that economic power translates into political power (pp. 69–70). The politically powerful corporation is the antithesis of the ideal separation of politics and economy propounded by liberal political economy, as dramatically illustrated by the bailout of banks deemed by governments to be ‘too big to fail’ – a ‘privatized Keynesianism’ which contradicts a basis premise of neoliberal theory, the removal of barriers to market entry and exit (pp. 98–104). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012464421">Richard Dienst (2011</xref>: 58–9) has demonstrated, the current ‘neoliberal regime of indebtedness’ has moved beyond the privatization of profits/ socialization of risks to a system whose proponents deny all public responsibility. Thus a crisis for banks has become a crisis for everyone. Neoliberalism, therefore, requires almost all people to act as ‘amoral automata’, as almost everyone has become complicit in a model built on all-encompassing debt (pp. 106–10). As prosperity became increasingly dependent on stock exchange movements, rather than on unionism, labour rights and publicly funded insurance schemes, so a fundamental political reconfiguration in favour of neoliberal policies occurred (pp. 111–16).</p>
<p>The bailout indicates an end to any pretence that politics and the economy can be kept separate. Corporations have the power to erect their own standards, which co-exist with those of transnational regulatory agencies and procedures. Since the global corporation is now in a unique position to implement social values, corporate social responsibility (CSR) provides an important avenue for achieving political change (pp. 124–37). As Crouch indicates, there is an identifiable consumer preference for CSR goods, and, as firms become increasingly powerful political actors, so they become targets for pressure groups wanting them to act in more socially and environmentally responsible ways (pp. 139–43). Civil society provides the contemporary space within which the contestation of values and a critique of state, markets and corporations can occur (pp. 147–54). The ‘quintessential’ actors of civil society are: political parties, linking the state to society; religions, traditionally the most powerful source of ethical, value-based rationales; campaigning groups, usually lacking financial resources but able to mobilize strongly on specific issues; the often overlapping voluntary and charity sectors, which can express a broader sense of charity as <italic>caritas</italic>, denoting a sense of welfare and community belonging; and finally, the professions, with their own values and ethics, which often come into conflict with organizations based on financial imperatives. While these organizations also require scrutiny, they provide a potential source of critique and opposition to the power of state, markets and corporations, providing avenues for action which implements moral values – the ‘best we can hope for’ in a pluralist society (pp. 152–61). While neoliberalism may be ‘wearing out’ (p. 163), then, Crouch sees limited possibilities for any left alternative: the ‘quadrilateral of forces’ – state, market, corporation and civil society – will remain under corporate dominance.</p>
<p>Crouch’s quadrilateral approach can permit readers to investigate the multiple exclusions and inclusions through which civil society, state and economy are formed. The location of the corporation within a broader network of socioeconomic and political relations permits identification of its points of strength and vulnerability, disassembling the corporation’s monolithic facade. Still, the extent to which civil society can provide the space for a substantive critique of state, markets and corporations is itself dependent on the configuration of civil society itself. As the terrain of the politically concerned and active citizen, civil society is constructed through unequal access to social goods and services (health, education, housing, social welfare, employment). The neoliberal imposition of private, market-based allocation has constructed a less open, less democratic civil society, reducing the space for alternatives to market judgements.</p>

<title>The origins and consequences of crisis: neoliberalism and the USA</title>
<p>Whereas the original Keynesian model represented the eventual accommodation of the working class and organized labour to capitalism, this privatized version has been promoted by finance capitalists – the primary beneficiaries of the neoliberal era examined by Duménil and Lévy. They investigate two main issues: how neoliberalism, as ‘a new stage of capitalism’, led to financial and economic crisis in the USA; and the accompanying decline of US global hegemony – a decline which, while unavoidable, will be either rapid or gradual. They identify three problems inherent to neoliberal strategies, in the USA and internationally: the quest for high income, particularly the creation of a ‘fictitious surplus’; the free mobility of capital, reducing the capacity of national governments to control their economies; and the USA’s unique national trajectory, made possible by its global hegemony, which helped accelerate internationalization of its commodity production (pp. 22–5).</p>
<p>Before the crisis, the neoliberal order successfully delivered vast wealth to a tiny minority, while the 1990s boom temporarily masked the divergence between neoliberal class strategies and the domestic economy’s problems (pp. 25–8). Duménil and Lévy outline two possible futures in the wake of crisis: a continuation of neoliberal policies and rapid US decline; or alternatively, a new post-neoliberal order in which the upper classes and the domestic economy are brought into closer alignment. The latter will require a compromise with the ‘popular classes’ (clerical and production workers) – although, given the weak position of the labour movement, they envisage neither a return to a social-democratic compromise nor any more radical alternative. They suggest that the probable outcome of the current crisis will be a right-leaning ‘neomanagerial capitalism’, comprising upper classes, capitalists and the new leading force – managers – although the need to garner popular support may require centrist concessions. Still, such an arrangement is unlikely to preserve US hegemony with the emergence of a new, multipolar international system (pp. 28–32).</p>
<p>The neoliberal era is seen as beset by contradictions, encompassing the quest for high income, financialization and globalization, combined with the US economy’s domestic problems, including rapidly growing consumption, credit and household debt, all made possible by a deregulatory regime. The bursting of the housing bubble and the collapse of financial institutions provided a trigger for the crisis of an already fragile global financial order (p. 38). Duménil and Lévy pose the necessary question of the depth and length of the ‘Great Contraction’, identifying economic stimulus as the key issue. Amid increasing government debt, reliance on foreign financing and continuing pressure on the dollar, US hegemony is under severe threat (pp. 41–2).</p>
<p>The gap between neoliberalism in theory and in practice explored by Crouch is also addressed by Duménil and Lévy, to examine the distinctive class dimensions of neoliberalism as a social order. While the national and global concentration of wealth and income (pp. 47–8) may be unproblematic for neoliberalism as theory, it can present serious political problems for neoliberal practice, necessitating the formation of alliances. The neoliberal configuration of capitalist, managerial and popular classes supplanted the Keynesian-era compromise between the ‘popular classes’ and managers (including public officials), a social order which had restrained capitalist interests. In the neoliberal era, the balance of power within the dominant class alliance has shifted. Capitalists have become increasingly dependent on the expertise of managers, who have been rewarded with rapidly increasing wages and portfolio assets. Like Crouch, Duménil and Lévy reject a simple state-markets explanation (pp. 85–9) since the state has been vital to the creation and maintenance of the neoliberal compromise (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012464421">Doogan, 2009</xref>: 118–21).</p>
<p>As Duménil and Lévy illustrate, financialization and globalization have assumed distinctive forms under neoliberalism, particularly through the transformation of the financial sector (pp. 99–112). The US economy followed a trajectory affected by rapidly rising consumption in relation to income, a growing trade deficit combined with rising household and government debt and declining capital accumulation (pp. 185–203). The destabilization ensuing from the mortgage debacle led on to the financial collapse and the contraction of economic activity in both the USA and globally. The subsequent bailouts by governments and central banks contradicted several of neoliberalism’s most cherished principles. The multipolar future, though, will be determined more by political events and changing social orders internationally than in the USA – most notably, in China and South America, as the USA heads towards neomanagerial capitalism, with few prospects of a left alternative (pp. 325–34). They provide a persuasive argument, supported by a wealth of statistical evidence, to make the case for a multipolar future, while showing convincingly how neoliberal globalization led to crisis.</p>

<title>Responses to restructuring: unions in Latin America</title>
<p>In Mark Anner’s <italic>Solidarity Transformed</italic>, he assesses how organized labour has responded to neoliberal globalization within four very different settings in Latin America. The book adds to a body of literature (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012464421">Bronfenbrenner, 2007</xref>) that explores new strategies for organized labour within the context of a global economy often hostile to union organization. He examines the impact of global industrial restructuring on unionization in, first, the apparel industry in El Salvador and Honduras and, second, the automotive industry in Brazil and Argentina, going on to evaluate the effectiveness of union responses within these restructured settings (pp. xi–xviii). These two industries exemplify two very different types of global commodity chain: buyer-driven chains (for example, major retailers such as Kmart and Wal-Mart) in apparel; and producer-driven chains (for example, major manufacturers such as Ford and Volkswagen) in automobiles.</p>
<p>Union responses have been characterized by the long-standing division between left and moderate unions. During the Cold War, successive US governments, often aided by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Unions (AFL-CIO), sought to undermine and marginalize leftist unionism in Latin America and to encourage moderate unions. Despite a dissipation of Cold War era antagonisms, this historical division persists: between anti-capitalist unions, more inclined to internationalism and transnational activism, and moderate unions committed to cross-class collaboration within national boundaries (pp. 13–15). The contrasting strategies pursued by left and moderate unions provide Anner with a consistent analytical framework.</p>
<p>He identifies four main types of response (pp. 14–20):</p>
<list id="list1-0950017012464421" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>left apparel unions’ anti-capitalist transnational activist campaigns;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>moderate apparel unions’ plant-level collaboration with employers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>radical automotive unions’ transnational labour networks; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>moderate automotive unions’ micro-corporatist collaboration with employers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>First, he evaluates the local and transnational consumer awareness and organizing campaigns of left apparel unions in El Salvador and Honduras, going on to examine how moderate apparel unions in the two countries pursued plant-level coalitions with employers, exploiting employers’ fears of leftist unionism. He then assesses Brazilian left unions’ development of transnational strategies and networks, ranging from information exchange to joint industrial action. Next he explores how moderate automotive unions in Brazil and Argentina pursued micro-corporatist pacts with employers. Finally, Anner weighs up the future prospects for organized labour and broader implications for research into labour and other social movements.</p>
<p>Restructuring in both industries has been both extensive and profound. Production, once contained within a single factory, has been segmented into smaller units distributed transnationally, thereby removing one historical catalyst for unionization – hysical concentration (pp. 22–5) (see also, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012464421">Brady and Wallace, 2000</xref>). Global industrial restructuring has effectively disorganized labour, often in distinctive generational and gendered ways. Whereas the apparel industry has a predominantly low-paid, young, female and rarely unionized workforce, the automotive industry remains relatively highly paid and mostly unionized, with a preponderance of middle-aged, male workers. In the buyer-driven apparel industry, workers have borne the brunt of the relentless cost-cutting demanded by international retail giants, pressures intensified within the Export Processing Zones (EPZs) of both El Salvador and Honduras (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012464421">Gordon, 2000</xref>). The producer-driven automotive industry has been restructured internationally, towards a system of modular production (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012464421">Frigant and Lung, 2002</xref>), in which vehicle production is disaggregated into autonomous subsystems (modules): modular plants have considerably lower overall wages and unionization rates than traditional factories. Wages and unionization in segmented production regimes within both industries have been consistently lower than in traditional manufacturing, although other macro-level factors also influence these trends. Brazil and Argentina, more economically advanced when restructuring began than El Salvador and Honduras, have retained higher unionization and wages, while the prevailing political regime (for example, the anti-union governments of El Salvador) can also have a strong influence (pp. 35–51).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, segmentation has also opened up new possibilities, including new forms of local and transnational organization, albeit with recurrent problems such as the often tense relationships between women’s groups and male-dominated unions. The anti-sweatshop movement, in particular, has made impressive headway in the apparel industries of El Salvador and Honduras, where left unions have combined the ‘shaming’ of major international retailers with a range of initiatives, including both cross-national and local mobilization (pp. 59–85).</p>
<p>Moderate unions in both El Salvador and Honduras have used the threat posed by left unionism – the ‘radical flank effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012464421">Haines, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012464421">McAdam et al., 1996</xref>) – to instigate collaborative relationships with employers and governments. With the removal of the left threat, however, employers subsequently pursued union avoidance strategies and moderate unions lost membership. In Honduras, moderate unions, departing from past strategies, have made alliances with women’s groups and transnational organizations, while employers have set up company unions to defend against transnational campaigns (pp. 109–10).</p>
<p>Like the left apparel unions in El Salvador and Honduras, Brazil’s automotive left automotive unions have responded to global restructuring by increased transnational activism, concentrating their activities on major manufacturers such as Ford and Volkswagen. The Brazilian unions have focused on alliances with automotive unions in other countries, even being prepared to invest in programmes such as language training to establish long-term relationships. Moderate automotive unions in both Brazil and Argentina have adopted a very different strategy, based on micro-corporatist, plant-level collaboration with employers. Recognizing that neoliberal decentralization provided favourable conditions for micro- rather than their previous macro-corporatism, moderate unions have supported plant-level flexibility, thereby sidelining left unions – a strategy which has proved more successful for Argentine than for Brazilian moderate unions, given Argentina’s more favourable political, institutional and legal frameworks (pp. 164–5).</p>
<p>Anner concludes that, despite the trend of recent years towards global union strategies in a global economy, national and local organization remains vital. The four types of labour strategy delineate the alternatives open to workers and unions – between, on one hand, collaboration and nationalism which accepts market-oriented change and, on the other, transnational activism which challenges the logic of industrial restructuring. He admirably demonstrates the costs of persistent division within organized labour, long-standing political schisms having been exacerbated by the segmentation initiated by transnational production regimes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Latin American unions have had to deal with neoliberalism in several of its most aggressive forms, since as far back as 1973 and the original neoliberal onslaught in Chile. Yet that was a situation in which neoliberal policies were given virtually free rein. In contrast, the subsequent story of neoliberalism confirms its remarkable flexibility, through its adaptation to very different political-economic regimes, in defiance of its theoretical premises. The prevention of market exit (which extended to major automotive producers as well as to financial institutions) highlights perhaps the most glaring gap between neoliberal rhetoric and reality: the contrast between a hypothetical model of unfettered markets and the growing influence of big business on government decision-making – most importantly, the success of the ‘too big to fail’ argument. Perhaps neoliberalism’s greatest ideological achievement has been the discrediting of alternatives – which allows austerity programmes to be presented as the only way out of crisis. The most enduring achievement of neoliberalism in this respect is a world in which the pursuit of private capital accumulation has become not only acceptable but celebrated, through the erosion of alternatives. A crisis of neoliberalism as theory need not be a crisis for neoliberalism as ideology and practice.</p>
