<abstract>
<p>This paper seeks to help reconceptualize the spaces of local and regional economies by developing the idea of the ‘compound economy’. It is set in the context of a growing body of work in geography that emphasizes the importance of culture as a factor shaping differentiated local and regional economic development and, correspondingly, as an important dynamic informing the ability of localities and regions to negotiate economic forces operating at national and supranational scales. Exploring both dominant and counter-hegemonic economic imaginaries as articulated in academic debates, we draw on the case study of Central Wales and demonstrate how these imaginaries are variously manifested in government policy discourse of the National Assembly for Wales and in the understandings and practices of business stakeholders in the region. Through comparing and contrasting these representations, we provide an empirical illustration of what, building on the work of Gibson-Graham and others, we term the ‘compound economy’, whose drivers, relations and logics are far more diverse and complex than mainstream and alternative models tend to suggest. We conclude by assessing the implications of the compound economy for both economic policy and geographical theory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The last few years have seen growing emphasis on the importance of culture for political-economic analyses of variations in local and regional economic development. The origins of this emphasis lie in the ‘cultural’ and ‘post-structuralist’ turns taken within human geography during the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969776411431102">Barnett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969776411431102">Murdoch, 2006</xref>). These ‘turns’ challenged ‘hard political economy’ approaches that tended to reify ‘the economic’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969776411431102">Isaksen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969776411431102">Blotevogel and King, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969776411431102">Mendez and Caravaca, 1997</xref>), such as neoclassical economics and determinist forms of Marxism, arguing that human agency and experience were largely absent from the theoretical scripts of capitalist geographies and needed to be written ‘back in’. Consequently, a growing body of work has sought to position ‘culture’ as an important dynamic informing the ability of localities and regions to negotiate economic forces operating at national and supranational scales. Indeed, recent publications within this journal are indicative of the trend towards more culturally attuned accounts of urban/regional development. Significantly, the October 1999 issue of EURS focused on the interface between political economy and the cultural turn, and included contributions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969776411431102">Kirsten Simonsen (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969776411431102">Ash Amin (1999)</xref> that rendered problematic a culture/economic dichotomy. More recently, notable papers looking at culture and development include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969776411431102">Allan Williams’ (2009)</xref> consideration of the role of international migration and associated knowledge mobility in uneven development; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969776411431102">Novy’s (2011)</xref> insights into the relationship between changing national regimes of regulation, local regimes of accumulation and multiculturalism in Vienna; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969776411431102">Brereton et al.’s (2011)</xref> work on the changing appreciation of quality of life in rural Ireland and geographically variable allusions to local economic indicators.</p>
<p>Attempts by post-structuralists to write agency and experience ‘back in’ have involved three broad strategies. First, emphasis on the importance of discursive representational practices has encouraged us to explore and problematize the ways in which ‘the economic’ is represented, as characterized by particular values, activities and imperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969776411431102">Reynolds, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">2006</xref>). Second, and associatively, emphasis on the need to look beyond representation has urged us to focus on the extent to which ‘the economic’ is practised, performed and embodied in and through particular sites and bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969776411431102">Thrift, 2005</xref>).Third, attempts to de-centre political economy have encouraged us to think less in terms of absolutely hegemonic capitalist totalities and more in terms of fragmented and contested fields of force that contain opportunities for different development trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411431102">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Increasingly, stress is being placed on ways of thinking economies ‘otherwise’, and the possibilities of various non-, anti- and post-capitalist models of local and regional economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411431102">Williams and White, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Some political-economic geographers have responded to such ideas with hostility, suggesting that paying more attention to culture risks a neglect of more pertinent matters such as economic inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969776411431102">Ray and Sayer, 1999</xref>). Others, however, have become convinced of the need to forge new theoretical perspectives that take seriously the issues raised by the cultural turn while retaining the important insights that more established political-economic approaches can offer. Most notable in this respect has been the work of Bob Jessop, Ngai-Ling Sum and Martin Jones. In part inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969776411431102">Andrew Sayer (1995)</xref>, Jessop and Sum have developed a distinct ‘cultural political economy’ perspective (CPE), which attempts to bring together concepts and methodologies from critical political economy (specifically the regulationist school) with critical semiotic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969776411431102">Sum and Jessop, 2008</xref>). In turn, this perspective has been further developed and modified by Jones, who has advocated a ‘critical cultural political economy’ perspective (CCPE) whose aim is a ‘more systematic and sophisticated understanding of the reshaping of state spatiality (or state/space) in tandem with the semiotic turn implied by CPE’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411431102">Jones, 2008</xref>: 386). Common to both CPE and CCPE is the idea that taking culture seriously in political-economic analyses means ‘highlighting the complex relations between meanings and practices’, including the ‘co-evolution of semiotic and extra-semiotic processes and their conjoint impact in the constitution of capitalist social formations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411431102">Jones, 2008</xref>: 384).</p>
<p>Although such work has produced interesting and valuable insights into potential synergies between political-economic and cultural/post-structural analyses, thus far it has remained largely at a high level of abstraction, concerned predominantly with exploring and seeking to resolve ontological and epistemological tensions. The challenge remaining is for CPE, CCPE and related perspectives to become more grounded in the ‘messiness’ of real-world economic spaces (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969776411431102">Mann, 1996</xref>). Accordingly, this paper explores the potential for a culturally oriented analysis to offer new insights into ‘the local economy’ by drawing on the findings of a recent research project on <italic>cultures of local economy</italic> in a Celtic fringe region. Utilizing the concept of the ‘economic imaginary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">Jessop, 2004</xref>), we discuss the significance of differing representations of the local economy of Central Wales for conceptualizations of local and regional economies and economic space. In doing so, we seek to build on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411431102">Williams et al. (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North (2010)</xref> and others in developing the concept of the ‘<italic>compound economy</italic>’. The paper argues for the need to think less in terms of a binary that characterizes economies as either mainstream neoliberal capitalist <italic>or</italic> alternative counter-hegemonic, and more in terms of multiple drivers, relations and logics that combine in complex ways to produce, reproduce and transform local and regional economic space.</p>
<p>In the first part of the paper, we outline the theoretical significance of the ‘economic imaginary’, before exploring and critiquing the imaginaries that have extensively featured in political-economic and cultural-economic geography. We then consider the potential for recent thinking around the idea of the ‘diverse economy’ to provide a way of going beyond the problematic binary categories often implicit in such imaginaries, towards the concept of the <italic>compound economy</italic>. In the second part of the paper, we explore the economic imaginaries associated with the local economy of Central Wales, emphasizing the divergence between representations of the economy and its future in government policy documents and the economy as it is understood, performed and embodied by local actors. The paper concludes by elaborating the concept of the compound economy and considering the implications of our findings for public policy and, more broadly, their significance for the consideration of culture in political-economic analyses of economic localities.</p>

<title>Local economies: actualities and imaginaries</title>
<p>Culturally oriented political-economic perspectives such as CPE and CCPE have, amongst other things, problematized the ontological category of the ‘economy’ or the ‘economic’. Rather than accepting economy or economies as natural, pre-given and taken-for-granted arenas, Jessop and others have emphasized the extent to which these arenas are bound up with discursive representational practices and have encouraged exploration of how ‘the economic’ is represented as characterized by particular values, activities and imperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969776411431102">Reynolds, 1993</xref>). The economy, or, as Jessop terms it, the ‘actually existing economy’, is a fundamentally incomprehensible amalgam of activities. Chaotic and amorphous, this totality is such that it precludes any attempt at adequate description, a condition that renders it impassive to either guidance or governance <italic>in itself</italic>. Instead, economic governance is and must always be oriented towards distinct subsets of relations, which are themselves discursively imagined and represented. It is these ‘economic imaginaries’, constituted through semiosis, that are, and must always be, the terrains of economic governance.</p>
<p>This does not mean that economic imaginaries bear no relation to the terrain of the real or ‘actually existing economy’. On the contrary, according to Jessop, economic imaginaries ‘must have some significant, albeit necessarily partial correspondence to real material interdependencies in the actually existing economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">2004</xref>: 7). However, the biological limits to and structuring of human cognitive capacities, coupled with the biases of particular epistemes (historically periodized regimes of knowledge), mean that economic imaginaries are always ‘selectively defined’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They typically exclude elements – usually intentionally – that are vital to the overall performance of the subset of economic (and extra-economic) relations that have been identified. Such exclusions limit in turn the efficacy of economic forecasting, management, planning, guidance, governance, etc., because such practices do not (indeed, cannot) take account of excluded elements and their impact. Similar arguments would apply, with appropriate changes, to so-called meso- or micro-level economic phenomena, such as industrial districts or individual enterprises. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">Jessop, 2004</xref>: 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, economic imaginaries are the frames through which actors make sense of complex environments, constructing or ‘problematizing’ the economy as a terrain of intervention. Whereas the ‘actually existing economy’ is the chaotic sum of all economic activities, the ‘imaginary economy’ is what governance gives regard to and seeks to make other actors believe in.</p>
<p>Constructed and circulated through diverse projects and activities, the strategically selective fictional unities of economic imaginaries can be of a highly representative nature (for example, the production and circulation of analyses, visions and strategies) or more material in form (for example, the creation of programmes that teach economic actors how to be ‘entrepreneurial’). Key to this process are what Dixon and Hapke refer to as ‘discursive sites’ such as think tanks, media organizations and research centres, as well as specific state apparatuses where ‘ideas and concepts are brought together in the formulation of knowledge concerning the world, which is then disseminated via various means’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969776411431102">2003</xref>: 142).</p>
<sec id="section3-0969776411431102">
<title>Dominant economic imaginaries</title>
<p>Much of the work on economic imaginaries within the CPE school, from where the concept originated, has focused on what has been identified as the broad hegemonic imaginary of late Western capitalism. This imaginary represents the relative successes and failures of local economies according to levels of ongoing growth, specialization and interconnections with wider economic spaces. Here the spectre of the ‘global economy’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969776411431102">Cameron and Palan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969776411431102">Ottaviano, 2003</xref>) looms large, as does the ‘entrepreneurial region’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969776411431102">Kenney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411431102">Zhou and Xin, 2003</xref>), the ‘entrepreneurial city’ (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969776411431102">Hall and Hubbard, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969776411431102">1996b</xref>) and EU discourses of development (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969776411431102">Dunford and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969776411431102">Crescenzi, 2009</xref>). Foregrounding international markets, competitive dynamics and agglomerative tendencies at a global scale, this neoliberal paradigm has, through hegemonic insertion and consolidation across policy fields, effectively established itself as the ‘real’ economy.</p>
<p>Until the early 1990s the hegemony of this ‘particularly virulent strand of global capitalism’ seemed both ‘assured and unquestioned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411431102">Leyshon and Lee, 2003</xref>: 1), prompting claims that core Western economies had been subject to a ‘corporate takeover’ of all aspects of everyday life (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969776411431102">Hutton, 1995</xref>). At the outset of the 21st century, however, fissures began to appear in the image of the all-conquering neoliberal economic order, with critics challenging the pre-eminence of this model and its prescriptive capability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969776411431102">
<title>Counter-hegemonic imaginaries</title>
<p>Challenges to the broad neoliberal paradigm fall into two broad schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411431102">Leyshon and Lee, 2003</xref>). Although the distinction between them is inevitably somewhat artificial, it is also a useful heuristic device. On the one hand are critiques of a primarily ideological and theoretical bent that have sought to destabilize the discursive foundations of neoliberal capitalism from within; on the other hand, is work of a ‘more practical and performative nature, which has sought to demonstrate ways of enacting the economy otherwise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411431102">Leyshon and Lee, 2003</xref>: 5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, 2011</xref>). Within human geography in particular, these ideological and performative critiques have generated a multitude of counter-hegemonic economic imaginaries that – in bringing to light the ‘rich diversity of capitalist and non-capitalist practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 1996</xref>: xi) through which the ‘actual economy’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">Jessop, 2004</xref>) is comprised – have helped challenge ‘routinised categories and naturalised institutions, generate new subject positions and social forces and struggle for new projects and strategies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411431102">Jones, 2008</xref>: 385).</p>
<p>The obvious point of reference here is the work of Gibson-Graham, which has sought to read and represent economies for <italic>difference</italic> rather than dominance, envisioning economies as terrains of economic <italic>diversity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>: xxxi–xxxii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">2008</xref>: 2). Reading for economic difference means that the dominance of any particular economic form becomes ‘an open question rather than an initial presumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 3), facilitating ‘recognition of the always already diverse economic landscape in all geographical regions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>: 23). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink put it (2011</xref>: 30):
<disp-quote>
<p>The diverse economies framing broadens our conception of the economy. There are different kinds of transactions and multiple ways in which exchange is negotiated – not only formal market transactions, but alternative markets where considerations other than supply and demand influence the terms of exchange, and non-market exchanges and transactions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their work has been accompanied by a growing body of studies seeking to represent and foreground the enormous variety of economic practices that constitute economies worldwide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411431102">Williams and White, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411431102">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly notable in this respect is research on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969776411431102">Leyshon et al. (2003)</xref> refer to as ‘alternative economic spaces’, focusing on the ‘variety of ways in which people create and implement ways of practicing economic life shaped and directed through sets of social relations differentiated from – and in some cases opposed to – [the] mainstream’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969776411431102">2003</xref>: x). This research includes the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411431102">Peter North (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969776411431102">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411431102">North and Huber, 2004</xref>) on the Transition Movements seeking to steer localities towards sustainable post-peak-oil futures, and Gibson-Graham’s analyses of ‘community economies’, which, it is claimed, ‘resocialize’ economic relations in ways that are neither dogmatically capitalist nor dogmatically non-capitalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>). Such work has come on the back of earlier work on ‘fair trade’ and similar networks that seek to connect ‘first world’ consumers and ‘third world’ producers in the interests of global social justice and accountability. More widely, a burgeoning field of research is exploring various ‘alternative’ spaces of employment (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969776411431102">Williams, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411431102">2006</xref>), finance (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411431102">Lee, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969776411431102">Fuller and Mellor, 2008</xref>), retail (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969776411431102">Gregson and Crewe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411431102">Crewe et al., 2003</xref>) and other sites of socioeconomic exchange.</p>

<title>Beyond binary economic imaginaries</title>
<p>Work on both dominant and counter-hegemonic imaginaries has been useful in highlighting the significance of culture to political economy. Much of it has been concerned with the prevalence of alternative-market and non-market forms that contribute (whether positively or negatively) to social wellbeing across the globe and active attempts by local activists to promote and protect non-capitalist forms of economic exchange. As such, it has helped to challenge the contention that neoliberalism is ‘the only game in town’ and opened up possibilities of performance that can maintain and even expand alternative ways of ‘doing business’, as well as illustrating the extent to which economic exchange is itself socially and culturally embedded (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969776411431102">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>However, distinguishing between ‘mainstream’ and ‘alternative’ economies carries a danger, in that it can contribute to a form of binary thinking in which economies are represented as being either capitalist or ‘other’ or are seen as being ‘segmented’ into ‘capitalist’ and ‘non-capitalist’ practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411431102">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). This in turn has tended to be associated with a hierarchical reading of economy in which ‘other’ economies and economic practices have been positioned as marginal and relatively insignificant to the power of dominant neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969776411431102">Williams, 2009</xref>). Such binary thinking in large part reflects the extent to which much of the work on economic imaginaries is expressly ideological and future oriented, whether it advocates neoliberal transition models representing the necessity (if not the inevitability) of local economies based on entrepreneurialism, specialization and networking, or post-capitalist and post-peak-oil transition models advocating various forms of localism and low carbon economies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North, 2010</xref>). We are concerned that this binary is not necessarily helpful for grasping more fully and more accurately the (ultimately ungraspable) complexities of the actual economy (rather than its ideal or future forms).</p>
<p>As Williams and White have put it,’[t]he economic is far richer, heterogeneous and pluralistic than crude mainstream binary frameworks have allowed for’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411431102">Williams and White, 2010</xref>: 2). Diversity, points out Gibson-Graham, ‘exists not only in the domain of non-capitalist economic activity . . . capitalist enterprise is itself a site of difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411431102">2008</xref>: 23). In this sense, the notion of ‘capitalism’ or even ‘neoliberalism’ in the singular is misleading. Rather, it is more accurate and useful to think in terms of ‘capitalisms’ and ‘neo-liberalisms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969776411431102">Barnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>). Similarly, any distinctions drawn between ‘capitalist’ and ‘alternative’ economies should themselves be taken as starting points to be deconstructed rather than rigid ontological distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink 2011</xref>). This recognition of diversity and heterogeneity undergirds the remainder of this paper, which seeks to move CPE, CCPE and related approaches beyond binaries to more nuanced ways of thinking about cultures of local economy and their significance. To this end we suggest that local and regional economies could usefully be conceptualized as <italic>compound. Compound economies</italic> are characterized not by the purified forms of either the neoliberal imaginary or the many other ‘alternative’ counter-hegemonic imaginaries, but rather by a diversity of drivers, values and forms of exchange, which can be variously capitalist and non-capitalist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0969776411431102">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to begin the necessary task of elaborating this thread of culturally oriented political economy, we focus our attention on two aspects of local economy: first, the hegemonic or quasi-hegemonic imaginaries represented and articulated in public policy arenas, such as key policy and strategy documents; secondly, the situated knowledges of local economic actors, which tend to have been neglected in political economic analyses. What follows draws on the preliminary findings of an ongoing project examining the ‘local economy’ of Central Wales through analyses of key policy documents and interviews with key actors in the retail and commercial sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0969776411431102">2</xref></sup> After briefly outlining how the Welsh Assembly government has imagined the local economy of Central Wales, we explore the diversity and contradictions of the ‘actual economy’ of Central Wales and its implications for thinking through local economies more generally.</p>

<title>Methodological imperatives</title>
<p>Any attempt to meld ‘cultural’ and ‘political’ geographies in a manner that does justice to both research currents requires an iterative relationship between theory and empirics so as to avoid a descent into idealism. Encompassing narrativity, rhetoric and identity under the umbrella of semiosis (or the intersubjectivity of meaning), the CPE/CCPE approach is characterized by a great degree of methodological play when engaging with those practices that continually serve to (re)make social relations and the ‘ongoing realization of their extra-semiotic properties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">Jessop, 2004</xref>: 5). Key, however, is the use of grounded empirics or ‘thick description’ that can combine the spatial insights offered by post-structuralism with the well-established political-economy emphasis on causal mechanisms and ‘contingent necessities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411431102">Jessop, 2004</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>From this angle, and drawing strongly on the Marxist tradition, Jessop, Sum, Jones and others have highlighted the extent to which the forms, contradictions and crises of capitalism are articulated in key policy documents. Dissecting the <italic>Leitch Review of Skills</italic> as published by HM Treasury, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411431102">Jones (2008)</xref> makes a compelling case for viewing such exercises both as the state evidencing itself through the construction of terrains of intervention, and as the production of terrains that define the changing form and function of the state. Taking our cue from this prognosis, we similarly consider the Wales Spatial Plan, published by the Welsh Assembly government (WAG) in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969776411431102">WAG, 2004</xref>), as an item of discourse that envisions ‘Welsh space’ as a peculiar site of problems and solutions, challenges and opportunities, with regard to which the state has particular functions and roles. At once represented as a vision and a holistic strategy, it is intermingled with – but not reducible to – particular ideologies of the state and its territory.</p>

<title>Imagining Central Wales through the Wales Spatial Plan</title>
<p>The Wales Spatial Plan (WSP), adopted by the National Assembly of Wales in November 2004, sets out a broad vision for the development of Wales, imagined as a coherent economic, social and environmental territory. Determining the need to shape ‘Welsh answers to Welsh questions’, it fashions a set of coherences structured around six local economies, all of which are seen to be in need of ‘economic development’ in the face of long-term economic restructuring and the challenges posed by ‘globalization’.</p>
<p>One of these local economies is Central Wales. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0969776411431102">Figure 2</xref>, Central Wales is the largest of the six localities delineated by the WSP, bordering England to the east and Ireland to the west, with the towns of Denbigh and Carmarthen representing its northern and southern extents respectively. As such, the strengths of the local economy are represented as a distinct blend of environmental, social, cultural and economic characteristics whose ‘intimate relationship’ makes the Central Wales Spatial Plan Area ‘the heartland of rural life and one of the storehouses of Wales’, particularly in terms of environmental capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969776411431102">WAG, 2008</xref>: 50). Alongside these strengths, however— and according to the WSP—, are significant economic weaknesses, namely a high level of self-employment and a lack of small business growth. These weaknesses, in turn, are attributed to peripherality and the lack of an effective internal and cross-border communication infrastructure.</p>

<p>Measures to help the local economy improve its economic position both absolutely and relative to other economies of Wales have been set out in the Central Wales Strategy (CWS). The strategy, agreed by key ‘stakeholders’, including the Welsh Assembly government and local authorities, and representatives from the environment, business, voluntary, education and health sectors, sets out several priorities for the successful development of the Central Wales economy. Key amongst these priorities are:</p>
<list id="list1-0969776411431102" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>creating higher value-added production opportunities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improving transport and communication links;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>cross-border cooperation with other regions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>According to the CWS, this will facilitate a critical mass of population and a significant growth in business activity, which in turn will underpin the ‘creation of a modern economy, which utilizes and develops the skills and knowledge of its people, linking economic ambition to rural areas [which is] vital for the sustainable future of Central Wales’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969776411431102">WAG, 2008</xref>: 59).</p>
<p>True to the discursive economic subtext of the WSP, the CWS is a model born out of a particular set of ideas regarding the relative (ill) health of both the Welsh economy considered as a whole and the ‘local economies’ therein. These judgements have been levelled on the basis of evaluations using particular indices that reciprocally enforce assumptions regarding not only the need for policy intervention but also its substance and spatialities. Key amongst these mutually reinforcing evaluations and assumptions are the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0969776411431102" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A high-proportion of self-employment is evidence of economic weakness and a hindrance to significant business growth</p>
<p>– business growth is vital for sustainable economic prosperity within Central Wales.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Poor external transport links and an underdeveloped infrastructure for information and communications technology are major contributors to marginalization of the area from wider economic markets</p>
<p>– engagement with wider markets is crucial to a sustainable regional economy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distance from wider markets, coupled with a population of insufficient size to form a ‘critical mass’, makes the region unattractive to inward investment</p>
<p>– the economies of Wales will prosper only if they can attract significant inward investment;</p>
<p>– increased commercial competition is a positive force.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As a future-oriented model for economic success, the CWS vision of Central Wales is a firmly mainstream economic imaginary: broadly neoliberal in orientation and emphasizing the need for greater growth, agglomeration and sectoral integration. In the next section of this paper, we compare and contrast this imaginary with the knowledges, practices and aspirations of the local economic actors it aims to guide and direct. First, we identify collective instances in which business stakeholders articulated ideas that fitted or otherwise supported the economic imaginary of the CWS in the context of transport and communication. Subsequently, however, we show how these ‘mainstream’ ideas regarding transport and communication are cross-cut and complicated by ideas about competition, stability and success, while also being out of step with alternative/localist, low-/zero-growth, low carbon and sustainable economic models. Consequently, we argue that the local economy of Central Wales is best imagined not in terms of the extent to which it can be traced onto either the ‘mainstream’ or the ‘alternative’ but rather as a <italic>compound</italic>, which contains elements of both and further ingredients besides. In the final section of the paper, we then suggest that the concept of the ‘compound economy’ might serve as a way of opening up an analytical middle ground for more general consideration of local economies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969776411431102">
<title>Imagining Central Wales through local knowledge and practice</title>
<p>A core component of the CWS is improvement of transport and communication links. This reflects the extent to which peripherality is perceived as a major factor in the lack of economic development in Central Wales (or, more specifically, the capacity for Central Wales to compete vis-à-vis ‘more connected’ spaces). With a large area of northern Wales being served by the ‘A55 corridor’, connecting the English north-west to Ireland via the port of Holyhead, and much of southern Wales falling into the so-called ‘M4 corridor’, Central Wales (served by the relatively slow, narrow and winding A470) finds itself at a particular disadvantage in terms of major intra- and inter-regional transport arteries. According to the CWS, this renders the region relatively unattractive to inward investment and otherwise inhibits commercial expansion, particularly in the case of businesses dependent upon bulk haulage in their supply chains. This mainstream thinking is prevalent amongst many local stakeholders, such as this general manager of a sizeable manufacturing firm.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We have explored the possibility of using rail freight, but there is not the capacity on the existing line . . . We use a haulage company from the English border, where our supply hub is, and in an ideal world the factory would be there – down the central corridor – to save costs. However, we are not and that is a disadvantage for us. Also, the road link across Central Wales is not the best, and I would hazard a guess that they are not going to build a motorway across Central Wales. Distribution is a significant cost [and] we have the philosophy that we have got to do things more efficiently than anybody in order to survive because of our locality. There is no way we could manufacture a cheap and cheerful product on this site. Our product is premium, which warrants a premium price and can support slightly higher distribution costs.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With distance from markets and the poor quality of existing rail and road links seen as major economic hurdles, many stakeholders emphasized the need for the Central Wales economy to be better integrated with national and international markets. This ‘mainstream’ mindset, for example, was evident in the plans of a company to broker shared transport agreements with other organizations.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘We do have this problem in this part of Wales in terms of distribution, and we need to get together to sort it out. For businesses in Wales to succeed and compete with our counterparts in England we have got to have better distribution mechanisms . . . This means those relatively few large companies that are here have to share loads, and organize their ingoing and outgoings together.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mainstream thinking was also evident in the degree to which stakeholders highlighted an apparent lack of critical mass in the commercial and manufacturing sectors, with difficulties attributed to physical distance and the poor state of existing transport networks being compounded by a lack of production capacity. This issue was raised, for example, by the director of a local transport company:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘There is little by way of manufacturing in Central Wales, and I doubt there ever can be. Because of this, transport firms generally can’t get loads in both directions, which they need to make a good level of profit. For this reason a lot of firms stay well clear of the area.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, mainstream thinking was far less in evidence when it came to local thinking regarding the role of information technologies in overcoming the problems of peripherality and facilitating business growth. Mainstream thinking suggests that information technology, in particular broadband Internet, is a key means through which local businesses can overcome or reduce the friction of distance in order to compete successfully within wider markets. In Central Wales, however, the potential of information technologies, particularly the Internet, to facilitate business growth was seen to be very limited. The factors limiting the potential of information technologies were identified as comparatively underdeveloped transport infrastructure acknowledged as a consequence of, and determinant for, a lack of critical mass in the Central Wales economy. In other words, what on the one hand appeared to be mainstream thinking about transport and communications, on the other hand veered very much outside the mainstream:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Yeah, the Internet has definitely helped our business grow, delivering parcels that people have bought on Amazon and other Internet sites. But it won’t necessarily help those existing local businesses that sell these goods already. They have got more competition, and their ability as small businesses to compete via the Internet, if you like, is not as strong. They still have to pay to send their products out, and they will not get the same cheap rates as companies who are based near other companies, larger cities and motorways.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such assertions question widespread assumptions about the capacity of the Internet to aid the ‘growth’ of businesses dealing in tangible goods and that people based in peripheral areas will necessarily seek to engage with wider markets via mail order Internet sales. It could also be seen as an example of ‘immanent’ localization; that is, localization based not on environmental and ethical considerations but in response to market forces and the costs associated with geographical distance and peripherality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969776411431102">
<title>Growth and stability</title>
<p>One of the traders we spoke with had made use of the Internet as a means of developing a wider client base. A partner in an instrument, sheet music and CD retailer outlined a growth in sales on the back of enquiries generated via mail order and, more significantly, a corporate website:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘In terms of being in an out-of-the-way place, mail order has made this less of an issue, and even more so with the advent of the Internet . . . We have a worldwide presence through a website that reaches out to a far bigger audience than you were 20 years ago when people would simply look in the yellow pages. But the Internet for us is not so important in terms of people ordering online as it is a direct point of contact . . . It is an information conduit and not necessarily a shop window . . . Also, you have to remember we are sending out sheet music and pay the same to send out envelopes via Royal Mail as anybody else would across the UK. But for musical instruments, we simply can’t compete with larger cut-price outlets that ship stuff out from central depots.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Internet was felt to be a means of overcoming distance for national and international sales of specialized Welsh choral arrangements and scores, but with the proviso of expertise in a niche market and competitive distribution costs. Demonstrating ‘mainstream’ thinking insofar as it points to competition and specialization, further conversation brought out criticism of other businesses within this sector that had floundered as a result of strategies that were overly competitive and growth oriented:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Within the industry there have been many larger chains of shops who have gone all out to capture business – particularly [company], who had about 30 shops across the UK and slashed their profit margins in order to take 70% of the market . . . Now when the economic climate changed and rents went up, they simply did not have a buffer to survive . . . For us, although we have lost out in terms of Internet sales of high-cost instruments, we are not competing on the same high street, and are somewhat sheltered for that reason.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This disparagement of an ‘all or bust’ commercial mentality, and the crisis-ridden economy for which it is seen to be responsible, went alongside an emphasis on the significance of geographical peripherality coupled with peripherality in terms of the density of economic exchanges. In this sense, small businesses in Central Wales (and, by extension, other so-called marginal regions) were seen as being ‘sheltered’ from the economic peaks and troughs and the extremes of competition that characterize an economy ‘outside’:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘The downside of being a business in mid-Wales is that we don’t see the extreme highs that the cities generate. On the plus side, come the downturn – like we are experiencing now – the market is generally much more stable. We don’t get the highs and lows; the business stays on a much more even keel.’ (Building supplies firm)</p>
<p>‘[Town in Central Wales] is unique really in my opinion, because it enables independents like myself to establish businesses from nothing. In places like Manchester and Birmingham you’re surrounded by competition and it’s difficult to find a little area; here, you can find it. However, if you want to expand your business you meet problems . . . There is only so big an audience for your product, in cities it is that much bigger, but there are also many more concerns doing what you do.’ (Sandwich shop)</p>
<p>‘We have a stable market where we are more or less the only musical instrument shop in this part of Wales, and people don’t mind paying an extra £20 if they get a personal service and can come and physically touch the product before they buy.’ (Music shop)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accentuating stability above all other considerations, notably economic expansion, statements such as these stand in stark contrast to a growth-defined mainstream imaginary and resonated with key tenets of many ‘alternative’ economy visions. This emphasis on mid-to-long-term survival was often premised on a close-knit working relationship with the local population, which, as far as the traders were concerned, ensured that local businesses knew what customers needed and wanted. It was felt that the community in turn had an allegiance to local traders and sought opportunities to shop and spend within their localities where they could do so. Local traders felt that national chains could not lay claim to such relationships and allegiances, and this was identified as a factor in their lack of resilience on the high street. As one shop-owner put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘We know exactly what is going out of the door and how much is coming in, whereas bigger companies like [recently defunct high street chain], they’re just interested in turnover. The smaller guy knows that . . . put in the window, a certain item will make so much money and be bought by one of a number of regular customers. If something is going to make less, or not sell, you won’t touch it . . . Chain stores, while they no doubt do their homework and know what sorts of things sell, they bung them on the shelf in all their stores across the country.’ (Men’s clothing shop)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sharing a belief in the overriding importance of turning a profit and the need to constantly explore new ways of increasing profitability, the majority of our respondents were at the same time keen to stress their role in providing a service and contributing to the economic vitality of the local environment. Balancing mainstream and alternative economic thinking, success was more often than not equated with stability, and the potential benefits of expansion were often measured against the dangers of losing touch with core markets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969776411431102">
<title>Success and resilience</title>
<p>Many traders stressed the social embeddedness of both their business and themselves in the local community alongside the difficulties and dangers of expanding into (and on the terms of) the economy ‘outside’. Business achievement was seldom articulated in the language of the size and number of trading premises, growing employee numbers or an increasing product range without reference to survival and resilience:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Our success in business is we don’t owe anybody anything, apart from our suppliers [and] we like to think we are giving a good service. We are not too interested in expansion because then you have to start employing people, and then health and safety issues start coming in . . . It’s so much easier to stay as you are and make a tidy living in [Central Wales town] – because you <italic>can</italic> make a tidy living here. Why risk expansion?’ (Men’s clothing shop)</p>
<p>‘We are in business, and growth would be nice; it is something we don’t look to stop and we are always looking to increase our business. You have to. But to fixate on growth and take your eye off the ball in terms of what you have already got is a disaster. . . . There are four of us here who work full time, and all four of us own our own tiny little homes. We are in a business that looks to remain secure so that we don’t have to worry about whatever mortgages we have. It is not about getting a new Bentley in five years’ time. We have good employment in a business we love, and as long as the business continues with a little bit of growth to cover inflation, rises in living costs and utility bills, we won’t complain. Expansion is not the goal, security is’. (Music shop)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Demonstrating an appreciation of autonomy, a high degree of attachment to place, local ownership and a sense of a long-term financial and emotional investment, these statements are clearly allied to elements of ‘alternative’ economy and the ‘community economy’ outlined by Gibson-Graham. It would, however, be wrong to assume that such thinking was manifest in a taciturn approach to business growth and relationships with their client base. Rather, these different elements were seen to be intimately entangled with one another:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘In the present financial climate, success is survival. And knowing that we give a good service. And I don’t mean fawning to customers, but that the customer has got what they want; that they are extremely satisfied with the way that they got it; that they know that we have not simply gone out to sell them a product and get the money in the till; that we have taken the time to make sure that what they have purchased is the right thing for them . . . And, as a consequence, they are likely to remain loyal and come back again – something that is again helped by the fact that we are <italic>the</italic> music specialist in this part of the country.’ (Music shop)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A complex narrative, this account is one that, like the majority of those statements gathered during the fieldwork process and quoted in this paper, does not fit easily with either ‘mainstream’ or ‘alternative’ economic imaginaries. Prioritizing responsibility for the customer base, it demonstrates an ethical bent that fits with alternative economic imaginaries, although the rationale behind this is also one of maintaining and stimulating trade. Conversely, to position geographical peripherality as a positive force for safeguarding a stable (if small) consumer base is a validation more attuned to mainstream economic imaginaries. In a nuanced view of the local economy, the traders we talked to acknowledged the importance of providing a service to their client base but also of the commercial survival of their business. This routine attitude appears to be part and parcel of a more extensive discourse within which representatives of the retail and commercial sectors in Central Wales position their outlooks and actions variously within, and in relation to, aspects of mainstream and community economic imaginaries.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion: towards imagining local economies otherwise</title>
<p>The preceding discussion, we suggest, indicates a potentially fruitful direction of travel for the study of culture and economy. The growing body of work exploring the importance of culture as a dynamic in the relationship between localities and the wider economic forces in which they are entwined has produced interesting and valuable insights into potential synergies between political economic and cultural/post-structural analyses. However, approaches such as CPE and CCPE, as well as the wider work on cultures of economy, have tended to be characterized by a strong degree of binary thinking, on the one hand emphasizing and unpacking the importance of hegemonic, ‘mainstream’ neoliberal imaginaries, on the other hand counterpointing them with ‘alternative’ imaginaries characterized by radically different and oppositional practices and values. The (admittedly nascent) research outlined in this paper indicates that ‘real’ local and regional economies are likely to be far more diverse and complex than is widely appreciated.</p>
<p>Our empirical findings suggest that the ‘local economy’ of Central Wales or – in the vernacular of the WSP – ‘Central Wales’ does not entirely resemble either of the imaginaries sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969776411431102">Figure 1</xref>. Rather, it is characterized by a host of different and sometimes conflicting drivers, logics and imperatives. Some of these characteristics are in tune with – or at least not antithetical to – the characteristics attributed to the regional economy by the WSP. Other apparent characteristics, however, are in distinct contrast. This economy is thus, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0969776411431102">Figure 3</xref>, both ‘mainstream’ and ‘alternative’ at the same time.</p>

<p>This suggests the need, as Gibson-Graham, Williams and others have urged, to think of local and regional economies in terms that go beyond such binary categories as ‘capitalist’/‘non-capitalist’, ‘mainstream’/‘alternative’. To this end, Gibson-Graham introduced the concept of the ‘community’ economy, which is characterized by configurations of practice that are variously capitalist and non-capitalist, mainstream and alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>). However, we suggest that this conception is not adequate to reflect the complexity and diversity apparent in contemporary regional and local economies, in large part because it is normative and future oriented. For Gibson-Graham, the ‘community economy’ is a particular <italic>type</italic> of economy that combines ‘community’ and ‘economy’ in order to ‘resocialize’ economic relations, with economic decisions made in the light of ethical considerations, and that Gibson-Graham posits as an ‘other’ of the ‘real economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the ‘compound economy’ is far broader both conceptually and, potentially, in practice; although a compound economy might be a community economy, it equally could be characterized by economic relations that are, to adopt Gibson-Graham’s terminology, ‘un-socialized’ and ‘non-ethical’. The economy of Central Wales, for example, is partially characterized by degrees of localism and localization that reflect alternately, and sometimes both, responses to market forces (immanent localization, empty of normative content) and decisions to prioritize sustainability and local population needs (intentional localization, which is explicitly normative) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411431102">North, 2010</xref>). In this paper, we are looking to make a case not for new <italic>practices</italic> of the economy but rather for new ways of thinking about the (changing) cultures of local economy and their significance for policy and theory. Our concerns are thus primarily in the realms of description and theorization rather than – as with much of the work on the ‘alternative’ and ‘community’ economy – normative and future oriented.</p>
<p>Given this, we suggest that local and regional economies might usefully be conceptualized as <italic>compound. Compound economies</italic> are characterized not by the purified forms of either the neoliberal imaginary or the many other ‘alternative’ counter-hegemonic imaginaries, but rather by a diversity of drivers, values and forms of exchange. These can be variously capitalist/non-capitalist, mainstream/alternative, or any of the many ‘sub-species’ of activity that are glossed by such terms.</p>
<p>As a concept, the compound economy is empty of empirical content. The precise characteristics of local and regional economies must be ascertained through grounded study, as with the (ongoing) work outlined here. In conceptualizing economies as compound, we are thus in no way seeking to foreclose debate on the real-world characteristics of local and regional economies and economic development. Rather, as with the work of Gibson-Graham and others, we are offering a theoretical tool that, we hope and anticipate, makes it easier to imagine the economy otherwise, reading it for difference rather than dominance while avoiding a collapse into positivist ‘description’ or empirical abstraction.</p>
<p>The notion of a <italic>compound economy</italic> is significant for both practice and theory. The relative success or failure of economic governance hinges to some degree at least on the degree of ‘fit’ between the (inevitably idealized) imaginary and the ‘real’ economy being addressed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969776411431102">Jessop, 1997</xref>). Too wide a gap is likely to lead to governance failures. In the case of Central Wales, for example, the imaginaries, knowledges and practices of the local actors helping to constitute that economy suggest that, whereas in some aspects the ‘imagined’ and the ‘real’ are close together, in other – significant – aspects they diverge. This is likely to limit the usefulness of the WSP, the CWS and the wider economic development programmes of the Welsh Assembly government as tools of governance. Conceived in terms of, and designed to act through, a neoliberal ‘mainstream’ economy, they are relevant in terms of only <italic>some</italic> aspects of <italic>some</italic> economic actors and activities. In this sense, the CWS and those other policy interventions produced by the Welsh Assembly government (all of which must, by statute, tie in with the project that is the WSP) will be impeded by a conceptual lack of fit with the perceptions and actions of those stakeholders performing the local economy on the ground, stakeholders that the Welsh Assembly looks to act through in driving economic change and development. The value of the CWS and the wider strategic thinking of WAG for economic development in Wales is, then, very much open to question. In turn, this similarly leaves open to question the value of comparable visions and strategy for regions and localities elsewhere, and suggests the need for policy-makers and other ‘big’ economic actors to reflect on and review the imaginaries through which they envision and construct strategies for local and regional economic development. How proximal, it might be asked, are the worlds envisioned in policy and strategy documents to the worlds they aspire to govern, and at what point does the degree of distance between them render policy and strategy relevant or irrelevant, practical or impractical, useful or harmful? Such vital questions are particularly relevant in the context of recent economic turbulence and the so-called ‘credit crunch’, when strategies of economic recovery and development hinging on mainstream imaginaries, particularly those centred on competitiveness, growth and engagement with wider markets, may conceivably have the effect of <italic>undermining</italic> the resilience of local and regional economies, particularly in geographically peripheral regions such as Central Wales.</p>
<p>Further, and more pertinent for the key concerns of this paper, the notion of the compound economy might prove useful in taking forward research into economic imaginaries and, by extension, further developing and elaborating the cultural approaches to political economy taken by ‘schools’ such as CPE and CCPE. Although their concern is with understanding and exploring the extent to which the production (and contestation) of representational forms and meaning are entangled with the materialities of the economy, advocates of such schools have been at pains to emphasize the importance of holding onto the ‘harder’ aspects of political economy approaches. Perhaps in contrast, our concern is that the already apparent emphasis on materiality is matched by a suitably robust and sophisticated approach to representation. As Jones puts it: ‘The trick is to find the basis for a dialogue or synthesis between them without folding “the economic” into discourses and cultures to obscure affects, and vice versa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411431102">2008</xref>: 383). Part of this ‘trick’ must involve seeking to move CPE, CCPE and related approaches beyond binary categories, towards more nuanced ways of thinking about cultures of local economy and their significance. The diversity and complexity of ‘the real’ must be taken into account if we are to adequately apprehend the worlds we are seeking to represent, reflect on and potentially intervene in.</p>
<p>If we take seriously the contention that researchers are, at least as much as anyone else, active participants in the reproduction and transformation of economic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>), then, theoretically, the concept of the compound economy is an example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411431102">Leyshon and Lee (2003)</xref> have referred to as ‘performing the economy otherwise’ and is suggestive of the need to develop more sophisticated and nuanced models and conceptualizations of the local economy ‘at work’. At present, cultural approaches to political economy are not just heavily capitalocentric but also monopolistically neoliberal-centric, in that they tend to work on the assumption that neoliberalism is, if not ‘the only game in town’, then a hegemonic presence. Conversely, studies that stress the ‘alternatives’ on offer tend to discount the significance of the capitalistic practices with which they can be entwined, as well as being often normative, future oriented and particularistic in appeal. The value of the ‘<italic>compound economy</italic>’ concept is that it neither presumes nor denies the presence of particular modes, logics and drivers of economic life, but rather orients thinking in terms of the temporally and geographically specific configurations of ‘capitalist’ and ‘non-capitalist’ cultures that are characteristic of ‘real-world’ economies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969776411431102">Gibson-Graham, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411431102">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411431102">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Only by apprehending the specifics and variety of these configurations can theory and practice adequately help us consider the relationships between the worlds of the real and the imagined and perhaps work towards closing the gap between them.</p>
