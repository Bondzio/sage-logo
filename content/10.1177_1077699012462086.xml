<p>Chris Roush’s <italic>Show Me the Money: Writing Business and Economics Stories for Mass Communication</italic> is designed as a textbook for schools of journalism and business schools, offering conceptual guidance and practical examples to students and even to professional journalists on how to write on business and economics for modern mass media. It is a timely contribution in the current environment of academic criticism of the role of investigative and analytical journalism in missing the warning signs of the global financial crisis and serious misconduct by Western financial institutions.</p>
<p>This criticism has amplified as the public in the United States and the United Kingdom continue to learn about the unhealthy and sometimes outright dirty business practices of some major Wall Street players. The book is written in classic journalist style with a number of real-life stories and short case studies to keep the readers intrigued and illustrate the work of business journalists in various professional situations.</p>
<p>Roush is a Walter E. Hussmann Sr. Distinguished Scholar in business journalism at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill and a founding director of the Carolina Business News initiative. He is a veteran journalist with experience working with influential media outlets from <italic>St. Petersburg Times</italic> and <italic>Business Week</italic> to <italic>Bloomberg News</italic>, and with a goodly number of other assignments under his professional belt. The main goal of his book is to fill the gap in professional business reporting and business journalism as, he writes, “…higher education and mass communication have failed miserably in effectively training journalists for careers in business reporting.”</p>
<p>The issues of business writing and examples of high-profile case studies of large corporate deals, spectacular failures and particularly the global financial crisis have been well covered since the beginning of the global economic downturn in 2008 (Natalie Canavor and Claire Meirowitz, 2009; Ken Davis, 2010; Harvard Business School Press, 2011; Mark W. Tatge, 2010; Terri Thompson, 2000). Yet the author believes that his book can offer some additional insights and valuable suggestions to help to prepare the next generation of students to be better equipped for dealing with economic issues and nailing those Wall Street sharks who disregard business ethics and the interests of society.</p>
<p>The sixteen chapters of this book can be subdivided into three sections. Chapters 1–4 cover some general issues and ethics of business journalism. The author highlights how at certain points in journalism history, U.S. reporters ignored major developments in the business world or became too cozy with it. Therefore, they were unprepared to fulfill the role of public watchdogs in difficult economic times by conducting deep economic research and producing comprehensive high-quality analytical materials. In fact, according to his data, “92 percent of executives and 72 percent of journalists and journalism academics were concerned about a reporter’s knowledge of the businesses they were covering.” Besides raising concerns about the need for better business writing education, the author introduces some ideas about “mining for stories” in different business sectors from banking and manufacturing to technology, new media, and investments.</p>
<p>The second section (Chapters 5–13) uses major business case studies and breaking stories to illustrate various opportunities in covering business and economic developments in professional settings. Among practical issues the author discusses the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission, focusing on the meaning of SEC filings for companies and their importance for investigative journalists in business analysis. Using examples from recent corporate mergers he also discusses how mergers work and how to identify different types of merger and to cover them in business media outlets. In addition, he allows the reader to take a look inside the major activities of Wall Street brokers, bankers and dealmakers, revealing some colorful details and tips on finding key sources and materials for breaking stories.</p>
<p>The third section (Chapters 14–16) deals mainly with the latest developments related to the global financial crisis—from the real estate bubble to the role of government and financial regulators in tackling major economic problems in the United States. These have become some of our most discussed issues, attracting the interest and attention of the general public and generating hot debate among all political groups in the United States and around the world. The author unveils major issues that emerged during the financial meltdown and using a range of examples illustrates how to use court papers, government regulatory documents, and various banking statements and financial reports to track business dynamics and produce strong analytical articles. Chapter 16 provides practical recommendations on how to use new media in business reporting and in investigative writing, supplemented with a quite comprehensive list of Internet resources useful for beginners as well as for experienced journalists in preparing their articles and investigating major business cases. Unfortunately this chapter is somewhat descriptive and does not discuss the latest trends in new media journalism.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of <italic>Show Me the Money</italic> lies in the author’s ability to utilize his personal experience and observations to illustrate the field work of business journalists, narrating techniques for covering the business world and economic issues from different angles. This same approach does, however, also become the book’s weakness; in compiling the text as a collection of empirical and analytical stories, Roush misses the opportunity to ground the work in theoretical approaches to better explain the peculiarities of contemporary business journalism. Neither does he delve into the different economic schools of thought, which compete with each other in explaining business development and the mechanisms and causes of the global financial crisis. It would be extremely useful to explore this topic, as business journalists increasingly contribute to the polarization of the general public in their views of economic development and remedies to overcome major glitches in the American and global economies.</p>
<p>Overall, Roush’s work should be considered as important and useful classroom reading material, serving to stimulate curiosity among students and helping to develop a better understanding of how business journalism works and how to deal with major business issues.</p>
