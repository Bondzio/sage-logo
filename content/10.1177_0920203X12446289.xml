<abstract>
<p>This article questions the idea of a Chinese model. It argues that the so-called Chinese model is a variant of neoauthoritarian development associated with the developmental experience of other Eastern Asian states. What distinguishes China is the revolutionary experience – ignored by both Chinese and non-Chinese promoters of the Chinese model idea – that has left its mark on post-revolutionary development. Admiration for the authoritarian China model idea is voiced most audibly by those who place efficient development ahead of all other considerations, including democracy and social justice. These voices include apologists for the corporate neoliberal model that combines organizational authoritarianism with market ‘freedom’, as well as educational institutions that emulate corporate models, and serve as willing instruments of the Chinese regime’s search for ‘soft power’. Competing ‘models’ within China itself provide prima facie evidence of an unsettled search for sustainable development that reconciles the ideological goals of the regime with the realities of participation in a global capitalist economy. Indeed, if there is a ‘China model’, its most outstanding characteristic is the willingness to experiment with different models.</p>

<body>
<p>I would like to take up in this discussion some questions thrown up by the idea of a ‘Chinese model’. As far as I am aware the idea of a model originated from foreigners of various stripes anxious to discover a categorical encapsulation of Chinese development, to be embraced subsequently by Chinese leaders and writers anxious to establish a developmental identity of China’s own. The term itself has appeared with increasing frequency over the last decade among both Chinese scholars and foreign observers of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Against the continued economic difficulties faced by the United States, Europe, and Japan, the seeming success of the PRC in weathering the world recession since 2008 has enhanced the significance of the ‘model’, giving it all the trappings of official discourse.</p>
<p>There is a suggestion in this official discourse, and among those who serve as its voices, of a model that is not only superior to the reigning neoliberal orthodoxy, promoted most enthusiastically by the United States and United Kingdom, but also, given the remarkably rapid development of the PRC over the last three decades, to the development path pioneered by Euro/American societies since the origins of capitalist modernization in the 18th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0920203X12446289">1</xref></sup> Yet, what this model consists of and how it may be translated into different social and political contexts remains quite vague. It is not very helpful, as such self-serving claims suggest, that as the idea has acquired prominence, it has become the subject of political manipulation by both opponents and proponents of the communist regime in China and abroad, as well as those who benefit from China’s development, or hope to do so, and those who suffer the consequences of policies associated with the idea.</p>
<p>There are methodological problems as well. The laundry list approach that characterizes most discussions simply draws on a variety of policies pursued by the regime to render what may be contingent responses into a model, with its suggestion of conscious design, so that even ‘pragmatism’, which resists such categorization, is rendered into the terms of the discourse. At the other extreme are obscurantist references to exceptional Chinese characteristics that by definition rule out the possibility of Chinese development serving as a model of any kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0920203X12446289">2</xref></sup> Only occasionally is there any kind of effort to distil from a wide array of shifting practical policies an account of the structural premises coherent enough to justify the use of the term ‘model’. Even then, there is a conspicuous absence of attention to the historical circumstances that may be crucial to understanding the ideological and practical forces that have guided the development of Chinese society.</p>
<p>These considerations guide the discussion here. Three questions are of particular interest in this discussion. First, what significance do we attribute to the idea of a model in the contemporary world, especially with respect to the deployment of the idea of models within a Chinese political discourse. Second, what might be the features of a so-called Chinese model? And, finally, in what sense might this model be appealing to others, especially over the neoliberal model of a market economy theoretically unfettered by social and political intervention but also in its own right, as a socialist path of development? I will conclude with a brief commentary on the relevance of ‘Chinese Marxism’ to the official conceptualization of China’s development of the model and its implications as a global idea.</p>
<sec id="section1-0920203X12446289">
<title>Global modernity and the Chinese model</title>
<p>The idea of a Chinese model may refer to a model of development that is peculiar to China, appropriate to the particular circumstances of Chinese society. Or it may be understood in more universalistic terms, as a model open to emulation by others, in which case its relevance transcends the boundaries of Chinese society.</p>
<p>The distinction is an important one, even if it is ignored in most references to the Chinese model. If the model is a product of the particular circumstances of Chinese society, the implication is that it may not be emulated by others, or may be emulated only with adjustment to different circumstances and needs. This is indeed the way the Chinese experience as an example for others has been understood in Chinese political discourse going back to the 1940s. Within Marxism and the history of socialist revolutions, the Chinese Revolution was the first (if not the only) one to insist on the necessity of articulating the universalist discourse of theory to concrete local circumstances, as is clearly implied by principles encapsulated in such phrases as ‘Making Marxism Chinese’ (马克思主义的中国化), ‘Chinese-style socialism’ (中国式的社会主义) or, most recently, ‘Socialism with Chinese characteristics’ (有中国特色的社会主义). The strategy of revolution or development expressed by these phrases – alternative Chinese models – distinguished the Chinese path not only from capitalist societies but also from other socialisms, most importantly that of the Soviet Union while it existed. There has been a sense all along that the experience of the Chinese Revolution was relevant to all societies placed similarly to China in global politics, so-called ‘semi-feudal and semi-colonial’ societies, which in an earlier day made China a part of both the Second and the Third Worlds. But throughout, the Chinese experience provided not a path to be followed but an example of articulating the universal to the particular, or translating the global to the local, which called upon others to find <italic>their</italic> own paths by following a similar procedure. This idea of a revolutionary practice that necessarily integrated universal principles with concrete local circumstances distinguished the path of revolution not only from one national context to another but also applied to different localities within the same nation. The ‘vernacularization’ of Marxism has been one of the significant contributions of the Chinese Revolution to Marxist theory. Despite significant transformations over the years, it has characterized Chinese Marxism throughout, in Maoist as well as post-Maoist Marxism. This attitude towards the Chinese Revolution has been extended in Chinese Marxism to revolutions and development elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0920203X12446289">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This distinction between a universal model and practices informed by universal principles but ultimately derivative of local circumstances is more important than ever under the regime of global modernity, characterized by an insistence on national or local particularity within the context of a globalized capitalism. We have witnessed over the last two decades a proliferation of calls for ‘alternative modernities’ even as the globalization of capitalism has restricted if not abolished spaces within which to imagine and construct such alternatives. One important consequence has been a simultaneous proliferation of models. There are no longer just two or three models as in the days of the Cold War, but an increasing number of them. We encounter daily references to the Iranian model, the Turkish model, the Indonesian model, the Indian model, and many others, as changing circumstances around the world call attention to one or another example of development deemed relevant by various constituencies.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Chinese model was responsible at least in part for the stress on particular modernities, and it continues to inspire faith in the possibility of alternatives. It is more difficult to judge its significance. It may be suggested that there were always significant differences between societies, and that no two capitalisms or socialisms are entirely alike. The difference between the present and the past may lie not in the novelty of difference but in a heightened consciousness of and will to difference. The Cold War no doubt disguised the many differences of the day by subordinating them to a binary or tripartite division of the world. So did the hegemonic discourse of modernization, capitalist or socialist, with its own binarisms of progressive and traditional, or advanced and backward. The globalization of modernity ironically has brought to the surface a consciousness of difference that has also set off a search for different paths of development, especially in those societies empowered by success in the global economy. And there seems to be no shortage of models for development, even if they do not command equal degrees of attention. Still, if there is a Chinese model, it is one of many.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, would it make more sense to speak of a ‘Chinese paradigm’ (模式 or 范式) rather than a Chinese model (模范 or 模式), which would shift attention from an example to be emulated to an example that provides not only inspiration but also procedural principles, central to which is attentiveness to the possibilities and limitations of concrete local circumstances as well as location in the world? This is not only consistent with the legacies of the Chinese Revolution and socialist thinking, but responds more closely to the ideological tendencies of global modernity. It would also avoid the ambiguities of the idea of a Chinese model, with its implications of an established pattern, that hardly does justice to what may be but a work in progress, a subject itself of ongoing experimentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0920203X12446289">
<title>Is there a Chinese model?</title>
<p>The question I would like to raise here is whether the idea of a Chinese model is based on a substantial set of norms and practices, or whether it derives its meaning primarily from its contrasts with liberalism or neoliberalism, much as the similar idea of a ‘Beijing consensus’ (北京共识) acquired a hearing some years back for its supposed contrasts to the ‘Washington consensus’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0920203X12446289">4</xref></sup> If that is indeed the case, secondly, do we need a further specification of its goals, and whether or not those goals pertain simply to issues of economic development, or include social and political goals as well. After all, simply being different from neoliberalism does not tell us much about whether or not the model points towards socialism, or other, possibly more conservative goals as another variant of authoritarian developmentalism, associated in the late 1980s with so-called ‘new authoritarianism’ (新权威主义).</p>
<p>If it is possible to speak of a Chinese model, it is indeed closest to this latter idea, which bears a close kinship to a socialism that has been stripped of its more radical aspirations to create a just and egalitarian society free of the exploitative relations characteristic of earlier modes of production, including capitalism. Traceable to the inspiration of Samuel P. Huntington’s 1969 publication, <italic>Political Order in Changing Societies</italic>, new authoritarianism was associated early on with the developmental paths followed most effectively by a number of Eastern Asian societies, namely, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong under British colonial rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0920203X12446289">5</xref></sup> Following the Second World War, especially from the 1960s, these regimes achieved rapid development under a combination of political authoritarianism (or dictatorship) and sub-contractual economic development, beginning with the creation of export zones, that would serve as the pioneering moments in the emergence of ‘a new international division of labour’, neoliberal assaults on national economic boundaries, and ultimately, what has come to be known as globalization. In the traditionalism which underwrote their authoritarianism, these regimes also pointed to the cultural resurgences that would come with globalization, challenging the Eurocentric assumptions of an earlier modernization discourse. The result was also the stripping down of modernity to its technologies, which served different social, political, and cultural trajectories, with success dependent on historical circumstances, with cultural legacies allegedly playing a crucial role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0920203X12446289">6</xref></sup> It was the developmental success of Eastern Asian societies that empowered the Confucian revival of the 1980s that since then has served as an explanation of their success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0920203X12446289">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The so-called Chinese model may be considered one more variant of authoritarian development that in its origins owed much to these societies both for inspiration and for direct involvement in triggering its take-off. Contemporary discussions not only in the PRC but also among many foreign commentators display a remarkable ‘forgetfulness’ concerning the part that the Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese, but especially the Singaporean models played in inspiring policy in the initial phase of ‘reform and opening’ (改革开放) in the 1980s and through the 1990s. But their significance goes beyond the inspiration they provided. The flourishing economies of Eastern Asia provided a context for the development of the PRC in which they played a strategically crucial part. It may be no exaggeration to say that investments and technological input from these societies as well as from the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were responsible for bringing the Chinese economy to its take-off stage. This context is also one of the particularities of Chinese development that call into question its emulation by others.</p>
<p>There are two important historical differences, nevertheless, that distinguish China’s development from that of these neighbouring neoauthoritarian regimes that also receive little attention these days, especially among commentators outside of China. The PRC when it launched its modernization programme after 1978 was the product of one of the most important revolutions of the century, heralding the political and economic re-emergence of the colonial, ‘semi-colonial and semi-feudal’ worlds through movements for national liberation. In this case, it was a national liberation movement imbued with socialist goals. The liberation of the nation was to be grounded in a social and cultural revolution. It may be noted that other societies of the region also went through social transformations of one kind or another as a condition of development, from the reconstitution of Japanese society after the Second World War to land reform in Taiwan to anti-colonial movements in Singapore, Korea, and Hong Kong. Unlike in these societies where the transformations created new social hierarchies consistent with development within the capitalist system, the Chinese Revolution sought a social and cultural transformation towards the creation of a socialist society that stressed egalitarianism, giving a voice to the people, and the creation of a new culture consistent with these goals. The legacy of egalitarianism has been significant not only in shaping the trajectory of Chinese development but also in cushioning new inequalities generated by capitalist development, most importantly in the countryside.</p>
<p>Another very significant difference was also the goal and a byproduct of the revolution: autonomous and self-reliant development. Transformations in the rest of the societies of the region were accomplished under the aegis of imperial powers, most importantly after the Second World War the United States. In the case of the PRC, avoiding foreign domination of the economy (capitalist or socialist) was a fundamental premise and goal of the revolution. Self-reliance, moreover, was equally important for regional as for national development. In the reform period, the importance of the legacies of local self-reliance has been demonstrated most effectively in the part played by local cadres in development projects (also the source, conversely, of corrupt practices that are a major cause of popular disaffection – and political headache for the central authorities).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0920203X12446289">8</xref></sup> Self-reliance also made possible the high rate of savings that enabled the state to extract the maximum amount of surplus from the countryside to finance development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0920203X12446289">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is remarkable about discussions of the idea of a Chinese model idea is the obliviousness to this historical trajectory that makes China unique and, therefore, difficult if not impossible to emulate. China as we know it today is a product of this revolution, which unfortunately is often beclouded by the claims to continuity with a so-called 5000 years of tradition of a resurgent traditionalism that downplays the revolution (which is described in the new Museum of History in Beijing as a ‘period of rejuvenation’ [or ‘renaissance’ 复兴]). The fervent nationalism that has drawn much scholarly attention since the 1990s was the product of ideological activity that accompanied the renunciation of revolution in the early 1980s. The revolutionary nationalism of an earlier period that linked the struggle against imperialism with a social revolution at home has been replaced by a de-revolutionized nationalism which places at the fore the patriotic struggles of all Chinese, which has come to encompass all Chinese globally. Combined with assertions of timeless Chinese culture, it lends a strong racial tinge to the understanding of ‘Chineseness’. It is a far cry, at any rate, from the more complicated nationalism of an earlier period driven by a more strictly social and political understanding of the nation. Forgotten in the process is the contribution to the reforms of the experience and organizational legacies of the revolution.</p>
<p>More often than not, that same revolution has been rendered into a ‘negative example’ for its failures, which were real but only part of the story. Deploying the revolution as a foil against which to claim legitimacy for the present has covered over its legacies to the present, both positive and negative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0920203X12446289">10</xref></sup> Thus it is hardly mentioned that during the revolutionary years before 1978 the Chinese economy developed rapidly, registering annual growth rates that match the much touted rates of the post-1978 period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0920203X12446289">11</xref></sup> While occasions of ill-considered enthusiasm had disastrous consequences for the people, and self-reliant development required extraction of excessive amounts of surplus from the people, especially in rural areas, there was nevertheless ongoing improvement in people’s lives from education and health care to increases in life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0920203X12446289">12</xref></sup> The social transformation that the revolution sought may have been less than perfect, but it came with an organizational transformation that unified and integrated the country, laying the infrastructure that would serve well after 1978. These changes also created a new culture of politics and work, the significance of which for later development is yet to be analysed. On the other hand, while the organizational achievements of the revolution lay the foundation for subsequent development, they also stood in the way of further changes necessitated by development in a new direction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0920203X12446289">13</xref></sup> The greatest achievement of the reform period has been the removal of the obstacles while making use of these earlier achievements.</p>
<p>There is also a tendency to downplay the national liberation aspects of the struggle, with more emphasis on its economic and cultural than its political aspects. China’s economic ‘globalization’ is now extended back over time, erasing the problematic relationship with the outside world that marked the last two centuries. Culture has been nationalized, but now it is continuity with the past that is stressed rather than the dialectical discontinuity called for by the revolution. Political colonialism is remembered in the stress on past ‘national humiliation’, but it is also accompanied by its erasure, as for instance in the literature on the Shanghai Expo celebrating its continuity with past world expositions while by-passing the racial discrimination and humiliations China had suffered in early 20th-century fairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0920203X12446289">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The point here is not that these things should be remembered to foster continued suspicion and hostility, but because they are important to assessing the meaning of the Chinese model beyond its reductionist economistic understanding. Divorced from the legacies of the revolution, the Chinese model becomes one more version of authoritarian development, seeking ideological and cultural compliance with the demands of development as a participant in the global capitalist economy, without any concerns beyond success in this economy. This is how it is widely perceived in China, and by admirers of Chinese development abroad. To cite one recent convert from neoliberalism to the Chinese model, Francis Fukuyama:
<disp-quote>
<p>The most important strength of the Chinese political system is its ability to make large, complex decisions quickly, and to make them relatively well, at least in economic policy. This is most evident in the area of infrastructure, where China has put into place airports, dams, high-speed rail, water and electricity systems to feed its growing industrial base. Contrast this with [democratic] India, where every new investment is subject to blockage by trade unions, lobby groups, peasant associations and courts…. Nonetheless, the quality of Chinese government is higher than in Russia, Iran, or the other authoritarian regimes with which it is often lumped – precisely because Chinese rulers feel some degree of accountability towards their population. That accountability is not, of course, procedural; the authority of the Chinese Communist party is limited neither by a rule of law nor by democratic elections. But while its leaders limit public criticism, they do try to stay on top of popular discontents, and shift policy in response.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0920203X12446289">15</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fukuyama’s observations may be exemplary of most discussions of the ‘China model’. What makes it work is its deficit of democracy. Authoritarianism makes possible the rapid and efficient mobilization of resources not possible in a democratic society, exemplified by India, another so-called ‘developing economy’. The party-state may be repressive in other ways, but it is a force for innovation and efficiency economically. It is also superior to other authoritarian regimes (India is the most common example) because it is relatively responsive to crisis and the population. In neither case is there any reference to the organizational and cultural legacies of the revolution – whether with regard to repressiveness or responsiveness. There is no hint either that legacies of the revolution, however weakened, may still be powerful ideological forces in shaping both people’s demands and leaders’ responses. Little noticed also is the continued anxiety about self-reliance and autonomy in the midst of participation in a neoliberal global capitalist economy of which China has become an integral part. The model appears as just a more efficient authoritarianism of uncertain origin. It is more common than not these days to find the explanation in the pre-revolutionary past, most importantly Confucianism of both state and people. In the end, what remains of a ‘Chinese model’ open to emulation by others are authoritarianism, organizational efficiency, and innovativeness (or, more accurately, a willingness to experiment with different models of development).</p>
<p>What is glossed over are the social goals that theoretically continue to be an important constituent of the model, or the paradigm, as I suggest. A good part of the responsibility for this ‘forgetfulness’ rests with Chinese leaders and theorists who have been anxious to turn their backs on the revolutionary legacies to which they are heirs. The path of development since the launching of the reforms also has produced inequalities that easily create the impression that the revolutionary past is no longer relevant to understanding the present. Chinese corporations are as ruthless as any of their capitalist competitors, if not more so, earlier promotion of national liberation struggles around the world has been replaced by full participation in power plays for participation in the capitalist world system, and the repressive response to popular dissatisfaction internally smacks more of efforts to sustain the power of the Communist Party than of any moves towards socialist equality and democracy. It is arguable, nevertheless, that unlike many foreign commentators anxious to pinpoint the sources of Chinese success so as to emulate it or to partake of its benefits, a keen sense of the past as burden or inspiration continues to distinguish Chinese from foreign notions of a model. Officially, at least, the reforms represent the latest of the series of experiments in the search for national autonomy, and national wealth and power, that have marked the history of modern China.</p>

<sec id="section3-0920203X12446289">
<title>The appeals of the model</title>
<p>Among the competing models of a post-Eurocentric global modernity, the Chinese model receives the greatest attention because of the enormous economic achievements of the last two decades. It is also the one that is tacitly or explicitly contrasted with the US economy in its resonance with the Beijing consensus idea set against the neoliberal Washington consensus. There is some sense that as the Chinese economy overtakes its rivals, the model, too, may achieve global hegemony.</p>
<p>Despite its haphazard origins, the ascendancy of the China model in global development discourse is not entirely spontaneous. The idea has been the subject of ideological activity openly propagated by official propaganda organs at least since 2009, as the regime has raised its sights as a possible contender for world leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0920203X12446289">16</xref></sup> The activity has drawn further impetus from the regime’s relatively successful weathering of the global recession of 2008–9, as well as the elevation of the Chinese GDP over that of Japan to the second spot in the world economy. It has benefited enormously in plausibility from the attention brought to China by the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo. The activity is a key element in China’s challenge to the United States for world leadership. Its timing could not be better as the US economy continues to totter on the brink of another recession; the country suffers materially, morally, and intellectually from the ill-conceived warfare in which it is mired, and the population is increasingly demoralized by a seemingly bleak future – which contrasts with the optimism of the majority of the Chinese population despite serious problems, ongoing repression of dissent, and widening social inequality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0920203X12446289">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The contrast also offers some explanation why the image the regime seeks to project as an alternative to US hegemony falls on receptive ears in many quarters across the globe. Unlike during the Cold War, when the contention over hegemony was fuelled by serious ideological difference between capitalism and socialism, however truncated, the struggle over hegemony this time around is for supremacy within global capitalism: the neoliberal capitalism of the Washington consensus and a state-managed and regulated capitalism represented by the so-called Beijing consensus. The juxtaposition is valid but somewhat misleading. The Chinese economy is state-managed, to be sure, but it has also nourished off globalization, and the Chinese regime since the mid-1990s has been a major proponent of the globalization of markets and production. What characterizes the Chinese economy is a successful combination of authoritarian management internally with effective activity in the neoliberal market. The combination was not of its invention, as it was characteristic of the neoauthoritarian economies to which I have already referred. But the communist regime in China has been particularly successful in managing globalization while at the same time retaining strict control over the national market. A recent discussion observes that
<disp-quote>
<p>today’s emerging markets are increasingly drawn to a new and compelling doctrine of state-managed capitalism. They are learning to combine market economics with traditional autocratic or semi-autocratic politics in a process that signals an intellectual rejection of the Western economic model. According to this doctrine, the government maintains control over a partly liberalized economy and the people accept a very non-Western kind of civic bargain: political oppression in the public square in return for relative economic freedom and a rising quality of life. Both of these trends have a powerful cheerleader in Beijing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0920203X12446289">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We might add that it is not only in emerging economies that the model is viewed with interest. ‘The rejection of the Western economic model’, itself hardly singular, has not stood in the way of ‘Western’ corporations rushing to ingratiate themselves with the regime in order to gain access to the growing Chinese market. While there are echoes in the current rush to China of earlier myths of a boundless China market, the stakes this time around <italic>appear</italic> to be real enough to give plausibility to promises of the model. I underline the ‘appear’ because while the growth of the Chinese economy is indisputable, how much of it may be shared with outsiders remains problematic. Observers have noted the exploitative conditions that limit access to the imagined riches of the Chinese economy, most importantly in the joint enterprises that guarantee technology transfers to China while strictly regulating the shares that accrue to the foreign partners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0920203X12446289">19</xref></sup> Some analysts go so far as to suggest that the Chinese economy is only partially ‘globalized’, with a ‘protectionist wall’ jealously guarding ‘the “state-owned” economy’ inside the system that is the backbone of the economy and the source of party/state power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0920203X12446289">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Criticism of the Chinese regime for its failures to live up to the demands of neoliberal globalization may be justifiable from a legalistic perspective, but it is widely off the mark in terms of global power politics. How to participate in the global capitalist economy without yielding national sovereignty and autonomy has been an obsessive concern of Chinese radicals since the early 20th century. The Chinese pursuit of national interest in a global economy may not be to the liking of the older centres of hegemony who had expected globalization to further enhance and broaden their hegemony. It makes perfect sense from a Chinese perspective. Unlike Mao-era anti-imperialism that demanded withdrawal from global capitalism, the ‘opening’ of the national economy in the reform era has sought to turn the tables on imperialism by exploiting the global economy in the service of national ends. The success with which the Chinese regime has accomplished this goal is a major source of attraction in the Global South. Among those who have been subjected to two centuries of imperialist abuse and exploitation, and in the eyes of the majority of the Chinese population, the benefits these successful policies have brought outweigh the regime’s limitations of citizens’ rights, its transgressions against human rights, and even the inequalities it has created in achieving national ends. From these perspectives, authoritarianism seems a small price to pay for achieving long-standing aspirations – especially among those who do not share in the basic assumptions of Euro/American democracy, or perceive it with good justification as an instrument of hegemony rather than liberation.</p>
<p>In a somewhat different register, there is little sign that evidence of serious problems in Chinese development has done anything to cool off the China fever. It is widely known in China and abroad that the Party elite has used its political power to appropriate public wealth and created inequalities that belie its socialist professions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0920203X12446289">21</xref></sup> Inequality is a major problem, but it is systemic corruption rather than inequality itself that is the greatest source of dissatisfaction among the public at large and the underlying cause of daily protest against the regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0920203X12446289">22</xref></sup> Party/state control of the economy in the name of national autonomy ‘disguises the privatization of state assets’ which have been ‘carved up by China’s rulers, their families and retainers, who are all in business for themselves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0920203X12446289">23</xref></sup> It would be unfair to compare the contemporary regime with pre-revolutionary militarists, but there is some resemblance in its identification of national autonomy and welfare with its own progressively privatized interests. Where power is concerned, the important difference is in size and organizational reach which renders it into a dominant ‘public sphere’ of its own, with the credibility and power to shape the course of the nation in the interest of its stakeholders much more efficiently than its military predecessors, or in more open societies. The confounding of the private and the public does give a new meaning to the old slogan that ‘without the Communist Party, there can be no new China’ – as many in China are quite aware, even though the news travels mostly by gossip.</p>
<p>The plunder of public wealth has been accompanied by investment in a greedy strategy of development – or, better still, maldevelopment – that is environmentally and socially destructive. Whether or not this development may be sustainable is quite uncertain and the subject of ongoing speculation in China and abroad. This uncertainty, the corruption, and the repressive apparatus that has been mobilized to keep the lid on popular discontent are surely integral to any notion of a Chinese model, and yet when they receive honourable mention, more often than not they are quickly dissolved into enthusiasm over the Chinese ‘miracle’, the most impressive and momentous of the ‘miracles’ that have characterized Eastern Asian development over the last half century. The teleology derived from these earlier miracles also provides the basis for predictions among foreign promoters that sooner or later the less desirable aspects of the model will fade away as a developing China inevitably moves towards greater democracy and public accountability. Future promise is enough to drive away any qualms about present ills.</p>
<p>Problems in Chinese development may be easy to overlook when plunder of public resources, corruption, inequality, environmental destruction, and repression have become norms of the global economy. Vague references to a rising middle class also disguise the enormous class differences within the middle class. But there, too, the emergence of a wealthy ruling elite does not seem particularly out of the ordinary against the background of a transnational concentration of wealth and power from the least to the most developed societies.</p>
<p>Still, there is something remarkable about Western corporations’ ready, and seemingly enthusiastic, compliance with the authoritarian dictates of a state-managed economy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0920203X12446289">24</xref></sup> of which systemic corruption is an integral ingredient. It is no surprise that inherently amoral elitist purveyors of luxury goods and services from manufacturers of high-end cars and yachts to exclusive makers of jewellery and perfume should seek to get in on the Chinese market and add the aura of their glamour to the newly wealthy elite. But so do the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, not to speak of countless corporations large and small for which China has become the new economic frontier that in turn bestows prestige on those allowed to share in its riches. Monetary gain and fear of being excluded from a growing market are no doubt very important factors in such compliance. Self-serving though it is, the argument that involvement in the Chinese economy will in the long run help iron out problems of Chinese development is not to be dismissed offhand. But the complicity also suggests ideological resonance between the authoritarian neoliberalism of the Chinese regime and the anti-democratic authoritarian premises that go hand in hand with the global economic neoliberalism of corporate organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0920203X12446289">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rush to China has brought out into the open the incipient authoritarianism of global corporations as well as of the educational institutions entrusted with the intellectual, cultural, and social preservation and propagation of democracy and the public good. Business corporations are not alone in giving ideological cover to the authoritarian practices of the Chinese regime. More effective in prestige because of their claims to intellectual and ethical purity may be the cover afforded by educational institutions, which are increasingly allied with business interests and behave like businesses themselves. North American, European, and Australian higher education institutions are as eager as any business to establish ‘joint enterprises’ in China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0920203X12446289">26</xref></sup> On the home front, they welcome with a mixture of cultural and economic anticipation the so-called Confucius Institutes, grass-roots propaganda organs of the Chinese state, with seeming obliviousness to the oppressive activities of the same propaganda establishment in the PRC in suppressing intellectual and political dissent – which is carried to campuses abroad in efforts to discourage or even suppress discussion of issues the PRC deems controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0920203X12446289">27</xref></sup> Faculty and students who readily protest government involvement on university campuses in the United States appear to be mostly silent when it comes to these institutions that arrive with promises of language, culture, and business ties.</p>
<p>Contrary to those who are convinced that economic development and new middle class values must inevitably usher democracy in their wake,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0920203X12446289">28</xref></sup> there is no reason to think on the basis of available evidence that authoritarianism is inconsistent with a neoliberal global economy. Indeed, it may be quite the reverse: what is at risk is not authoritarianism but democracy, and the public good, as economic imperatives gain ascendancy in global competition for resources, and economic and political supremacy. To listen to US political leaders, including President Obama who surely knows much better, the goal of democracy is most importantly to foster technological innovation. President Hu Jintao would have no problems agreeing with that. Neither would Li Changchun, the electrical engineer in charge of the propaganda apparatus as a member of the Politburo.</p>
<p>Despite brave talk about democracy, authoritarianism is more necessary than ever to keep in check popular frustration with the inequalities that globalization has produced, not just in China but globally. If Chinese development has given it a new respectability, it is by no means an exclusive Chinese characteristic. What Halper describes as ‘the China effect’ is real enough, but it is misleading to focus one-sidedly on Chinese policies, and ignore the part global corporations and educational institutions play in sustaining authoritarianism even as they nourish off and deepen inequalities in the emergent reconfiguration of the world system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0920203X12446289">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the strategically crucial role the PRC has come to play in the global economy, the idea of a Chinese model as it is framed in most discussions articulates fundamental contradictions of global capitalism. The self-serving claim cited above that the Chinese model is superior not only to contemporary alternatives but even to the economies that initiated global economic modernization is to be approached critically because of its obliviousness to historical circumstances, as well as to problems that await solutions that are the products of development. Judging by railroads and automobiles, China is a society on the move, which contrasts sharply with stagnation elsewhere. But the problems are equally impressive: unprecedented social and spatial inequalities resulting from development over the last three decades, reversing the achievements of the revolution, enormous ecological problems that threaten further development, corruption, social instability arising from these problems, and a deficit of democracy, however conceived, along with issues of free speech and legal due process. These, too, are products of the so-called China model. A recent discussion refers to China as ‘the world’s first rich-poor country’, with a GDP that is ranked 2nd in the world, and a per capita GDP that ranks 127th.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0920203X12446289">30</xref></sup> The gap between the two rankings may serve as a measure of severe social and regional inequality that is easily overlooked in the rush to partake of ‘the deep wallet’ of a dictatorial regime and a new adoration for the unscrupulous Chinese elite as consumers of luxury goods. With severe inequality as a global condition, what attracts the greatest attention is the seemingly superior performance of the Chinese national economy. How this performance may be sustained nevertheless presents serious questions.</p>
<p>Above all, however, is the question of the direction of development, which is another crucial aspect of the notion of an ‘alternative’. China’s developmental success has been achieved within the parameters set by existing models of development, most importantly in the United States, with a heavy emphasis on urbanization, the provision of consumer goods internally and externally, and a corresponding concentration of resources. While it is widely recognized that such a model of development may not be any more sustainable in China than in the United States, so far the corrections to it seem to have been mostly of a cosmetic nature. The destruction of the countryside and the depletion of natural resources continue apace. So does reliance on real estate speculation and automobile manufacturing to keep the engine of growth in motion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0920203X12446289">31</xref></sup> These are problems readily acknowledged by the leadership, and yet there is no plausible alternative in sight.</p>
<p>It seems premature to speak of a Chinese model until these problems have been resolved, let alone a model as a socialist society. It also seems that those abroad who are most taken with the Chinese model are those who place economic and technological development ahead of all other social and political concerns, admirers of authoritarianism seeking escape from the problems of democratic societies, or, simply groupies of China cultivated by Confucian Institutes who seem to perceive China as a mélange of an exotic but suddenly accessible culture and much needed commercial opportunities for the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0920203X12446289">32</xref></sup> The success of the PRC in alleviating poverty is a powerful source of attraction. So is the seeming vitality of Chinese society which disguises that it suffers from the same problems that afflict liberal corporate economies, especially problems of deep inequality, cultural disorientation, and ecology. China’s problems are not exceptional. Currently available models all suffer from more or less similar problems which diminish their claims to serve as models for others. This is part of the crisis of our times. I think it is fair to say in the case of China that, however satisfying it may be from a nationalistic perspective, little of the admiration is fostered by hopes in movement towards socialist goals of social justice, equality, and democratic practices based on those ideals. The Chinese model in its success or as competitor can even be put to use in some advanced societies such as the United States as an excuse for curtailing democracy and redirecting education towards corporate goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0920203X12446289">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also a perception, that of a minority unfortunately, that if it is indeed possible to speak of a Chinese model, it is as a model in the process of formation, a work in progress with a still uncertain future. It is quite obvious that even the leadership in China is deeply divided over solutions to these problems, which are crucial to the formulation of development strategies. As is evident once again from the most recent National People’s Congress in 2011, and the new Five-Year Plan, resolving the social challenges of development remains a priority. Whether or not these concerns in the long run overcome the fetishism of development, and redirect it towards socialist ends, remains an open question. Even if socialist policies are rejuvenated, moreover, questions will persist concerning their implementation over obstacles presented by conflicting economic and political interests. It is also important to remember that as times have changed, so has the understanding of socialism as necessarily people-based rather than state-centred. The Chinese Revolution of the 20th century played an important part in placing some of these questions on the political agenda of Marxism and socialism. Whether or not they remain on the development agenda will have important consequences for the future.</p>

<title>Marxism, capitalism, and the Chinese model</title>
<p>I would like to glance briefly here at developments in Chinese Marxism in light of questions concerning the Chinese model. While the legacies of revolution and socialism are quite relevant to grasping the forces that continue to shape Chinese society and politics, it would be intellectually self-deceptive even for the Communist Party leadership to ignore what most commentators in and out of China find attractive is not ‘socialism’ but ‘capitalism with Chinese characteristics’, made possible by repudiating the revolutionary socialism of the past. It takes considerable naivete, if not premeditated loss of vision, to remain blind to the disconnect between ideology, theory, and practice that characterizes contemporary Chinese political, economic, and social policies. Marxism is no more a concern for the population at large in China than it is elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0920203X12446289">34</xref></sup> On the other hand, depending on the political persuasion of the observer, the socialist professions of the regime continue to carry considerable weight in assessments of its weakness, or the hopes it offers as an alternative to actually existing capitalism.</p>
<p>Insistence on Marxism as a source of truth is obviously a condition of the Communist Party’s legitimacy, as is its status as the political agent that has re-established national wealth and power. It is no less foolish to ignore the continued contribution of Marxism to the language of politics, moreover, than to disregard the revolutionary past as a storehouse of memories and policies that may be drawn upon to confront problems of the present when necessary. It is evidently the case that, rather than Marxism guiding policy, as the leadership would like to claim, it is the policy presently that shapes the contemporary interpretation of Marxism. But Marxism may be relevant in unexpected ways to understanding the reasoning that underlies the idea of a Chinese model that has deep roots in the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>Since 2004, the leadership has launched an effort to rejuvenate Marxism through the ‘Marxist Theoretical Research and Development Project’ (literally, Basic Research and Construction 马克思主义基础理论研究和建设工程) sponsored by President Hu Jintao himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0920203X12446289">35</xref></sup> On the surface, at least, the rejuvenation of Marxism was intended to counter both developmentalism and consumerism by making human well-being the point of departure for and the end of development as demanded by socialist goals. Its most immediate goals could be seen as restoring ideological coherence to the Party organization, on the one hand, and to make sure, on the other hand, that the ideology was in conformity with the ideological lineage established by the leadership over the last 30 years: Marxism–Leninism – Mao Zedong Thought – Deng Xiaoping Theory – ‘Three Represents Theory’ of Jiang Zemin – and Hu’s own ‘Scientific Outlook on Development’. The overarching goal of the project was to formulate a Chinese Marxism appropriate to China’s development in a global age, based upon direct confrontation of the classical texts of Marxism, unmediated by other post-Marx/Engels/Lenin interpretations. Earlier efforts to make Marxism Chinese, most prominently under Mao in the 1940s, had sought to build upon Soviet Marxism. This time around, the interpretation was to be based on the Chinese experience of revolution and development.</p>
<p>The project’s stress has been on the exploration of what Marxist classics had to say about socialist construction, rather than revolution, which had been the primary focus in the past. When it was initiated, it was assigned five tasks: to strengthen study of the ‘sinicization of Marxism’ in Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Three Represents; re-translate and explain Marxist classics; establish a Marxist system appropriate to the times; produce higher education texts in political economy, philosophy, and so on with Marxist characteristics, as well as texts on modern history, and so forth, imbued with the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Three Represents; and create new institutions of Marxist research. The last-mentioned included the establishment of a new Marxism Research Institute in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The project itself involved, in addition to the Compilation and Translation Bureau and Marxist research institutes, university departments as well as Party schools across the country. One aspect of the project was to cull from the works of Marx and Engels the meaning they had assigned to a selected list of 18 terms and concepts that are worth listing here because they are revealing of current concerns: democracy and political civilization; capitalism, socialism, and communism; social development; agriculture and peasants; social development in economically and culturally backward societies; problems of globalization and ‘epoch’ (时代); ownership and distribution; political parties; war and peace; labour theory of value and surplus value; class, class struggle, proletarian revolution and dictatorship; religion; nationality; ideology, progressive culture and morality; human; dialectical and historical materialism; principles of political economy; and military.</p>
<p>Theoretical workers in the Party have been engaged in recent years in a global search in Marx-Engels archives for published and unpublished materials that might offer textual alibi for the theoretical correctness of China’s development under the reform regime. There is no reason to assume homogeneity of interpretation among the various institutions involved or their research staff from different backgrounds who themselves are not necessarily of one mind in evaluating contemporary development. But judging by the published output that has become available so far, the project has generated a Marxism that goes beyond Mao Zedong Thought in its nativist equation of Chinese Marxism with ‘the practice of the Chinese revolution’. Indeed, some supposedly theoretical texts read very much like histories of the revolution from Mao to the present. Unlike in revolutionary days, moreover, when past philosophical legacies were viewed at least formally as objects of radical transformation in keeping with Marxist theoretical and historical assumptions, there has been some attempt to discover commonalities between Marxism and native legacies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0920203X12446289">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is more at work here than the obvious, and perhaps trivial, point that Marxism has come to serve more explicitly than ever before as an instrument of national and Party policy. The more important point is that the instrument, in the status of scientific universality ascribed to it, provides a connection across national boundaries that endows the Chinese experience with global relevance. The temporal overlap between the Marxism project and the official dissemination of the Chinese model may not be coincidental. Whether or not so intended by its promoters, there is an unmistakable dialectical interplay between the two projects which may be captured best by the philosophical notion of a ‘concrete universal’, where the universal may be grasped only in its particular, overdetermined historicity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0920203X12446289">37</xref></sup> The Chinese model or better still, the Chinese example, may then be grasped as the singularly historical practice of universal principles that is open to emulation not as a universal pattern but for its procedures in articulating the universal to concrete historical circumstances (or vice versa, to be more consistently dialectical).</p>
<p>What is important here is overcoming the categorical formalism that has characterized discussions of Chinese development, and attending more closely to the thinking that guides change. Structural transformations after 1978 (reform and opening) within the spatial context of Eastern Asia have been of the utmost importance in directing the trajectory that changes in China have followed. But these transformations are grasped best when viewed within the perspective of a longer stretch of time that encompasses the revolutionary period before and after 1949 – which, after all, is merely a lifetime for some who have played key parts in both revolution and reform. Closer attention to these structural and historical circumstances might offer better clues to Chinese thinking on change than endless chase after fluid particulars, search for principles that transcend the limitations of time and place, or speculative meanderings in a ‘Chinese’ or East Asian mind. On the other hand, rather than take the idea of a Chinese model for granted, we need to be closely attentive to its entanglement in discourses on global power in which it has its inspiration, and from which it derives its significance and vitality.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Intensifying tension over the past year between the Communist Party and society at large, and within the Communist Party itself, offers cogent evidence of the pitfalls of facile judgements about a Chinese model. While foreign commentators have been waxing enthusiastic about the China model, it is quite evident that Chinese leaders and the Chinese public are in search of a model that will help overcome a brewing crisis of governance, which no doubt has been exacerbated by anxiety about the sustainability of the existing path of development and inflationary pressures that have resisted the government’s efforts to overcome them. The Chongqing model, which received much attention for its radical song-and-dance revivalism during celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Party earlier this year, just recently has been challenged by a ‘Guangdong model’, which places greater emphasis on democratization, further opening to the world, and closer attention to public grievances – such as those of labour. While the Chongqing model invokes anxieties among Chinese liberals and foreign observers about the revival of Maoist revolutionary ‘extremism’, the Guangdong model inspires hopes that China will be integrated more closely into global capitalism and the (neo)liberal order that sustains it. In the meantime, netizens have found a model in India in the figure of Anna Hazare to answer to their calls for a public voice in politics and struggle against deep-seated corruption. Their concerns are echoed in the renewed emphasis of Party leadership on ‘social management’, with ‘the ultimate purpose … of mitigating the threat of social conflicts and safeguarding social order and stability’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0920203X12446289">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>An ongoing discussion within the Party over the future of politics spilled out into the public just recently in a discussion of major Party intellectuals, sanctioned by the Party itself, commemorating Deng Xiaoping’s seminal 1981 essay, ‘How to resolve certain questions in the history of our party’. As the participants suggest, the various models that are under discussion represent alternative responses to a crisis of governance, motivated by different interests and ideological orientations. An important Party intellectual Zhang Musheng, supported by other powerful figures, advocates a return to the policies of New Democracy which guided Chinese political, social, and economic policy between 1940 and 1956, to many the golden age of socialism before the turn to the radical policies of the Cultural Revolution, which in its origins, eruption, and consequences covers the two decades from 1956 to 1976.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0920203X12446289">39</xref></sup> I would like to suggest, to the contrary, that the present crisis is once again the crisis of New Democracy, this time around within the context of a global capitalism of which China is an integral part. New Democracy was characterized by a mixed economy and politics, under the direction of the Communist Party. When Deng Xiaoping conceded in 1981 that the contradictions facing China were the same contradictions that had prevailed in 1956, he was tacitly announcing a return to New Democracy (not too incidentally, he also observed that Party corruption in the early 1980s was reminiscent of the days of New Democracy).</p>
<p>Over the three decades since, it is such a mixture that has guided Chinese development. New Democracy, however, presented an unstable mixture of capitalism and socialism. The contradictions created by the mixture were resolved after 1956 by a turn to radical socialism. Similar contradictions have repeatedly disturbed the Chinese economy and society since the beginning of reform and opening. The first decade of hesitant reform and opening culminated in the crisis of 1989, in which inflation, unemployment – especially of youth – and corruption were also primary issues. The response to the crisis, this time around, was to turn to opening to global capitalism in a headlong rush. We might note that this turn coincided with the fall of socialism in Eastern Europe and Russia, and the vitality of Eastern Asian economies, which reinforced arguments for further opening. Now, after another decade and a half, when the turn has succeeded beyond all expectations, and China has become a backbone of the global capitalist economy, the many contradictions in Chinese society find expression in what we may describe, following Maoist language, as ‘the primary contradiction’ that gives meaning to all the others: the contradiction between the Party and society, a contradiction in governance. The Chongqing model with its Maoist revivalism, and the Guangdong model standing for further liberalization are but two products of the mixture that has characterized Chinese politics and society. They once again present a choice, if I may simplify a bit, between greater emphasis on the socialist aspect versus a complete turn to capitalism. Nevertheless, the Chongqing model, no less than the Guangdong one, presupposes continued integration with the global capitalist economy. The two models are both equally developmentalist in their assumptions, with seemingly unquestioned faith in technological fixes. And neither promises much by way of resolving fundamental questions of environment, urban–rural relations, deep inequalities in society, and so on and so forth. In the meantime, at least some among the people feel the need for something else: confrontation of the fundamental corruption of the system, which may be resolved only through a greater voice for the people.</p>
<p>If we are to speak of a Chinese model, which is encouraged by the economic horse-race that has taken hold of contemporary thinking on development, we need to be cognizant that in the perceptions and desires of the Chinese themselves, there is more than one model, each with its own social and political implications. To ignore this with a single-minded focus on GDPs, GNPs, or consumption figures is also to gloss over the complexities that the Chinese themselves face in resolving the consequences of development. Instead of searching for models for emulation, we might do well to ponder these consequences. China has problems of its own, but like everything else these days, the problems are not just theirs alone. The world of neoliberal global capitalism is one that is devoid of any models for emulation, which likely is indicative of terminal systemic crisis.</p>

A brief but updated version of Pan’s ideas is to be found in Pan Wei, Reflections on the ‘China model’ discussion, <italic>International Critical Thought</italic> 1(1), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0920203X12446289">2011</xref>: 11–17. Lu enumerates five characteristics: a diverse ‘tool kit’ to choose from in making policy, state involvement in the corporate economy, a ‘deep wallet’ and the ability to ‘throw money at problems’, freedom from election concerns that make possible long-range planning, and top-down policymaking combined with local flexibility. Pan Wei finds the Chinese difference in ‘a unique way of social organization, a unique way of developing its economy, a unique way of government, and a unique outlook on the world’, which all add up to state penetration of society as the characteristic of the Chinese model. Not surprisingly both approaches, but especially the former, are open to variation depending on the commentator. There is little discussion of where these characteristics came from, other than vague references to China being different. Neither Lu nor Pan makes any reference to the authoritarianism that is the premise of the various factors that both enumerate. Nor is there any discussion of the ‘unique’ relations of exploitation, and extraction of surplus value from the population, made possible by such authoritarianism, or of the conditions of neoliberal globalization that enabled export-oriented development. The focus on China’s ‘uniqueness’ also disguises its indebtedness to the example of other authoritarian modes of development in Eastern Asia. See below for further discussion.</p>

<p>In his comparison of Chinese and Indian development, which favours China so far, Bardhan places special emphasis throughout on two characteristics of Chinese development, egalitarianism in land distribution at the beginning of reforms, and the part played by decentralization. The former was most important initially in spurring development, which in many ways began in the countryside. The other has been important in mobilization of local cadres in the cause of development. What he does not add is that both characteristics were legacies of the preceding revolutionary period, which he views with some disfavour. Collectivization during the preceding period had been the great equalizer, which set the stage for the equal distribution of land under the household responsibility system, which helped development but also moderated the new tendencies towards inequality, offering the poor some protection. Local cadres, who had been at the forefront of these changes earlier, now assumed a new role. Both their contribution to development and the problems associated with them also replay earlier contradictions in a new guise.

Interestingly, Fukuyama here echoes remarks by the Indian Home Minister, P. Chidambaram. In a speech he gave at Harvard University in 2007 entitled ‘Poor rich countries’, Chidambaram also pointed to the problems created for development by forces – from trade unions to land laws protecting the rural population – usually associated with democracy.

Roy’s passionate condemnation of the government–corporate alliance against the interests of the rural population, especially the indigenous people, should give pause to facile contrasts between democratic India and dictatorial China. Equally important is the fact that Maoist activity has been the most effective among the indigenous people, the adivasis.</p>

Duke University, meanwhile has begun the construction of a new campus near Shanghai, jointly with Wuhan University, that will confer Duke degrees. The University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom announced at the end of October 2005 that it was establishing a campus in the PRC jointly with Xi’an Jiaotong University, which would concentrate on technological subjects. According to a report, interestingly, the campus is to be located in Suzhou Industrial Park in Eastern China, which is quite a distance not only from Liverpool, but also from Xi’an. The attraction of the location is that it is home to foreign enterprises in the PRC, including 53 Fortune 500 companies. The founding of the university, in other words, is one more example of higher education as enterprise serving other enterprises. The ‘joint enterprise’ has been the standard form of Sino-foreign business collaboration. The deal in this case was backed up by Laureate Educational Limited, an online education transnational.

Fingleton rightly stresses the East Asian context for Chinese development, which he traces in turn to Japanese colonial policies of development in Manchuria in the 1930s. The analysis suffers from the author’s insistence on describing the model as ‘Confucian’, despite his acknowledgement of the problems it presents, and occasional references to an East Asian mind, but it offers much material on the seamier aspects of its workings, and on the temptations it offers to foreign cheerleaders.</p>

<p>Anne-Marie Brady aptly describes the ‘model’ as ‘popular authoritarianism’.

See also pp. 78–9 for the lessons in public relations (not to speak of ‘soft power’) that the Chinese regime has learned from the United States. Despite highly visible cases such as those of Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei, which get much play among foreign commentators, attitudes towards the regime among the Chinese population at large remain quite positive.</p>

<p>Marxism as filtered through the Chinese revolution may be another matter.

It should be noted that while the article has positive things to say about the revolution, it ascribes goals such as equality to ancient Chinese traditions.</p>

<p>What I have in mind here is similar to what Marcuse writes with regard to the idea of ‘concrete universality’ in Hegel: ‘the universal is in itself concrete … for it does not exist outside the particular but realizes itself only in and through the particular, or, rather, in the totality of particulars’. Herbert Marcuse, <italic>Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory</italic>, Boston: Beacon Press, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0920203X12446289">1960</xref>, 127. I have argued elsewhere that this dialectic between the universal and the particular has characterized the Chinese understanding of Marxism as universal theory. The universal here refers to the dynamics of society, rather than the goals of socialism, while the particular (and the concrete) to their actual operation under different historical contexts and circumstances. The idea is productive politically and strategically (in terms of revolution or development, as the case might be) in the flexibility it posits in the use of theory (‘pragmatism’, in other words). How socialism is conceived, needless to say, also presents the predicament of theory serving any goal, and opens the way to bending theory to the service of goals for which it was not intended.</p>
