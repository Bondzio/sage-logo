<abstract>
<p>The main purpose of this study was to examine the classroom, teacher and student factors distinguishing grade three classes performing at higher levels than expected, in relation to socioeconomic status (SES) and language factors, from classes performing below their potential with regard to the same factors. Data from a standardized reading comprehension test and student and teacher questionnaires covering teacher, classroom and student characteristics were collected. The participants were 1,092 grade three classes and their class teachers, from Stockholm, Sweden. By use of regression and a twin-matching procedure, one group of 94 underachieving classes and another group of 94 overachieving classes were formed for comparison. Data about extended voluntary reading, classroom climate, teacher experience and the use of authentic literature were seen to be the main four indicators discriminating between over- and underachieving classes beyond the impact of SES and language background.</p>

<p>A burning question for reading research is the discovery of the key determinants of classes that are beating the odds when learning to read. While teachers are certainly in a position to contribute to differences in reading achievement between classes, many other classroom and student characteristics might also play an important role in accounting for success and failure among groups of students. The main purpose of this study was to identify teacher, classroom and student factors distinguishing classes performing at a higher level than expected, in relation to socioeconomic status (SES) and language background (i.e. native students vs. students with Swedish as a second language), employing the class as the unit of analysis. This study was conducted in Sweden, where the impact of SES is considered to be less pronounced than in many other Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411417376">Mullis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411417376">Myrberg and Rosén, 2006</xref>). The fact that most Swedish parents are fairly well educated might in part explain the high reading results among Swedish students observed in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411417376">Mullis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411417376">Myrberg and Rosén, 2006</xref>; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD), 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, the largest city in Sweden, Stockholm, is considered to be one of the most segregated cities in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411417376">OECD, 1998</xref>). The contrasts between, on the one hand, low-SES suburban tenement areas with a majority of immigrants and middle-class tenant-owners’ societies with one-family houses and, on the other, inner-city areas with predominately high-income inhabitants are large. Therefore we perceived this study to be of great significance since any study in any country examining teacher, classroom and student characteristics associated with successful reading achievement must pay attention to the socioeconomicstructure of the area surrounding the school, as the impact of SES is often stronger on a class level as compared with on an individual level (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411417376">Elbro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411417376">Raudenbush et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468798411417376"><title>The impact of SES factors on reading achievement</title>
<p>It is well documented that socioeconomic factors such as family income, parental education and occupation are factors linked to individual differences in literacy achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411417376">Coleman et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411417376">Noble et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411417376">Princiotta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411417376">Raudenbush et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411417376">Rutter and Maugham, 2002</xref>). Some findings also indicate that cognitive, social and neuro-biological influences are modulated by socioeconomic background, specifically at lower levels of status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411417376">Noble et al., 2006</xref>). For example, related abilities such as preschool phonological awareness, with a causal impact on reading development, is linked to SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411417376">Bowey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411417376">Hecht et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>SES factors influence the home literacy environment and such literacy activities as shared book reading and letter-based activities which, in turn, are related to children’s early reading acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411417376">Adams, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411417376">Hart and Risley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411417376">Scarborough, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411417376">Sénéchal and LeFèvre, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411417376">Sénéchal et al., 1998</xref>). Parents’ own reading competence, the frequency of parents’ reading aloud and parents’ attitudes towards reading also contribute to students’ reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468798411417376">Rosén et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>When SES factors are controlled for, more variance within schools than between schools is often found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411417376">Braun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411417376">Gustafsson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411417376">Yang, 2003</xref>). SES at an area level is described as more powerful than SES at an individual level as, for example, parents’ expectations may influence achievement levels in a whole class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411417376">Elbro, 2004</xref>). In this sense ‘good’ schools may simply reflect the SES of the area. Although the web of interdependent factors influencing the degree of success of schools is very intricate and is sometimes hard to overview and interpret, some recurring features accounting for social and educational capital in effective schools have been observed.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1468798411417376"><title>Schools overachieving in reading</title>
<p>A shared school-wide commitment to language development and reading is a recurring feature characterizing schools that are successful in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411417376">Mosenthal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411417376">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). Many researchers mention academic emphasis, encompassing a climate of high expectations in school and hard-working students, as a benchmark for effective schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411417376">Denton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411417376">Goddard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411417376">Gustafsson and Myrberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411417376">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). Frequent teacher–parent communication is another trait typical of successful schools, especially in schools with student bodies from low SES multicultural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411417376">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468798411417376">Thomas and Collier, 2002</xref>). In addition, allocating sufficient time for independent reading is linked to high reading results at school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411417376">Barbosa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411417376">Mosenthal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411417376">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411417376">Barbosa and colleagues (2006)</xref>, reading incentives in school may even cancel out the impact of SES on students’ reading habits.</p>
<p>Another general pattern in high-achieving schools is that teachers and students often perceive the school climate to be supportive and positive. Peer relations and relationships between students and teachers, in particular, seem to influence the working climate in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411417376">Mosenthal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411417376">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411417376">Parker and colleagues (2006)</xref> also found that in-service training that focused on teaching methods heavily reduced the impact of SES on students’ reading and writing performance.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1468798411417376"><title>Teacher and teaching characteristics</title>
<p>Teacher experience is a well-documented discriminator between high- and low-achieving schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411417376">Darling-Hammond (1999)</xref>, teacher education is strongly linked to teacher effectiveness. The proportion of well-qualified teachers was found to be the strongest predictor of state-level achievement in reading in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411417376">Darling-Hammond, 1999</xref>), when SES factors and language status were controlled for. Knowledge of both subject and teaching methods can be presumed to interact to form the best teaching competence. Skilled teachers seem to adapt their methods, strategies and follow-up procedures to respond to students’ needs in a flexible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411417376">Darling-Hammond, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411417376">Snow et al., 2005</xref>). In other words, the teacher can motivate choices of content and methods in accordance with theoreticalknowledge <italic>and</italic> the interests and cognitive levels of the children. Thus, linguistic form may be practised in exercises with a function connecting tomeaning-making, so that inner motivation is enhanced. For example, role-playing and drama may be used to let children shift to an insider’s perspective while examining the characters in a story. Reading, oral activities and writing are, in this way, used to support each other. However, it is difficult to compare teacher qualifications between countries. Still, there is strong evidence that teacher competence, irrespective of its definition, is linked to students’ achievement levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411417376">Gustafsson and Myrberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468798411417376"><title>Student characteristics</title>
<p>The amount of reading associated with children’s reading habits, and their attitudes towards reading, is an acknowledged predictor of reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411417376">Cipielewski and Stanovich, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411417376">Juel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411417376">Nagy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>), depending in part on the reciprocal relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Themore children read, the more low-frequency vocabulary they encounter and learn, which in turn speeds up their reading fluency, enabling further reading success and more reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411417376">Stanovich, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the language factor is closely linked to reading results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411417376">Damber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>). According to the Swedish National Agency for Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411417376">Skolverket, 2003</xref>), the proportion of students leaving compulsory school without complete grades is greater among students with two parents born outside Sweden, indicating that these children are still in the process of learning Swedish, which affects their results in all school subjects. However, socioeconomic background co-varied more strongly with individual differences in final school results than did language background, even if there is also a correlation between SES and language factors (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468798411417376">Van der Slik et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec7-1468798411417376"><title>Research question</title>
<p>It is impossible to provide a full description of factors with the potential to discriminate between high- and low-performing schools and/or classes within the realms of this study. Our aim was to emphasize factors of importance beyond the impact of SES and language background. Also, we found that the number of earlier studies accounting for SES and language with a special focus on <italic>classroom</italic> achievement was limited. Therefore, the main objective in the present study was to identify the kind of teacher/teaching, classroom and student characteristics distinguishing over- and underachieving classes, after SES and language influences had been controlled for.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1468798411417376" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>In 1997, 1998 and 1999, large-scale studies of reading achievement in all the grade three and grade eight classes in Stockholm, Sweden, were conducted. Along with the measurement of reading comprehension, these studies included student and teacher questionnaires on factors related to teacher, student andclassroom activities and characteristics. The overall purpose of those studies, at both grade levels, was to address changes in reading comprehension over time, as well as to relate reading achievement to the above-mentioned factors. One reason for selecting these data was that Stockholm had been observed to be one of the most segregated cities in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411417376">OECD, 1998</xref>) and the variance in both SES and language background was maximized. Inaddition, this sample of schools would resemble the situation frequently observed elsewhere in Sweden as the number of inhabitants with a foreign background has increased considerably in medium-sized Swedish cities since the 1990s.</p>
<p>The reason for restricting this study to grade three was that most teaching, including reading instruction, was mainly conducted by one teacher, responsible for a class. This is an advantage when addressing the impact of the teacher and teaching on classroom achievement in reading. With only a few exceptions, all schools and classes in the city of Stockholm, including its surrounding suburbs, participated in the study. Fourteen city districts with a total population of around 740,000 were included (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468798411417376">USK, 2007</xref>). Preparatory classes with students with very little knowledge of Swedish were excluded as their reading level would have impacted on their ability to complete a questionnaire. Special schools/classes for severely physically and mentally disabled students were excluded for the same reason.</p>
<p>Target classes were selected from a total of 1,092 classes, including 25,552 students at grade three, distributed over three years in Stockholm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411417376">Table 1</xref>). The mean age was nine years and seven months across all years. In addition, the class teachers with the main responsibility for teaching Swedish, atotal of 1,092 teachers, also participated in the study.

<p>To obtain high- and low-achieving classes matched for sociocultural factors, we used the average number of books in the home as an index of SES at class level. This was chosen because that information was available for eachstudent across all the schools taking part in the study. As the Swedish school system was built on a proximity principle at that time, with a majority of students attending the school closest to their home, this index was validated by statistics describing both the percentage of families in a particular geographic area with an income of more than 360,000 Swedish kronor, and the percentage of families within the same area with a post-secondary level of education or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468798411417376">USK, 2007</xref>). As 6% of the classes in the total sample were independent schools, to which students might possibly commute from all areas of the city, the number of books at home appeared to be an appropriate measure to use as the socioeconomic index, since information about income and education was not available for those classes.</p>
<p>The correlation between family income and the level of education was high (<italic>r</italic> = 84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating a high level of reliability in the use of these statistics for validating the number of books as an index of SES. More importantly, the correlation between the average number of books on the one hand and income and education on the other was significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and varied from .56 to .68 with a mean correlation of .62. Also, as the level of education is a more reliable index of SES than income, our correlation of .68 between the number of books in the home and the level of education makes it possible to argue that the number of books in the home can be used as a valid index of SES, as well as an indication of the literacy level of the family.</p>
<p>In the next step, we calculated the regression between the average number of books and the average class performance in reading comprehension (seetest description below) based on the total sample of 1,092 classes. Classes with a mean reading performance substantially above the mean predicted by the number of books were identified as high-performing classes (henceforth denoted overachievers). Furthermore, those classes with positive residuals above the 85th percentile were selected. Those classes with a mean reading performance considerably below the mean, predicted by the number of books, were identified as low-performing classes (henceforth denoted underachievers), i.e. those classes with negative residuals below the 15th percentile. A total of 163 overachieving classes and 163 underachieving classes were selected from the total sample of 1,092 classes. However, estimates of family income and level of education were still higher among overachievers compared to underachievers. Therefore, we decided to employ a twin-matching procedure based on the number of books, family income and the level of education to eliminate these differences in SES. The groups were matched on measures of family income, parents’ educational level and number of books in the home by means of ocular matching. After this matching procedure, 119 overachievers and 119 underachievers were identified andmatched for all three indexes of SES (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411417376">Table 2</xref>). There is a significant difference between the groups for reading comprehension, but they are well matched on all three indexes of SES. However, there is a significant difference between over- and underachieving classes in the proportion of children withSwedish as a second language. This finding supports the approach of adding language as a second factor to account for when comparing over- and underachieving classes. In the following (and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411417376">Table 2</xref>), overachieving and underachieving classes when SES is controlled for will be referred to as OA-S and UA-S, respectively.

<p>In addition to defining classes matched on SES, a second matching procedure to eliminate the difference between over- and underachievers in the percentage of students with Swedish as a second language was performed. Thus, our samples of 119 OA-S and 119 UA-S were also twin-matched on the percentage of students with a first language other than Swedish. Based on this procedure, 25 over- and 25 underachieving classes were excluded, and two new groups of 94 overachievers and 94 underachievers matched on both SES and language were created (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411417376">Table 3</xref>). These two new groups of over- and underachieving classes, matched on both SES and language, will be referred to as OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L, respectively.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411417376">Table 4</xref> displays the mean differences between the 119 highest- and the 119 lowest-achieving classes in reading comprehension <italic>prior</italic> to matching for SES and language, a matching procedure that resulted in two new groups of 94 overachieving and 94 underachieving classes. Thus, these results were used in the process of validating the relevance of the methods chosen. Significant differences were indicated on all measurements: reading comprehension (<italic>t</italic>(236) = 44.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); the number of books in the home (<italic>t</italic>(236) = 14.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); the level of education (<italic>t</italic>(219) = 13.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); family income (<italic>t</italic>(219) = 10.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); and the percentage of students with a first language other than Swedish (<italic>t</italic>(193) = 9.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). From this table, it is clear that there are substantial differences between the highest- and lowest-performing classes among all the indexes for SES and language. These findings illustrate the need to control for both SES and language before it becomes meaningful to search for other factors that might account for differences between over- and underachieving classes.

<sec id="sec11-1468798411417376"><title>The reading comprehension test</title>
<p>The reading test consisted of a paper-and-pencil test with six texts from the IEA Reading Literacy study conducted in 1990–1 (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>). This reading comprehension test was very carefully tested in the IEA studies, it was also tested in a pilot study in Stockholm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468798411417376">Taube and Skarlind, 1997</xref>), and is still widely used in Swedish reading research. The maximum score in the test was 26 points. The reading material domains, intended to reflect different aspects of reading comprehension, were as follows:
<list id="list1-1468798411417376" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Narrative prose: continuous texts in which the authors’ aim was to tell a story, following a linear time sequence intended to entertain or involve the reader emotionally. A short fable and a lengthier story of more than 750 words were included, one of the passages had five items and the other had six. Chronbach’s <italic>α</italic> was .87.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Expository prose: a continuous text designed to describe, explain and/or convey information to the reader. This part of the test included one passage, with sixitems. Chronbach’s <italic>α</italic> was .88.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Documents: structured information presented as a map, a school timetable and a postcard. Students had to search, locate and process selected information rather than read a continuous test. Three texts were included, with two, three and four items respectively. Chronbach’s <italic>α</italic> was .85.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411417376"><title>Student and teacher questionnaires</title>
<p>Two questionnaires were employed in this study: one for the students and onefor the teachers. Questionnaires and tests were distributed to the class teachers and were then distributed to the students during lessons. Each questionnaire is described separately, below. More detailed descriptions of the questionnaires are provided in Appendices A, B and C. Both questionnaires also gathered personal data, such as gender and language background.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1468798411417376"><title>Teacher questionnaire</title>
<p>The teacher questionnaire contained a total of 29 questions. Nine questions gathered personal data and information on personal teaching experience, such as teacher continuity in the present class, number of years of teacher education and other post-secondary education, number of years of teacher experience, and in-service training required and completed (Appendix A). A total of 15 questions focused on classroom and class-related factors, such as class size, number of teachers in the class, number of students with divergent language backgrounds, whether it was a multi-graded class or not, classroom climate, access to libraries, number of students with reading and writing difficulties and, finally, resources in terms of specialized teachers, preschool teachers available, and so forth (Appendix B). Two questions focused on teachers’ perceptions of problems and the adequacy of existing resources in the classroom. One question gathered teachers’ ratings of five aspects of parental cooperation. Teachers were also asked to rate aims for teaching reading, to indicate methods used for reading instruction, the methods used for assessment and the frequencies of different reading stimulating methods used (Appendix A). Missing data in the teacher questionnaire ranged from 1%–6%, with the exception of the question on parental contacts where the omission rate was 20%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411417376"><title>Student questionnaire</title>
<p>The student questionnaire contained a total of 31 questions mainly covering background information, print activities, home literacy environment, self-rated reading ability and school activities (Appendix C). A total of eight questions focused on background information. There were seven questions focusing on the frequency with which students were engaged in print activities, including frequency of library use, parents’ preschool and present storybook reading and parents’ talking about print. Twoquestions focused on competing activities. Four questions enquired about the home literacy environment, including the presence of a daily paper, evening paper and the number of adult and children’s books at home. The questions concerning the number of books were illustrated with pictures of bookshelves containing different quantities of books. Three questions focused on self-rated reading ability. Seven questions focused on school conditions including five questions on the frequency with which students were engaged in print activities. Finally, two questions examined well-being in terms of friends and schoolwork (Appendix B).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1468798411417376"><title>Composite variables</title>
<p>To enable an overview of the results, we wanted to bring a simpler structure tothe wealth of questions measuring teacher, classroom and student characteristics (see Appendices A, B and C). To this end we performed exploratory factor analyses on questions within each variable in the two questionnaires (SPSS; Statistical Package for the Social Science, version 12.0.1 for Windows). These factor analyses were not performed on all the questions included in each questionnaire, but instead on the questions within each variable category. For example, there were four questions in the factor analyses creating the composite variable denoted ‘experiences of lessons’ (Appendix A). On the basis of these factor analyses, we created eight composite variables by calculating the sum of the scores for each question. The sum was then divided by the number of questions within each variable category. Following this procedure, a total of eight composite variables were created. One additional composite variable, teacher education, was created simply by adding the values of the two questions addressing subject knowledge and knowledge about teaching methods. One further composite variable was created for theneeds of resources by adding the answers from five dichotomous questions. Afinal composite variable for students’ early abilities was also created by adding the answers to four dichotomous questions.</p>
<p>The composite variables addressing teacher characteristics were teacher education (eigenvalue = 2.7), traditional parental cooperation (eigenvalue = 2.4), informal parental cooperation (eigenvalue = 1.2) and experiences of lessons (eigenvalue = 2.1). The composite variables measuring classroomcharacteristics were the needs of resources, the ability to meet demands (eigenvalue = 3.7), student attitudes (eigenvalue = 2.1), student–teacher relationships (eigenvalue = 1.7) and student–student relationships as perceived by the teachers (eigenvalue = 1.7). The last composite variables on student characteristics were students’ early abilities and voluntary reading (eigenvalue = 2.2). The remaining questions, labelled under different variables in the questionnaires, did not show a single-factor structure. Thus, these questions were treated as single independent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1468798411417376"><title>Statistics</title>
<p><italic>T</italic>-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for mean comparisons between over- and underachievers. The <italic>α</italic> level was set to <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 throughout the results section, due to multiple testing. In addition, because the total sample size for mean comparisons was approximately 200, rather unimportant differences between groups may be statistically significant. Therefore, we also calculated the magnitude of mean differences using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> as an effect-size measurement. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> below .40 is considered to be small, therefore we only comment on effect sizes above .40. Parametric statistics were performed on composite variables and for single questions when appropriate, while non-parametric statistics were used for single questions at the ordinal level. Several spot checks revealed no substantial differences between mean and median values for the composite variables and with respect to the sample size we decided to treat those variables as parametric measures.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1468798411417376" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>

Only significant differencesbetween OA-S and UA-S and OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L, respectively, will be presented. When significant differences were obtained, effect size measures (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> values) for those results were reported. When Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> values were smaller than .40, those results were excluded as the impact of those factors on the results were regarded as dismissible.

<p>Results concerning teacher-related characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411417376">Table 5</xref>. There was a significant difference between OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L in teacher continuity, indicating that more teachers in OA-S&amp;L classes had followed the same class during the first three years in school. Also,teacher experience seems to be an important factor distinguishing between overachieving and underachieving classes, matched for both SES and for SES and language. Informal contacts with parents seem to be a factor characterizing OA classes, at least for the classes matched for SES. More frequent use of drama distinguished OA-S&amp;L from UA-S&amp;L classes. The use of book reviews was more frequent in the OA-S classes as compared to UA-S classes matched for SES only. Finally, writing letters to the author in connection with reading fiction was more frequent in OA classes compared to UA classes, irrespective of the matching procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1468798411417376"><title>Classroom-related characteristics</title>
<p>Classroom characteristics distinguishing overachieving and underachieving classes are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468798411417376">Table 6</xref>. Students’ attitudes to peers were more positive in OA (S and S&amp;L) classes, as were teachers’ ratings of students’ peer relationships. OA (S and S&amp;L) teacher ratings of students’ attitudes towards schoolwork were higher compared to UA (S and S&amp;L) classes. Teachers rated their ability to meet demands as higher in the OA (S and S&amp;L) classes. Teachers in OA-S classes also rated their experiences from Swedish lessons more positively, but this difference was not significant when both SES and language factors were controlled for.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1468798411417376"><title>Student-related characteristics</title>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468798411417376">Table 7</xref>, overachieving classes (S and S&amp;L) were substantially more involved in voluntary reading activities compared with underachieving classes (S and S&amp;L). It is also evident that students in overachieving classes (S and S&amp;L) rated their own reading ability higher compared to students in underachieving classes (S and S&amp;L). There was also a difference between OA-S and UA-S in the number of daily hours of watching television, UA classes spending more hours at this activity. The curvilinear relationship observed in other studies was also observed here, indicating that more than three hours a day spent watching television may be linked to a decrease in reading results, although this difference disappeared when language was also controlled for. The presence of a daily paper was more frequent in OA classes (S and S&amp;L), irrespective of the matching approach.</p>

<p>With reference to the findings presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411417376">Tables 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468798411417376">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468798411417376">7</xref>, four main themes related to classroom, student and teacher characteristics seem to distinguish between overachieving and underachieving classes:
<list id="list2-1468798411417376" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>A positive classroom climate</italic>. Significant impact on the differences between OA and UAclasses was observed irrespective of the matching procedure, regarding more positive attitudes towards peers (as reported by both teachers and students), more positive teachers’ perceptions of students’ attitudes to schoolwork and teachers’ more positive perceptions of their chances of meeting the demands in the classroom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Experienced teachers with positive perceptions of their class.</italic> Significant impact on the differences between OA and UA classes was observed regarding teacher experience, irrespective of the matching procedure. On average, OA teachers had eight more years of teaching experience. Significant impact on the differences between OA and UA classes, matched for SES only, was reported in the measurement of teachers’ experiences from Swedish lessons, the experiences being reported as being more positive from the OA teachers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Extended voluntary reading.</italic> Significant impact on the differences between OA and UAclasses was observed regarding reading quantity. The students in the UA-S and UA-S&amp;L classes spent more hours a day watching television. Students in the OA-S and UA-S&amp;L classes invested more of their spare time in reading.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The use of authentic literature.</italic> Significant impact on the differences between OA and UAclasses was observed regarding teachers’ reports of more extensive use of drama (OA-S and OA-S&amp;L), more frequent writing of book reviews (OA-S) and more frequent writing of letters to the author (OA-S and OA-S&amp;L). Taking into consideration that the students engaged more in voluntary reading, the reading of larger amounts of authentic literature emerges as a characteristic of overachieving classes.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec23-1468798411417376" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sweden has often demonstrated relatively high homogeneity in literacy in several international comparative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411417376">Mullis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>). However, the results of this study indicate substantial classroom differences in reading achievement linked to SES and language factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411417376">Table 4</xref>). The distribution of family income and of students with Swedish as their second language were clearly linked to residential segregation in Stockholm. The conclusion that there is little purpose in examining the outcome of teachers’ or students’ work without controlling for SES and language is supported. As this was a study, the need for controlling for SES factors becomes obvious. However, the results also show that students’ high achievement may be linked to factors related to classroom and teacher characteristics.</p>
<sec id="sec24-1468798411417376"><title>A positive classroom climate</title>
<p>One interesting observation was that OA teachers reported their experiences from Swedish lessons as involving and inspiring, rather than frustrating and disappointing, as compared with the teachers in UA classes, when SES was controlled for (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468798411417376">Table 6</xref>). However, these experiences did not distinguish between classes when the language variable was adjusted for. This finding needs to be examined as it indicates that classroom teachers’ perceptions oftheir levels of involvement and frustration after their lessons in Swedish, in OA and UA classes, were linked to the ethnic composition in the classroom. In other words, this indicates an area of development as <italic>all</italic> Swedish teachers today, at some point in their career, will meet students who are using Swedish as their second language. Only when teachers are also properly educated in second language acquisition and are well prepared to handle multicultural classes will it be plausible to suppose that those feelings of frustration that the teachers reported will diminish. This finding also points to the importance of examining further the school discourse, including values and attitudes, as we know that teachers’ perceptions of their students may well influence students’ construction of their self-image.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1468798411417376"><title>Experienced teachers with positive perceptions of their class</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that teachers’ experience has an impact on reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411417376">Elley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411417376">OECD, 2001</xref>). These findings are replicated in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411417376">Table 5</xref>). One further finding was that teacher continuity discriminated between OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L classes. Teachers with overachieving classes are perhaps less likely to change jobs, compared to teachers working with more demanding classes. This indicates that teacher continuity might be aneffect of, rather than the cause of, student achievement. However, both these findings could indicate the importance of incorporating new teachers into mentor systems, thus encouraging new teachers to learn from more experienced teachers, thereby also promoting teacher continuity. Again, it should be noted that teachers’ perceptions of students do not develop in a void, but are embedded in discourses that may link different categories of students to certain expectations of achievement. Swedish as a second language is often viewed by teachers as a compensatory school subject. Therefore findings like these need to be further problematized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1468798411417376"><title>Extended voluntary reading</title>
<p>Students in OA classes reported higher frequencies of voluntary reading. Inaddition, scores on self-rated reading ability were higher, suggesting higher levels of self-efficacy in overachieving classes, which of course reflects their higher reading comprehension levels. However, differences were also found in the measurement of having a daily paper or not, indicating the impact of the home print environment. One major goal of compulsory schooling is to compensate for a less-advantaged home literacy environment and to encourage reading both in and out of school. Our findings emphasize the necessity to increase efforts to enhance reading both at school and at home. If teachers too closely link their pupils’ reading achievement to their individual abilities, and ignore sociocultural background factors, then the risk of sustaining inequitable power structures is obvious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1468798411417376"><title>Extended reading of authentic literature</title>
<p>The use of authentic literature was part of literacy teaching to a greater extent in OA classes as compared to UA classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411417376">Table 5</xref>). Also, the use of drama as a method emerged as a discriminatory factor after adjusting for the language variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411417376">Table 5</xref>). The link between the use of drama and positive literacy development does not seem to have been that thoroughly researched, although there are reports supporting this link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411417376">Miller et al., 2006</xref>). Although reading authentic literature may be a result of higher reading levels, our findings still imply that the use of authentic literature may be connected both to a greater quantity of reading and to high reading comprehension results. The view that reading for meaning is an important feature in the process of becoming a reader is sustained. These findings imply that alternative ways of working with fiction, such as drama, need to be paid further attention. Of course somestudents read in their spare time due to reading patterns developed at home and, as a result, will also be better readers at school. However, a tentative conclusion of these results may be that competent teachers find ways to connect classroom practices with the out-of-school world so that reading in students’ spare time may also be a result of classroom practice. In this view, interest in reading created in school may also lead to more reading at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1468798411417376"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Given that the sample of classes in this study was restricted to Stockholm city and its suburbs, it might be argued that it may not be possible to generalize from the present findings. A second potential problem in generalizing these findings might be that the data were collected seven to nine years ago. A third potential problem associated with representativeness might be that there are schools that may receive students from both high- and low-income residential sites in the same geographical area. However, the fact that the total sample comprised more than 1,000 classes distributed across 14 city districts, covering a wide range of socioeconomic and cultural factors, certainly helps when arguing that the present sample of classes should be representative of contemporary Sweden. It might also be argued that our sample of classes assessed some years ago might be even more representative as both ethnic and socioeconomic segregation generally display a linear increase from the beginning of the 1990s onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411417376">Gustafsson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As both teacher and student questionnaires rely on self-reported data, questions may be raised about reliability. However, a smaller later qualitative study validated the results reported here. It should also be noted that the present study does not provide support for causality. Teacher, classroom and student factors distinguishing between overachieving and underachieving classes might also be consequences of additional factors not included in the study. Institutional characteristics such as the role of school management and prerequisites for collaboration exemplify additional factors with a potential impact on student achievement. Of course, one question related to causality isthe difficulty of implementing the characteristics of effective schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411417376">Levin, 1995</xref>). Attempts to implement changes at the school level might simply be rejected without the teachers’ and students’ active and positive response to educational reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411417376">Joyce et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec29-1468798411417376" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The impact of several classroom, student and teacher characteristics frequently associated with successful reading achievement is reduced considerably by adjusting for socioeconomic levels and language background. For example, student factors such as the distribution of female and male students in theclassroom, the need for special education, and shared reading in the home didnot discriminate between OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L classes. However, a vast majority of the factors enquired about did not result in any significant differences between the two groups, a result we find reason to emphasize, as this lack of significance was also a result of controlling for SES and language. Additional classroom characteristics such as the number of teachers in the classroom, mixed-age classroom organization and access to a school library did not distinguish between OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L classes. Even several teacher characteristics often claimed to be important indicators of classroom performance, such as teacher education (i.e. years of education), aims and methods for reading instruction and, in general, methods used to stimulate literacy activities, did not turn out to be significantly different between OA-S&amp;L and UA-S&amp;L classes. One possible interpretation is that such differences do not exist when SES and language are controlled for. Another interpretation is that the instruments used were not able to capture the sometimes subtle differences of a qualitative character that may make a difference in students’ reading and language performance.</p>
<p>However, extended voluntary reading, classroom climate, teacher experience and the use of authentic literature <italic>did</italic> distinguish between overachieving andunderachieving classes beyond the impact of SES and language background, indicating these areas are prospective areas for further research.</p>
<sec id="sec30-1468798411417376"><title>Suggestions for further research</title>
<p>That teacher experience makes a difference leaves room for further questions about <italic>how</italic> teaching was carried out, for example <italic>how</italic> drama was employed, <italic>how</italic> classroom climate was created and <italic>how</italic> authentic literature reading was organized. As questions about the content of teaching and frequencies of literacy activities were asked here, perhaps answers to the <italic>how</italic> questions could also befound by the employment of qualitative methods. But is it possible to describe such phenomena as classroom climate in a large-scale statistical study? As activities, attitudes and climate in a classroom are context-bound qualities, the necessity of complementary small-scale qualitative studies is emphasized in order to study further how reading interest created in school may generate more reading in students’ spare time. How extended in-service training and extended teacher education regarding second language acquisition and multicultural issues would impact on teachers’ competence in handling multicultural learners is another area where more research and school development is needed if thebelief that mainstream classes in Sweden display diversity is to be taken seriously.</p>
