<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of surveillance and information-gathering technologies has almost invariably led to a marked change in the volume and complexity of information presented to a system’s operator. In turn, this change may compromise the capacity of the operator to sustain performance in complex and dynamic settings, particularly in activities related to discerning significant objects and events. Failure to notice changes in a visual scene—a phenomenon sometimes referred to as <italic>change blindness</italic> (CB)—has been identified as one of the key consequences of increasing load and is particularly relevant to many work-related dynamic environments, especially in situations characterized by severe constraints of time pressure, uncertainty, and high information load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, the consequences of missing a critical change during command-and-control (C2) operations (e.g., military operations, air traffic control, crisis response management), because of their safety-critical nature, may be disastrous (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812443066">Varakin, Levin, &amp; Filder, 2004</xref>). Most studies on change detection deal with static visual displays, and surprisingly little research has addressed complex dynamic contexts. This lack of research in dynamic contexts is remiss, given the likely practical impact. We adopt the approach of augmenting behavioral data on detection of events with the analysis of eye movements to study the deployment of attention in a simulated C2 task.</p>
<p>In typical CB experiments, participants are instructed to <italic>report explicitly</italic> any changes occurring in a static visual scene (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812443066">Henderson &amp; Hollingworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan, Deubel, Clark, &amp; Rensink, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720812443066">Rensink, O’Regan, &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812443066">Rensink, 2002</xref>, for a review), but such explicit detection tasks have been also applied to dynamic displays (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812443066">Bahrami, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812443066">Boot, Kramer, Becic, Wiegmann, &amp; Kubose, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812443066">Levin &amp; Simons, 1997</xref>). Indeed, considerable “blindness” has been observed when participants had to report explicitly any task-relevant changes occurring in the dynamic C2 environment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812443066">DiVita, Obermayer, Nugent, &amp; Linville, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812443066">Durlach &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812443066">Smallman &amp; St. John, 2003</xref>). For instance, in a simulated C2 battlefield environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812443066">Durlach and Chen (2003)</xref> found that change detection performance dropped from approximately 90% to approximately 50% when changes were contingent on the closing of a secondary task window.</p>
<p>Although the detection of important changes in real C2 environments is typically pivotal to the operator’s mission, more often than not, operational tasks are not required to be reported; rather, C2 operators can respond to critical changes without having to explicitly declare them, and instead, such information is bound up in tasks such as visual search, display manipulations, situation assessment, and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>). In other words, C2 operations usually involve <italic>implicit change detection</italic> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812443066">Triesch, Ballard, Hayhoe, &amp; Sullivan, 2003</xref>); that is, the detection of critical changes to the situation is intrinsic to the operator’s mission and does not require any explicit report of change. However, it is unclear to what extent the knowledge about CB in static and dynamic scenes can generalize to C2 multitasking situations in which change detection would be implicit to the operator’s tasks. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812443066">Boot et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated that minimizing eye movements over the display promotes change detection in dynamic scenes. However, the adoption of such scan strategy would be unthinkable in C2 situations, in which operators must perform multiple tasks concurrently and exploit the whole tactical display.</p>
<p>CB has been demonstrated in the context of relatively simple tasks in which participants were unaware that changes might happen (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812443066">Johansson, Hall, &amp; Sikström, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812443066">Triesch et al., 2003</xref>), revealing how task demands can affect the ability to notice changes. In extending the investigation of implicit change detection to dynamic displays, we use the Simulated Combat Control System (S-CCS) microworld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812443066">Lafond, Vachon, Rousseau, &amp; Tremblay, 2010</xref>), a simplified emulation that requires no particular expertise but that provides a functional simulation of the cognitive activities performed by a tactical coordinator aboard a ship, such as the threat-evaluation and combat-power management processes. In S-CCS, participants have to monitor a radar screen representing the airspace around the ship, evaluate the threat level of every aircraft moving in the vicinity of the ship on the basis of a list of parameters, and take appropriate defensive measures against hostile aircraft. Critical changes are inserted naturally in the S-CCS environment because change detection is intrinsic to the participant’s tasks.</p>
<p>As each scenario begins with no hostile aircraft, a critical change consists of an aircraft passing unexpectedly from a nonthreatening to a hostile status. Necessarily, participants must notice these critical changes to neutralize the hostile aircraft before being hit. Each critical change is accompanied by a change on the radar screen (i.e., a change in the direction and/or the speed of the aircraft) that makes it more visually noticeable. Change detection is assessed through the timeliness of the actions made in relation to the “new” hostile aircraft rather than the explicit report of a critical change. In other words, a critical change is considered detected when an action is performed on the aircraft within seconds after the change. This methodology can be viewed as a hybrid of the paradigms used to study CB (the failure to detect expected change) and a closely related phenomenon termed <italic>inattentional blindness</italic> (the failure to detect unexpected events; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720812443066">Mack &amp; Rock, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A widely held view is that change detection in a visual scene depends on the application of conscious attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812443066">Rensink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812443066">Simons &amp; Ambinder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812443066">Tse, 2004</xref>). To examine the role of attention in the context of an implicit change-detection C2 task, we used eye tracking as an index of attention allocation over the dynamic display. Although visual selective attention and the overt movements of the eyes can be dissociated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720812443066">Posner, 1980</xref>), they are nevertheless intrinsically related (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812443066">McCarley &amp; Kramer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812443066">Rayner, 2009</xref>). Indeed, “a fixation at a given location is strong evidence that attention has been there” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720812443066">McCarley &amp; Kramer, 2008</xref>, p. 99).</p>
<p>Because eye movements can index the deployment of attention, the technique of eye tracking has been useful in studying CB in static displays (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812443066">Hollingworth, Schrock, &amp; Henderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720812443066">McCarley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812443066">Triesch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812443066">Tse, 2004</xref>). For instance, some studies established that changes are more likely to be detected when occurring close to a fixated—that is, attended—position (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812443066">Hollingworth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>), and further research showed that directly fixating the changing object does not ensure successful detection of change, suggesting that attention is not always sufficient to enable change detection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812443066">Caplovitz, Fendrich, &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we recorded eye movements to characterize the interaction between attentional allocation over the visual scene and the ability to notice significant changes to dynamic displays. The enhancement of traditional behavioral data with nonobtrusive eye tracking data is of particular importance, given the implicit nature of the change-detection task. So, we compared critical changes for which at least one fixation was recorded before and/or after the change with those changes that were never fixated. Eye tracking data were also used in assessing whether change detection in dynamic display depends on fixation position on the visual scene at the moment a critical change arises. On the basis of previous work involving dynamic displays (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812443066">Boot et al., 2006</xref>), detection performance was anticipated to be worse for changes that occurred farther from the fixation location.</p>
<p>We also looked at the pupillary size in relation to critical changes. Pupil size has been studied in relation to many cognitive processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812443066">Beatty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812443066">Kahneman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720812443066">Wang, 2011</xref>) and may vary in response to changes in attentional effort (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812443066">Hoeks &amp; Levelt, 1993</xref>). Exploiting pupillometry in the context of change detection could be a good complement to studying eye fixation. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812443066">Privitera, Renninger, Carney, Klein, and Aguilar (2010)</xref> showed that pupil dilation was related to the detection of visual targets presented at fixation and found significant pupil dilation even for undetected targets.</p>

<title>Microworld</title>
<p>The S-CCS microworld is a low-level, computer-controlled simulation of single-ship naval above-water warfare. The simulation is dynamic and evolves according to a scenario in interaction with the operator’s actions. Typical scenarios of the S-CCS microworld involve multiple aircraft moving in the vicinity of the ship with possible attacks requiring retaliatory missile firing from the ship. A single participant plays the role of tactical coordinator who must observe and comprehend the operational space; conduct threat assessments, including the categorization and prioritization of threats; and plan and schedule the application of combat power. This microworld was a substrate that enabled us to generate displays, develop scenarios, and record the status of all objects and events. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812443066">Figure 1</xref> for a description of the various parts of the display. (A video of the S-CCS microworld can be viewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.co-dot.ulaval.ca">http://www.co-dot.ulaval.ca</ext-link>, in the Cognitive System Integration section.)</p>

<title>Task</title>
<p>As a tactical coordinator, participants performed three main subtasks. First, participants assessed the level of threat posed by an aircraft by classifying all aircraft as nonhostile, uncertain, or hostile. They were instructed to take into account 5 out of the 11 parameters displayed in the list: Origin, Altitude, Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF), Military Electronic Emissions, and Detection of Weapons. Each critical parameter can take either a threatening or a nonthreatening value. The number of threatening cues determines the threat level of an aircraft. The classification decision must be made according to the following classification rule: An aircraft is (a) nonhostile when it shows zero to one threatening cue, (b) uncertain when it manifests two to three threatening cues, and (c) hostile if it exhibits four to five threatening cues. None of the critical parameters was intrinsically more important than the others. When a decision was made, participants were required to click on the corresponding classification button. The white dot representing the selected aircraft changed color according to the level of threat assigned to it: green (nonhostile), yellow (uncertain), or red (hostile). However, since aircraft threat level could increase over time, participants had to check the parameters regularly to reassess the threat level, if appropriate.</p>
<p>The second task consisted of assessing the threat immediacy of all aircraft designated as hostile on the basis of their spatiotemporal proximity to the ship. Since hostile aircraft were programmed to hit the ship in the absence of any intervention, threat immediacy had to be evaluated by adding the parameter values for the time the aircraft will take to reach the closest point of approach (CPA) if its velocity remains constant, or time to CPA (TCPA), and CPA distance in units of time (CPAUT), that is, the time it will take the aircraft to hit the ship from the CPA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720812443066">Roy, Paradis, &amp; Allouche, 2002</xref>, for more details about “time before hit” computation). Participants had to determine whether the threat immediacy level was high (&lt;15 s from hitting the ship), medium (15 to 30 s), or low (&gt;30 s) and to click on the corresponding immediacy button (1 to 3, respectively). The third task was to defend the ship against hostile aircraft by launching an antimissile using the <italic>Engage</italic> button when the target was within range. A small white dot, representing the antimissile device, then appeared on the radar screen. Only one projectile could be airborne at a time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812443066">
<title>Change Detection</title>
<p>When an aircraft appeared on the radar screen, it was either nonhostile or uncertain (i.e., displaying fewer than four threatening cues). Its status could change during the course of the scenario to become hostile (i.e., displaying four to five threatening cues). Such changes were considered critical because hostile aircraft were programmed to hit the ship. A total of eight critical changes occurred unexpectedly in each scenario. Each critical change was accompanied by a change of either speed (i.e., an increase), direction (i.e., the aircraft is heading toward the ship), or both. A critical change was considered detected if the aircraft was selected and/or classified within the 15 s following this change. If no actions were made on a hostile aircraft within these 15 s, the change was considered undetected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018720812443066">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Following a tutorial describing the context of the simulation and the tasks, participants were asked to undertake threat-evaluation and threat-immediacy tasks for nine static screenshots to verify their understanding. Familiarity with the dynamic environment was established in two training sessions, each comprising four 4-min scenarios (or trials). After calibrating the eye tracking system, participants performed four randomly presented experimental blocks separated by 5-min rest periods. Each block comprised four 4-min scenarios of similar difficulty, presented randomly. Each scenario involved a set of 27 aircraft (11 nonhostile, 8 uncertain, and 8 hostile) varying in speed and trajectory. A maximum of 10 aircraft could appear on the radar screen at the same time.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0018720812443066" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Changes to aircraft parameters were examined in relation to whether they were fixated (i.e., attended) before and after the change as well as by the position of the gaze on the display at the moment of the change. We also looked at the impact of change detection on pupil size. Given that the nondetection of a shift toward a hostile status is expected to influence the participant’s capacity to adequately achieve his or her mission—that is, to correctly classify aircraft and to neutralize hostile aircraft—we examined whether the level of CB was related to classification and neutralization tasks. The alpha level was set at .05.</p>
<sec id="section16-0018720812443066">
<title>Change Detection</title>
<sec id="section17-0018720812443066">
<title>Fixated vs. nonfixated changes</title>
<p>Overall, 13.1% of critical changes were not detected; that is, no actions were recorded on the changed aircraft within the 15-s postchange period. Among the changes that received at least one postchange fixation (i.e., within 15 s after the change), which represent 91.7% of all critical changes, 7.2% remained undetected, but this percentage increased to 78.1% for changes that were never fixated after the change. (Overall, 1.8% of the critical changes were detected despite that no fixations were recorded on the changed aircraft after the change. Among those changes, 27% can be explained by the fact that the changed aircraft was either fixated before the change or already selected while the change occurred [e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812443066">Hollingworth &amp; Henderson, 2002</xref>]. This means that only 1.3% of critical changes were detected without being fixated, probably reflecting some action unrelated to the critical change, e.g., the action was planned before the change occurred, or the aircraft was the closest to the mouse at the moment the decision to act upon it was taken.)</p>

When considering prechange fixations (i.e., within 5 s before a critical change occurred), we found that 19.8% of nonfixated changes remained undetected, whereas this percentage dropped to 9.3% for changed aircraft fixated before the change. A change was 2.13 times more likely to be missed if not fixated before the change than if fixated, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 33.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Overall, 17.9% of the undetected changes were fixated both before and after the change, suggesting that looking at a changing object did not guarantee the detection of the change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the combined impact of pre- and postchange fixations on change detection, we dichotomized the proportion of undetected changes for each participant as a function of whether the changing aircraft has been fixated before and after the change. The results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812443066">Figure 2</xref>. A 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant effects of postchange fixation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 18) = 223.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and of prechange fixation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 18) = 6.33, <italic>p</italic> = .022, pointing to better detection for changing aircraft that were fixated before and/or after the change. The significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 18) = 4.79, <italic>p</italic> = .042, indicated that the beneficial impact of prechange fixation on change detection was more important for changed aircraft that were never fixated after the change than for those that received at least one postchange fixation.</p>

<title>Gaze position at the time of change</title>
<p>We turn now to examine whether change detection depends on gaze position when the change occurred in dynamic displays, as it does in static scenes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812443066">Hollingworth et al., 2001</xref>). First, we compared the distance, in pixels, separating gaze position from the changed aircraft between detected and undetected changes. The data revealed that undetected changes occurred, on average, farther away from gaze position (<italic>M</italic> = 213.68 pixels, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.36) than did detected changes (<italic>M</italic> = 148.31 pixels, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.98), <italic>t</italic>(18) = 12.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As in static displays, detection in dynamic displays increases as a function of gaze proximity to the changed object (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812443066">Hollingworth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The proportion of undetected changes varied with the distance between gaze position and the change. We delineated three distance intervals (i.e., 0 to 299 pixels, 300 to 699 pixels, and 700 or more pixels) and compared the proportion of undetected changes across these intervals. The results are presented on the left part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812443066">Figure 3</xref>. We used a stricter alpha level of .0167 to compensate for the increase in familywise error rate. The proportion of undetected changes significantly increased as a function of distance, <italic>F</italic>(2, 36) = 14.87, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Next, we verified whether this distance interval effect was applicable to fixated changes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812443066">Figure 3</xref>, change detection was no more modulated by the position of the gaze at the time of the change when the changing aircraft was fixated either before, <italic>F</italic>(2, 36) = 1.20, <italic>p</italic> = .298, or after the change, <italic>F</italic>(2, 36) = 0.93, <italic>p</italic> = .354.</p>

<p>The percentage change in pupil size (PCPS) after the change was computed, which is the average pupil size within the 15-s interval after the change minus the average pupil size in the 15 s preceding the change (i.e., the baseline), was divided by the baseline (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812443066">Beatty, 1982</xref>).

<title>Performance</title>
<p>A range of measures associated with the classification and neutralization tasks were recorded and related to change detection. Accordingly, we extracted the proportion of correct classifications as well as a measure of defensive effectiveness, namely, the proportion of time the ship was hit by a hostile aircraft. Given that CB has been previously associated with poorer decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812443066">Creaser, Edwards, Uggerslev, &amp; Caird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812443066">Gabaude et al., 2009</xref>), we expected to find a negative relationship between the proportion of undetected changes and classification accuracy. Using a one-tailed test, we found such a negative correlation, <italic>r</italic>(17) = −.406, <italic>p</italic> = .042, indicating that classification accuracy tended to be lower when undetected changes were more frequent. We also computed the same correlation separately for fixated and nonfixated changes. The negative relationship between change detection and classification accuracy appeared to be confined to those changes that were never fixated, as the correlation was still moderate for nonfixated changes, <italic>r</italic>(17) = −.640, <italic>p</italic> = .002, but was not significant for fixated changes, <italic>r</italic>(17) = .024, <italic>p</italic> = .461.</p>
<p>Conversely, we expected CB to be positively associated with defensive effectiveness, as newly hostile aircraft are more likely to reach the ship if never detected. Consistently, a strong positive (one-tailed) relationship was observed between the proportion of undetected changes and the proportion of ship hits, <italic>r</italic>(17) = .776, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, indicating that the more changes that remained undetected, the more the ship was hit by hostile aircraft. When computing the same correlation separately for fixated and nonfixated changes, the positive relation between change detection and defensive effectiveness was mainly attributable, this time, to those changes that were fixated. Indeed, whereas the correlation was still strong for fixated changes, <italic>r</italic>(17) = .646, <italic>p</italic> = .001, it was not significant for nonfixated changes, <italic>r</italic>(17) = .225, <italic>p</italic> = .177.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results indicated that the capability to implicitly detect critical changes appeared strongly affected by the pattern of eye movements over the dynamic display. Critical changes were more likely to remain unseen if the eye never looked directly at the changed aircraft in the moments preceding or following the change. If one assumes that eye movements can index the allocation of attention over a display (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720812443066">Rayner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720812443066">Tse, 2004</xref>), such findings are consistent with the notion that attention is required for conscious change perception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812443066">Simons &amp; Ambinder, 2005</xref>). Although fixated (i.e., attended) changes were more likely to be noticed than were nonfixated (i.e., unattended) changes, attention to a changing aircraft did not seem sufficient for change detection, as almost 18% of undetected changes were fixated both before and after the change occurred.</p>
<p>There is evidence that changes to attended objects can often remain unnoticed in both static (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812443066">Caplovitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720812443066">Williams &amp; Simons, 2000</xref>) and dynamic scenes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720812443066">Levin &amp; Simons, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720812443066">Simons &amp; Levin, 1998</xref>), suggesting that looking at something does not mean one sees it. To account for such findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al. (2000)</xref> proposed that “what an observer ‘sees’ at any moment in a scene is not the <italic>location</italic> he or she is directly fixating with the eyes, but the <italic>aspect</italic> of the scene he or she is currently attending to” (p. 209). As such, the elements of the scene that are attended to appear to be determined by behavioral goals and task demands (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720812443066">Triesch et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in our dynamic display, some fixated changes went undetected because at the time the changing aircraft was fixated, participants were engaged in cognitive activities that did not require allocating attentional resources to that particular aircraft (e.g., searching for or evaluating the threat or immediacy level of another aircraft).</p>
<p>Importantly, there was a double dissociation found between fixated and nonfixated changes. On one hand, fixation position on the display at the moment of change modulated the detection of nonfixated changes but not that of fixated changes. On the other hand, the pupillary response was sensitive to undetected changes that were fixated but not to those that were never fixated. A similar pattern of results was also observed with performance: Classification accuracy was correlated only with the detection of nonfixated changes, whereas defensive effectiveness covaried only with the detection of fixated changes.</p>
<p>Such dissociation points toward two distinct sources of CB in dynamic displays. The first source relates to the allocation of attention to critical changes. As previously put forward for static scenes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812443066">Rensink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812443066">Simons &amp; Ambinder, 2005</xref>), unattended changes are less likely to be consciously perceived and, consequently, more likely to remain undetected. The “no attention” source of CB would be responsible for the failure to detect nonfixated changes. That the probability of detecting a nonfixated (i.e., unattended) change diminished as a function of fixation distance from the change location is consistent with this interpretation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812443066">Hollingworth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>). In fact, this relationship between fixation position and nonfixated change detection likely reflects the preferential allocation of visual attention to fixated objects. Changes occurring in the peripheral region of the visual field appear less likely to be attended and, hence, perceived than do changes happening closer to the foveal region where overt attention is focused.</p>
<p>The other source of CB is highlighted by pupillometry: An attended change can be missed because of a failure of attentional processes. Pupil dilation has been associated with increased attentional processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812443066">Hoeks &amp; Levelt, 1993</xref>); accordingly, significant dilation for changes undetected but fixated suggests that despite the failure to consciously detect fixated changes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720812443066">Privitera et al., 2010</xref>), some attentional effort was generated in response to the changed aircraft. That pupil response to fixated undetected changes was smaller than that to detected changes may be taken as evidence of impaired attentional processing of changed objects. More specifically, we propose that such impairment pertains to automatic detection processes. Attended visual transients triggered by a critical change are more likely to be automatically (i.e., unconsciously) detected by the cognitive system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>) and to then generate a “call for attention” toward it for further processing.</p>
<p>There is recent evidence that automatic processes can be dependent on top-down attentional control and then can be severely limited during multitasking, when task demands are high (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812443066">Kiefer &amp; Martens, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720812443066">Logan &amp; Gordon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720812443066">Vachon &amp; Jolicoeur, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720812443066">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720812443066">Vachon, Tremblay, &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>). Thus, it is likely that this automatic “call for attention” remains unanswered in complex dynamic situations because attentional processes are overloaded by the need to process multiple sources of information that are constantly evolving under time constraints and high cognitive load, leading to the failure to consciously detect the change. Whereas this attention-failure source of CB is believed to be more specific to complex dynamic situations, the nondetection of unattended changes is more likely to occur in both static and dynamic scenes.</p>
<p>In typical CB experiments, the failure of change detection is much more likely if the change coincides with a visual distraction, such as a flash, a partial occlusion, or distractors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720812443066">Rensink, 2002</xref>). The goal of these visual disruptions, especially in static scenes, is to prevent the reception of visual transient signals that are typically used by the visual system to detect changes by automatically directing attention away from them (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720812443066">Simons &amp; Ambinder, 2005</xref>). However, another key finding of the present study was the demonstration that CB in dynamic displays can arise without contingent visual distraction (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812443066">Bahrami, 2003</xref>). Indeed, critical changes were not made concomitant with extraneous, imposed visual disturbances. Such a result is likely to ensue from the fact that in C2 environments, observers have to deal with a high load of visual information constantly evolving over time.</p> <p>That is, multiple changes and, consequently, numerous visual transients occur concurrently across the visual field at every moment. These transients compete for attention with the localized transient that was produced by the critical change, consequently reducing the propensity of that change to pop out from the scene and, hence, minimizing its detectability (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720812443066">O’Regan et al., 2000</xref>). Accordingly, under “normal” circumstances, when there is no control over the presentation of distracting visual information, C2 environments would be more propitious to CB than would static scenes. Of course, one would expect to see more undetected changes in dynamic displays if they coincide with a visually distracting event (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812443066">Boot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812443066">DiVita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812443066">Durlach &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>), but the fact remains that visual distraction does not seem necessary for CB to occur in dynamic scenes.</p>
<p>In a real C2 situation, optimal performance is critical for safety purposes. Importantly, the tendency for an operator to fail to detect critical events occurring right where he or she is looking could be amplified by the fact that people are generally unaware of the CB phenomenon and tend to overestimate their ability to detect change (a phenomenon known as <italic>CB blindness</italic>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720812443066">Levin, Momen, Drivdahl, &amp; Simons, 2000</xref>). To reduce the potential negative effects of CB, one solution may lie in the design of supportive tools for change detection in complex dynamic situations (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812443066">Durlach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720812443066">St. John &amp; Smallman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720812443066">Varakin et al., 2004</xref>). So far, change-detection tools have been designed mainly to attract attention toward the critical events occurring in the visual scene. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720812443066">Smallman and St. John (2003)</xref> developed the Change History EXplicit (CHEX) tool, which employs automation for assisting change awareness during the active monitoring of airspace activity. By automatically detecting and logging every change in a flexibly-sorted table added to the operator’s interface and by linking each entry in that table to the corresponding object on the geospatial display, the CHEX tool has been proven effective in supporting explicit change detection (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720812443066">St. John et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Such effectiveness remains to be demonstrated in the context of an implicit change-detection task, as the addition of a new source of information may amplify information overload and, consequently, hinder the proper execution of the operator’s main tasks. Moreover, the present study proposes that failure of automatic attentional processes can also contribute to CB in dynamic displays. It is not clear whether a tool such as CHEX could help to overcome such attentional failure. In fact, if the extraction of visual information is degraded, it is possible that the extraction of the information logged in the CHEX tool suffers the same complications. Conversely, the fact that the information displayed in the table is continuously accessible may reduce the negative impact of temporary attentional breakdowns. This effect remains to be tested. Nevertheless, the present findings suggest that designers of change-detection tools should not only focus on promoting the allocation of attention to critical changes but also consider risks of attentional failure as well as the factors that enhance them.</p>
