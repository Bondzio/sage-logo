<abstract>
<p>Change in health behaviors requires motivation on the part of the individual. The aim of this article is to compare elements of the motivation process across cultures. A secondary aim is to determine whether a Western model of behavior change for health promotion, such as the PRECEDE–PROCEED model, can be applied to Asian populations. An integrative review and critical analysis of research literature was done by reviewing 20 studies with observational survey design and 6 integrative literature reviews. Findings show that the motivation process is similar for Eastern and Western cultures, but the motivators are different. The findings identify 10 motivators, congruent with Asian culture, that would allow the PRECEDE–PROCEED model to be used in Asian settings.</p>

<p>Motivation is an intrinsic process, impulse, or intention that, once stimulated by the motivator, moves a person to the point of readiness to act. Motivators are defined as intrinsic or extrinsic stimulators, which act as catalysts to spark the motivation process, break down barriers, and raise the benefits of an action. Given these definitions, it might seem like motivation is the property of academia, but in reality, motivation is a concept that many people use daily.</p>
<p>In the community health and development fields, one hears about hundreds of cross-cultural health-related programs and projects that look theoretically sound on paper, but do not produce behavioral changes in the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611433869">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks, Madanat, Merrill, Goudy, &amp; Miyagawa, 2003</xref>). Donors, facilitators, nurses, and administrators bemoan the fact that participants are not accessing their programs, or are accessing them but not following through with expected behavioral changes. Reasons proposed for these failures include that projects are offered at the wrong times, their location is inconvenient, the cost is too high, or there is no transportation. The problem with these explanations is that the same groups often do access other programs that have the same location, transportation, or time inconveniences. Nurses speak of the need to motivate their noncompliant patients but bemoan the fact that many remain noncompliant. Nursing instructors strive to help their students learn but are often left wondering why they do not see the success rate their efforts should merit. When the reasons are reduced to the basics, many agree that a lack of motivation is the root cause, the other causes are barriers that can be overcome through motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433869">Cohen-Mansfield, Marx, &amp; Guralnik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611433869">Papacharisis &amp; Goudas, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>To clearly elucidate the problem, however, the cause of the lack of motivation must be specified. In America today, it is rare that a health care provider does not work with people who have emigrated from Asia. Thus, the cause of the lack of motivation must be studied not just through Western eyes but also cross-culturally. Are motivators the same for every culture? Can the same behavior-change/health promotion models be used worldwide? If change is needed to adapt the models for cross-cultural use, what changes need to occur? Nurses and other health care providers need to be culturally competent. One step in gaining cultural competence is understanding cross-cultural motivation. This review aims to help fill this knowledge gap and in so doing give nurses the means to more effectively motivate their clients.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043659611433869">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Motivation is a global concept, but no review can consider all cultures. This review will be limited to the Asian context. Because Asia is not just one country or culture, it is necessary to explore motivation in several Asian countries. The literature in this review includes studies done with Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Bengali, Chinese, Japanese, and Singaporean populations.</p>
<sec id="section2-1043659611433869">
<title>PRECEDE–PROCEED Model</title>
<p>Because this review deals not only with the identification of Asian motivators and the motivation process, but also with their use in the PRECEDE–PROCEED model, it is necessary to consider this model. The PRECEDE–PROCEED model was chosen because it has been validated over years, has been used cross-culturally, and is motivation based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433869">Green, Kreuter, Deeds, &amp; Partridge, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>The acronym of the chosen model is PRECEDE (predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling constructs in education/ecological diagnosis and evaluation) and PROCEED (policy, regulatory, and organizational constructs in educational and environmental development). The motivators in this model can be identified as predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors. The motivators influence the behavioral element, which leads to the outcome. In this model, health promotion strategies (health education and policy regulations) are considered in their role of activating the motivators. This is logical when one considers that this is really an organizational model. This model is used more often in health planning, promotion, and evaluation on an organizational level than on an individual level; however, the organizational goal is health promotion for the individual. If the health promotion strategies activate the motivators and the motivators spark the motivation process, the outcome will be a healthy behavioral change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611433869">Green &amp; Kreuter, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1043659611433869">
<title>Motivation and Motivators</title>
<p>Most would agree with the basic definitions of motivation and motivators and that a lack of motivation is the root cause for the lack of participant behavior changes in many health related or health promotion programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611433869">Aday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433869">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611433869">Papacharisis &amp; Goudas, 2003</xref>). In addition, many health care workers realize that for a solution to be identified the cause of the lack of motivation must be specified. Researchers have found that not everyone is motivated by the same motivator. Thus, a lack of motivation can be due to the use of ineffective motivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433869">Daly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand, Erez, &amp; Ayan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger, Chatziasarantis, Barkoukis, Wang, &amp; Baranowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433869">Hamamura, Meijer, Heine, Kamaya, &amp; Hori, 2009</xref>). Culture must be considered when choosing effective motivators. In Asian cultures, motivators such as negative role models, group identity, self-regulation, and harmony spark the motivation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433869">Hamamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433869">Klassen, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A literature review was conducted using the databases of CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing Academic, Academic Search Elite, Cochrane Library, PsyArticles (EBSCO), Psychology (CSA), Social Sciences Abstracts (OCLC), ScienceDirect, Sociological Abstracts (CSA), Wiley InterScience, and Annual Reviews with both nursing and sociology as subjects and the key words Asian culture, Asian motivators, and Asian motivation with search limits requiring that the study be in English and be published between 2001 and 2009. The reference lists of selected literature were reviewed for possible additional sources. The results were 20 observation survey design studies, which had sample sizes from 52 to 110,991 individuals and 2 case studies of organizations, and 6 integrated literature reviews. With one exception, all were peer-reviewed studies. The study that was not peer reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>) was allowed as it presented a good insider view. The identified literature was then read and findings were categorized through secondary analysis into findings related to Asian cultures, motivators, and the motivation process and its components. Most authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433869">Daly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433869">J.

<title>Asian Cultural Components Influencing Motivation</title>
<p>The main cultural component studied is that of collectivism. Terminology varied, but a common definition emerged. Collectivism is seen as a view of culture in which people are so interdependent and closely related that they unconsciously influence others through emotions and behavior, and are, in turn, influenced by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433869">Daly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433869">B.

<p>A second cultural characteristic that was identified by some studies as an Asian cultural component is their desire to conform to norms. For cultures with this component, the need to belong is often seen as directly related to conforming to the norms of society. Those who do not conform do not belong, because they are too autonomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433869">Daly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433869">B. Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433869">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433869">Li &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433869">Lockwood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611433869">Shin, Yun, &amp; Pender, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433869">Tsuda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659611433869">Wu &amp; Pender, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The third characteristic is composed of four components, which are filial piety, hierarchical family structure, deference to authority, and humility. In the first three, submission is seen, but they differ in the persons to whom one submits. The fourth component is submission/sublimation of oneself in general. Strong self-efficacy beliefs and autonomy are seen as the opposite of this component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433869">B.

<p>The fourth characteristic is emotional restraint. The authors, who spoke about this component of Asian culture, defined it as manifesting an attitude of emotional control and not showing strong emotions in public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433869">B. Kim &amp; Hong, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611433869">
<title>Asian Motivators</title>
<p>Studies included in this integrative review identified and described 10 motivators within Asian culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611433869">Table 1</xref>). The first motivator is the use of negative role models. Studies found that Asians respond strongly to the fear and threat of failure seen in negative role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433869">Hamamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433869">Klassen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433869">Lockwood et al., 2005</xref>). They act to prevent being the negative role model. Role models that present a positive outcome and endeavor to stimulate by positive promotion do not motivate the Asian population. Thus, avoidance is a stronger motivator than approach. The studies found that this fact is related to the importance of deference and conformity to cultural norms present in Asian culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433869">Klassen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611433869">Liu, Wang, Tan, Ee, &amp; Koh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433869">Lockwood et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>The second motivator is avoidance of being different. It was found that Asians prefer conformity rather than adoption of something different, unknown, or contrary to cultural norms. They will change behavior to avoid being different or avoid facing the unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433869">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433869">Tsuda, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The third motivator deals with the issue of choice as a motivator. It was found that if Asians are given behavioral choices, they will probably not be motivated to change. If, on the other hand, a behavior is chosen for them by an authority figure, they will change in accordance with the decision. Researchers found that this is linked to the cultural preference for deference to authority, filial piety, hierarchical family structure, and humility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433869">Daly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433869">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433869">Li &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659611433869">Yan &amp; McCullagh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth motivator is self-regulation. At first, this might sound like a motivator related to an individualistic society rather than a collective society, but such is not the case. Self-regulation is defined as the internalization of values to the point that they control one’s behavior without outside influence. In a culture that has the components of collectivism and conformity to norms, it is not surprising that values are internalized and thus become intrinsic motivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433869">D’Ailly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433869">Hamamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The fifth motivator that was described is group autonomy. Although self-autonomy is a motivator in individualistic societies, societies with collectivism as a value are not without autonomy, it is just manifested differently. In collective societies, individuals are motivated to act if they can act as part of a group. Thus, to an Asian, group activity is motivational and beneficial. It is not viewed as a barrier as it might be in an individualistic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611433869">Chirkor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433869">Gore, Cross, &amp; Kanagawa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433869">J.

<p>The sixth motivator is group identity. This speaks very strongly of the collectivism and conformity to norms present in the Asian culture. Researchers found that collectivism and conformity to norms lead to group identity, and thus a culture, which values collectivism and conformity to norms, will also value group identity. In Asian culture, the desire for group identity is so strong that one will be motivated to act in such a way as to obtain it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433869">J. Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433869">Klassen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433869">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433869">Scholz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433869">Tsuda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043659611433869">Wang, Hagger, &amp; Liu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659611433869">Yan &amp; McCullagh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The seventh motivator is physical pleasure. This pleasure, however, is not individualistic as in the Western culture but rather is related to the environment or society. Thus again the cultural component of collectivism is seen as determining the shape of a motivator. Individualists eat something because they like it, it does not matter if others like it or not. Asians eat and find pleasure in foods that their culture defines as pleasurable. They will not try a food unless others among their family or friends also like it and get pleasure from eating it. The researchers found that in the Asian culture the motivator of pleasure must be linked to society if it is to be motivational. A behavior change will be encouraged because it brings pleasure to a group, not because it brings pleasure to an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433869">Hawks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659611433869">Yan &amp; McCullagh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The eighth motivator is self-effacement. Researchers found that the Asian population is more motivated to act if the action proposed allows them to be self-effaced. A humble person is esteemed in Asian culture, so if one wants to give themselves a positive image in society they will do it through self-effacement rather than through self-enhancement as an individualist does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433869">J. Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433869">Klassen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433869">Scholz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611433869">Tsuda, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The ninth motivator is other-oriented self-efficacy. Self-efficacy has been defined as the belief that one can successfully perform a task. At first this appears to be a motivator only in an individualistic culture, but several researchers found that it is a motivator in both Western and Eastern cultures. In all cultures if one believes that the barriers to a behavioral change are insurmountable, the person will not attempt it. On the other hand, if one believes that they can do it (self-efficacy), the person will be motivated to try it. Researchers found that although both cultures have self-efficacy beliefs that serve as motivators to action, the difference is in how they are formed. Individualists develop self-efficacy by what they believe about themselves and what they have accomplished in the past. Collectivists develop their self-efficacy by feedback from others.

<p>The tenth and final motivator is social harmony. Asians will act to bring harmony. They seek harmony. Therefore, harmony is a strong motivator. Researchers found that if an action is seen as bringing harmony, it will spark the motivation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433869">Kam-shing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433869">Lim, 2004</xref>; Tsuda, 2002).</p>

<title>Motivation Process</title>
<p>The findings show that the Western and Eastern motivation processes are basically the same. It is only the motivators that are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611433869">Arlelt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433869">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611433869">Ginsberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433869">Hamamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433869">Lane, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433869">Scholz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611433869">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659611433869">Wu &amp; Pender, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611433869">Zhang &amp; Oetzel, 2006</xref>). These findings open the possibility of using Western motivation-based health promotion models in the Asian setting. Several researchers have tested models for usefulness cross-culturally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433869">Hagger et al. (2005)</xref> created a transcultural model using the theory of planned behavior with an added self-determination component. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611433869">Shin et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659611433869">Wu and Pender (2002)</xref> used the Health Promotion Model. All three groups found the models to be a good fit. Since these models share a number of components with the PRECEDE–PROCEED model, it argues that this model also will prove useful.</p>

<title>Application to Model</title>
<p>In applying the finding of the literature review to the PRECEDE–PRECEED model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043659611433869">Figure 1</xref>), one must begin at the right of the model and continue to the left through Phases 1 to 4. This is the assessment and planning stages of a program.</p>

<title>Social Assessment</title>
<p>The first phase assesses the quality of life. In reviewing the assessment results, one is endeavoring to discover elements that need to change in order to obtain a higher quality of life. Cultural competency plays an important role, for the same life quality will not be rated the same in every culture. Although the individualist prefers a home inhabited by the nuclear family, the collectivist likes the extended family all together in a three or four room house. The individualist sees the collectivist as being crowded, whereas the collectivist sees the individualist as isolated. In planning a health promotion program one needs to determine the elements that must change and those that are different from one’s own culture, but do not need to change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043659611433869">
<title>Epidemiological Assessment</title>
<p>The second phase is the epidemiological assessment. The components of the model considered in this phase could be likened to repositories whose content, when activated, leads to changes in the quality of life either directly or indirectly through the health component. Of the four components, genetics, behavior, environment, and health, the health component is unique for it is activated by the other three, but it does not act on any of the other three. The health status of the target population can thus be changed by genetic factors, behavior, and environment. In assessing the health status of a population, with a view to planning a health promotion program, it is important to note that one’s view of what constitutes good health is culturally influenced. As strange as it may seem to the Western mind-set, not all cultures would agree that the absence of disease constitutes health. Some in the Cambodian and Vietnam region would see diseases, such as epilepsy, as indicative of spiritual power and thus not necessarily something to be controlled too tightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611433869">Fadiman, 1997</xref>). The next three components in this phase (environment, behavior, and genetics) are interrelated and when activated will lead, directly or indirectly, to changes in the quality of life. In the adapted model, the environment is the culture. Culture spawns certain norms (collectivism, conformity to norms, submission/sublimation, and emotional restraint), which in turn become the source/determinants of behavioral norms. The behavioral norms, in turn, influence the environment (culture), so that the norms become the characteristics by which Asian culture is characterized. The third component is genetics, which, like environment, is interrelated with behavior. The same cultural norms that are the source/determinants of behavior also influence how one views/treats those with genetic defects. How one is viewed, in turn, influences how one reacts/behaves. Thus, one would expect that a collectivist culture would treat individuals with visible disabilities differently than an individualist society would. This is an important consideration in planning a health promotion program. Genetics can also stimulate a particular behavior for it can become a predisposing motivator. An example would be Alpha-Thalassemia, which tends to occur in those of African or Asian descent and which leads to anemia and fatigue, listlessness, and cardiac failure. These symptoms become a predisposing motivator that can lead to dependency behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043659611433869">
<title>Educational and Ecological Assessment</title>
<p>The third phase is the educational and ecological assessment. How one learns and reacts to the environment is culturally determined. In the PRECEDE–PROCEED model the word motivator does not occur, but rather the authors use the words predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling. That is exactly what motivators do. Motivators predispose one to an action, provide reinforcement for a particular action so that one is motivated to act, and enable one to act by providing the necessary support or lowering the barriers to an action. When the Asian motivators, identified in the findings of this integrative review, are compared with these elements of the model, they fit well. The Asian motivators of negative role models and avoidance-of-the-different fit with the reinforcing element of the model, it is these motivators that assure Asians that they are acting correctly. The Asian motivators of other-decided choice, group autonomy, group identity, other-orientated self-efficacy, and group-orientated physical pleasure fit into the enabling factors of the model. These are the motivators that support individuals in their action and assure them they are not acting alone. The Asian motivators of self-regulation, harmony, and self-effacement fit the predisposing factors of the model for they are culturally engrained in an individual from childhood. Thus, to motivate someone toward a healthier quality of life, it is crucial to choose a motivator that has been identified as one that will trigger the motivational process in the target culture.</p>
<p>A Western nurse learned the importance of using an appropriate motivator very early in work in Bangladesh. She had learned the language and set up a village maternal/child health program with the help and advice of the community and the development staff. One day she went with her national assistant to a village. They visited a baby who was a few weeks old and was not thriving. The mother said she was not breast-feeding as it was difficult. The bottle was easier. There was another woman with a very healthy baby sitting not far away. The nurse began to extol the value of breast-feeding and told her, “If you want your baby to be healthy like this one, you should breast-feed.” The mother’s expression was polite but noncommittal. The assistant left for a few minutes and came back with a very thin baby. She approached the mother and abruptly stated, “If you don’t want your baby to look like this you had better breast-feed.” The nurse was shocked. Was this the gentle polite assistant talking? About a week later, they visited again. Sure enough the mother had conquered the difficulties and was breast-feeding. The two strategies look similar on the surface, but the assistant used an appropriate motivator and succeeded, whereas the Western nurse used the wrong motivator and failed to stimulate a change.</p>
<p>The model also shows that the three elements (reinforcing, enabling, and predisposing) interact. This is definitely true of motivators. A motivator that is reinforcing, such as negative role models, can spark behavior directly, but it can also interact with an enabling motivator such as group identity and, on the strength of this interaction, activate the behavior.</p>
<p>When another nurse set up a maternal/child health program for women in Bangladesh, the health equipment was to be shared by two or three groups. The health agent was to use the equipment and then take it to the next group. The box was not heavy and the distance was only three or four blocks. From the beginning, the health agents came up with excuses. There was not time to get it from group to group. The nurse changed the meeting times to allow several days in between meetings. Then the nurse provided transportation money for the rickshaws, to no avail. Finally, the health agents told the nurse that women in Bangladesh do not carry anything larger than a purse outside the home. If they do, it says they are poor or do not have a good husband to care for them (negative role model motivated them not be like that). This motivator was strengthened by interacting with the group identity enabler, for these health agents were part of the cooperative savings group and needed to conform to keep their group identity. So they were given less equipment in a small box of their own. Problem solved. The program flourished.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043659611433869">
<title>Administrative and Policy Assessment</title>
<p>The final phase in assessment is to assess the policy and plan the program. The planning must take into account the assessment results from earlier assessment phases. It is not enough to know which motivators to use; one must also implement strategies that truly enable the proper motivators. In a treatment program for latent TB infection, nurses were told that the Vietnamese clients believed that the medication prescribed was “hot” in the yin and yang conception of health/harmony. Often, clients and their families added traditional cooling foods to their diet to counteract the hot effect of the medications and establish harmony in their environment. Some of the nurses started encouraging patients to include more fruits and vegetables in their diets to balance hot side effects. This recommendation was fairly broad and did not recognize the specific traditional “cold” foods the patients would typically use. At the time, a medical anthropologist was visiting patients’ homes along with an interpreter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433869">Ito, 1999</xref>). She reported back to the program that one patient heard the nurse’s advice about adding fruits and vegetables, but thought it meant adding American salads to her diet and thus rejected the advice as not appropriate to balance the medication prescribed. The patient did not take the medication because it was too hot. The nurses knew that the yin and yang concept of harmony needed to be used as a motivator, but because they did not fully understand it, their strategy did not enable/trigger this motivator and the patient did not take the medication. At the time, interpreters were used to provide straightforward interpretation of medical information. When this was changed and community workers and interpreters were encouraged to provide culturally clearer explanations such as naming traditional cold foods rather than saying fruits and vegetables, the results changed. The strategy triggered the motivator of harmony and the medication compliance rate improved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043659611433869">
<title>Implementation and Evaluation</title>
<p>In Phase 5, the program is implemented and then the evaluation, Phases 6 to 8, begins. If the program was planned correctly it will use techniques/strategies that trigger/use the Asian motivators, which in turn act in a culturally appropriate manner to enable behavioral change to take place (spark the motivation process), which will lead to the desired outcome (positive change in health status and/or quality of life). Although all the components are influenced by culture, the motivators are key, as the above examples show. It is during the evaluation phase that one must not only look at the outcomes but also consider whether the outcomes are those that fulfill the goals of the program. If they are not, changes need to be made. A thorough review of the motivators is a key area with which to start, for as this literature review and adapted model show, motivation is a universal process, but Asian motivators and Western motivators are not the same.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This review has implications in three main areas for nurses and others who serve the public. First, it speaks to the area of cultural competency. Nurses care for patients of different ethnic groups every day. Many of these patients are Asians. In 2000, there were 12 million Asian Americans, a 72% increase since 1990, and by 2050, 10% of Americans will be of Asian descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433869">B. Kim &amp; Hong 2004</xref>). Cultural competency is an awareness of one’s own culture, the recognition of cultural differences, and the adaptation of one’s behavior to accommodate differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>). One could restate it as an awareness of one’s own culture, the recognition that different cultures respond to different motivators, and the ability to adapt one’s behavior to accommodate these differences by selecting culturally congruent motivators. An understanding of motivators can help nurses deal with the significant issue of noncompliant patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611433869">Christensen &amp; Kockrow, 2006</xref>). If nurses take the time to understand the cultural issues, they will understand why the patient is noncompliant, be able to adapt the medical regimen to include only essential elements, and be able to apply appropriate motivators to avoid demotivation. The example of the issue of breast-feeding illustrates this concept. The assistant knew the importance of breast-feeding and which motivators were culturally appropriate, whereas the nurse knew the importance of breast-feeding, but used the wrong motivator.</p>
<p>Second, health promotion and disease prevention are important issues in nursing and this study, through its identification of culture-specific motivators, addresses this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433869">Anderson &amp; McFarlane, 2004</xref>). <italic>Healthy People 2010</italic> is a significant health promotion document, for it calls on individuals to make healthy lifestyle choices, clinicians to put prevention into their practices, and communities and businesses to support health promotion in all settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043659611433869">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000</xref>). The authors of <italic>Healthy People 2010</italic> recognized the importance of motivators for they based their choice of indicators on several elements, one of which was “their inherent quality to motivate action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611433869">Fodor, Dolis, &amp; Guarratano-Russell, 2002</xref>). If nurses want to promote health and see the goals of <italic>Healthy People</italic> become a reality, they must use motivators that are culturally congruent. The 10 motivators of this review have strong implications for health promotion among the Asian populations. Third, health education occupies a great deal of nursing hours, and to do more than just dispense facts, nurses need to know how to make their teaching motivational (Christensen &amp; Kockrow). This study addresses this issue in a cross-cultural context, which is especially helpful in today’s culturally diverse world. No matter in what setting the nurses are teaching, they need to gear their teaching strategies to use the appropriate motivator correctly as the yin and yang example clearly showed. While motivating Western youth, nurses might uphold the values of being drug-free, but in dealing with Asian youth, they might be better advised to point out that drug use can lead to death as it did for Mr. X Movie Star (negative role model). Eastern youth find conformity motivational. Thus, if school nurses wish to motivate students to get out of gangs or not start gang activities, they must help them find a group with which they can conform and also obtain the desired social or health outcomes. To use the group motivators effectively, the nurse should use group activities but should not give individuals their own grade based on their contribution to the group activity, for that will motivate an individualist but not a collectivist. In using the motivator of self-effacement, the nurse can encourage the Asian to learn from others, but should be very careful about building someone up as a great example. The nurse who presents an action as bringing harmony to society, home, or body will have greater success in seeing the desired outcome than one who presents an action as leading to disease control.</p>

<sec id="section16-1043659611433869">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>If nurses are going to rise to the challenge proposed by <italic>Healthy People 2010</italic>, for all Americans including Asians, it is recommended that they try the adapted PRECEDE–PRECEED model with the 10 Asian motivators, in their practice and share their experiences with others. Second, it is recommended that researchers conduct studies using the motivators and the PRECEDE–PROCEED model in a variety of Asian contexts to establish the reliability of the adapted model and motivators, and also to establish the practice strategies that best set these motivators in motion. This literature review has identified 10 Asian motivators. It is now necessary for nurses and researchers to put them into practice to understand more fully how they can be effectively used in clinical nursing, health promotion programs, and education.</p>
