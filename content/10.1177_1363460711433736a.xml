<p>Fran Martin, <italic>Backward Glances: Contemporary Chinese Cultures and the Female Homoerotic Imaginary,</italic> Duke University Press: Durham, NC, 2010; 304 pp.: ISBN 978 0 822 34680 7, £15.99 (pbk)</p>
<p>Recent years have seen a proliferation in the publishing of qualitative studies of non-normative gender, sexuality and their relative meanings in a contemporaneous, globalizing context. Studies of specifically lesbian representation and epistemology are fairly few but do form a sub-field in western, English-language scholarship. Fran Martin’s <italic>Backward Glances</italic> contributes to this scholarship with a captivating, brilliant study of the representation of love between women in Chinese mass-media including cinema, literature, and television. In consistently combining western and Chinese sexual epistemologies, and fields such as psychoanalysis, queer theory, lesbian and gay studies and media theory, Martin seeks to ask a somewhat different question about representations of female homoeroticism than conventional theories tend to do, which are inclined to be concerned with a politics of visibility, the injured same-sex identity and the binary divide between the West and the Other. Martin is interested in understanding sexuality less within this dichotomous paradigmatic framework, and proposes that detaching her analysis of female homoeroticism in Chinese popular culture from the politics of queer visibility exposes the complex representational politics at play. This reading strategy also allows a less Eurocentric approach to Chinese sexual epistemologies and cultural practices, one in which ‘China’ is not ultimately reduced to either an exemplar of general (western) theory or as fundamentally different and therefore ultimately incomparable.</p>
<p><italic>Backward Glances</italic> is a major contribution to our understanding of female homoerotic representations in Chinese mass media cultures and theories of non-normative sexuality and gender. The book considers a body of diverse texts, including mainstream film, TV soap operas, independent lesbian cinema, and romance novellas, from the early 20th century until today in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. Martin identifies the memorial schoolgirl romance as an almost omnipresent narrative logic in much mainstream texts. Although this narrative structure seems to reflect lesbian impossibility, familial repression, and victorious hetero-marriage, Martin’s alternative representational analysis identifies a more complex representational politics at play, one that includes social commentary on, and at times political critique of, patriarchy, hetero-marriage, and state masculinism. Martin asks: What is so gripping about the ideological structure of these narratives that they remain hugely popular with a mainstream straight, female audience and, increasingly also, a lesbian-identified public? What cultural and political work does such a narrative perform today?</p>
<p>Importantly, Martin does not deny a dominant logic of impossibility of lasting relationships between women, nor the negative stereotypes surrounding lesbianism: arrested psycho-sexual development, childhood abuse, or ‘perverse’ masculinity. However, the lack of intimate futures does not mean that lesbian love ceases to exist <italic>tout court</italic>. Rather, intimate bonds between women are invariably interrupted by externally imposed hetero-norms (marriage), and this upsets the proper narrative development of the primary same-sex romance narrative. According to this narrative logic, the romantic bond is replayed continually in the present as nostalgic memory. By extension, female homoerotic intimacy is culturally imaginable only as memory of youth, mournfully narrated by the present-day ‘everywoman’, the conventionally feminine woman who ends up married. This ‘female homoerotic imaginary’ has remained a culturally prominent image throughout the 20th century, Martin shows in her fascinating analysis, and its temporal logic is a strategy that continues to over-determine their representation. This logic represents a universalizing approach to same-sex love, as the appropriation of a traditional romance narrative genre links same-sex and cross-sex love, so as to connect them to a familiar narrative of ‘women in love’. This ‘generic echo’ strategy (p. 42) complicates and broadens the representational reading possibilities, compared with the pre-determined and dichotomous analytical options offered by one based on minoritized sexual politics and theory.</p>
<p>Gender is shown to carry fundamental importance through the centrality of secondary gender, divided into the first-person femme ‘everywoman’ narrator, and the distinct and fixed tomboy identity without a future (she usually dies, figuratively or actually). In a compelling chapter on ‘tomboy melodrama’, Martin revisits her previous book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460711433736a"><italic>Situating Sexualities</italic> (2003)</xref>, where she discussed theories of same-sex identity as foundational injury, and reflects on dominant analyses of queerness that valorize the proud exhibition of injury as a means to counter and overcome queer shame. Martin develops the analysis of the melodrama of the tomboy’s anguished subjecthood as indirect coping strategy. Departing from a ‘violently phobic’ stereotype of the butch lesbian as monstrous freak, Martin shows how a ‘victim-hero’ trend within the memorial genre invites audiences’ sympathy, admiration, and even desirous objectification of the tomboy. Additionally, the villain shifts away from the tomboy toward the abusive, deficit mother figure. This melodramatic tomboy-affirming strategy, Martin cautions, also works to redirect attention away from broader political issues toward the private and personal sphere: love is lost, not because of structural misogynistic homophobia but deficit mothering.</p>
<p>A final chapter on ‘critical presentism’ in current independent lesbian cinema argues that the memorial logic is shifting towards expressively queer representational media strategies, the temporal focus shifts toward the present and future, cultural references expand toward the transnational, textual tools become less mainstream and more references to art films and political symbolism. Martin shows how new independent films insist on a temporal perspective not of the memorial past but of the contemporaneous moment. A new genre of art films with social and political content also include lesbian topics with a decidedly present moment, for example <italic>Fish and Elephant</italic> (2003, Mainland China). An interview transcript with Shi Tou, one of the leads in <italic>Fish</italic> and a well-known lesbian artist-activist in Mainland China, contributes a fascinating dimension and biographical voice to Martin’s analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Backward Glances</italic> is an intriguing and important contribution to scholarship on transnational sexualities, and lesbian media representation in particular. The book is directed at a diverse readership, balancing descriptive sections that outline plots, contexts, and cultural histories, with sharp theoretical arguments. This brilliantly argued and comprehensive study should be an essential read for anyone interested in queer and gender theories, epistemologies of sexual globalization, and Chinese media cultures.</p></body>
