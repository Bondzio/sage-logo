<p>When you hear the words ‘theology’ and ‘tragedy’ in the same sentence you are very likely to think immediately of Don Mackinnon, who rightly fits at the heart of this wide-reaching, diverse collection of essays (if not, then certainly Balthasar who receives more qualified appreciation). As such Waller’s own essay is of central importance and provides an excellent exposition of Mackinnon’s work.</p>
<p>The advantage of a multi-authored work is that it naturally engenders a broad definition of tragedy, which it seeks to defend as a worthy genre and mode within Christian theology, in particular against the criticism of John Milbank and David Bentley Hart. This is begun expertly in Ben Quash’s first chapter, where he isolates the fundamental issue as one of over-resolution. Arguing against Milbank and Hart he maintains that tragedy is not necessarily bound up with resignation, but recalls us to the unresolved historical particularity of suffering. Rather than tragedy requiring a closed sacrificial logic of fate, it confronts the neat Christian theodicy of resurrection, leaving the discontinuity open to the freedom and love of God. Which is not to say that Christianity does not ultimately present a comic vision, but, as Montemaggi writes in his sensitive chapter on Primo Levi and Dante, the divine love is a response to, not a neglect or forgetting of, the tragic darkness of the world. This means entering the whirlwind without presuming to know what the end will be.</p>
<p>The collection is divided into three and while the first section looks at the relation of tragic literature to theology, the second is concerned with how theologians have understood tragedy. Adrian Poole delivers here a balanced and insightful commentary on Simone Weil’s account of tragedy, in dialogue with Elaine Scarry. For Weil tragedies are ‘moments of arrest … forms of attention’, which question our narratives and presuppositions (p. 125). But while Weil notes that tragedy reveals the loss involved in violence, Poole supplements her account with Scarry’s positive grace of human creativity.</p>
<p>There are many other excellent essays in this collection. Taylor provides a superb critical examination of Balthasar’s account of the tragic; Michael Ward is very good on C. S. Lewis.</p>
<p>The final section looks at how theology engages with tragic theory, which provides some of the most varied essays. David Cunningham’s essay, in particular, draws us back to the indeterminacy of tragedy, articulated in performance. He argues that to succeed as drama the audience itself must recognize the possibility of redemption. Tragedy does not then convince of resignation to tragic fate, but rather instigates moral improvement. The audience can see the way out, experience the moment of hesitation; they depend upon the possibility of final comedy, setting ritual ruin against redemption.</p>
<p>Overall, the breadth of disciplines engaged with expands the reader’s understanding of the scope and possibilities of the tragic, drawing us away from simple definitions and casual commentary. All of these essays draw attention to the particularity of the historical suffering of creation and take it with the utmost seriousness. Without shying away from orthodox Christianity, there is a commitment to engaging with human experience and the non-resolution of the world as we receive it. As such it confirms the significance of tragedy and tragic literature as illuminating subjects for Christian reflection.</p>
