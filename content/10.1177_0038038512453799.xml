<abstract>
<p>An affirmative action programme, established by the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989, has been an important attempt to ensure ‘fair participation’ in employment for both Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland since 1990. The programme includes detailed monitoring of the community background of employees and requires employers to undertake remedial action where fair participation is not evident. Agreements were concluded between the regulatory agency and many employers specifying what affirmative action measures were required. Based on the annual monitoring returns submitted between 1990 and 2005, this article evaluates the effectiveness of the affirmative action programme in promoting fair employment participation using fixed effects models. The analysis shows that there has been a general shift towards workforce integration in Northern Ireland but the increase of under-represented groups in agreement concerns is greater than in concerns with no agreement. The success of agreements, however, is limited to certain industrial sectors and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Affirmative action in the labour market has been operated in several countries using significantly different approaches, ranging from India, where quotas have been established for the employment of members of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in public sector employment, to the USA where federal contractors are obliged to show evidence of affirmative action with respect to gender and race in order to qualify for government contracts. There are also programmes in South Africa, Malaysia, Canada, Namibia, and Fiji, all with significant differences in how affirmative action is implemented in employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512453799">McCrudden, 2011</xref>). A common issue is whether such programmes are effective in bringing about changes in workforce composition that benefit the targeted groups.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, on which this article focuses, affirmative action, which was put into statute with the introduction of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989 and came into operation on 1 January 1990, has been an important feature of employment from the 1980s and has been a key building block of the Peace Process. At the beginning of the political conflict, or ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland, the 1971 Census data showed that Catholics were two and a half times as likely as Protestants to be unemployed. Catholics in employment were over-represented in the semi-skilled and unskilled categories and in lower-status industries such as clothing manufacture and textiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512453799">Aunger, 1975</xref>). In contrast, Protestants dominated the relatively higher-paid areas of shipbuilding and engineering. Zoning policies and tax incentives that influenced the location of new industries reinforced these differences in employment patterns. These were often in areas where Catholics found it difficult or dangerous to travel. Trade unions acted to maintain the Protestant monopoly in the heavy manufacturing industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453799">Hancock, 1998</xref>). Historically, therefore, workforces were seen as either Catholic or Protestant. The Cameron Commission, established to report on the causes and nature of the civil disturbances in 1968 and 1969, concluded that a sense of injustice related to discrimination in employment and housing was a key contributory factor to the violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038512453799">Gallagher, 1991</xref>). Inequality with regard to employment remained intertwined with community relations, violence and politics for four decades following the civil rights disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512453799">Darby, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512453799">John Brewer (2010)</xref> argues that communal violence is embedded in the social structures in which it takes place and calls for a detailed understanding of how social processes like structural inequality reinforce violent conflicts over social cleavages. A focus on the ways in which changes to social processes are brought about and to what effect is therefore timely. The study of the effectiveness of the affirmative action programme on fair employment participation in Northern Ireland thus reflects social, economic and political changes in the country over the past two decades.</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland programme is a remarkable and innovative one that uses legal enforcement measures to ensure that both communities in Northern Ireland (Roman Catholics and Protestants) secure ‘fair participation’ in employment. The programme includes detailed monitoring of the religion of employees in public and private sector concerns and requires employers to undertake remedial action where fair participation is not evident. Agreements were concluded between the regulatory agency and many employers specifying what affirmative action measures were required.</p>
<p>The Northern Ireland approach is radically different from the legal approach to inequality of opportunity in the rest of the UK, in being much more proactive in requiring changes in employment practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512453799">Fredman, 2011</xref>). It also differs from the better known American or Indian affirmative action programmes. The American approach essentially uses public procurement as a lever to induce contractors to hire more minorities or women, and can thus use the powerful threat of debarring firms from federal contracts as an incentive to comply. The Indian approach, on the other hand, relies on quotas, and only applies to public sector employment. In contrast, the Northern Ireland approach applies to <italic>all</italic> concerns (above a certain size) irrespective of whether they are in the public or private sectors or are government contractors or not, and does not rely on quotas or reverse discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038038512453799">1</xref></sup> The success (or otherwise) of the Northern Ireland approach may therefore have important implications for other jurisdictions such as the European Union (EU) that are considering how to tackle issues of employment inequality (for example in the context of ethnic inequalities in the labour market).</p>
<p>Although affirmative action in employment has been implemented in several countries, empirical studies of the effectiveness of affirmative action policies predominantly focus on the US experience. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512453799">Holzer and Neumark, 2000</xref>, for a review of the economic literature assessing the effects of affirmative action programmes in the USA.) In the USA, affirmative action in employment dates back to the 1960s. The 1965 Executive Order required federal contractors and subcontractors to reduce underutilization of minorities. Subsequently, the 1967 Executive Order further addressed the underutilization of women. Since then, empirical studies have investigated the effectiveness of these policies. Both earlier and recent studies show that, amongst federal contractors, there has been some redistribution of employment from white males to minorities and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512453799">Heckman and Wolpin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512453799">Holzer and Neumark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512453799">Kalev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512453799">Leonard, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512453799">1990</xref>). This redistribution is not limited to the share of total employment but also applies to managerial positions. Apart from the US studies, the research on affirmative action programmes in other countries such as India, Canada, Malaysia and South Africa is mainly descriptive and rarely rigorously evaluates directly whether the programmes were effective in increasing employment of the under-represented groups. (One exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512453799">Jain and Lawler, 2004</xref>, on the Canadian Employment Equity programme.)</p>
<p>In this article, we aim to evaluate empirically the effectiveness of the Northern Ireland affirmative action programme in promoting the fair employment of Catholics and Protestants. This is the first systematic and comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the programme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038038512453799">2</xref></sup> The article is organized as follows. The next section describes the context and detail of the Northern Ireland affirmative action programme. Subsequently, trends and patterns of Catholic and Protestant labour force participation over the period 1990–2005 are explored. Next, we describe the data and methods used in our evaluation of the programme. We then report the pattern of compliance activity and examine the characteristics of concerns undertaking affirmative action under the programme. The empirical part gives the results of statistical analyses of the effects of agreements between the regulatory agency and employers on the workforce composition of individual concerns. The final section discusses the findings and concludes.</p>

<title>The Northern Ireland Affirmative Action Programme</title>
<p>The affirmative action programme that we examine in this article was established by the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989, which amended and substantially replaced the previous 1976 fair employment legislation. The 1976 legislation essentially prohibited discrimination but did not require any significant affirmative action to promote fair employment between Catholics and Protestants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0038038512453799">3</xref></sup> We use these terms as shorthand, recognizing that a complex mixture of political, religious and national identities contributed to the emergence of two main communities, and the relative stability of this duality up to the present day. The split between the Catholic community and the Protestant community encompasses not only religious differences but also radically divergent political allegiances. This contributed to the emergence of extensive segregation in housing, schooling and cultural activities, often voluntary but also in some cases enforced through discrimination. The effects on the pattern of employment were also complex. The degree of voluntary segregation meant that some professions, for example teaching, the medical profession and the legal profession, had a significant proportion of Catholics. However, the Protestant community was the dominant economic community and most major employers in manufacturing, for example, were Protestant.</p>
<p>In targeting discrimination in the workplace, the legislation exposed fundamental ideological cleavages between Protestant Unionism and Catholic Nationalism. Catholic nationalists and a coalition of supporters that included the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the British Labour Party (then in opposition) and the Irish Americans had long expressed concern about discrimination. The local (devolved) Parliament in Northern Ireland, which operated between 1920 and 1972, was dominated by Protestant Unionists, who ignored the problem. After the Northern Ireland Parliament collapsed and the United Kingdom government reasserted direct control in 1974, these groups applied increasing pressure on the British government to introduce policies that would make a meaningful impact on the gap between Catholic and Protestant unemployment. Protestant Unionists, in contrast, continued to refuse to join a consensus on fair employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512453799">Doyle (1994</xref>: 45) argues that this was not merely a sectarian reaction but a ‘logical conclusion of their political perspective. Unionists simply saw that fair employment cannot be divorced from the broader political conflict, and they felt they could not give way on fair employment without weakening their fundamental political stance.’ Their position was simultaneously to deny the existence of discrimination and to justify it by arguing that in rejecting the authority of the state Catholics renounced their citizenship rights. One way of punishing such disloyalty was the right to refuse employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512453799">Doyle, 1994</xref>). Fair employment legislation, first in 1976 and then in 1989, directly challenged such ideological entrenchments and demanded a change in the behaviour of those who held these views. It was explicitly aimed at increasing the economic inclusion of Catholics, and eased the way towards increased political participation resulting in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.</p>
<p>Although the 1976 legislation essentially focused on identifying and remedying discrimination, there were moves by the regulatory agency (the Fair Employment Agency) to secure agreements with larger employers in various sectors to introduce monitoring and limited changes in recruitment processes in particular firms. The 1989 legislation formalized and generalized this approach. It established the Fair Employment Commission (FEC) and initially required all concerns with 25 or more employees, both public and private, to prepare and submit to the Commission annual monitoring returns reporting inter alia the proportion of Protestants, Catholics and people of ‘non-determined’ community affiliation in the employer’s full-time workforce. (There were various procedures for minimizing the number of non-determined employees, and in most concerns the proportion was rarely above 6% for any given year.) The FEC devoted considerable resources to checking the accuracy of these monitoring returns. After considerable debate, it was decided that these returns should be published, identifying all concerns by name and showing the overall proportions of their workforces that were Catholic, Protestant and non-determined (but not breaking these proportions down by gender or occupational level).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0038038512453799">4</xref></sup> From 1992, the requirement to prepare annual monitoring returns was extended to all concerns with 11 or more employees. This legislation was subsequently modified by the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (FETO), while the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Section 73) established the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI), which came into existence in October 1999 with a broader mandate including discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, race, sex, sexual orientation, religious belief and political opinion. FETO also extended the monitoring requirement to part-time employees from 2001.</p>
<p>In addition to undertaking regular monitoring of their workforces, under Section 31 of the 1989 Act (now Article 55 of FETO), the Northern Ireland legislation imposes on all employers, both public and private, a duty to carry out at least once every three years a regular review of the composition of their workforces and practices in order to determine whether they are providing ‘fair participation’. Where a triennial review shows that fair participation has not been achieved the employer is required to undertake remedial action. If an employer determines that either community is not likely to continue to enjoy ‘fair participation’ this can also trigger affirmative action measures. The programme thus applies to all concerns (above a certain size) and not simply to federal contractors as under the US federal contractor requirements or only to public sector bodies as in the Indian case. (Throughout this article we use the term ‘concerns’ to describe the relevant employers, rather than ‘firms’ since we are dealing with public sector bodies as well as private sector firms.)</p>
<p>Fair participation is not defined in the legislation but, as interpreted by the FEC/ECNI, fair participation will be present in a concern when ‘under-representation’ has been eliminated. Under-representation in turn is somewhat problematic. It is clear, however, that it should not be taken to mean a simple numerical disparity between the composition of the workforce in the particular concern and that of the Northern Ireland labour force as a whole (and conversely the absence of any disparity does not necessarily indicate fair representation). Instead, interpreting whether under-representation is present or not depends on taking account of the availability of suitably qualified individuals in the area from which the concern might reasonably be expected to recruit for particular jobs in the concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512453799">McCrudden, 1992</xref>). Geographical issues are thus central to the evaluation of the programme.</p>
<p>A crucial feature of the legislation, which sets it apart from all the other well-known examples of affirmative action, is that the affirmative action obligation applies symmetrically; that is, it applies to concerns where Protestants are under-represented and to concerns where Catholics are under-represented. It is in this respect radically different from the more familiar US federal contractor programme, which is directed at reducing ethnic minority (particularly African-American) and female under-representation.</p>
<p>A major tool was made available to the FEC under the legislation (now Article 13 of FETO), and from 2000 to the ECNI: where the Commission considered it was necessary, it could seek to establish agreements to improve the representation of the under-represented group. In considering whether to work towards an agreement, the Commission could use its investigatory powers under the 1989 Act and the results of the triennial reviews that employers were required to undertake (‘Section 31 reviews’ under the 1989 Act, ‘Article 55 reviews’ under FETO 1998).</p>
<p>While the majority of concluded agreements have attempted to remedy Catholic under-representation, a substantial number have also been designed to remedy Protestant under-representation in specific concerns (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0038038512453799">Figure 3</xref> below). (Concerns with agreements designed to increase the representation of Protestants will be termed ‘Protestant agreement’ concerns; those with agreements designed to increase the representation of Catholics will be termed ‘Catholic agreement’ concerns.) These affirmative action agreements usually required concerns to introduce changes in the way in which they conducted their personnel functions, particularly by formalizing advertising, hiring, promotion and dismissal. Additional specified measures deemed most appropriate for that concern were also required, such as the use of advertising specifically targeted to the under-represented group, the use of statements in advertisements particularly welcoming applications from the under-represented group, and (frequently) the adoption of specified numerical goals that concerns committed themselves to achieving in order to reduce under-representation, together with timetables by which these numerical targets would be achieved. No reverse discrimination or quotas were permitted or could be required by the FEC/ECNI. (A major exception to this approach involves affirmative action in the police force where a time-limited form of quota system was in operation between 2001 and 2011.) These measures may apply not only to the overall composition of the workforce but also to the composition at specific occupational levels. Our focus in this article, however, is on the level of representation in the concern as a whole rather than on specific occupations.</p>
<p>There are three sorts of agreement between an employer and the FEC/ECNI, namely legally enforceable (Article 13) agreements, formal agreements approved by the FEC/ECNI Board, and voluntary agreements negotiated with FEC/ECNI staff. In practice, the great majority of the agreements (around two-thirds) have been voluntary agreements with most of the remainder being legally enforceable Article 13 agreements. Our fieldwork at the ECNI has suggested that the Commission tended to move towards Article 13 agreements when it was unable to secure a satisfactory voluntary agreement. Ultimately these Article 13 agreements are backed up by sanctions although, in practice, the Commission has primarily employed persuasion rather than enforcement even in the context of this type of agreement.</p>
<p>In summary, the most notable features of the Northern Ireland legislation and approach to affirmative action are:</p>

<title>Trends in Catholic and Protestant Labour Force Representation</title>
<p>Over the past two decades, Northern Ireland has experienced major political, economic and social changes that are likely to have had some impact on Catholic and Protestant labour force representation. Demographic changes resulted in Catholics becoming a greater proportion of the population in Northern Ireland. During the 1990s, Northern Ireland enjoyed steady economic growth resulting from large-scale foreign investment and expansion of the service sector. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998, and the IRA ceasefire of 1997 and decommissioning of their weapons from 2001 onwards, provided a more favourable political and security environment. Changes were introduced in the Northern Ireland educational system that improved funding for Catholic schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512453799">McCrudden, 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, the yearly publication of the monitoring returns identifying the names and community composition of individual concerns are likely to have put pressure on employers to deal with the under-representation of a particular community. These changes may well have had positive effects on patterns of representation generally.</p>
<p>We first explore whether there were any changes over time in Catholic and Protestant representation in all monitored concerns in Northern Ireland. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038512453799">Figure 1</xref> presents the distributions of concerns by their proportion of Catholic employees in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0038038512453799-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>What we see is a very clear and continuing shift over time from extremes of both Catholic under- and over-representation towards the centre. This shows that, over the period 1990–2005, the share of Catholic and Protestant employees in monitored concerns in Northern Ireland (including both agreement and non-agreement concerns) became more balanced, with fewer concerns at the two tails of the distribution. This means that in more recent periods, the majority of concerns have more or less equal proportions of Catholic and Protestant employees and only few concerns have very skewed proportions of Catholic or Protestant employees.</p>
<p>A key question in evaluating the affirmative action programme is whether there was greater progress towards fair representation in concerns that were subject to agreements. The changes observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038512453799">Figure 1</xref> could have been generated simply by the more favourable economic and political environment rather than by the affirmative action programme itself. One way in which we can explore the effectiveness of the programme is to check whether greater progress was made by those concerns that had been subject to the affirmative action agreements negotiated by the Commission. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512453799">Figure 2</xref> provides a first look at this, and compares the growth in the proportion of Catholic employees in concerns with Catholic under-representation agreements, and the growth in the proportion of Protestant employees in concerns with Protestant under-representation agreements, with the overall changes in the composition of the monitored workforce.</p>

</fig>
<p>Over the period 1990–2005, the NI workforce has been changing in character, with an increasing number of Catholics in the labour force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512453799">Heath et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512453799">Li and O’Leary, 2007</xref>). This growth was probably due partly to higher fertility amongst the Catholic population and perhaps also due to higher rates of emigration especially to England amongst the Protestant population. This is reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512453799">Figure 2</xref> in the growth in the percentage of Catholic full-time employees in non-agreement concerns, which rose from 37 per cent in 1990 to 40 per cent in 2005. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512453799">Figure 2</xref> also shows that Catholic employment grew slightly faster in the Catholic agreement concerns, from 17 per cent to nearly 25 per cent, although from a much lower starting point. Similarly, Protestant employment grew in the Protestant agreement firms, from 20 per cent to nearly 25 per cent.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512453799">Figure 2</xref> is consistent with the hypotheses that Catholic agreements increased the representation of Catholic employees while Protestant agreements increased the representation of Protestant employees, we should not draw any causal conclusions from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038512453799">Figure 2</xref>. For example, the observed changes might simply have been a consequence of the Commission’s practice of forming agreements at the beginning of the period with the concerns which had the highest degree of under-representation at that time and then moving to less extreme concerns later. One therefore needs to take into account when an agreement was signed and investigate whether the employment of the under-represented group increased in a specific concern after the agreement was signed. This requires more detailed statistical analysis modelling of the data and attempting to control for potential confounding factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0038038512453799">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data analysis is based on the annual monitoring returns collected by the FEC (until 1999) and the ECNI (from 1999 onwards) covering the period 1990–2005. Much of the data is publicly available in the annual monitoring returns, which give the community composition of all the relevant named concerns in Northern Ireland. They were, however, supplied to us in an electronic form by the ECNI, together with information about the size of the concern, its industry (manufacturing or services),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0038038512453799">5</xref></sup> its sector (public or private), its location, the year in which an agreement was made and the nature of the agreement (whether it was to address Catholic or Protestant under-representation), and its legal status (Article 13, formal or voluntary). The data do not constitute a sample but are the complete population of eligible concerns within Northern Ireland. There is no unit non-response although there are some exclusions. There is also some item non-response due to the need to maintain confidentiality. No data could be provided to us in a form that might permit in principle the identification of individuals. Data based on small cell sizes (less than two) could not therefore be released. For example, if a particular concern has only two Protestant employees, this information would not be available to us.</p>
<p>Over the period as a whole some new concerns entered the market while others merged, were taken over or went out of business. These concerns can be identified from the ECNI database and we retain in our dataset all concern-years for which there are valid data. We do, however, exclude 10 concerns that signed more complex agreements (both Catholic and Protestant under-representation agreements in the same concern). We also exclude the concerns with fewer than 25 employees, since the data on these small concerns were collected only from 1992 so we do not have their information for the whole period of our study. Only the composition of the full-time workforce is considered because data on part-time workers are not available for the whole period. The total number of concerns included in the analysis is 4306 and the maximum number of concern-years is 16.</p>
<p>The data were anonymized by the ECNI before release to us. Rigorous procedures were followed to ensure that individuals could not be identified from the data supplied to us. (In practice this meant combining categories into larger aggregations.)</p>

<title>Methods and Model Specification</title>
<p>We assess the effectiveness of the Commission’s affirmative action agreements by comparing whether the proportion of Catholic (or Protestant) employees in agreement concerns was higher after the agreement was signed than it had been before. The estimation method is fixed effects regression (which in essence holds constant the average characteristics of each concern and relates over-time deviations from the average to time-varying characteristics of the concern). The advantage of using the fixed effects model is its ability to control for all time-invariant observed and unobserved characteristics of the concerns. This method can thus reduce bias due to omitted variables. Recent research on the effects of compliance reviews in the USA has similarly employed the fixed effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512453799">Kalev and Dobbin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512453799">Kalev et al., 2006</xref>). This model effectively tests whether Catholic (or Protestant) employment was higher in a given concern after an agreement than before, controlling for other time-varying characteristics of the concern.</p>
<p>The variables to be incorporated in the models are described below.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0038038512453799-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>During the period 1990 to 2005, 250 Catholic under-representation agreements and 102 Protestant under-representation agreements were concluded. While overall the ratio of Catholic to Protestant agreements was therefore around 2.5:1, in the earlier part of the period, up until the mid-1990s, there tended to be more Catholic under-representation agreements, with the number of Protestant under-representation agreements rising in the later years.</p>
<p>Unlike in the USA where evidence suggests that, in the federal contractor programme, firms were selected rather randomly for compliance reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512453799">Leonard, 1985</xref>), in Northern Ireland the FEC/ECNI employed certain criteria to target concerns for investigation. In the early stages the Commission tended to target larger concerns, particularly in the public sector and in manufacturing industry, gradually moving to medium-size firms later (with relatively little activity throughout targeting the smallest firms). As might be expected, the Commission also tended in the early stages to target concerns with more extreme distributions of Catholic and Protestant employees.</p>
<p>These patterns are broadly consistent with our qualitative work in which we interviewed ECNI staff about their rationale for choosing concerns for investigation and affirmative action agreements. They are also confirmed by detailed statistical analysis of the changing profile over time of the concerns with which agreements were concluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0038038512453799">7</xref></sup> For full details of the statistical analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453799">McCrudden et al., forthcoming</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0038038512453799">
<title>The ‘Effects’ of Affirmative Action Agreements</title>
<p>We now turn to using fixed effects models to investigate the effects of the affirmative action agreements on Catholic and Protestant overall employment in the concerns. An important issue that arises in the Northern Ireland context when applying a fixed effects model of this kind is how to deal with the symmetrical character of the Northern Ireland legislation. As described earlier, in Northern Ireland the legislation requires concerns where either Catholics or Protestants are under-represented to move towards fair participation. In effect, this means that concerns at both extremes of the distribution are being pressed to move towards the centre of the distribution. As presented above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038512453799">Figure 1</xref>, we find evidence for increasing integration, with the distribution of both agreement and non-agreement concerns shifting from the two extremes towards the centre. It is thus possible that we would achieve different estimates for the effects of the time-varying controls depending on whether we include all concerns in the analysis or only those concerns that are in the same tail of the distribution.</p>
<p>One way to deal with this issue arising from the symmetrical character of the legislation, therefore, is to restrict the analysis to specified selections from the dataset, for example those in a particular tail of the distribution. If we were to compare the change in Catholic and Protestant employment share in agreement concerns with all non-agreement concerns, we might overestimate the agreement effect. The fact that the Commission tended to target concerns with more skewed distributions of employees from a particular community to sign an under-representation agreement also means that these concerns have greater room for improvement than the concerns which have not signed such an agreement. In addition, non-agreement concerns lying on the other side of the distribution may be subject to contradictory pressures to improve their workforce composition. For instance, while concerns with fewer than 30 per cent Catholic employees may be under pressure to increase their Catholic workforce, those with more than 70 per cent Catholic employees are likely to be subject to an opposite pressure to increase their Protestant workforce. In order to deal with this problem, we limit the analyses to the subsamples of concerns with fewer than 36 per cent Catholics and fewer than 41 per cent Protestants respectively. (Different cut-off percentages for the two communities are employed because of the differing shares of the two communities in the workforce overall.) This will bring us closer to a situation where we are comparing like with like. In this analysis, both agreement and non-agreement concerns have a low proportion of Catholics (or Protestants) and the only difference between the two groups is the presence of the under-representation agreement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038512453799">Table 1</xref> displays the fixed effects estimates of the log odds of Catholic and Protestant employees for concerns with fewer than 36 per cent Catholics and fewer than 41 per cent Protestants respectively. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038038512453799">Table 1</xref> show that the log odds of Catholic: non-Catholic (or Protestant: non-Protestant) employees in a concern in a given year depends significantly on the ratio in the previous year. Meanwhile, the proportion of Catholics in the district where the concern was located does not have any significant effect on the change in the log odds. The year effects are significant and positive for both Catholic and Protestant log odds alike. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038512453799">Figure 1</xref> displayed above, showing that over time there is a general tendency for concerns to move towards the centre of the distribution regardless of whether they had an agreement or not.</p>

<p>The two estimates for Catholic and Protestant agreements produce the expected positive signs and are both statistically significant. After the agreements were signed, the odds for Catholic employees rise by 5 per cent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0038038512453799">7</xref></sup> for concerns with Catholic agreements, and similarly the odds for Protestant employees rise by 5 per cent for concerns with Protestant agreements. This shows that, while we observe a general tendency for all concerns in Northern Ireland to move towards a balanced share of Catholic and Protestant employees, the increase of the under-represented group in agreement concerns is greater than in non-agreement ones.</p>
<p>Next, we investigate whether the agreement effects vary by industrial type and size of concern. Given that manufacturing industry has declined in Northern Ireland, while services and the public sector have been expanding, it might be more difficult for manufacturing concerns to implement changes in their workforce composition as they will be less likely to be taking on new staff. In the case of firm size, we might expect smaller firms to use more informal methods of recruitment, perhaps relying on word of mouth and personal recommendations, and they might thus be more able to implement reforms to their recruitment practices in ways that open up opportunities for the under-represented group. Conversely, large firms will typically already have more formalized recruitment and personnel systems and may have less scope for making reforms.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038038512453799">Table 2</xref> show that the effects of agreements on the change in the log odds for Catholics and Protestants differ between industrial type and size of concern. The odds for Catholics significantly increase by 6 per cent and 7 per cent in concerns in the manufacturing and services sectors that signed Catholic under-representation agreements. There is, however, no significant agreement effect for Catholic agreements in the public sector. In contrast, the odds for Protestant employment rise significantly, by 7 per cent where there are Protestant agreements in the public sector but we find no significant agreement effects in the private sector, neither in manufacturing nor service industries. We also find that the odds for Catholic and Protestant employment improve significantly only in medium-size concerns with agreements but not in small (25–50 employees) or large (251+ employees) concerns.</p>
<p>These results are somewhat puzzling, although we must remember that the number of agreement concerns in some of the categories (for example, Protestant agreement concerns in the manufacturing sector) is very small. We thus lack the statistical power in several cases to reach any firm conclusions. However, there does appear to be a clear pattern for agreements not to have statistically significant effects in the larger concerns. This finding is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512453799">Kalev et al. (2006)</xref> who examined the US case. One possible explanation, as we suggested above, is that the larger concerns may already have had written equal opportunities policies, formalized recruitment practices, with standardized application forms and posts advertised openly rather than using personal recommendations. We have seen that, under the 1976 legislation, the regulatory agency had embarked on a policy of attempting to secure such changes by selected large employers, and we may be seeing the effects of this in the pattern we have identified. The Workplace Employment Relations Survey (covering Great Britain), for example, shows that such procedures are much more prevalent in larger firms than in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and our qualitative research in Northern Ireland concerns has suggested that it is the introduction of such procedures that are particularly associated with remedying under-representation. It may be, then, that SMEs had more scope for introducing these procedures following an agreement.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Our empirical results show that, over the period 1990–2005, there has been a general shift towards workforce integration in Northern Ireland. This might be an indirect effect of the annual publication of the Fair Employment Monitoring Reports, which identify individual concerns by name as well as reporting the community composition of employees in each concern – a kind of ‘naming and shaming’ strategy. However, the changing political and economic environment in Northern Ireland during recent years may also have contributed to workforce integration in general and we cannot therefore attribute these overall changes to the affirmative action programme in the absence of evidence linking these changes to the programme more directly. It is this evidence that the article provides for the first time.</p>
<p>Apart from taking charge of collecting and publishing annual monitoring returns, another important activity of the FEC/ECNI has been to oversee and select concerns for investigation, and where necessary, to establish agreements to improve the representation of the under-represented group. Generally, concerns with extreme distributions of either group were targeted for Catholic or Protestant agreements accordingly. In the earlier period, larger-sized concerns and those in the public sector were targeted first for an agreement but the FEC later expanded its compliance activities to cover medium- and small-size concerns as well as concerns in the private sector, particularly those in the non-service industrial sector such as construction, manufacturing, transportation and trades.</p>
<p>With respect to the impact of the affirmative action programme, our empirical evidence suggests that affirmative action agreements were successful in increasing the employment share of the under-represented group within concerns that had signed an agreement. We find that on average, the share of Catholic employees increased in concerns that signed Catholic agreements and similarly the share of Protestant employees increased in concerns that signed Protestant agreements. These agreements, however, appear to be effective only in certain industrial sectors and mainly in medium-size concerns. Nevertheless, they have directly tackled a fundamental cause of the conflict and contributed to the Peace Process.</p>
<p>Not only has there been a shift in workforce integration but there has also been a corresponding change in reported attitudes towards such integration during this time period. Responses to the question ‘If you were working and had to change your job, would you prefer a workplace with people of only your own religion, or in a mixed-religion workplace?’ asked by the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey have shown a move towards greater inclusion. In 1998, 9 per cent of Catholics and 14 per cent of Protestants stated that they would prefer a workplace comprised of their own religion only. In 2005, these figures went down to 7 per cent of Catholics and 11 per cent of Protestants and in 2010, reported attitudes had changed again to 4 per cent of Catholics and 3 per cent of Protestants preferring a workplace comprised of their own religion only. This shift in Protestant attitudes towards integration contrasts sharply with public statements made by prominent Unionist politicians in the 1970s and 1980s who argued that workplace integration would increase sectarian tensions and ‘create discord where there is none’ (Jim Kilfedder, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512453799">Doyle, 1994</xref>: 52).</p>
<p>We suspect that key ingredients of the Northern Ireland success may be the regular monitoring of firms’ composition, the willingness of the Commission to use its powers to carry out investigations and secure agreements in cases where monitoring reveals serious under-representation, and the extent of external political pressure. While more detailed research is needed to establish exactly which other mechanisms were responsible for these positive effects, the Northern Ireland experience of affirmative action does show that negotiated agreements to remedy under-representation can be a successful part of a strategy of bringing about change. It is particularly striking that these changes in composition of workplaces and attitudes to workplace integration have been achieved without the primary use of sanctions such as threatening to withhold government contracts (as in the USA), and without imposing quotas (as in India). This may well have important implications for how other regulatory bodies established to promote ethnic and gender equality, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission in Great Britain, might reconceptualize their role.</p>
<p>The role of the affirmative action programme in Northern Ireland in addressing a fundamental communal grievance, its far-reaching approach applying to both public and private sector concerns, and its requirement that concerns must undertake and make public the monitoring returns and undertake remedial action where fair participation has not been achieved have all contributed to its success. While the political context of Northern Ireland might be unique, the affirmative action programme’s role, approach and requirements could provide a model to other jurisdictions seeking to tackle not only issues of fair employment but also other structural inequalities within society.</p>
