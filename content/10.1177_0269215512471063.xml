<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The postoperative period of abdominal surgery is associated with respiratory muscle dysfunction and impaired physical capacity, which, in turn, are associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512471063">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512471063"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512471063">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anesthesia, the trauma of surgery, and the conditions inherent to the postoperative period (such as incisions, drains, and catheters) have an impact on the respiratory mechanics and mobility of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512471063">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512471063">5</xref></sup> The first postoperative days are associated with limited upright mobilization, fatigue, and restrictive ventilatory defects, among other functional disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512471063">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512471063"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512471063"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512471063">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physical therapy, including respiratory and motor exercises, can aid patient recovery after laparotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512471063">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512471063"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512471063">12</xref></sup> However, its effect on the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery remains unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471063">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512471063">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, the preoperative period provides an opportunity to encourage and possibly improve physical performance in patients who are awaiting elective surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471063">15</xref></sup> This concept, known as <italic>prehabilitation</italic>, has been the object of studies in patients undergoing orthopedic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512471063">16</xref></sup> and colorectal surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471063">17</xref></sup> and its aim is to speed postoperative recovery by means of preoperative interventions.</p>
<p>Respiratory muscle training, a procedure consistent with this concept, has been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and shorten length of hospital stay after cardiothoracic surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512471063">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512471063">19</xref></sup> and is associated with a reduction in the rate of atelectasis after abdominal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512471063">20</xref></sup> In addition, preoperative aerobic fitness programs have been studied as a potential strategy for mitigating postoperative impairment of functional capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512471063">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512471063">22</xref></sup> and reducing the incidence of pulmonary complications after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471063">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare, in a sample of adults awaiting upper abdominal surgery, the extent to which a preoperative physical therapy intervention consisting of respiratory and general functional exercises improves pulmonary function and functional physical performance versus no preoperative intervention at time of surgery and at 7 and 30 days postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512471063" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial conducted at a private university and a tertiary public hospital in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The study protocol was approved by the institutional Human Subject Research Ethics Committee and added to the Brazilian clinical trials registry (REBEC – <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.bridentifierRBR-73vbv8">www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.bridentifierRBR-73vbv8</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Patients were recruited from the outpatient specialist clinic of a medical school department of digestive surgery. Inclusion criteria were elective open abdominal surgery (defined as opening of the peritoneal cavity), waiting period of at least 2 weeks, no prior surgical intervention for esophageal, gastric, or biliary tract resection, age ≥ 40 years, and acceptable physical condition (permitting pulmonary function and walk tests). Exclusion criteria were cerebrovascular disease, use of immunosuppressants within 30 days of surgery, cardiovascular instability, and physical therapy within the 8 weeks preceding study enrollment.</p>
<p>All participants were referred by surgeons for physical therapy follow-up during the pre- and postoperative periods as part of a multidisciplinary surgical team. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked, and patients were informed of the study objectives and asked for their informed consent. The day of admission to the study was defined as the day of first patient assessment, usually 2 to 3 weeks before surgery (baseline data). After stratification by surgical site (esophagus, stomach, or biliary tract), participants were randomly allocated, by means of sealed envelope randomization, to the treatment or control groups. Subjects allocated to the treatment group received preoperative physical therapy, whereas the control group received no preoperative physical therapy intervention. At the end of 2 to 3 preoperative weeks, all patients were admitted to the hospital, and immediate preoperative outcome measures were assessed within the first 24 hours before surgery (preoperative data). In the postoperative period, a physical therapy protocol was implemented in both groups and followed until the seventh postoperative day or hospital discharge (when the length of stay was &lt;07 days). Three assessments were conducted in the postoperative period: within the first 24 hours after surgery (24-hour postoperative data), on the seventh postoperative day or at hospital discharge when the length of stay was &lt;0 7 days (7-day postoperative data), and on the 30th postoperative day (30-day postoperative data). Neither patients nor physical therapists were blinded to group assignment, and the investigators responsible for data collection were aware of allocation.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215512471063">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>All treatment-group subjects received preoperative physical therapy during the 2 to 3 weeks preceding their surgical procedure. The protocol consisted of two supervised 50-minute physical therapy sessions per week, which consisted of stretching exercises, trunk rotation (dissociation of the pelvis and shoulder girdle), deep breathing, respiratory muscle training, active upper and lower extremity exercises, walking, and relaxation. Patients also received guidance and training on coughing and huffing. For respiratory muscle training, patients were trained to use an inspiratory threshold-loading device (Threshold IMT, Respironics, NJ, USA), for 15 minutes daily. The initial load was set at 20% of their maximal inspiratory pressure, measured at baseline. This was increased by 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O/week in the preoperative period, as described by Dronkers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512471063">20</xref></sup> The walking portion of the protocol consisted of a 10-minute walk on flat ground. Speed was required to be faster than that of a random leisurely walk, and was limited by perceived dyspnea, never exceeding level 15 on the Borg Scale of rate perceived exertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512471063">23</xref></sup> Patients were instructed to avoid running, and were allowed to slow their pace if necessary to complete the activity in no less than 10 minutes. Respiratory muscle training and walking were carried out once daily, at home, at a predefined time, four times a week, scheduled not to coincide with supervised physical therapy sessions. All patients reported full adherence with these recommended activities, which was corroborated by progressive improvement in ability to carry out related exercises during supervised physical therapy.</p>
<p>Control group patients did not receive any physical therapy intervention in the preoperative period. They were instructed to wait for medical staff to call regarding hospital admission (within 2 to 3 weeks) and surgery.</p>
<p>Postoperative physical therapy consisted of a standardized protocol which was applied to both groups until the seventh postoperative day. All patients received daily physical therapy (one 45-minute session), which consisted of deep breathing exercises followed by coughing or huffing. Chest maneuvers were used to aid airway clearance when necessary, as determined by pulmonary auscultation. This was followed by active upper and lower extremity exercises (similar to those used in the preoperative protocol), performed in the seated position. All subjects were encouraged to sit out of bed (within 24 hours of surgery) and walk at least 10 minutes a day (starting on the second postoperative day) if stable. All participants were encouraged to repeat the respiratory, coughing, and limb mobilization exercises performed during the physical therapy session once daily, without the presence of the therapist.</p>
<p>When subjects were under mechanical ventilation, the physical therapy protocol was followed whenever patients were hemodynamically stable, with exercises adapted to their current clinical condition. Ventilator weaning was carried out by intensive care unit professionals. When length of stay exceeded 7 days, postoperative care was handed over to the hospital’s physical therapy service (one daily session on average).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data on operative time, American Society of Anesthesiologists functional classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512471063">24</xref></sup> severity of condition on the first postoperative day (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)), and postoperative pulmonary complications were collected for between-group comparisons. Postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pulmonary complications treated and noted in medical records until the seventh postoperative day, were: (1) respiratory failure, as characterized by a need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation; (2) atelectasis, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, as diagnosed on chest radiographs; or (3) pneumonia, on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and institution of antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>Pulmonary function assessment consisted of measurement of respiratory muscle strength and endurance, followed by spirometry. Respiratory muscle strength was determined by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, reflecting the inspiratory and expiratory muscle force, respectively. Measures were obtained with an aneroid manometer (Comercial Médica, São Paulo, Brazil), calibrated in cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The procedure was carried out in accordance with American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512471063">25</xref></sup> Maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure were derived from the residual volume and total lung capacity, respectively. Absolute values were compared with predicted values for the Brazilian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512471063">26</xref></sup> Respiratory muscle endurance was measured by incremental threshold loading following the protocol described by Dronkers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512471063">20</xref></sup> The initial load was set at 30% of the maximal inspiratory pressure, as measured during the corresponding assessment, and resistance was gradually increased by 10% of maximal inspiratory pressure every 2 minutes. Endurance was expressed as the highest pressure (in cmH<sub>2</sub>O) that could be sustained for 2 minutes without interrupting inspiration. Lung volumes and capacities were measured with a portable spirometer (KoKo, Ferraris Respiratory, Louisville, CO, USA). Slow and forced vital capacity maneuvers were performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512471063">27</xref></sup> Slow vital capacity was used to calculate vital capacity and inspiratory capacity, and forced vital capacity to determine the forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacity. Results were expressed as absolute values and as percentages of predicted reference values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512471063">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The functional independence measure and distance on the 6-minute walk test were used for assessment of functional performance. The functional independence measure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512471063">29</xref></sup> validated for use in Brazil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512471063">30</xref></sup> enabled assessment of functional capacity for the activities of daily living (self-care, sphincter control, mobility/transferring, locomotion, communication, and social cognition). The overall score was interpreted as complete dependence (18 points), moderate modified dependence (19–60 points), mild modified dependence (61–103 points), or complete independence (104–126 points). The 6-minute walk test was performed along a 30-meter hallway, in accordance with international standards, for assessment of physical capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512471063">31</xref></sup> The distance in meters was recorded and compared with values predicted for the Brazilian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512471063">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>All measurements were obtained at all five assessments (baseline, preoperative, and 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after surgery), except for the 6-minute walk test, which was not performed 24 hours after surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215512471063">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS v. 17.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Medians and interquartile ranges were used for descriptive analyses of quantitative variables due to the skewness of most variables. Hence, non-parametric tests were deemed more adequate for statistical analysis. Between-group (treatment group versus control group) comparisons were performed with the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (for quantitative variables) or the chi-squared test (for categorical variables). Fisher’s exact test was used when the prerequisites for use of the chi-squared test were not met.</p>
<p>The Wilcoxon test was used for comparisons between baseline measurements and predicted values, as well as between preoperative measurements and predicted values. The Friedman test was used for within-group comparisons among the five predetermined assessments, followed by the post-hoc Wilcoxon signed ranks test with Bonferroni correction for comparison among the various permutations of the two study groups.</p>
<p>A normal approximation of the binomial distribution with single probability of success of 0.5 was also applied for calculation of binomial probabilities.</p>
<p>The significance level was set at 0.05, except for post-hoc analysis, in which the significance level was set at 0.005 or 0.0083 after Bonferroni correction, depending on the number of comparisons.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our main findings revealed that (1) in the preoperative period, patients who had engaged in respiratory and motor exercises had inspiratory strength and respiratory muscle endurance superior to patients who did not receive the program, as well as better 6-minute walk test distances; (2) on the seventh postoperative day, maximal inspiratory pressure, respiratory muscle endurance, functional independence measure and 6-minute walk test distance were significantly greater among patients who received preoperative physical therapy; and (3) in the first week after surgery, treatment group patients experienced fewer postoperative pulmonary complications.</p>
<p>The waiting period for elective surgery is highly detrimental to the physical and emotional condition of the patient. Improvement of health status in this period is a challenge, particularly in patients awaiting oncologic surgery, due to a tendency to abstain from physical strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512471063">33</xref></sup> In the present study, 78% of participants had a diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract neoplasm.</p>
<p>The optimal time for intervention prior to surgery is limited and varies across studies. A period of 2–3 weeks was chosen for this trial due to the routine of the institution. Similar waits have been reported for cardiothoracic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512471063">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512471063">34</xref></sup> and abdominal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512471063">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical trials of preoperative respiratory muscle training have revealed less decline in inspiratory muscle strength after laparotomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512471063">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215512471063">36</xref></sup> which explains speculation as to a potential effect in the reduction of postoperative pulmonary complications. Respiratory muscle training was included as an add-on to other exercises, and treatment group subjects exhibited inspiratory strength and respiratory muscle endurance superior to controls in the preoperative period. Nevertheless, both groups experienced a decline in respiratory muscle performance after surgery. By the seventh postoperative day, inspiratory muscle strength and endurance were once again superior in the treatment group. Respiratory muscle endurance measures are interesting and valuable markers of the postoperative behavior of lung mechanics in surgical patients. Anesthesia and surgical manipulation reduce residual functional capacity; this, compounded by a decrease in pulmonary compliance, increases the elastic work of the lung and contributes to elevations in respiratory rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215512471063">37</xref></sup> Therefore, improvement of respiratory muscle endurance is an investment towards maintenance of proper ventilatory capacity in the postoperative period. We believe that respiratory muscle endurance behavior before and after surgery may have contributed to a lower incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in the treatment group.</p>
<p>Neither group exhibited any significant changes in spirometric parameters preoperatively, but these parameters were significantly reduced postoperatively. Decreases in lung volumes and capacities, to approximately 40% of preoperative values, have even been reported after laparoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215512471063">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The time required for postoperative recovery of baseline functional capacity is long, and the clinical course of postoperative functional recovery varies according to the measure used for assessment;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215512471063">39</xref></sup> hence our use of the functional independence measure and 6-minute walk test. In the preoperative period, all participants were classified as functionally independent. In the first 24 hours after surgery, however, all – in both groups – were completely dependent. Over the course of the postoperative period, both groups exhibited improvement in functional capacity, but this improvement was superior in the treatment group. These findings suggest that treatment group patients mounted a response against the mobility challenges posed by postoperative tubes and catheters, possibly because they had been motivated and engaged in recovery of their physical fitness since the preoperative period.</p>
<p>The 6-minute walk test has been validated for use in the preoperative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215512471063">40</xref></sup> and postoperative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512471063">41</xref></sup> periods as a measure of recovery and physical capacity. The test is not merely a walking activity, but a trial of muscle and aerobic endurance, coordination, and capacity at a level consistent with the activities of daily living. In the preoperative period, 13 (81%) treatment group patients had an increased 6-minute walk test distance in relation to their baseline distance; in seven of these subjects, the difference exceeded 30 meters. Furthermore, on the seventh postoperative day, the 6-minute walk test distance reached 64% of predicted value in the treatment group, versus 44% in the control group. This difference appears clinically relevant.</p>
<p>Our preoperative physical therapy program used low-intensity exercises, which constitutes the first limitation of the study. However, in a previous study of patients scheduled to undergo colectomy, those who followed a regimen of walking and breathing exercises had better postoperative functional capacity than those who followed a stationary cycling regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512471063">21</xref></sup> An intensive training program was found to provide no physical performance benefit over home exercises in a sample of oncologic patients undergoing abdominal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512471063">22</xref></sup> Therefore, use of a preoperative physical therapy protocol, even one lacking high-intensity exercise, may have improved patients’ functional status by mitigating preoperative inactivity. This, in turn, facilitated patient adherence and commitment to the proposed treatment. The second limitation consists of the sample size and number of participants who completed all variables and all assessments. However, this issue has been reported in other studies of preoperative interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512471063">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512471063">22</xref></sup> This trial did not use a blind design, which leads to the possibility of bias in functional independence measure assessment, because these scores depend on investigator observations. However, the 6-minute walk test was also adopted, and walking distance is an objective, observer-independent measure. Further limitations include the duration of postoperative physical therapy, the heterogeneity of the surgical procedures performed, and the lack of a strict protocol for assessment of postoperative pulmonary complications.</p>
<p>We conclude that patients who receive preoperative physical therapy before undergoing abdominal surgery exhibit better pulmonary function and functional physical performance, both before and after the operation, than subjects not receiving such an intervention preoperatively. Further studies should be carried out to investigate different preoperative exercise protocols, so that a greater number of patients can benefit from these interventions.</p>
