<abstract>
<p>Although “hot hands” in basketball are illusory, the belief in them is so robust that it not only has sparked many debates but may also affect the behavior of players and coaches. On the basis of an entire National Basketball Association season’s worth of data, the research reported here shows that even a single successful shot suffices to increase a player’s likelihood of taking the next team shot, increase the average distance from which this next shot is taken, decrease the probability that this next shot is successful, and decrease the probability that the coach will replace the player.</p>

<p>The belief in the “hot hand” in basketball suggests that a player is more likely to hit than miss following a streak of successful hits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468452">Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky (1985)</xref> analyzed the shooting of a professional National Basketball Association (NBA) team over the course of a season and found that the probability of success on any given shot was essentially independent of previous shots. The deeply held belief in the hot hand inspired many researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612468452">Adams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612468452">Hooke, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612468452">Larkey, Smith, &amp; Kadane, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612468452">Wardrop, 1995</xref>) to challenge these findings, with little success. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612468452">Alter and Oppenheimer (2006)</xref> have complained that the focus of the debate was on whether streak shooting in basketball and other sports actually exists rather than on the mechanisms that contribute to the human tendency to misidentify patterns.</p>
<p>One reason for the wide interest in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468452">Gilovich et al. (1985)</xref> result is its obvious implications for behavior on the basketball court (i.e., does the hot-hand belief affect how players conduct the game?). Surprisingly, there has been only one attempt to study this question empirically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612468452">Tversky and Gilovich (1989)</xref> examined whether a player was more likely to take the team’s next shot after a hit than after a miss. Averaging across 18 outstanding NBA players, they found that players were more likely to take the next team shot after a hit than after a miss (probabilities of .25 and .20, respectively). This result suggests that allocation of shots among the five players on the court is sensitive to perceived hotness, but it does not show that these allocation decisions are suboptimal in any way. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612468452">Burns (2004)</xref> suggested (and demonstrated in simulations) that although the hot-hand belief is false, streaks could still be used as valid allocation cues for deciding whom to give shots to.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612468452">Camerer (1989)</xref>, however, found empirical evidence that spectators’ gambling decisions might be adversely influenced by the hot-hand belief. He examined gambling bets made on NBA games and found that the bets placed on teams with winning streaks tended to lose, whereas the bets placed on teams with losing streaks tended to win. Bettors overestimated the likelihood that winning or losing streaks would continue, and bets against teams on winning streaks won more than 50% of the time. In other words, the gamblers’ overconfidence about streaking teams resulted in suboptimal bets.</p>
<p>Belief in the hot hand could affect players’ decision making in a similar way. In particular, perceived hotness may increase players’ willingness to take a shot, and because shooting during the game is usually performed under great pressure, a bias to take a shot could result in a tendency to take more risky shots, which could lead to less successful shooting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612468452">Huizinga and Weil (2009)</xref> obtained results consistent with these hypotheses for 29 top NBA shooters. Analyses across several seasons (for a total of 49 player-seasons) indicated that following a successful shot, these players were more likely to take the next team shot, were more likely to take a jump shot than a non–jump shot (which is usually made from a shorter distance), and were less likely to hit this next shot, and these effects were larger for a successful jump shot than for a non–jump shot.</p>
<p>In the research reported here, this approach was extended by analyzing shooting behavior for all NBA players and by using the precise shot distance to interpret this behavior. Shooting distance was used as a mediator for perceived hotness because a hit from a longer distance should be more readily interpretable as evidence of hotness. Because shooting distance affects the difficulty of the shot, it also can be used as a measure of the risk players take in deciding to shoot.</p>
<p>In this study, perceived hotness was defined on the basis of a single hit or miss—the weakest possible evidence of hotness. We hypothesized that if players believe in the hot-hand effect, they should be more likely to take the next shot after a hit, especially if the first shot was made from a greater distance; this subsequent shot is more likely to be taken from a greater distance (evidence of a riskier shot) and is less likely to succeed. These patterns were also contrasted with patterns for free throw shooting, which is performed from a fixed position. Finally, it was hypothesized that if coaches believe in the hot hand, their confidence in players should fluctuate on the basis of a hit or miss and, therefore, they should be more inclined to substitute a player who just missed a shot (a decision similar to the shot-allocation decisions players make).</p>
<p>The hot-hand literature can be characterized by a search for the special circumstances in which this phenomenon can be found—the clutch player (that is, a player who performs well in high-stakes situations) who is “in the zone.” It is possible that by focusing analyses (and statistical tests) on particular circumstances, a greater general phenomenon was overlooked: A reanalysis of the original data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468452">Gilovich et al. (1985)</xref> showed a statistically significant negative recency effect, a result that is consistent with the findings in this report and the opposite of a hot-hand effect.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797612468452">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The entire NBA 2010–2011 regular season was analyzed for this study. Overall, there were 41 home games for each of 30 teams. For each game, a play-by-play summary was obtained from the <italic>New York Times</italic> Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nytimes.stats.com/nba">http://nytimes.stats.com/nba</ext-link>). The data included descriptions of events and the times at which they took place. In one game, for example, at 0 min and 30 s before the end of the fourth quarter, “Dirk Nowitzki [made] a layup shot from 2 feet out. Jason Kidd with the assist.” Events included shot attempts and their distance, assists, free throws, rebounds, fouls and other violations, substitutions, time-outs, turnovers, blocks, and steals.</p>
<p>The main analysis focused on approximately 185,000 pairs of consecutive shot attempts by teams. However, these analyses excluded approximately 12,000 cases in which a player made a shot attempt and then was substituted out before the next team attempt was made or in which the two shots were made across halftime. The remaining 173,032 pairs of consecutive shot attempts were the focus of the analyses reported here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0956797612468452" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 448 players made the first shot of each pair of shots analyzed. Across players, the number of attempted shots varied widely, from 2 to 1,458 (<italic>M</italic> = 386, <italic>SD</italic> = 327, <italic>Mdn</italic> = 305). The average success rate of players also varied considerably (<italic>M</italic> = .50, <italic>SD</italic> = .07, for the 403 players with more than 30 total shots).</p>
<p>Shot distance was used as a possible mediator in the following analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612468452">Figure 1</xref> presents the frequency of shots from each distance, as well as their associated success rate. As the figure shows, in general, success rates decreased monotonically with distance, but distinct patterns emerged for different ranges. The particularly high hit rate and frequency for close-range shots (0–3 feet from the basket) reflect the relative easiness of these shots and the effort made by attacking teams to shoot from close range. The low frequency and sharp drop in success for shots made from 4 to 13 feet from the basket reflect the difficulty of shooting from this range because this range is strongly defended. The spike in frequency for shots made from 14 to 22 feet from the basket reflects the relative decrease in defensive pressure in this range. Finally, the sharp spike in frequency of shot from around the 3-point line (24 feet) reflects the effort made by offensive teams to shoot from this distance because of the increased payoff (from 2 points to 3 points) for success.</p>

<title>Repeating a shot following a hit or miss</title>
<p>The first research question was whether players are more likely to take the next shot following a hit as opposed to following a miss. The overall rate of same-player consecutive shots was .197. To avoid possible confounding across players, the relationship between success in the first shot and the identity of the second shooter (same or different) was examined using a Mantel-Haenszel analysis. Controlling for first-shooter identity, a statistically significant<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612468452">1</xref></sup> difference in the likelihood of same-player shots was found for hits and misses, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 173,032) = 758.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 1.399. In other words, the odds<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612468452">2</xref></sup> of taking a shot after a hit were 40% higher than the odds of taking a shot after a miss. This corresponds to a rate of .171 following a miss and .223 following a hit. However, the Breslow-Day statistic, which tests the null hypothesis of homogeneous odds ratios across players, was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(427, <italic>N</italic> = 173,032) = 1,012.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>An inspection of odds ratios across players showed that 74% of the 401 players with at least 30 shots had odds ratios greater than 1. For the 100 players with the most shots, 91 had odds ratios greater than 1—that is, players with odds ratios greater than 1 tended to have more shots. A positive relation also was evident between a player’s odds ratio and the average shooting distance of the player (<italic>r</italic> = .35), and the nine top shooters who had odds ratios lower than 1 tended to be power forwards (or centers) who tend to shoot from close range, such as Zach Randolph, Pau Gasol, and Kevin Love. These results suggest that the distance from which the first shot was made could be an important intervening factor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612468452">Figure 2</xref> shows the same-player rates after hits and misses for the four typical ranges of shots; the rates were similar for close-range shots but increasingly disparate for shots from longer ranges, with an odds ratio of 1.68 for long-range shots.</p>

<title>Shot distance following a hit or miss</title>
<p>We next asked whether success in a shot was related to the distance of the subsequent shot (when the same player took both shots). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797612468452">Figure 3</xref> presents the average difference in distance between the two shots for each first-shot distance range, separately for hits and misses in the first shot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0956797612468452">3</xref></sup> Regardless of the first-shot outcome, there was a regression to the mean effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797612468452">Fig. 3</xref>), whereby shots from close range generally were followed by shots from a longer range, and long-range shots generally were followed by shots from a closer range. However, the difference in the distance between the second shot and the first shot was larger for second shots that followed a hit than for those that followed a miss. This was true for initial shots from every range, but the differences increased for longer-range initial shots. This pattern suggests that players are sensitive to the difficulty of the first shot: A successful long-range shot has a stronger effect on the distance of the subsequent shot than does a successful close-range shot.</p>

</fig>
<p>A two-level analysis of covariance was conducted to confirm these suggestions, with individual players as a Level 2 random effect. The dependent variable was the distance of the second shot. The covariate was the distance of the previous shot, and success in the previous shot was coded as a dummy variable. Results for the fixed effects showed a previous-shot-distance effect of −0.04 feet (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), a previous-shot-success effect of .37 (<italic>SE</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> = .05), and a Previous-Shot-Success × Distance interaction effect of .13 (<italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In other words, the difference in expected shot distance between previous hits and misses was larger for previous shots taken from a greater distance. For previous shots taken from 0 feet, the expected difference was 0.4 feet greater when the previous shot was a hit rather than a miss. For previous shots taken from 10 feet, the expected difference was 1.6 feet greater. For previous shots taken from 24 feet (the three-point line), the expected difference was 3.4 feet greater.</p>

<sec id="section5-0956797612468452">
<title>Same-player hit rate following a hit or miss</title>
<p>We next asked whether success in the first of two consecutive team shots made by the same player is related to success in the second shot. A Mantel-Haenszel analysis was used again to examine the relationship between success in the first and second shots, controlling for shooter identity. A significant difference in the likelihood of same-player shots was found for hits and misses, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 34,060) = 73.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 0.827, which corresponds to a hit rate of .518 following a miss and .470 following a hit, indicating a negative dependency between the results of the first and second shots. The Breslow-Day statistic was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(400, <italic>N</italic> = 34,060) = 442.9, <italic>p</italic> = .07, indicating homogeneous odds ratios across players.</p>
<p>The regular game-play shots for which we observed the negative recency effect can be compared with free throws because in most cases, a player attempts two consecutive free throws. In analyzing these pairs of free throws, a slight <italic>positive</italic> and barely significant dependency between the results of the first and second shots was found, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 25,362) = 6.3, <italic>p</italic> = .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 1.094, which corresponds to a hit rate of .770 following a miss and .786 following a hit. The Breslow-Day statistic was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(398, <italic>N</italic> = 25,362) = 426.4, <italic>p</italic> = .16, indicating homogeneous odds ratios across players.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797612468452">
<title>Player substitution following a hit or miss</title>
<p>We last asked whether there is a dependency between the success of the last shot made before a substitution and whether or not the player substituted is the shooter. The total number of substitutions was 52,174, and, overall, 19.71% of the substituted players were those who had made the last shot. A Mantel-Haenszel analysis was again used to examine this relationship, controlling for shooter identity. A significant difference in the likelihood of shooter substitution was found for hits and misses, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 52,174) = 350.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 0.649, which corresponds to a substitution rate of .229 following a miss and .161 following a hit, indicating that coaches were more likely to substitute the last-shooting player if he missed the shot. The Breslow-Day statistic was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(410, <italic>N</italic> = 52,174) = 466.6, <italic>p</italic> = .03, indicating homogeneous odds ratios across players.</p>

<title>Runs of two hits or misses</title>
<p>Previous analyses focused on the effect of a single shot and showed that the shot’s success or failure was sufficient to influence subsequent decisions by players and coaches. A run of two hits or misses should result in stronger feelings of hotness or coldness and, therefore, in stronger effects (runs of more than two hits or misses are quite rare).</p>
<p>First, a stronger dependency was found between success or failure in the first two shots and whether the same player took the third successive team shot, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 8,584) = 59.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 1.553, which corresponds to a rate of .173 following two misses and .245 following two hits. The Breslow-Day statistic was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(291, <italic>N</italic> = 8,584) = 338.4, <italic>p</italic> = .03.</p>
<p>Second, a stronger negative recency effect was found between success or failure in the first two shots and success in the third shot, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 1,839) = 11.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was .693, which corresponds to a rate of .563 following two misses and .471 following two hits. The Breslow-Day statistic was significant in this case, χ<sup>2</sup>(160, <italic>N</italic> = 1,839) = 214.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p>Third, when a substitution was made after two shots by the same player, a stronger dependency was found between the identity of the substituted player and the success of the last two shots, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 2,680) = 46.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was 2.224, which corresponds to a rate of .122 following two hits and .235 following two misses. The Breslow-Day statistic was not significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(186, <italic>N</italic> = 2,680) = 213.6, <italic>p</italic> = .08.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results provide evidence that the hot-hand belief affects allocation of shots among players, risk and success of players’ shots, and substitution decisions by coaches. The analyses focused on pairs of consecutive team shots, and, therefore, the observed effects depended on the success of a single shot. Nevertheless, players (and coaches) seem to be sensitive to these weak signals in a way that is consistent with belief in the hot hand. Players were more likely to take the next team shot after a hit (especially if the first shot was taken from a longer range), and they seemed to take second shots that were more difficult than the first shots, evidenced by the longer distance of these shots.</p>
<p>This behavior may have surprising effects on the success of these second shots—players were less likely to make a successful shot following a hit than following a miss (during game play; for free throws, no such effect was found). There may be different causes for this effect, including an increased number of difficult shots taken by the players and stronger defense on players who just made a successful shot. However, the possibility of such a negative recency effect has not been considered in the literature. The debate has been limited to the question of whether there is a positive recency effect or no effect at all. It is interesting to note that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468452">Gilovich et al. (1985)</xref>, the main table of results (Table 1, concerning Philadelphia 76ers players; p. 299) shows that in general, the probability of a hit was also higher following hits than following misses, but the authors tested the serial correlations separately for each player, and these correlations were statistically nonsignificant for all but one player. Results and statistical tests in the hot-hand literature have most often been reported separately for each individual player. Separate analyses for players may have been appropriate when researchers were looking for evidence of the hot hand in the performance of specific individuals, but a focus on mechanisms and general tendencies warrants the use of analyses that summarize results across players.</p>
<p>A reanalysis of the data on Philadelphia 76ers players in Table 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468452">Gilovich et al. (1985)</xref> using the Mantel-Haenszel method showed that the results were statistically significant and indicated a negative recency effect. For example, the relation between two consecutive shots (columns 4 and 6 in Table 1) was statistically significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 3,390) = 4.2, <italic>p</italic> = .04. The estimated pooled odds ratio for all players was .867, which corresponds to a success rate of .542 following a miss and .506 following a hit.</p>
<p>This reanalysis demonstrates the emphasis on general trends that was the focus of this study. There are certainly interesting possibilities for differences in results across players or across time. For example, players’ roles (forward or guard) may affect their reactions to hits and misses, and the amount of time left on the clock may have strong effects on players’ behavior. However, as the results of this study show, there is value in a broad perspective that reveals underlying general tendencies.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that the data set analyzed in this study, although very large, was based on naturally occurring phenomena with no experimental control. It is therefore not possible to attribute the effects that were revealed in the data to belief in the hot hand. For example, coaches may tend to avoid substituting a player who just made a hit because of the possible emotional or motivational signal it could send to other players. Similarly, the defending team itself may respond to perceived hotness by defending a player more strongly after a successful shot, and the confounding effect this would introduce would be very difficult to deal with in the context of a real game.</p>
