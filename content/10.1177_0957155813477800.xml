<p>In working to draw attention to the plight of African immigrants, the Union Générale des Travailleurs Sénégalais en France (UGTSF), under the leadership of Sally N’Dongo, sought to raise awareness and provide assistance that would create a greater understanding, decrease racism, and promote equality and opportunity. As one of the most powerful African immigrant organisations of the 1960s and 1970s, the UGTSF focused on providing social welfare programmes for members and non-members alike, assisting African workers in a variety of ways as the French state struggled to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477800">Germain, 2008</xref>: 15–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477800">UGTSF, 1970</xref>: 77–81, 116–17, 134–5). While French trade unions grappled with how and whether to incorporate immigrant workers – and African immigrants in particular – the UGTSF’s rise to prominence signified the emergence of a postcolonial African trade union movement in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155813477800">Freeman, 1979</xref>: 216–58). Through the UGTSF, African immigrants involved themselves in some of the most important debates of the era while addressing critical issues such as racial discrimination and exclusion, the politics of social welfare for immigrant workers, and the challenges of integrating non-Western immigrants into the French economic, political and social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957155813477800">Pojmann, 2008</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>African workers responded to the challenges they faced in France in a way that resembled the activism undertaken by previous generations who protested against colonial policies in France and West Africa. The exclusion experienced by African immigrants in the postcolonial era resembled colonial forms of discrimination and had the same effect in inspiring political and social mobilisation, including the emergence in 1955 of the Union Générale des Travailleurs d’Afrique Noire (UGTAN) in French West Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155813477800">Cooper, 1996</xref>: 408). Organisations such as the UGTSF provided the means by which African workers could not only obtain essential services such as housing, access to literacy courses and healthcare, but also participate politically and socially in a society in which they often did not hold formal citizenship and had little official recognition or representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477800">Germain, 2008</xref>: 15–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957155813477800">Pojmann, 2008</xref>: 2). In short, the UGTSF provided an important political and social channel through which African workers could gain and retain recognition, status and assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957155813477800">Pojmann, 2008</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>The UGTSF’s work on behalf of the African immigrant community in France also fits into the broader post-war trajectory of immigrant political activism in France dating back to the first decades of the twentieth century. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, immigrants from West Africa and other regions of the French empire demanded rights within metropolitan society, decrying racism and highlighting the exploitation they endured as immigrant workers. Rather than turn to traditional political parties, though, they organised themselves into trade unions and associations, using a template borrowed from the colonial era while looking to the <italic>Négritude</italic> movement’s critique of colonialism and its emphasis on consciousness for inspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957155813477800">Irele, 2007</xref>: 203). In undertaking this kind of activism, the UGTSF and other immigrant organisations provided racial advocacy for the African diaspora in France in the early decades of the postcolonial era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957155813477800">Lloyd, 1998</xref>: 1–4). The UGTSF serves as a case study for the postcolonial advent of racial advocacy undertaken by an immigrant group on behalf not only of Senegalese immigrants in France, but also of other African immigrants residing there as well.</p>
<sec id="section1-0957155813477800">
<title>Living conditions and political activism</title>
<p>The challenging social conditions confronted by this immigrant community upon their arrival in France constituted one of the most important factors that inspired politicisation among them while shaping the agenda of groups such as the UGTSF. While African immigrants confronted increasingly restrictive migration policies over the course of the 1960s and into the 1970s, other problems emerged as well. The UGTSF tailored its agenda to address the situation. From overcrowding in slums to exploitation by French and immigrant landlords alike, African workers who sought to improve their economic position by migrating to France instead found themselves living in rundown hotels, apartments, and <italic>foyers</italic> in the peripheral <italic>arrondissements</italic> of Paris and in suburban communities such as Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Montreuil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1976</xref>: 134–40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957155813477800">Trebous, 1966</xref>: 738–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477800">UGTSF, 1970</xref>: 172–3). As Sally N’Dongo explained in <italic>‘Coopération’ et néo-colonialisme</italic>, ‘the first concern, after having found a job, is to find lodging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">1976</xref>: 114). Overcrowded <italic>foyers</italic> became the norm, with one in Ivry housing upwards of 500 residents by 1969, and another – located on the boulevard de Vaugirard in the fifth <italic>arrondissement</italic> – housing 380 residents in a space designed for 300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477800">UGTSF, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1976</xref>: 115). ‘Sleep merchants’ rented beds used by multiple workers and many dwellings had little in the way of heat or running water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1976</xref>: 114). Damp, dank living conditions and overcrowding contributed to deteriorating health, which increased the risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, and could even jeopardise an immigrant’s ability to work productively in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477800">Brincourt, 1966</xref>: 758–62). In 1964, a worker called Abdou Drame wrote to his brother and explained that, ‘the least expensive hotel costs 3000 francs per night. And that’s the hotel for the poor’. Instead of sending money back to his family as most immigrant workers intended to do, Drame wrote home asking his brother to assist him financially so that he could pay his rent. While <italic>foyers</italic> run by organisations such as the Société Nationale de Construction de Logements pour les Travailleurs (Algériens) (SONACOTRA), Association pour le soutien, l’union et la dignité de l’accueil aux travailleurs africaines (SOUNDIATA) and Association Française des Travailleurs Africains et Malgaches (AFTAM) accepted African workers throughout the Paris region, there were not enough beds to match the demand. Many found themselves living in overpriced hotels, often run by Algerian owners, leading in turn to the kind of ethnic tension and friction between immigrant communities evidenced in other cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1976</xref>: 114). Others lived in <italic>bidonvilles</italic> with no running water or electricity – conditions described by N’Dongo in his autobiography as scandalous and revolting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957155813477800">1975</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>In addition to these problems, African workers frequently arrived without work contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477800">UGTSF, 1970</xref>: 101–5), and found employment in some of the most challenging sectors of the French economy, including automobile manufacturing, metallurgy and construction, often facing underemployment and having to relocate frequently to secure and maintain work. As the UGTSF explained in its 1970 publication:
<disp-quote>
<p>Geographical mobility is considerable: they’re not attached to one region over another, and they’ll move when it’s necessary to find work … an African worker who has professional qualifications – and that’s frequently the case – is never employed at his skill level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957155813477800">1970</xref>: 103–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite their willingness to move from region to region for work, African immigrants were deemed the most expendable portion of the workforce and grappled with some of the highest rates of unemployment of any immigrant group throughout the 1960s and early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1972</xref>: 66). The challenges they faced in securing decent employment defeated the very purpose for which they migrated to France. As one worker explained in an interview conducted in the 1970s, ‘Principally, I came to work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957155813477800">Samuel, 1978</xref>: 98).</p>

<title>African and immigrant mobilisation in France: a brief history</title>
<p>Contemporary immigrant political movements in France that address these problems therefore inscribe themselves in a long and important tradition of immigrant mobilisation. The interwar period witnessed the increasing visibility of the Algerian nationalist organisation Étoile Nord-Africaine and the emergence of African immigrant trade unions such as the Union des Travailleurs nègres (UTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">Aissaoui, 2009</xref>: 1–2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477800">Dewitte, 1985</xref>: 300–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155813477800">MacMaster, 1997</xref>: 153). Tied closely to nationalist and anti-colonial organisations in French colonies such as Algeria and Senegal and linked to the Parti Communiste Français (PCF) in France, these organisations created an important tradition of cultural, economic, political and social advocacy for immigrant communities prior to decolonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477800">Dewitte, 1985</xref>: 95–102; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957155813477800">MacMaster, 1997</xref>: 153). During that same period, African and Antillean intellectuals such as Léopold Sédar Senghor and Aimé Césaire shaped the <italic>Négritude</italic> movement in metropolitan France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957155813477800">Young, 2001</xref>: xx).</p>
<p>Following the end of empire in Afrique Occidentale française (AOF) African workers continued the tradition of trade unionism by creating organisations that closely resembled their predecessors. In the immediate aftermath of colonialism, the UGTSF and other postcolonial African immigrant trade unions emerged as a means of providing stability and advocacy for the growing African immigrant community. Working within the legal stipulations governing immigrant associations in France, the UGTSF was not a clandestine immigrant organisation but received official sanction from the Préfecture de Police in line with the law of 1901 governing associations in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden and Leveau, 2001</xref>: 7). This official sanction made it possible for the UGTSF to create and maintain a highly visible position within French society through its increasingly prominent media presence, public political and social activism, and service to the African immigrant community. Recent scholarly emphasis on the <italic>sans-papiers</italic> and organisations such as SOS Racisme point to the importance of contemporary immigrant mobilisation, racial advocacy and anti-racism movements in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">Aissaoui, 2009</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155813477800">Freedman, 2004</xref>: 71–88; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957155813477800">Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957155813477800">Waters, 2003</xref>: 64–5), but these are only the most recent incarnations of African social and political activism in metropolitan France and West Africa that spanned the twentieth century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0957155813477800">
<title>Anti-colonial activity</title>
<p>The UGTSF and other such organisations also continued a long history of resisting colonial domination and exploitation in West Africa and metropolitan France, borrowing from the anti-colonial nationalist movements of the interwar and early post-war periods. Activists such as Lamine Senghor agitated against colonialism through the PCF, the Internationale and the Union Intercoloniale (UIC) while supporting African workers residing in cities such as Paris and Marseille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155813477800">Boittin, 2010</xref>: 77–110; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155813477800">Cabral, 2003</xref>: 56; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477800">Dewitte, 1985</xref>: 105–8). The work undertaken in the interwar period provided a foundation for post-war racial advocacy. These connections underscore the commonalities in terms of the problems and challenges as well as their transcolonial nature.</p>
<p>In the African immigrant context, the UGTSF also built upon the <italic>Négritude</italic> movement and the broader emphasis on social justice and human rights within Pan-Africanism and other anti-colonial nationalist movements of the twentieth century. As Robert J. C. Young explains in his preface to Jean-Paul Sartre’s <italic>Colonialism and Neocolonialism</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>[<italic>Négritude</italic>], which developed out of the context of a militant metropolitan diasporic anti-colonial radicalism, utilized any and all available sources to formulate its cultural redefinition which would enable African colonized subjects to transform themselves from the object status of abject deculturalization to which they had been reduced. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957155813477800">Young, 2001</xref>: xxi)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Building on this critical intellectual movement, the UGTSF worked to transform the lives of African workers in order to avoid a postcolonial continuation of colonial subjugation. In fact, the UGTSF’s work was part of a broader trend among non-Western immigrant groups residing in France after decolonisation. As Rabah Aissaoui has argued, ‘nationalist policies among Maghrebi migrants did not end with the independence of North African states in the 1950s and early 1960s’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">2009</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>During the colonial era African immigrant organisations focused on anti-colonial activities, but after decolonisation they turned their attention to considerations of social welfare and racial advocacy, and to supporting development in the countries of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477800">Ezra, 2000</xref>: 2). Although the Confédération générale du travail (CGT) worried that African immigrants lacked the ability to organise themselves into meaningful social and political groups, the UGTSF patterned itself on the trade unions that contributed significantly to the struggle for independence in West Africa and France, showing a strong propensity for formal organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477800">Germain, 2008</xref>: 18–24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1972</xref>: 17–40).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0957155813477800">
<title>From anti-colonialism to anti-racism</title>
<p>The emergence of the UGTSF and other postcolonial African immigrant organisations, then, marked the transition from anti-colonialism to anti-racism within the immigrant associational realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">Aissaoui, 2009</xref>: 179). Although an implicitly anti-racist message existed within the rhetoric of anti-colonial organisations such as the UTN, the dominant message of the interwar period focused on forcing the French to withdraw from its sub-Saharan African colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">Aissaoui, 2009</xref>: 6–9). With the end of empire came the need to shift the political and social focus. While North African associations such as the Mouvement des travailleurs arabes (MTA) initially focused on political developments in North Africa and then worked on assisting North African immigrants, the UGTSF did exactly the opposite, working first on the plight of African immigrants in France and then shifting the organisation’s focus to the political and economic developments in West African countries, including Senegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477800">Aissaoui, 2009</xref>: 154). In confronting racism and working to eradicate it in the two decades after decolonisation, the UGTSF and other groups borrowed heavily from nationalist anti-colonial movements that operated within the colonial and metropolitan contexts prior to decolonisation, perpetuating their rhetoric and message into the postcolonial era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477800">Ezra, 2000</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>In continuing the tradition of political activism among African immigrants, racial advocacy and anti-racism from the immigrant perspective remained central to the UGTSF’s mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2004</xref>: 162–88). The organisation’s approach was uniquely tailored to what it interpreted as the most pressing issues facing the African immigrant community. N’Dongo, as the UGTSF’s leader, sought to build on what he saw as the African immigrant community’s greatest strength – its solidarity. He explained that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Their way of life is entirely communitarian, and often they manage to entirely reconstruct their original village in France. It’s not at all rare to see a black worker cross the whole of Paris each day to have his dinner with members of his village, from whom he finds himself temporarily separated. Living communally reinforces their feeling of mutual assistance and solidarity, which is their only recourse in facing the numerous kinds of exploitation of which they are the focus. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957155813477800">N’Dongo, 1976</xref>: 116)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the Direction des Renseignements Généraux and French authorities in general labelled this migration pattern the ‘problème noir’ and expressed concern over the growing presence of African workers in Paris and throughout France and its potential threat to French national identity, the UGTSF assessed the racism inherent within French immigration policy and the initiatives undertaken to assist immigrants. In responding to institutional and cultural racism, exemplified in statements made in 1963 by the Ministry of the Interior that positioned African immigrants as anarchic, threatening and problematic, the UGTSF pursued initiatives designed to assist African workers. As the group became more overtly political by the 1970s, its critique of the French government grew stronger as well, shifting its focus to development in West Africa and continuing French influence there through neo-colonialism. Although French advocacy organisations such as MRAP (Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l’amitié entre des peuples) have addressed the racism and discrimination faced by several different immigrant communities, they have done so from a decidedly French perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957155813477800">Lloyd, 1998</xref>: 1–2). One of the UGTSF’s critical contributions was its ability to examine the problems encountered by African workers from the immigrant vantage point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0957155813477800">
<title>Race, racism and racial advocacy</title>
<p>In undertaking this type of political and social mobilisation, twentieth-century colonial and postcolonial migration to France forced French society to come to terms with the challenges of ethnic and racial diversity much sooner than many contemporary studies take into account, as confirmed by the activities undertaken by the UGTSF. Colonial workers, students, artists and intellectuals from North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Indochina took up residence in metropolitan French cities (migration patterns that of course continued to varying degrees after decolonisation) and established important networks of sociability and support which translated into various forms of racial advocacy. Political scientist Erik Bleich argues that, ‘Most government leaders during the first three postwar decades believed that racism and issues of interethnic tensions were not substantial problems in French society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2003</xref>: 141), but the work of organisations such as the UGTSF and individuals such as Sally N’Dongo contradict this view, pointing instead to substantial racial tensions during this timeframe. Decolonisation and political independence did not of course erase the racism inherent within French colonialism, nor did it eliminate racial constructions and stereotypes of African workers within French society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477800">Germain, 2008</xref>: 15–32). African immigrants not only confronted and experienced racism but also addressed its colonial legacy thanks to the political and social activism of organisations like the UGTSF.</p>
<p>Beyond the legacy of colonial racism, African immigrants faced additional challenges, given that the notion that immigrant groups could ‘become French’ grew increasingly contested, despite the emphasis on integration within French republicanism dating back to the late eighteenth and nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155813477800">Brubaker, 1992</xref>: 35–49). As France became an important receiving country for labour migration throughout the nineteenth century, historians, sociologists and other scholars have often pointed to the Italian immigrant community as an example of successful integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957155813477800">Noiriel, 1988</xref>: 71–95). However, twentieth-century French republicanism challenges this narrative because of the way in which integration found itself re-conceptualised within specific parameters and did not pay sufficient attention to the fact that the French government had singled out groups deemed ‘unfit’ to become French. Thus, by the time African workers arrived from new nation-states such as Senegal from 1960 onwards, the French state was already experienced in tracking, surveying and singling out ‘the other’ within and beyond metropolitan France, determining who did and did not belong. This was bolstered by an increasingly racialised discourse surrounding non-Western immigrant groups, and officials from the Préfecture de Police and other areas of the Ministry of Interior debated whether African immigrants could fit into the French social and political order, openly questioning their compatibility with urban life in cities such as Paris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957155813477800">Legru, 1965</xref>). Analogous questions pertaining to the desirability, suitability and perceived ability of immigrant populations to integrate persists to this day. In contrast to these <italic>exclusive</italic> approaches to integration within French republicanism, the UGTSF instead emphasised inclusiveness while simultaneously advocating the right of the African immigrant community to maintain a collective African identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0957155813477800">
<title>Immigration policy and racial advocacy</title>
<p>The UGTSF’s emphasis on inclusion also responded to important shifts in French immigration policy throughout the first three decades of the post-war era. The French government facilitated labour recruitment after World War II through the Office Nationale d’Immigration (ONI), created in November 1945 with the goal of coordinating national immigration policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 85–94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155813477800">Haus, 2002</xref>: 129). Foreign workers could obtain work permits and authorisation to work in specific sectors and zones of the economy, allowing them to contribute to the rebuilding effort in France both economically and demographically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 93–4). That same year, French sociologist Albert Bayet linked this new direction in immigration policy to the Republican emphasis on assimilation and integration, explaining that, ‘The immigrant should be seen as a future citizen as he has earned his nationality through his work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 88). Questions emerged, however, over which specific groups would become part of that recruitment effort. Considerable opposition emerged to the possibility of bringing in German workers after World War II and questions arose about whether to recruit workers from beyond Europe’s borders. While Italy, Portugal and Spain became important early sources of immigrant labour, so too did France’s colonial empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 95–6). Yet early in the post-war era, as demands for foreign labour grew, the ONI and policymakers placed an emphasis on maintaining an ethnic equilibrium and a selection process for foreign workers that emphasised ‘health, assimilability, and prolific elements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 94–8).</p>
<p>After decolonisation, the ONI and private companies continued to recruit workers throughout Europe and in former colonies such as Senegal. The circular of 10 February 1961 allowed for a process of regularisation for undocumented workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 107; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 117). This shift reflected the more liberal and less stringent stance on immigration undertaken by the provisional government and the Fourth Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 110–1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 15). Yet concerns emerged by the mid 1960s that the ONI had lost control of the immigration process. On 25 June 1965, the director-general of the Ministère du Travail et de l’Emploi released a report critiquing the ONI’s shortcomings, while expressing grave concerns over the ‘degradation of the 1945 immigration policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 125). Although regularisation remained a possibility for workers who had come to France without work contracts, a sense emerged among French officials that in fact African immigrants in particular were not the ‘future citizens’ to whom Bayet had referred and did not merit French nationality based on their work in the French economy. The state attempted to enact control over what it perceived to be an increasingly unmanageable and chaotic immigration policy and the growing levels of ethnic diversity it brought about. Consequently, over the course of the 1960s and into the 1970s, the UGTSF and other African organisations operated in an increasingly restrictive environment from the standpoint of immigration law.</p>
<p>As the post-war economic recovery showed signs of slowing down, immigration policy became increasingly restrictive. In 1963 and 1964, the French government concluded bilateral agreements with several countries, including the former West African colonies of Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. These new agreements attempted to standardise the migration process and required workers from those countries to obtain an employment contract, a guarantee of return and a medical examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 110–1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 126). The 15 July 1967 <italic>arrêt</italic> mandated that employers register newly hired foreign workers within 24 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 108). That same year, Ordinance 67-707 (21 August 1967) penalised employers if foreign workers did not obtain the medical examination required for their work permit by requiring a partial reimbursement of social security expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 108). In the aftermath of the turmoil of May 1968, the government suspended the regularisation process that had become standard at a time when almost 80 per cent of all immigrants arrived undocumented and eventually obtained work papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 108). These restrictions preceded the Marcellin and Fontanet Circulars of 1972, which centralised the process for obtaining work permits for foreign workers within the Préfecture de Police and required employers to advertise positions domestically before requesting foreign labourers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957155813477800">Money, 1999</xref>: 111). By this point, Sally N’Dongo argued that, ‘there’s a category of immigrant workers deemed particularly desirable by employers: those that we can label clandestine’ (1972: 60), whereby employers preferred to recruit undocumented labour in order to evade the requirements placed on them.</p>
<p>As Catherine Wihtol de Wenden, Virginie Guiraudon, Martin Schain and others have argued, this approach to immigration policy reached its apex in the 1970s as the French legislative branch of government remained all but shut out of the process of formulating immigration policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155813477800">Guiraudon, 1998</xref>: 297–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957155813477800">Schain, 2008</xref>: 38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 87). Within this increasingly restrictive context, African immigrants found themselves targeted for deportation while continuing to struggle with decrepit housing conditions, exploitative working conditions, racism, discrimination and alienation. It was not a coincidence that African immigrant political activism became more vocal and visible within French society during this period. Officials persisted in ranking immigrant groups, thereby triggering the corresponding marginalisation that contributed to the politicisation of the African immigrant community and other immigrant groups. As in Britain, a postcolonial version of racism succeeded its colonial predecessor in France. Despite the post-war era’s emphasis on social justice, human rights and democratisation from the Western European perspective and the disavowal of biologically based racism, racially based discrimination against workers from North African and West African countries remained entrenched, with significant consequences for French society and its immigrant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957155813477800">Hesse, 2000</xref>: 110). The racial advocacy provided by the UGTSF, then, responded to the latent and overt cultural racism throughout French society following decolonisation. Rather than disappearing, racism in the postcolonial French context shifted its focus away from biological inferiority to the backwardness and cultural incompatibility of African migrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957155813477800">Castles and Miller, 2009</xref>: 247).</p>

<title>State and associational racial advocacy</title>
<p>Despite the inconsistencies in French immigration policies, the UGTSF’s approach to racial advocacy adopted components of the French state’s approach to immigration. As the state shifted over the course of the 1960s and 1970s to what it describes as a ‘colour blind’ approach – cemented in the 1972 anti-racism law – governmental organisations continued to focus on housing, education and medical care for immigrant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2004</xref>: 162–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155813477800">Freeman, 1979</xref>: 99–130). The FAS, created in 1958, initially supported Algerian immigrants through social intervention programmes, but by 1964 had expanded its mission to include other immigrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 117). This government agency not only provided financial support for housing through Habitations à loyer modéré (HLM) and SONACOTRA but also funded a wide range of activities, including festivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2004</xref>: 166; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957155813477800">Wihtol de Wenden, 1988</xref>: 117–26).</p>
<p>At the same time, however, there was divergence between the two approaches. Whereas the French government avoided overt public references to race, and even downplayed it, in the early postcolonial era even before France’s 1972 anti-racism law, the UGTSF and other similar organisations discussed race and racism extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2003</xref>: 14). In doing so, these organisations became important sources of racial advocacy. The UGTSF addressed the problems and challenges of racism on behalf of immigrants who were frequently the target of racial discrimination in their jobs, in their housing, and at bars and other establishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477800">Bleich, 2003</xref>: 133–4).</p>
<p>Advocacy for the rights of African immigrants built upon the <italic>Négritude</italic> movement of the interwar period and organisations were modelled on the nationalist trade unions that contributed to the independence movement in West Africa. Promoting nationality over race, organisations such as the Association des Travailleurs maliens en France (ATMF) signalled an important shift in identity toward that of ‘Senegalese’ and ‘Malian’ workers, indicating an important cultural, political and social shift occurring among African immigrants and relinquishing terms such as ‘nègre’ and ‘noir’ from new organisational names and titles. The terminology changed again in the 1970s, when organisations such as the Association pour la Promotion soninké (APS) emerged emphasising ethnicity over nationality. For its part, the UGTSF focused more on culture and became more overtly politicised, and also became increasingly focused on expressions of African cultural identity in line with transitions taking place within the African community. The UGTSF also confronted the legacy of the assimilationist emphasis within French colonialism, republicanism and citizenship. Even with reforms and new conceptualisations of colonial citizenship and belonging, a barrier remained to obtaining full integration into French society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477800">Ezra, 2000</xref>: xii).</p>
<p>The UGTSF joined several organisations working on behalf of immigrant workers residing in France. Focusing on services such as healthcare, literacy training and housing, it contributed to a broader social movement comprised of immigrants demanding better working and living conditions. The organisation and its leader, Sally N’Dongo, not only offered services for African workers, but also utilised the French media to disseminate their message and call for the improved treatment of immigrants in France. Within the colonial realm, republicanism had operated under a different set of assumptions, placing colonial subjects in a position of inferiority to French administrators and settlers. The legacy of colonial racism reverberated in postcolonial France, affecting the reception of and response to African workers throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The UGTSF channelled the emphasis on justice, equality and individual rights within French republicanism in order to draw attention to the exploitation faced by the African immigrant community and the challenges that it posed for a republic premised on those values.</p>
<p>The UGTSF was part of a broader coalition of organisations – both immigrant and French – that provided advocacy and support for immigrant communities throughout the post-war and postcolonial eras. Just within the African community, organisations from the student-based Fédération des Étudiants d’Afrique Noire en France (FEANF) to the worker-oriented Union Générale des Travailleurs Maliens en France (UGTMF) provided a sense of belonging and identity to their members while supporting African workers and students alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477800">Guimont, 1997</xref>: 107–16). Based on the trade unionism appropriated by African nationalists in France and West Africa during the interwar and early post-war eras, the UGTSF and other organisations perpetuated an important tradition of immigrant political activism and African mobilisation across the twentieth century into the postcolonial era. Drawing attention to the racism and discrimination that African workers faced each day in France, the UGTSF not only provided an early form of racial advocacy but also grappled with the legacy of colonial racism within French society after decolonisation.</p>
