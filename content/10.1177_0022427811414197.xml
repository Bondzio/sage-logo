<title>Objectives.</title>
<p>This study aims to examine the impact of criminal offending on marriage formation and partner selection. Although it is well established that marriage has the potential to foster desistance from crime, far less attention has been paid to offenders' marital chances. The few studies that did investigate the effects of crime on marriage formation have not taken into account spouses' criminal behavior. However, desistance from crime may strongly depend on the criminal history of the spouse.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method.</title>
<p>We employ data from a unique longitudinal study: The Criminal Career and Life-course Study (CCLS). The CCLS contains data on the officially registered criminal careers of 4,615 Dutch offenders and their spouses. To analyze the relationship between criminal offending and outcomes in the marriage market, we use event history models.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results.</title>
<p>The results show that not only the seriousness of a criminal history but also the timing of criminal convictions affects offenders' outcomes in the marriage market. The more criminal offenses individuals have committed, the lower the chances of marrying and, given marriage, the higher the chances of marrying a criminal partner. The impact of a criminal record on marriage likelihood becomes weaker when offenders have been convicted a longer time ago.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions.</title>
<p>On the basis of our findings, we have to nuance the prominent idea that marriage reduces criminal behavior. Because of their lower marital chances and their tendency to marry criminal partners, offenders are less likely to experience protective effects of marriage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In life course criminology, marriage is considered an important event that can reduce an individual’s criminal activity and can even lead to desistance from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414197">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). The decline in criminal behavior is often attributed to the social bond that forms as a result of marriage: spouses monitor and attempt to control each other’s behavior and do not want to endanger their marital relationship by committing crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811414197">Sampson and Laub 1993</xref>). Recent empirical studies show that marriage indeed has the potential to suppress criminal offending, especially among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811414197">Blokland and Nieuwbeerta 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811414197">King, Massoglia, and MacMillan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it has been widely acknowledged that marriage affects the development of crime, surprisingly few studies have examined the reverse relationship: the effects of a criminal history on the transition to marriage. As marriage has been shown to protect individuals from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414197">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>), it is equally important to study the factors that determine offenders' marital chances. The few earlier studies in this area have mainly limited their attention to the effect of incarceration on the formation of marital unions. As a result, they focused on a selective group of serious and persistent offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811414197">Huebner 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811414197">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811414197">London and Parker 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414197">Lopoo and Western 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811414197">Western, Lopoo, and McLanahan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811414197">Western and McLanahan 2000</xref>). However, even without imprisonment, contact with the criminal justice system may diminish marital chances in a significant way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811414197">King and South 2008</xref>:3).</p>
<p>Moreover, despite its prominence, the idea that marriage is protective and reduces crime is less straightforward than assumed. The possible benefits of marriage can be hypothesized to depend strongly on the criminal behavior of the spouse. A marriage to a criminal partner may sustain or even stimulate an offender’s criminal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811414197">Rhule-Louie and McMahon 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811414197">Simons et al. 2002</xref>). For example, offenders may have similar views on the appropriateness of criminal offending, learn from each other, and pass on their criminal skills. Therefore, it is not only relevant to study if criminal convicts marry but also whom they marry.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between criminal offending, marriage formation, and partner selection. The current study will be guided by two research questions. First, to what extent does criminal offending affect the likelihood of marrying? Second, to what extent do criminal offenders marry spouses who have a criminal history as well? One of the reasons for the lack of empirical research on the effects of criminal behavior on marital outcomes is that the requirements for the design of these studies are substantial. First, longitudinal information on the development of offenders' criminal behavior is necessary. Second, this information is needed on marriage partners. Third, very long periods of observation are needed in order to examine persons beyond adolescence into adulthood.</p>
<p>To answer our research questions, we will use data from a unique long-term study of a Dutch conviction cohort: the Criminal Career and Life-course Study (CCLS). The CCLS enables us to contribute to the current literature in several ways. First, it is the first study containing data on the criminal careers of a large number of offenders <italic>and</italic> their marriage partners. Both offenders and their spouses are followed over almost the entire life course, from age 12 until age 72. Second, the data include the exact timing of marriages, convictions, and periods of incarceration. In this way we can gain more insight into the causality of the studied relationships. Third, we use a more complete measure of criminal behavior than that typically used in earlier studies. We will investigate the number of criminal convictions, the time since last conviction, different types of offenses (i.e., violent offenses), and incarceration. Fourth, the data not only allow us to investigate the marital outcomes of male offenders but also those of female offenders. Fifth, we are able to study offenders' marital outcomes in a different cultural context: the Netherlands. Earlier studies solely relied on data from the United States.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background and Previous Research</title>
<p>With the rise of life course criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811414197">Piquero, Farrington, and Blumstein 2003</xref>), studies examining the development of individual criminal careers have been accumulating. Earlier research in this area has been primarily based on Sampson and Laub’s age-graded theory of informal social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811414197">Sampson and Laub 1993</xref>). According to Sampson and Laub, important life course events can act as turning points in the criminal career. During adulthood especially marriage has been identified as a significant transitional event.</p>
<p>Although Sampson and Laub do recognize that individuals may select themselves into marriage, they assume that life course transitions are to a large extent determined by chance (Laub and Samspon 2003). As a result, their theory has mainly focused on explaining the effects of marriage on crime. Although they do recognize the role of cumulative disadvantage (the idea that offending impedes conventional life outcomes, such as marriage), they remain unclear about the mechanisms underlying offenders' marital chances. In addition, Sampson and Laub solely focused on male offenders. The assumption behind their theory is that these male offenders marry noncriminal women: “Given the crime differences between men and women, it is almost invariably the case that ‘men’ marry up and women ‘down’ when it comes to exposure to crime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414197">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>:45-46). As a result, Sampson and Laub did not pay attention to partner selection (i.e., the criminal history of the spouse).</p>
<p>To explain offenders' outcomes in the marriage market, we expand Sampson and Laub’s informal social control theory with criminological insights (e.g., Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory) and especially theoretical notions from family sociology. In contrast to criminology, family sociologists have extensively studied the mechanisms underlying marriage formation and partner selection. Sociologists argue that both marriage formation and partner selection can be expected to depend upon preferences and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811414197">Becker 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811414197">Goldscheider and Waite 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811414197">Kalmijn 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811414197">Oppenheimer 1988</xref>). In the following sections, it will be argued that criminal behavior influences these preferences and opportunities and, through this, the likelihood of marrying as well as partner choice.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022427811414197">
<title>Marriage Formation</title>
<p>There may be various reasons to enter a marital union, but usually individuals prefer to marry because it enhances their well-being—emotional, financial, and social—or because they wish to have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811414197">Becker 1981</xref>). It has been argued that offenders may have lower <italic>preferences</italic> to marry. This idea especially takes a prominent place in Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory (1990). Individuals with lower levels of self-control would have a tendency to seek immediate gratification of their desires with minimal effort and without long-term planning. Due to these underlying personal traits, they would not only be more likely to commit offenses but also less likely to marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811414197">Hirschi and Gottfredson 1995</xref>). “People with lower levels of self-control tend to dislike institutional arrangements that require discipline, supervision, or other constraints on behavior” such as marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811414197">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>:157).</p>
<p>Besides offenders' preferences, a lack of marriage <italic>opportunities</italic> can reduce their marital chances. First, a criminal record can make them less attractive marriage partners to others. A criminal record is not only a predictor of future criminal activities but also gives information about one’s prospects in the labor market and the ability to provide for a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811414197">Pager 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811414197">Western 2002</xref>). In addition, a criminal record might signal that one is more likely to commit violence (toward a partner) and less likely to show characteristics that are valued in a spouse, such as personal empathy, responsibility, maturity, and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811414197">King and South 2008</xref>:6, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811414197">Edin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811414197">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811414197">Western and McLanahan 2000</xref>). Second, besides offenders' unattractiveness as a partner, marriage formation can be constrained because offenders have lower chances to meet potential partners. This argument especially applies to incarceration. Incarceration, by way of incapacitation, removes individuals from the pool of eligible marriage partners. It may also strain and weaken bonds among those who already have established a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414197">Lopoo and Western 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although various mechanisms may apply, it can be expected that offenders have lower marital chances than nonoffenders. In this study, we examine several aspects of offenders' criminal careers: The seriousness of convictions (i.e., the number of offenses, violent offenses, and incarceration) and the timing of convictions. We argue that the mechanisms generating marital chances not only apply to offending and nonoffending but also to the seriousness of a criminal history. The more serious a criminal history, the weaker the offenders' preferences toward marriage and the higher the perceived constraints will be. Furthermore, constraints in the marriage market are likely to diminish when criminal activities took place a longer time ago: potential partners may be unaware of or unconcerned about these offenses. Also, the offenders' own preferences might change, once a criminal lifestyle has been abandoned.</p>
<p>In line with the foregoing, we formulate three hypotheses. First, we expect that the more offenses a person has committed, the lower the odds of marrying becomes. Second, we expect that violent offenses and incarceration—as indicators of even more serious involvement in crime—decrease marital chances even further. Third, we expect that the longer ago the last conviction, the higher marital chances become.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, so far very little research exists on the effects of criminal behavior on marriage formation. One of the main studies is Sampson and Laub’s reanalysis of the Glueck data. Although their primary aim was to investigate the effect of marriage on crime (i.e., the reverse relationship), they estimated a propensity score model of the chance to marry as a way to control for selection effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>). The results showed that juvenile delinquent behavior, an early age at first arrest, arrest in the previous year, the total number of arrests until the previous year, and the length of incarceration in the previous year reduced men’s marital chances throughout adulthood (odds ratios range from .59 to .99).</p>
<p>Other studies in this area solely focused on the effects of incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811414197">Huebner 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811414197">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811414197">London and Parker 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414197">Lopoo and Western 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811414197">Western, Lopoo, and McLanahan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811414197">Western and McLanahan 2000</xref>). In general, they supported the idea that incarceration has immediate effects, but results were mixed when it concerns the long-term effects of incarceration after men’s release from prison. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414197">Lopoo and Western (2005)</xref> found that the odds of the transition to marriage were 78 percent lower for currently incarcerated men compared to nonincarcerated men (odds ratio = .22). They observed no such effect of having ever been incarcerated on the transition to marriage. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811414197">Huebner (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811414197">2007</xref>) found a significant effect of adult incarceration on the likelihood of marrying that continues after release from prison (odds ratios varied between .42 and .68 for different racial groups).</p>

<sec id="section4-0022427811414197">
<title>Partner Selection</title>
<p>In addition to the choice to marry, the choice of whom to marry can be assumed to arise from an interplay between individual preferences for certain characteristics in a spouse, and the opportunities that marriage candidates have to meet dissimilar partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811414197">Kalmijn 1998</xref>). In general, individual <italic>preferences</italic> to marry a certain person are based on an evaluation of the resources that a person has to offer. Individuals may either prefer a partner who is similar, which is likely to hold for sociocultural resources (i.e., ethnicity), or prefer a partner with many resources, which is plausible in case of socioeconomic resources (i.e., income; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811414197">Kalmijn 2005</xref>). In the context of criminal activities, it could, on one hand, be argued that offenders are likely to prefer a partner who shows criminal behavior as well. An advantage of this similarity in criminal lifestyle is that it promotes mutual understanding between partners. On the other hand, it could be argued that all individuals, be it criminals or not, seek a trustworthy partner who is not involved in criminal activities. Being married to a criminal offender may introduce a variety of problems, such as trouble with the law and regular separation from the family as a result of incarceration. Regardless of whether offenders prefer a similar or a noncriminal partner, homogamy (i.e., resemblance between partners) will be the likely outcome in both cases. Preferences for similar partners obviously lead to homogamy, but so does competition over noncriminal partners: persons with the most attractive characteristics have a high likelihood of selecting each other as partners first, leaving the less fortunate to end up together.</p>
<p>The choice for a marriage partner is constrained by mere meeting <italic>opportunities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811414197">Kalmijn 1998</xref>). Opportunities to meet similar others are generally larger than opportunities to meet dissimilar others. Chances to meet dissimilar partners are, for example, reduced by local marriage markets. Partners often meet each other at specific locations and occasions, such as the neighborhood, at school or through friends. The composition of these local marriage markets is often quite homogeneous: criminal activity tends to be concentrated in certain neighborhoods or friendship networks. Therefore, people will have an increased probability of selecting someone who is similar as to criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811414197">Krueger et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One’s own preferences and the constraints of the marriage market both suggest that marriages are homogamous as to criminal activities of the spouses. We formulate three hypotheses. First, we expect that the more criminal offenses a person has committed, the higher the chance that his or her partner is criminally active as well. Second, incarceration and violent offenses are expected to further increase the chance of marrying a criminal partner. Third, we expect that the longer ago a person has been convicted, the lower the chance of marrying a criminal spouse becomes.</p>
<p>Although long-term longitudinal data on partners' complete criminal careers were not available up to now, some studies do provide insight into partner similarity. First, a number of studies examined criminal behavior among already married couples. These studies show that partners were similar with regard to their involvement in crime, although the strength of the associations varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811414197">Galbaud du Fort et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811414197">Krueger et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811414197">Quinton et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811414197">Taylor, McGue, and Iacono 2000</xref>). Second, there are studies that showed that youthful delinquent behavior was positively related to criminal behavior of one’s intimate partner in young adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811414197">Simons et al. (2002)</xref> found a significant effect of adolescent delinquent behavior on having an antisocial partner for men as well as women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811414197">Moffitt et al. (2001)</xref> found significant correlations between individuals' antisocial behavior during adolescence and their partner’s self-reported delinquency, violence, and criminal charges at court (correlations varied from .21 to .34). In some cases, depending on the specific outcome under study, the criminal behavior of female offenders and their partners correlated stronger than the criminal behavior of male offenders and their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811414197">Moffitt et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811414197">Simons et al. 2002</xref>). A disadvantage of all before mentioned studies is that they only had information about spouses' criminal behavior at the time of the relationship. The similarity between partners is thus not necessarily caused by selection processes but may also result from the fact that partners influence each other’s criminal behavior during the relationship.</p>

<title>Marriage and Crime in the Netherlands</title>
<p>An important idea within the life course perspective is that offenders' lives are embedded and shaped by context (i.e., historical time and place; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414197">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). The data used in this study relate to a specific context: the Netherlands. The sample subjects were born between 1906 and 1965 and have been followed from age 12 until the year 2002. In this context, two aspects are of importance. First, compared to the United States (and most other European countries), the Netherlands was characterized by a lenient penal climate at least until the 1990s. Few offenders were convicted, few convicted offenders were sentenced to prison, and sentences were relatively short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811414197">Kommer 1994</xref>). A lenient penal climate may affect offenders' marriage opportunities in several opposite ways. On the one hand, offenders' attractiveness as potential partners may be even lower. In a context, where convictions and imprisonment are less common, the negative signal of a criminal record is likely to be stronger, leading to even lower chances to marry. On the other hand, offenders' meeting opportunities are likely to be higher, because prison sentences are relatively short. The idea that imprisonment removes offenders from the marriage market is less applicable to many offenders.</p>
<p>Second, the Dutch context is also important, because from the 1970s onward it became more and more common to cohabit, and cohabitation even became a substitute for marriage. Among individuals who start living together with a partner for the first time close to 100 percent were married in the first half of the century. Nowadays, almost 80 percent first cohabits among this group (Liefbroer and Dykstra 2002:93). For our analysis, the trend toward cohabitation is however of less relevance. The CCLS contains data on a cohort of persons convicted in 1977. As a result, the largest share of the offenders already reached a marriageable age before the seventies. In addition, the trend toward cohabitation is universal and also present in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811414197">Kalmijn 2002</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between criminal behavior and marital outcomes is likely to be affected in a similar way by cohabitation.</p>

<p>In order to answer our research questions, we analyze data of the CCLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811414197">Nieuwbeerta and Blokland 2003</xref>). CCLS offenders were selected by taking a 4 percent sample of all cases of criminal offenses tried in the Netherlands in 1977, with an oversampling of less common—mainly serious—offenses (e.g., murder and rape) and an undersampling of common offenses (e.g., drunk driving). This resulted in a total sample of 4,615 offenders (4,187 men and 428 women).</p>
<p>Extracts (“rap sheets”) from the General Documentation Files (GDF) of the Criminal Record Office were used to reconstruct the entire criminal careers of all 4,615 sampled individuals from the age of 12—the minimum age of criminal responsibility in the Netherlands—until the year 2003. In the Netherlands, a person is not given a “blank sheet” upon becoming an adult. The extracts used thus contain information on both juvenile and adult offenses. Although the GDF contain information on all offenses that have led to any type of judicial action, here we use only information on those offenses that were either followed by a conviction or a prosecutorial disposition because of policy reasons, thereby excluding cases that resulted in an acquittal or a prosecutorial disposition because of insufficient evidence. This means that only those criminal law offenses are studied that most likely have been committed by the offenders.</p>
<p>To determine developments in life circumstances, the judicial data have been supplemented with data from the population registration records. These records contain information on marriage, divorce, fertility, and date of death. All data are derived from official sources, which means that they are of high quality and have very few missing values. Because the mean age of the offenders was about 27 years in 1977, we have data on criminal careers and life circumstances that reach far into adulthood for the largest part of the sample.</p>
<p>Especially for this study, the CCLS was extended with data on the complete criminal careers of all marriage partners from age 12 to the year 2007. The earlier collected population registration records show that 74.9 percent (<italic>N</italic> = 3,456) of the 4,615 offenders married at least once. These persons have been married to 4,409 partners in total—including all ex-partners. By enlarging the original CCLS, we now know for all offenders and partners the exact timing of criminal offenses, the type of offenses committed, periods of incarceration, and the exact timing of marriages.</p>
<p>When interpreting the results of the analyses, it has to be taken into account that the CCLS sample consists of offenders only. All sampled individuals had their case tried in 1977 and—as a result—have been convicted at least once during their lives. Those who have no convictions prior to their marriage will, by construction, have at least one conviction during or after their marriage. Our results thus speak to the effect of criminal convictions on marriage among convicted and to-be-convicted individuals, and not necessarily to the population at large.</p>
<p>However, having a selective sample of offenders can actually be regarded as a strength as well. In fact, it might be more useful to compare the offenders with not-yet offenders than with a sample of nonoffenders. Not-yet offenders are likely to be much more similar to offenders with regard to unmeasured characteristics that influence both the likelihood of offending and marriage. This might be especially relevant for the current analyses. Although the CCLS data are unusually rich with regard to the offenders' criminal and marital histories, information on other variables known to be related to marital and offending behavior (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and self-control) is lacking. The selectivity of the sample thus partly offers a solution to the fact that we do not have information on these control variables.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics on the criminal and marital careers of the sampled individuals are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811414197">Table 1</xref>. We were able to trace males’ criminal careers until an average age of about 53, and females’ criminal careers until an average age of 58. Examining criminal backgrounds, it appears that men have been convicted for a mean number of 12.7 offenses, and women of 3.9 offenses. Compared to women, men started their criminal careers on average at an earlier age (age 20.7 vs. 28.1). Between ages 12 and 21 (for most persons the period before marriage), a large share of the CCLS offenders already committed crimes. Compared to women, men have been convicted more often, committed more offenses, used violence more often, and were sentenced to prison more frequently.</p>

<p>Examining marital backgrounds, we find that a higher proportion of women has ever been married (86.7% vs. 73.2%). For women, first marriages occur at an earlier age than for men—on average three years earlier (age 23.2 vs. 26.2). Remarkably, for women, the age of first conviction is on average higher than the age of first marriage. On one hand, this may result from the fact that their male partners stimulate criminal behavior during marriage; on the other hand, it may also result from a marital dissolution (e.g., single mothers who have to provide for their children).</p>
<p>Although the criminal history of women was less severe, the percentage marrying a criminal partner was almost six times higher compared to men (22.9% vs. 4.0%). This might result from the fact that there are simply more men with a criminal record available, and therefore chances to meet them are higher. Also, it might be the case that some of the female partners actually are delinquent, but are convicted less often (e.g., because they commit less serious crimes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022427811414197">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To analyze the relationship between criminal behavior and outcomes in the marriage market, we use discrete-time event history models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811414197">Allison 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811414197">Yamaguchi 1991</xref>). To estimate the discrete-time event history models, a person–period file was constructed with records containing information on criminal behavior, marriage, and other relevant covariates for each individual in each year. We constructed a file that begins at age 16—the minimum age for marriage in the Netherlands—and ends in the year in which the person first married or the year in which the data collection ended in case the person did not marry. The fully constructed data file contains information on 75,598 person years for 4,615 individuals.</p>
<p>We restrict ourselves to examining the effects of criminal offending on first-time marriage. First, most persons in our sample marry only once (76%). Second, and most importantly, the focus on first-time marriage allows us to avoid having to account for feedback effects between marriage and crime whereby marriage affects the likelihood of crime which in turn affects the likelihood of (a criminal) marriage. Accounting for such an endogenous relationship would greatly complicate the analyses and also increases the risk that our estimates of the effect of offending are contaminated by biases due to endogeneity. Although the focus on first-time marriage limits the generalizability of our findings, we eliminate an important source of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414197">Nieuwbeerta, Nagin, and Blokland 2009</xref>:232).</p>
<p>We estimate two types of event history models, one for each research question. First, to investigate offenders' marital chances (research question 1), we applied logistic regression analyses to the person–period file. In the logistic regression analyses, we estimate the probability of marrying in a given year, conditional on whether one is still single in the previous year. The dependent variable is a binary variable that equals 1 in the year a person first marries and 0 for all earlier years (the years after marriage are deleted). Those persons who never marry obtain a score of 0 in all years.</p>
<p>Second, to investigate partner selection (research question 2), we apply multinomial logistic regression analysis to the person–period file. In these so-called competing risk models, we estimate (1) the conditional probability of marrying a criminal partner versus staying unmarried in a given year and (2) the conditional probability of marrying a criminal partner versus a noncriminal partner in a given year. The dependent variable in these analyses is a categorical variable that is coded 2 in the year a newly married person marries a criminal partner, 1 in the year a newly married person marries a noncriminal partner, and 0 in all earlier years. Again the years after marriage are deleted, and those who never marry are coded 0 in all years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811414197">1</xref></sup> In the competing risk models, we thus take into account the characteristics of the persons who stay unmarried when estimating the chance to marry a particular partner. Marital outcomes are not considered a gradual process in which persons first decide to marry and after that decide to marry a particular kind of partner; the assumption is that persons make these choices simultaneously. By a criminal partner, we mean a spouse who has ever been convicted before the year of marriage. All analyses have been conducted for men and women separately.</p>
<p>For both men and women, we include two measures of criminal behavior in our models (model 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811414197">2</xref></sup> First, we measure the <italic>total number of convictions until the last</italic>
<italic>year</italic>. Exploratory analyses revealed that the relationship between the number of convictions and marriage is not linear (i.e., there is a clear turning point). Therefore, we constructed different categories (0 convictions, 1 conviction, 2–5 convictions, 6–10 convictions, and more than 10 convictions). Second, we measure the <italic>number of years since the last conviction</italic>. By including this variable, we can distinguish offenders who are criminally active in the period just before marriage from those who have been criminally active a longer time ago. Exploratory analyses showed that a linear function covers the relationship between this variable and marital outcomes adequately. The measurement of this variable is somewhat complicated, because we are interested in assessing the effect of this variable for offenders and want to retain the nonoffenders in the analyses as well. Therefore, we assigned a single value to the nonconvicted persons. If we would not assign a value to the nonoffenders, they would be missing by definition and the number of cases would substantially drop. We chose the age-specific mean. This is the average number of years since the last conviction for those convicted at that specific age. To decrease the correlation with age, we centered the variable on the age-specific mean. As we already include a variable distinguishing offenders and nonoffenders (<italic>total number of convictions until last year</italic>), the effect of <italic>number of years since last conviction</italic> refers to offenders only. We checked if the results change if we impute other values, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>For men, we also estimate an additional model (model 2) in which we include the effects of violent offenses and incarceration. We only estimate the effects of these variables for men, because the number of violent offenders and incarcerated offenders appears to be very small among women (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811414197">Table 1</xref>). First, we measure whether men were <italic>ever convicted for a violent offense</italic>
<italic>until the last year</italic>. Rape, assault, other sexual offenses, threat, battery, murder and manslaughter, robbery, and extortion are all classified as violent offenses. Second, we inquire whether men were <italic>ever incarcerated until the last year</italic>. The total number of convictions is too strongly correlated with ever being incarcerated (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .70) and distorts the results. Therefore, we include a measure indicating whether a man was <italic>ever convicted until the last year</italic> instead of the total number of offenses until the last year. All three variables are coded 1 in every year following the year of first conviction or incarceration, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>In all models, we control for a number of other characteristics that are known to confound the association between offending and marriage. First of all, we include <italic>age</italic> and <italic>age squared</italic> in the models. In order not to force the relationship between age and the risk of marriage to be a linear function, we also include the quadratic age term in our models. Second, we add a time-constant dummy variable indicating whether persons are <italic>non-Dutch</italic> (not born in the Netherlands). Third, we include a time-varying dummy variable capturing whether a <italic>child was coresiding in the last year</italic>.</p>

<title>Marriage Formation</title>
<p>Our first research question concerns the impact of criminal offending on marriage formation. With the logistic regression analyses, we estimated the likelihood of marrying in a given year, conditional on whether one is still single in the previous year. The analyses are conducted for men and women separately. The <italic>B</italic> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811414197">Table 2</xref> represent logistic regression coefficients. These coefficients can be transformed to odds ratios by raising e to the power of <italic>B</italic> (<italic>e<sup>B</sup>
</italic>). Negative <italic>B</italic> values indicate that the odds of marrying become lower. The extent of this decrease can be computed by subtracting the exponentiated coefficient from 1 (1 − <italic>e<sup>B</sup>
</italic>).</p>
<p>Model 1 shows that male offenders who committed six or more offenses have significantly lower chances to marry. Compared to men without a criminal record the odds of marrying are 24 percent lower for men who have been convicted of 6–10 offenses (1 – e<sup>−.28</sup> = 1 – 0.76 = 0.24). The relationship is even stronger for men who committed more than 10 offenses until the last year: their odds of marrying are 42 percent lower (e<sup>−.55</sup> = .58). We thus only find an association between criminal behavior and marriage for men with an extensive criminal record. In addition, we see that the longer ago a man was convicted, the higher his odds of marrying become (<italic>B</italic> = .04). This suggests that the effects of a criminal record indeed diminish over time. In model 2, we estimated the relative importance of convictions, violent offenses, and incarceration. For men, the effect of incarceration appears to be even stronger than the effect of convictions. For those who were ever incarcerated until the last year, the odds of marrying in that year are 42 percent lower (e<sup>−.54</sup> = .58). That we do not find a comparable effect for violent offenses can be explained by the fact that this variable is relatively strongly correlated with incarceration. On the basis of these results, we can thus conclude that the seriousness of a criminal history matters even more than having a criminal record per se.</p>
<p>In contrast to the men in our sample, we see that women who were convicted once until last year have significantly lower chances to marry in that year: the odds of marriage are 30 percent lower compared to nonoffenders (e<sup>−.36</sup> = .70). For women who have been convicted of 2 to 5 offenses the odds of marrying are even slightly lower (e<sup>−.39</sup> = .68). This suggests that convictions have different implications for females. Because a criminal lifestyle is less common and accepted for women, a woman who has been convicted for a small number of offenses might be comparable to a man who has committed a large number of offenses. That we do not find significant differences for the other categories can be attributed to the fact that the number of women who have been convicted more than five times is very small. Finally, we find—just as for men—that the longer ago the last conviction, the higher the odds of marrying becomes (<italic>B</italic> = .08). We can thus conclude that, in addition to the seriousness of a criminal record, the timing of convictions is related to marital chances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811414197">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811414197">Table 2</xref> shows other interesting findings as well. For example, non-Dutch are found to have significant lower chances to marry—this is the case for men as well as women. The presence of a child affects marital chances differently for both sexes. A child is related to higher odds of marrying for men, whereas no relationship is found for women. In line with this result, it has been argued that women who have children out of wedlock might be more reluctant to marry the fathers of their children, because of their poor economic prospects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811414197">Edin 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811414197">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811414197">5</xref></sup>
</p>

<sec id="section10-0022427811414197">
<title>Partner Selection</title>
<p>Our second research question concerns the impact of criminal offending on partner selection (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811414197">Table 3</xref>). In the competing risk models, we estimate (1) the conditional probability of marrying a criminal partner versus staying unmarried and (2) the conditional probability of marrying a criminal partner versus marrying a noncriminal partner. Within each model, the second comparison most directly answers our research question: marrying a criminal partner versus noncriminal partner.</p>
<p>For men as well as women, model 1 shows that only those persons who committed more than one offense until the last year have a significantly higher likelihood of marrying a criminal partner (see the second comparison within each model). In line with our hypothesis, we see that the higher the number of convictions, the higher the chance to marry a criminal partner. For example, for men who have been convicted of 2–5 offenses, the odds of marrying a criminal partner are about twice as high (e<sup>.73</sup> = 2.08), and for men who have been convicted of 6–10 offenses the odds are three times as high (<italic>e</italic>
<sup>1.18</sup> = 3.25). For women, the odds are even higher (respectively, e<sup>1.34</sup> = 3.82 and <italic>e</italic>
<sup>1.62</sup> = 5.05), although the differences are not significant.</p>
<p>Again, for men the relationship between having ever been incarcerated and marital outcomes appears to be stronger than between having ever been convicted and marital outcomes (although the difference is smaller now): the odds of marrying a criminal partner are 95 percent higher (e<sup>.67</sup> = 1.95) for men who have ever been incarcerated compared to their nonincarcerated counterparts (see the last column of model 2). In addition, we find that males' partner choices are related to their violent offenses: being convicted for a violent offense until the last year increases the odds of marrying a criminal partner (e<sup>.61</sup> = 1.84). The seriousness of a persons' criminal behavior is thus clearly related to the type of partner one marries. We do not find support for our hypothesis that the time since last conviction affects partner choice.</p>
<p>Finally, the control variables show some additional interesting findings (see again the second comparison of each model). The presence of a child is associated with higher odds of marrying a criminal partner. This does not only apply to men but also to women. When we assume that persons marry the mother or father of the child, this relationship could, for example, be attributed to the partners' lower levels of self-control. This characteristic not only leads persons to have children out of wedlock but also makes them more crime prone. On the other hand—when not marrying the father or mother of the child—single parents may become less attractive marriage partners to others. As a result, they may have to lower their standards, which increases the likelihood that they will partner with a convicted criminal. The fact that non-Dutch women have lower chances of marrying a criminal partner than Dutch women may be an artifact of the way our data have been collected. We only have information on offenses that have been tried in the Netherlands. As non-Dutch can be assumed to have higher chances to marry a partner who is non-Dutch as well, it is possible that we may not have the complete criminal histories of these partners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022427811414197">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Another remarkable finding shows up, if we look at the other comparison: the probability of marrying a criminal partner versus staying unmarried (the first comparison within each model). It appears that offenders do not eschew marriages altogether. The positive coefficients indicate that offenders are actually more likely to marry criminal spouses than to stay unmarried. This not only applies to men but also to women. The more serious a criminal history, the higher the odds of marrying a criminal spouse becomes. For example, men who have been convicted for 2–5 offenses are almost two times more likely to marry a criminal spouse (e<sup>.68</sup> = 1.97), while men with more than 10 convictions are more than three times more likely to marry a deviant spouse than not to marry (<italic>e</italic>
<sup>1.25</sup> = 3.49). Women who have been convicted for 2–5 offenses or 6–10 offenses are also two to three times more likely to marry a criminal spouse than to stay unmarried (the odds are respectively: e<sup>.67</sup> = 1.95 and e<sup>1.11</sup> = 3.03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which criminal offending is related to marriage formation and partner selection. Various studies have shown that marriage can reduce criminal behavior (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811414197">Blokland and Nieuwbeerta 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811414197">King, Massoglia, and MacMillan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is equally important to investigate the factors that determine offenders' outcomes in the marriage market. The lack of research in this area can partly be explained by the fact that adequate data were lacking. We used data from a unique longitudinal study: the CCLS. In contrast to earlier research, the CCLS enabled us to examine the complete criminal careers of both offenders <italic>and</italic> their spouses.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings revealed that the <italic>seriousness</italic> of a criminal history is strongly related to outcomes in the marriage market. The more criminal offenses a person has committed, the lower the chances of marrying and, given marriage, the higher the chances of marrying a criminal partner. Both preferences and opportunities can explain these findings. For example, an increase in the number of offenses may not only lower opportunities to marry a noncriminal spouse (e.g., more involved in criminal networks) but also weaken preferences toward marrying a noncriminal spouse (e.g., lower levels of mutual understanding). Besides the seriousness of a criminal history, we found that the <italic>timing</italic> of convictions is associated with marital chances: The impact of a criminal record on marriage likelihood becomes weaker when offenders have been convicted a longer time ago. On the one hand, it might be that potential partners do not know or do not care about these offenses; on the other hand, it can be the case that the preference to marry becomes stronger once a criminal lifestyle has been abandoned.</p>
<p>These findings need to be nuanced in two ways. First, we found gender differences. Females' marital chances diminish as soon as they have been convicted once, while males' marital chances are only affected if they have an extensive criminal record. Given that a criminal lifestyle is less common and accepted for women, a criminal record may make them even less attractive marriage partners than male convicts. For men, incarceration is associated with even lower marital chances than having a criminal record per se. This finding is in line with the idea that incarceration does not only restrain inmates from committing crime but also hinders relationship formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414197">Lopoo and Western 2005</xref>). Contrary to what we might have expected, this result (and also the effect size) is quite comparable with earlier studies on the relationship between incarceration and marriage formation that were based on U.S. data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414197">Sampson, Laub, and Wimer 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we found that offenders do not refrain from marriage altogether. They are more likely to marry criminal spouses than to stay unmarried. On the basis of these results, we have to nuance Gottfredson and Hirschi’s idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811414197">Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811414197">Hirschi and Gottfredson 1995</xref>) that offenders tend to avoid the institution of marriage, because of their underlying personal traits. The earlier finding that offenders are less likely to marry than to stay unmarried can be attributed to the fact that they are less likely to marry <italic>noncriminal</italic> spouses. This may not only result from their own preferences (i.e., a preference for criminal partners) but also from a lack of opportunities to marry noncriminal spouses. As the group marrying noncriminal spouses is relatively large, this drives the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811414197">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The finding that offenders are more likely to marry a deviant spouse than to stay unmarried may be explained by premarital childbirth. The data show that a substantial share of the CCLS sample members had a child before marriage (11.5 percent of the men and 20.2 percent of the women). Among those who marry a criminal spouse, these percentages are even higher (23.1 percent of the men and 29.6 percent of the women). Having a child may increase the chance to marry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811414197">Table 3</xref> shows that this is indeed the case). In addition, the historical context should be taken into account. Most CCLS sample members reached a marriageable age before the 70s of the previous century. Singlehood was less common during that period. This means that the offenders had a high likelihood of getting married during their lives (irrespective of the characteristics of the spouse). Future studies are needed to see if this finding holds in other contexts.</p>
<p>Although the CCLS data are unique—and already improve upon earlier studies focusing on incarceration—some limitations have to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, our analyses rely on official data. Therefore, we probably underestimate the total number of delinquent acts. Not all criminal offenses are known to the police and not all offenses are prosecuted. The underestimation can be selective, when the probability of being convicted is not equal for all persons. Some criminal persons may be more likely to be intensely monitored by the police, while others have smarter strategies to keep out of the arms of the law. On the other hand, it should be noted that the use of official data has an important advantage as well: We are able to examine a wide range of criminal activities that differ in severity, that is, violent offenses, property offenses, drug offenses, weapon offenses, and offenses against the public order. Also, our measure of criminal behavior is not disturbed by social desirability problems and memory problems, as would have been the case with self-report data. Ideally though, one would like to complement a longitudinal study such as the CCLS with self-report data in future research. This would not only create a more valid measure of criminal involvement but would also make it possible to disentangle the effects of involvement with the criminal justice system from the effects of committing crimes per se. The institutional effects associated with the criminal justice system might reduce marriage opportunities even more (e.g., through higher levels of stigma).</p>
<p>Second, our measure of marriage includes only legal marriage. The lack of information on cohabitation is less of a problem for our analysis: the largest share of the CCLS men had reached a marriageable age prior to 1970. However, with increasing rates of cohabitation in the Netherlands, the United States, and other countries, research on the relationship between criminal behavior and other living arrangements is needed (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811414197">Bersani, Laub, and Nieuwbeerta 2009</xref>:22). Cohabitation is considered a living arrangement indicative of lower levels of social integration with vaguer norms and expectations, which may be especially attractive to (more serious) offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811414197">London and Parker 2009</xref>). Offenders may not only be more likely to enter less stable relationship forms, these type of relations might also have a different impact on the development of crime. Earlier research seems to support this idea. Living with a spouse has been found to be associated with lover levels of offending, while living with a girlfriend was associated with higher levels crime, especially drug crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811414197">Horney, Osgood, and Marshall 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, when investigating the relationship between criminal behavior and marital outcomes, we have not been able to control for a number of other characteristics likely to be correlated with both crime and marriage (e.g., SES, education, personality characteristics). Because of this lack of information, we have not been able to gain complete insight in the mechanisms underlying the relationship between crime and marriage. Untangling these mechanisms and determining their relative importance is an important task for future research.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, our conclusions have significant implications for criminological theories emphasizing the protective effects of marriage and give important guidelines for future research. In contrast to Sampson and Laub, Gottfredson and Hirschi did focus on the mechanisms underlying marriage formation (offenders' lower marital chances would be caused by their lower levels of self-control). However, just as Sampson and Laub, they did not pay attention to partner selection (i.e., the criminal history of the spouse whom one is marrying). To gain more insight into the development of offenders' criminal careers, both theories need to be extended.</p>
<p>On the basis of the current findings, we have to nuance the prominent idea that marriage reduces criminal behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414197">Laub and Sampson 2003</xref>). First, offenders are less likely to experience the protective effects of marriage, because of their lower marital chances. Second, crime-reducing effects of marriage may very well be limited, because criminals have a tendency to marry criminal partners. Questions on the effects of partner relationships need to be addressed in future research. These studies should take into account that young offenders face processes of cumulative disadvantage. This means that they should not focus on the relationship per se but also pay close attention to the criminal behavior of the partner.</p>

<p>In additional analyses, we checked if the relationship between time since last convictions and outcomes in the marriage market depends on the seriousness of a criminal history. If one has an extensive criminal record it might be less important if the last crime has been committed a long time ago. To investigate this possibility, we extended model 1 by adding interactions between “the number of convictions until last year” and “number of years since last conviction”.
