<p>The book <italic>Retribution has a Past: Has It a Future?</italic> is a collection of articles presented by penal theorists at two conferences in the Netherlands in 2008 and 2009. These conferences were sponsored by the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement and the Institute on Crime and Public Policy of the University of Minnesota Law School. The book’s editor, Michael Tonry, is a professor of law and public policy and the codirector of the Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at the University of Minnesota Law School. Tonry put the conferences together to address the problem of providing theoretical justifications for recent U.S. sentencing practices that he criticizes are unprincipled.</p>
<p>Overall, the book contains an Introductory essay by Tonry followed by 12 essays by international sentencing scholars, some of which are discussed below. Tonry establishes the purpose of the book early in his Introductory essay, “Can Twenty-first Century Punishment Policies Be Justified in Principal?” by tracing current sentencing practices to the wave of retributive sentencing that took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the Reagan Administration in the United States. Similar practices were adopted by the Thatcher Administration in Great Britain. In the United States, these sentencing practices replaced the rehabilitative-based indeterminate sentencing policies with retributive-based determinate sentencing schemes under the principal that the new laws would cure the old system of inherent proportionality defects. However, Tonry notes that by the 1990s proportionality disappeared as a sentencing policy goal in the United States resulting in unprincipled and morally unjustifiable sentencing practices, such as mandatory minimum sentences, three strikes you are out laws, “sexual predator” laws, and life without parole sentences. Tonry criticizes that, unlike the principled sentencing decisions of late 1970s and early 1980s, the new sentencing practices were often constructed by politicians to reassure frightened publics and to express public anger. Today, these harsh measures exist with rehabilitative sentencing practices such as drug courts and restorative justice programs. Tonry claims the newer sentencing schemes are doomed to failure unless penal theorists can find a way to justify them in terms of proportionality or a consistent sentencing philosophy.</p>
<p>In his essay, “Punishment Futures: The Desert model Debate and the Importance of the Criminal Law Context,” Von Hirsch explains that Tonry along with other book contributor’s such Kleinig, Duff, and himself are “desert model” theorists who are opposed to traditional forms of retributivism in two important ways. The first is an objection that punishment rests on “metaphysical” notions of requital of evil for evil. Rather modern “desert model” theorists put forth the simpler explanation that punishment is a blaming institution that involves the “censure” of the actor for his criminal conduct. The second objection is the rejection of the traditional “an eye for an eye” punishment philosophy. Punishment for “desert model” theorists does not require an equivalent amount of suffering, only proportional sanctions that represent the seriousness of the offense. The central principal for the “desert model” theorist is proportionality. Disproportionate sentences are unjust because they publically censure offenders in a way that cannot be justified in terms of their criminal conduct. Von Hirsch explains that “desert model” theory with its emphasis on proportionality emerged as the dominant sentencing philosophy in the United States and Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, soon after the sentencing reform of the late 1970s, the criminal justice system went back to rehabilitation policies in the form of problem courts, restorative justice gained in popularity and conservative “get tough” crime policies to create a widening gap between sentencing theory and practice. This prompted Tonry’s questioning the “desert model’s” future and its ability to provide a principled sentencing philosophy for the new sentencing practices. In providing an overview of the book, Von Hirsch emphasizes that none of the theorists who responded to Tonry’s call suggest that the retribution based “desert model” of sentencing be replaced by a sentencing model that does not consider retribution.</p>
<p>Some of the scholars answered Tonry’s challenge to devise a principled sentencing theory to guide current sentencing practices. In “Responsibility, Restoration, and Retribution,” R. A. Duff explains how his “communicative” theory of punishment can maintain a connection with retribution and the desert model’s proportionality requirement and still be used as a sentencing philosophy to guide current rehabilitative, restorative, and “get tough” policies. As Michael M. O’ Hear, in his essay “Drug Courts as Communicative Punishment” explains, Duff’s theory is adaptable to numerous types of punishments because its focus is on how punishment is communicated to the offender while using retributive and proportionality principals. Another attempt to theoretically inform current sentencing practices is written by Richard S. Frase in his essay “Can Above-desert Penalties Be Justified by Competing Deontological Theories.” In that essay, Frase conceives a Rawlsian approach to criminal punishment which develops proportionality arguments by comparing the rights of the offender in society with the rights of the crime victim. Jan W. De Keijser’s presents the Dutch dual model of sentencing in his essay, “Never Mind the Pain, It’s a Measure! Justifying Measures as Part of the Dutch Bifurcated System of Sanctions.” Both Tonry and Von Hirsch discuss the suitability of this model for the United States, which includes sentencing based on classic notions of desert as well as sentencing that considers the protection of society. Another theorist, Douglas Husak, discusses the compatibility of retributivist philosophy with restorative justice in “Retributivism, Proportionality, and the Challenge of the Drug Court Movement.”</p>
<p>In all, enough sentencing theorists answered Tonry’s call to present an optimistic future for the desert model and its ability to inform current sentencing practices. The book is worth reading because it takes the reader from conceptualizing criminal sentencing in terms of overly simplistic notions of traditional retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation to the more sophisticated theoretical precepts of the contemporary “desert model.”</p>
