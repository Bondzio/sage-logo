<abstract>
<p>Factors such as the standards-based education movement, mandated participation in statewide testing, and inclusion have forced an increased focus on improving outcomes for students with disabilities. There are many determinants of postschool success for students with disabilities; however, teachers primarily have control over only one, teaching practices and programs. As a result, it is important that teachers choose and implement practices that have proven successful for secondary students with disabilities. This article guides teachers through the process of navigating the evidence-based practice maze to identify evidence-based practices and programs for secondary students with disabilities. Particularly, it addresses the need to (a) follow a research-based framework (i.e., Kohler’s Taxonomy), (b) use practices with the best available research evidence to support effectiveness, and (c) use data-based decision making to guide use of evidence-based practices.</p>

<p>Over the years, the field of education has endured many changes. In recent years, one change that has impacted elementary, middle, and secondary instructional practices across the country is the federally mandated requirement that teachers use evidence-based practices and curricula to teach students with disabilities as well as their typical peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212454004">Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act [IDEIA], 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212454004">No Child Left Behind [NCLB], 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212454004">U.S. Department of Education [USDOE], 2010</xref>). The evidence-based education movement is founded on the assumption that the implementation of evidence-based practices by teachers will improve educational outcomes for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212454004">Detrich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212454004">The Wing Institute, 2012</xref>). Whereas these federal mandates have implications for the field of education as a whole, there are specific implications for teachers of students with disabilities and improving in-school and postschool outcomes for these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454004">Cook, Tankersley, &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Special education researchers are beginning to consider the concept of evidence-based special education as the guiding principle that teachers should follow in delivering instruction to students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454004">Cook &amp; Cook, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454004">Cook, Tankersley, Cook, &amp; Landrum, 2008</xref>). The tools for providing evidence-based special education can be referred to as evidence-based practices (EBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454004">Detrich, Spencer, &amp; Slocum, 2009</xref>). The field of special education has identified the importance of bridging the research-to-practice gap to facilitate implementation of EBPs by teachers of students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook, Shepherd, Cook, &amp; Cook, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454004">Kretlow &amp; Blatz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454004">Smith, Richards-Tutor, &amp; Cook, 2010</xref>). However, whereas teachers should use evidence-based special education as the guiding principle and evidence-based practices to guide instruction, teachers have reported that they do not necessarily use EBPs when teaching students because navigating the evidence-based practice maze remains difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454004">Burns &amp; Ysseldyke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212454004">Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Secondary transition, one area of special education, is an important player in this process because it is imperative that high school teachers implement evidence-based secondary transition programs and practices to help ensure students with disabilities have positive postschool success. Recently, researchers have identified numerous secondary EBPs that have been proven successful for secondary students with disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454004">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Although these practices exist, there are still not enough EBPs to fill an entire transition program for students with disabilities, and unfortunately, teachers do not necessarily have the tools to choose and implement practices that have been proven successful for these students. Two challenges secondary teachers face in choosing practices are time and research knowledge to determine what constitutes an evidence-based or research-based practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454004">Kretlow &amp; Blatz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212454004">Mustian, Mazzotti, &amp; Test, 2011</xref>). Additionally, implementing these practices with fidelity (i.e., accurately adhering to instructional procedures) is a necessary component in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212454004">Kretlow &amp; Blatz, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Meet Mr. Gomez</title>
<p><italic>Mr. Gomez is a secondary special education teacher. He currently teaches youth with learning disabilities and emotional behavioral disorders in an inclusive setting and provides individual supports in a resource room. Each year, Mr. Gomez is challenged with providing his students quality instruction to assist them in obtaining the skills necessary to attain their postschool goals. In addition to ensuring his students are learning skills necessary to reach their postschool goals, he is required by district administration to use EBPs in his classroom. We will use Mr. Gomez and one of his students, Emmett, to illustrate how to navigate the EBP maze</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451212454004">Note 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1053451212454004">
<title>Navigating the Evidence-Based Practice Maze</title>
<p>Evidence-based special education is a decision-making process informed by four sources of information: (a) a framework related to the guiding principle (i.e., evidence-based special education), (b) the best available research evidence, (c) professional judgment, and (d) student needs and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454004">Cook &amp; Cook, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454004">Detrich et al., 2009</xref>). To navigate the evidence-based practice maze, teachers must consider four sources when making instructional decisions.</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212454004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A framework developed from research-based principles that informs practice and provides a systematic basis for professional judgment is less susceptible to bias. Research-based principles have an empirical base that encourages sound reasoning and problem solving. In secondary transition, one research-based framework used is the <italic>Taxonomy for Transition Programming</italic> (The Taxonomy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454004">Kohler, 1996</xref>). The Taxonomy is made up of five components, including (a) student-focused planning, (b) student development, (c) family involvement, (d) program structure, and (d) interagency collaboration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Best available research evidence is a necessary source of information in the decision-making process. This is where EBPs fail because they are derived from empirical research (i.e., group true experimental, group quasi-experimental, single subject; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2012</xref>, for description of research designs).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Professional judgment is next in the process and includes the practitioner’s history of educational experiences. Although this is important and valuable, one’s experiences and beliefs are susceptible to bias.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teachers must consider student needs and values. As teachers adapt, select, and/or develop individualized interventions, student needs and values should be a primary consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454004">Detrich et al., 2009</xref>). Teachers should consider where the student is presently, where the student is going, and how they are going to get the student there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212454004">Mazzotti et al., 2009</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section3-1053451212454004">
<title>Mr. Gomez and Emmett</title>
<p><italic>Mr. Gomez’s student, Emmett, is a 16-year-old with a learning disability in reading and written expression. His reading and writing performance requires accommodations for testing and participating in the general curriculum, including extended time, read-aloud, and computer software resources to support listening comprehension and writing. One of Emmett’s postschool goals is this: After high school, Emmett will work part-time in the computer lab at the college he attends. As Mr. Gomez plans instruction for Emmett, he uses Kohler’s Taxonomy for Transition Planning as the framework to guide his instructional decision making and considers Emmett’s interests and needs. Mr. Gomez knows instruction provided to Emmett must assist him in obtaining postschool employment. Mr. Gomez considers all skills necessary for Emmett to obtain employment (e.g., job searches, completing an application, networking, socials skills).</italic></p>
<p>The next step in the decision-making process is to use a practice that has the best available evidence to support its effectiveness. Although EBPs are the gold standard, not all instructional practices have enough research to establish them as an EBP. EBPs provide teachers with strategies that are supported by research to teach students specific skills. They can be used to support individualized education program (IEP) goals and objectives, as well as support skill development. Determining which EBP to use is the piece of the decision-making process that is missing for many secondary transition teachers. It requires educators to navigate through a maze of unfamiliar terminology and a variety of web resources. To navigate through the EBP maze to find practices that are based on the best available research, teachers must be familiar with (a) the terms used to describe EBP, (b) the procedures used to identify EBPs, and (c) trustworthy sources of EBPs (i.e., web resources).</p>
<p>First, a problem often faced is the overabundance of terms used to refer to EBPs (e.g., evidence-based, scientifically supported, empirically validated). Using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212454004">Figure 1</xref>, by combining a word from Column A with a word from Columns B and C, the reader can derive any number of terms that have been used synonymously with the term evidence-based practices. As a result, it is important for teachers to be aware that terms used to describe EBPs are not consistent across the field. No assumptions can be made from the term or label alone. Teachers must attend to the procedures used to determine if a practice is “evidence-based” to determine if what is being referred to as evidence-based is actually an EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212454004">Detrich et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1053451212454004-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>To help secondary transition professionals understand the definitions of terms, the National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212454004">NSTTAC</xref>) synthesized the literature defining EBPs and developed four broad definitions to assist researchers and practitioners in navigating the EBP maze (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451212454004">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212454004">Innes-Helsel, Hitchcock, Miller, Malinow, &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>; NSTTAC, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212454004">Twyman &amp; Sota, 2008</xref>). These definitions have distinct differences that set them apart from one another. For example, what sets EBPs apart from the rest is the research on a practice has undergone a systematic review process using quality indicators to evaluate the level of evidence for that particular practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454004">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454004">Horner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212454004">Test et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, it is important for teachers to understand these definitions and use them, along with their professional judgment, when making decisions about which EBPs to use. When examining EBPs, teachers need to understand the procedures used to identify EBPs. Specifically, teachers should ask the following questions:</p>
<list id="list2-1053451212454004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Did the practice undergo a systematic review using quality indicators?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the practice based on research that used a rigorous research design?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the practice have a demonstrated record of success for improving student outcomes?</p></list-item></list>
<p>To get answers to these questions, teachers have to determine the process used for identifying the research evidence for a specific practice. For example, if the practice has been identified by a web-based resource, by a vendor, or in a peer-reviewed journal, then it is important to determine if the researchers used quality indicators to ensure the practice was based on research that used rigorous research designs and demonstrated improved outcomes for secondary students with disabilities. When visiting websites or talking with vendors at a state or national conference, teachers need to ask the three questions and request information related to the research base. Additionally, teachers must use professional judgment to determine if a practice (a) will be effective for a particular group of students, (b) relates to the principles of secondary transition as stated in the taxonomy for transition programming, and (c) can be individualized and/or adapted to meet the needs of a particular group of students.</p>
<p>As noted, navigating the EBP maze can be challenging for teachers, and researchers are typically the individuals who are identifying and disseminating EBPs to the field. Whereas it is important for teachers to understand the process in order to navigate the EBP maze, it is also important for teachers to have resources available that can be trusted to provide EBPs based on the three previous questions.</p>

<sec id="section4-1053451212454004">
<title>Web-Based Resources for Promoting Secondary Skill Development</title>
<p>Fortunately, there are numerous web-based resources available to teachers of students with disabilities that provide information on EBPs to help navigate the EBP maze. When investigating web-based resources, there is key information that teachers should look for in order to answer the three questions above. Teachers should look for any research evidence to ensure the practices identified have undergone a rigorous review process. The research evidence may be found under tabs such as <italic>research process, literature review process</italic>, or <italic>scientific review</italic>. The following web-based resources provide reliable resources related to secondary transition EBPs.</p>
<sec id="section5-1053451212454004">
<title>National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center</title>
<p>The primary resource for EBPs in secondary transition is the NSTTAC. The Center was funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs, in 2006 to identify EBPs in secondary transition for students with disabilities. The Center used a rigorous review process, which included examining group experimental and single-subject research studies to identify EBPs in secondary transition. The quality indicators used by NSTTAC were developed based on recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212454004">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212454004">Horner et al. (2005)</xref>. To date, 63 EBPs have been identified that relate to teaching academic skills, self-determination skills, functional life skills, employment skills, community integration skills, and social skills, to name a few. In an effort to bridge the research to practice gap, NSTTAC has developed several products to provide practitioners with tools for implementing EBPs with secondary students with disabilities.</p>
<sec id="section6-1053451212454004">
<title>Practice descriptions</title>
<p>For each EBP, NSTTAC has developed a downloadable practice description that provides information about the EBP, including (a) level of evidence, (b) population for which the practice was effective, (c) setting in which practice was implemented, (d) resources for how to implement the practice, and (e) how the practice relates to Indicator 13, Common Core State Standards, and states’ Career Cluster Initiative. Finally, each practice description includes the references for the research evidence used to establish the EBP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212454004">
<title>Research to practice lesson plan starters</title>
<p>The next resource available from NSTTAC, and one of the most useful resources for practitioners, are the Research to Practice Lesson Plan Starters (RtPLPS). NSTTAC has developed over 70 RtPLPS that practitioners can use to teach specific transition related skills to students. The RtPLPS provide teachers with the basic components of a lesson plan, including lesson objective, setting and materials, content taught, teaching procedure, and evaluation method. Additionally, each RtPLPS includes the reference for the research article the lesson was based on.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451212454004">
<title>Dropout Prevention Center</title>
<p>The National Dropout Prevention Center for Students with Disabilities (NDPC-SD) is a federally funded technical assistance center that provides technical assistance to states related to evidence-based programs and practices for reducing dropout of students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212454004">NDPC-SD, 2012</xref>). NDPC-SC used a systematic review process and synthesized the literature using quality indicators to identify the EBPs related to dropout prevention. The Center offers a variety of information related to dropout prevention, including specific evidence-based programs that schools can implement to help reduce dropout of students with disabilities, for example, <italic>Check and Connect, The Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) Model</italic>, and <italic>The Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program</italic>. The Center also provides teachers with a practice guide related to implementation of cognitive behavioral strategies to help students with disabilities stay in school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451212454004">
<title>National Autism Center</title>
<p>The National Autism Center (NAC) has completed its National Standards Project, which investigated EBPs for students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). NAC used an extensive process for identifying EBPs for students with autism. NAC developed a model, titled the <italic>Strength of Evidence Classification System</italic>, based on guidelines from various sources in health and psychology to identify EBPs for students with autism. NAC used the model to examine group experimental and single-subject research studies to identify EBPs for students with autism. Whereas NAC did not specifically identify practices for secondary students with ASD, several of the EBPs identified included secondary students with ASD. For example, evidence-based antecedent strategies, behavioral packages, modeling, and self-management strategies all included middle and high school students with ASD. In addition to the EBPs identified for students with ASD, NAC has developed an EBP guide for practitioners, which includes a description of each EBP, examples of the practice, and methods for implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212454004">
<title>The National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
<p>Another resource is the National Professional Development Center on ASD. The Center used rigorous criteria to identify EBPs for students with autism. The National Professional Development Center on ASD has developed 37 web-based training modules for teachers who want to implement EBPs for students with ASD. Several of the modules provide information related to secondary students and young adults with ASD, including <italic>Social Supports for Transition-Aged Individuals, Preparing Individuals for Employment, Social Skills Functioning and Programming</italic>, and <italic>Customized Employment</italic>. Of the upcoming modules that will be available, two relate specifically to secondary transition (i.e., <italic>Person-Centered Planning Including PATHS and MAPS, Choice-Making</italic>). The modules include (a) descriptions of strategies related to the specific topics; (b) methods for assessment and evaluation, including social validity; and (c) and ways to facilitate generalization of skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451212454004">
<title>Best Evidence</title>
<p>The Best Evidence Encyclopedia (BEE) is another resource for EBPs in secondary transition. Whereas the BEE focuses on EBPs for all K-12 students, the website includes three areas (i.e., math, reading, school reform) specifically for middle/high school students. The BEE conducted meta-analyses and quantitative syntheses (i.e., comprehensive literature reviews) and used quality indicators to examine group experimental research to identify their EBPs. The BEE does not disaggregate practices based on student characteristics related to disability or no disability; however, the EBPs identified were found effective for a variety of secondary students. The BEE provides a summary of each evidence-based program, information related to the level of evidence (i.e., strong, moderate, limited, insufficient), and methods for program implementation. Examples of secondary programs include Peer-Assisted Learning Strategies (PALS), computer-assisted instruction, and school development programs. Other resources for teachers related to EBPs include a technical brief titled <italic>Overcoming Obstacles to Adopting and Implementing Evidence-Based Practices</italic>, which provides schools and practitioners with information for using and implementing EBPs at the district and school level. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212454004">Table 1</xref> for links to the web-based resources described.</p>

<title>Mr. Gomez and Web-Based Resources</title>
<p><italic>Mr. Gomez spent time investigating the various web-based resources available to identify a practice that would support Emmett’s skill development and prepare him for postschool employment. In doing so, he came across the NSTTAC website. Mr. Gomez found the answers to his three questions under the evidence-based practice tab (subtab: literature review process), which described the process NSTTAC used to identify the EBPs listed on the website. He confirmed the practices listed had undergone a systematic review process, were based on rigorous research designs, and had demonstrated a record of success. He scrolled through the practices and identified several that would be useful in teaching Emmett the skills necessary to reach his postschool employment goals (e.g., mnemonics, self-management, constant time delay). The first skill Mr. Gomez chose to teach Emmett was to complete a job application. He reviewed the practice description to determine procedures for teaching the skill and how the practice had been implemented. Then, he downloaded the lesson plan found in the NSTTAC lesson plan library for using mnemonics to teach completing a job application. Mr. Gomez was now ready to implement the practice with Emmett in the classroom.</italic></p>

<title>Evidence-Based Special Education and Data-Based Decision Making</title>
<p>The final step in navigating the EBP maze is to ensure teachers are using data-based decision making to guide their use of EBPs. Data-based decision making involves the systematic collection and analysis of a variety of data to guide instructional decisions geared to improving the success of students and schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212454004">Marsh, Pane, &amp; Hamilton, 2006</xref>). Using data to make informed decisions about instructional methods and curricula is becoming common. Data-based decision making is at the heart of evidence-based special education. The impact of implementing EBPs depends on the effectiveness of the specific interventions. To determine effectiveness of the intervention, teachers typically collect some type of data (e.g., curriculum-based measure, task analysis, frequency count of behavior). Although these data are extremely important in determining the success of the intervention, what is often overlooked is the behavior of the teacher; that is, is the teacher implementing the practice as prescribed (i.e., with fidelity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454004">Cook et al., 2012</xref>)? Success of an intervention is attributed not only to students’ response to the intervention but also the fidelity in which the intervention was implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454004">Detrich, 2011</xref>). It is imperative teachers implement EBPs with fidelity and track their actions. Student data, along with information regarding the fidelity of instruction, can assist teachers in determining if an intervention needs to be continued, modified, or changed. If a teacher knows the adequacy with which procedures were followed and instruction was provided, they can make decisions regarding next steps. If implementation of a practice was not adequate, a teacher should focus efforts on improving implementation of the practice. If the implementation of the practice was adequate, a teacher should focus efforts on changing or modifying the intervention to ensure student success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212454004">Detrich, 2011</xref>). When considering changing or modifying an intervention, teachers should stay away from an “eclectic” approach, where a variety of interventions are used. Instead, teachers should consider changing only one variable at a time to determine which piece of the intervention needs change or modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212454004">Kutash, Duchnowski, &amp; Lynn, 2009</xref>). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1053451212454004">Figure 3</xref> for a matrix for making data-based decisions.</p>

<title>Mr. Gomez and Data-Based Decision Making</title>
<p><italic>Mr. Gomez implemented the strategy as prescribed in the lesson plan found in the NSTTAC lesson plan library. As described in the evaluation section of the lesson plan, he collected data daily on student performance using a task analysis of steps to complete a job application. He also tracked his performance using a fidelity checklist that outlined the steps of the teaching procedures. This accurate and consistent data collection allowed Mr. Gomez to determine when Emmett mastered the skill of completing a job application.</italic></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Whereas many resources are readily available to teachers of secondary students with disabilities, not all are EBPs. Therefore, it is important teachers use trusted resources when choosing EBPs. First, this article has provided specific information related to navigating the EBP maze for teachers of secondary students with disabilities. When determining which resources to use, teachers should remember to ask the three questions mentioned previously:</p>
<list id="list3-1053451212454004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Did the practice undergo a systematic review using quality indicators?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the practice based on research that used rigorous research designs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the practice have a demonstrated record of success for improving student outcomes?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Next, the resources described in this article provide secondary teachers with access to EBPs proven effective for secondary students with disabilities. Teachers are encouraged to keep the three questions in mind but also remember that professional judgment and students’ needs and values play a key role in this process.</p>
<p>Finally, teachers must acknowledge that evidence-based special education is a decision-making process that involves a framework developed from research-based principles (i.e., Kohler’s Taxonomy for Transition Programming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212454004">Kohler, 1996</xref>), the best available research evidence, professional judgment, and students’ needs and values. With this in mind, data-based decision making should be used to determine if a selected EBP is effective for specific students. In addition to collecting student data, teachers should ensure EBPs are being implemented with fidelity by tracking their actions. This will allow teachers to make the final decisions regarding continued use of, or modifying or changing, an EBP.</p>
