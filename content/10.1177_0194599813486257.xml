<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx initially treated with either radiation or chemoradiation, who underwent salvage laryngectomy at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 1997 to 2011, were identified. The cohort was divided into an early-stage group and an advanced-stage group based on initial tumor staging. Survival outcome was evaluated separately in each group against tumor staging, methods of treatment, and nodal status. Secondary endpoints of speech and swallowing were also evaluated.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599813486257">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 100 patients were identified, with 72 patients in the early-stage group and 28 patients in the advanced-stage group. The overall postsalvage locoregional control rate was 70%, and the 5-year disease-specific survival was 70% and 55.2% in the early and advanced group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .39). The 5-year disease-specific survival was not significant in either group when compared with recurrent staging, initial treatment, salvage treatment, or nodal disease (<italic>P</italic> = ns). Using voice prostheses, good to excellent speech function was achieved postoperatively in most patients.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Tumor staging, methods of initial and salvage treatment, and nodal disease were not significant predictors of survival. Both salvage partial and total laryngectomy were effective methods in the treatment of recurrent laryngeal cancer in carefully selected patients.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the American Cancer Society, 12,720 cases of laryngeal cancer were expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813486257">1</xref></sup> Currently, radiotherapy (RT) and surgery remain as the standard single-modality treatment options for early-stage laryngeal cancer. On the other hand, total laryngectomy (TL) was the treatment of choice for advanced laryngeal cancer until 2 landmark studies by the VA Laryngeal Cancer Study Group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813486257">2</xref></sup> in 1991 and the RTOG 91-11 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813486257">3</xref></sup> in 2003 provided evidence for the nonsurgical option in treating advanced-stage laryngeal cancer. These studies revolutionized the management of advanced laryngeal cancer by demonstrating the effectiveness of managing laryngeal carcinoma without the use of transcervical surgery and thus allowing salvage procedures to be reserved for patients with treatment failure. The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of salvage surgery for recurrent laryngeal cancer after initial nonoperative treatment in terms of survival and functional outcome and to identify additional factors that might influence the long-term survival in these patients. The prognostic factors affecting the long-term survival in these patients are not well established. This study represents one of the largest and most comprehensive studies from a single institution on the treatment outcomes of recurrent laryngeal cancer through salvage surgeries.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599813486257" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patient records were collected from a computer database at the Head and Neck Institute of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for the period between 1997 and 2011. Patients with biopsy-proven primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx who underwent either salvage partial laryngectomy (PL) or TL at the Cleveland Clinic, after failing initial treatment with RT or chemoradiation therapy (chemoRT), were identified. Partial laryngectomies included supraglottic, supracricoid, or vertical PL. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: an early- and an advanced-stage group. The early-stage group included patients with initial American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I/II cancer. The advanced-stage group included patients with initial AJCC stage III/IV cancer. Patients with primary cancer of the oropharynx and hypopharynx, such as base-of-tongue and piriform sinus tumors, as well as non–squamous cell cancers of the larynx were excluded. However, patients with primary SCC originating from the larynx extending to these regions were included. Patients who received their initial treatment at an outside hospital were also included.</p>
<p>Information extracted from the database included patient demographics, oncological data, details of treatment, survival, and functional outcome (speech and swallow). Median length of follow-up was determined from the date of initial visit to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and from the date of salvage surgery to the last date of recorded follow-up, and the median follow-up time was determined using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. Median time to recurrence of disease was measured from the time of initial diagnosis to the time of cancer recurrence. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was measured from the date of diagnosis to the last date that the patient was reported alive. The endpoint was death from cancer or suspected death from cancer.</p>
<p>Disease-specific survival was analyzed against the initial and salvage treatment, initial and recurrent staging, neck dissection, and nodal disease status on dissection. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparison of survival was analyzed using the log-rank test. Comparisons of nonsurvival data were analyzed by using the χ<sup>2</sup> test or by Fisher’s exact test (FET) in groups that could be assessed by a 2 × 2 grid. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. This protocol was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 100 patients were identified to have biopsy-proven recurrent SCC of the larynx. Seventy-two patients were identified in the early-stage group and 28 patients in the advanced-stage group. Patient demographics and initial treatment data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813486257"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Oncologic descriptive data, salvage treatment, and functional data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813486257"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813486257"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. Overall, the median age of diagnosis was in the sixth decade, with a male predominance. Between the 2 groups, statistical significance was noted only in terms of primary tumor location (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and initial treatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). At the time of initial diagnosis, most tumors were located in the glottis in the early-stage group (79.2%) and in the supraglottis in the advanced-stage group (53.6%). Most of the patients in the early-stage group received RT alone (91.7%) as their initial treatment, whereas most patients in the advanced-stage group primarily underwent both radiation and chemotherapy (64.3%). In the 2 groups, most of the patients received treatment for their initial cancer at an outside institution (<italic>P</italic> = .12). The median length of follow-up was 63 months in the early-stage group and 69 months in the advanced-stage group (<italic>P</italic> = .66). In patients with early-stage disease (stage I/II) on initial presentation, more than half (51.4%) were diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer at the time of recurrence. Most of the patients in both groups underwent TL (<italic>P</italic> = .082). Salvage PL was performed on 24 patients in the early-stage group and 4 patients in the advanced-stage group. The categorization of PL procedures performed is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813486257"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. In the early-stage group, there was no involvement of the base of tongue, the pre-epiglottic space, or the cricoid cartilage in any of the 12 patients who underwent supracricoid laryngectomy. Only 1 patient had involvement of the arytenoid cartilage. In the 11 patients who had vertical PL, 8 patients had recurrence involving a unilateral vocal cord (TVC) with or without extension to the anterior commissure. The other 3 patients had bilateral anterior TVC involvement. Extensions of the tumor to the false vocal cord, the cricoid, or the involvement of arytenoids were not observed. In the single patient who underwent supraglottic laryngectomy, the recurrence was above the level of TVC. In the advanced-stage group, 2 patients had recurrence limited to the epiglottis, 1 patient in the aryepiglottic fold, and all 3 patients underwent supraglottic PL. The last patient had transglottic tumor and underwent vertical PL because of her refusal for TL.</p>

<p>In the early-stage group at the time of recurrence, there were a total of 54 patients with local recurrence, 18 patients with regional nodal disease, and no patients with distant metastasis. In the advanced-stage group, 20 patients had local recurrence, 7 with regional nodal disease, and only 1 patient with distant metastasis to the lung (χ<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>P</italic> = .27). The postsalvage recurrence rate was 27.7% (20/72) in the early-stage group and 36% (10/28) in the advanced-stage group (FET, <italic>P</italic> = .47). Most of the patients from both groups underwent neck dissection at the time of recurrence (<italic>P</italic> = .38). The necessity of neck dissection was determined after discussion with a multidisciplinary team, and it was based on clinical history, physical examination, and radiologic findings. Because most patients with recurrent disease had exhausted further radiation therapeutic options, neck dissections were often recommended at the time of recurrence because of the risk of occult disease and lack of further treatment options after salvage surgery. In our series, a total of 82 patients underwent neck dissection, 25 patients (30.5%) were found to have positive neck disease, and no significant differences were noted between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .80).</p>
<p>The postoperative length of stay was comparable between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .80). Functional outcome measures were descriptive for speech function after TL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813486257"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>) using voice prosthesis and for swallowing. Good to excellent speech function, as described by a certified speech language pathologist and the treating physician, was achieved in 83.3%, 85.7%, and 75% (χ<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>P</italic> = .73) of the patients who underwent TL using either primary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP), secondary TEP, or electrolarynx, respectively. Overall, the median time to swallowing was 16 days (range, 3-166 days) after surgery. Of the 100 patients, 96% were able to achieve swallow function postoperatively. Only 4 patients required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. Two patients required PEG tube for total nutrition, and 2 patients required PEG tube for partial nutrition with eventual removal of the PEG tube in 1 of the patients. A total of 16 patients (13 after TL and 3 after PL) experienced some degree of dysphagia requiring esophageal dilation.</p>
<p>Subgroup analysis of the 28 patients who underwent salvage PL showed that swallowing function was achieved in all patients postoperatively, except for 2 patients who developed persistent dysphagia not amendable to esophageal dilation. One of the patients had resolution of the dysphagia after undergoing TL, and the other patient became PEG dependent. Functional speech was achieved in 71.4% of the patients in this subgroup. Suboptimal speech was seen in 14.2% of the patients. These patients with impaired vocal quality had a described severe breathy speech. Aphonia was seen in 7.14% of the patients. Functional data were unavailable in 2 patients (7.14%) in this subgroup due to loss of follow-up.</p>
<p>The overall 5-year DSS was 70% in the early-stage group and 55.2% in the advanced-stage group (<italic>P</italic> = .39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The initial treatment was measured against survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The 5-year DSS in patients who underwent chemoRT versus RT alone was 55.6% versus 66% (<italic>P</italic> = .61) in the early-stage group and 51.8% versus 62.2% (<italic>P</italic> = .94) in the advanced-stage group. The impact of salvage treatment on survival was also evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). In the early-stage group, the 5-year DSS of patients who underwent PL and TL were 78.5% and 66.1% (<italic>P</italic> = .27), respectively. In the advanced-stage group, this was 75% versus 51.9% (<italic>P</italic> = .31), respectively. The impact of recurrent staging on survival was also assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). In the early-stage group, patients with recurrent stage I/II disease had a 5-year DSS of 71.7% compared with 67.8% in patients with recurrent stage III/IV disease (<italic>P</italic> = .22). In the advanced-stage group, this was 60% versus 53% (<italic>P</italic> = .45), respectively. Neck dissection was also measured against survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). The 5-year DSS in patients who underwent neck dissection at the time of salvage treatment compared with those who did not have neck dissection was 66.5% versus 92.9% (<italic>P</italic> = .042) in the early-stage group and 53.8% versus 66.7% (<italic>P</italic> = .53) in the advanced-stage group. Lastly, the impact of nodal disease was also compared as a function of survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0194599813486257"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). The 5-year DSS in patients with positive nodal disease on neck dissection compared with those with negative nodal disease was 56.2% versus 74% (<italic>P</italic> = .079) in the early-stage group and 50% versus 58.5% (<italic>P</italic> = .50) in the advanced-stage group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Laryngeal SCC is a highly radiosensitive cancer with locoregional control approaching 73% to 95% in early-stage disease after radiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813486257">4</xref></sup> Recurrent disease, even in the advanced stages, can often be managed by salvage surgical procedures capable of achieving ultimate tumor control in most cases. Since the initial nonoperative treatments are so effective, it is often difficult to obtain a large cohort from a single institution to examine the treatment outcome of patients who failed these initial treatments, and the data in the current literature on this topic almost universally consist of much smaller series that are often less comprehensive. Only 1 similar study by Van Der Putten et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486257">5</xref></sup> had a sizable cohort of 120 patients. However, the authors of this study focused solely on the outcome of salvage TL. To our knowledge, the current study is one of the largest studies in the literature examining the role of both salvage partial and TL in the treatment of recurrent laryngeal cancer from a single institution.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that the overall locoregional control rate after salvage laryngectomy was 70% with an overall 5-year DSS rate of 55% to 70% depending on initial staging, similar to that previously reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813486257">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813486257"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813486257"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813486257">8</xref></sup> However, neither the initial nor the recurrent staging significantly influence the long-term survival rate in the case of treatment failure. Furthermore, the median time to recurrence from initial diagnosis was 11 to 15 months, which emphasizes the importance of frequent follow-up for at least 2 years after the initial treatment with extended long-term follow-up thereafter to allow for early intervention.</p>
<p>Despite the significant difference in the initial treatment in the early- and the advanced-stage groups, we did not find any statistical difference between the initial approaches (RT alone vs chemoRT) in terms of 5-year DSS in either group. Therefore, if treatment failure occurs, initial treatment modalities played little or no role in the long-term prognosis. These findings are in line with previous studies by Weber et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813486257">9</xref></sup> and Young et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813486257">10</xref></sup> However, our study further elaborates on these previous studies by examining patients with both early and advanced disease in a single institution cohort.</p>
<p>When failure occurs, the treatments are often geared toward aggressive resection through salvage TL, since postsalvage recurrence of disease is associated with significantly worse outcome. In our series, the 5-year DSS in patients with postsalvage recurrence compared with those without recurrence is 47.7% versus 80.6% (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) in the early-stage group and 22.2% versus 77% (<italic>P</italic> = .0003) in the advanced-stage group. Despite its effectiveness, TL is associated with significant comorbidities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813486257">11</xref></sup> and therefore PLs are occasionally used in patients who are deemed both medically and anatomically suitable candidates. In our series, aside from a single patient who refused TL and instead elected for PL, all 28 patients who underwent salvage PL had disease amendable to PL without significant procedure-specific contraindications such as arytenoid fixation, interarytenoid invasion, pre-epiglottic disease, or extralaryngeal spread of tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813486257">12</xref></sup> We found that the 5-year DSS was not significantly affected by the type of salvage procedure performed in either group and that the long-term survival outcomes were similar between salvage PL and TL.</p>
<p>Currently, the criteria for neck dissection in the treatment of recurrent laryngeal cancer are not well established. In our series, 82% of patients underwent neck dissection at the time of the recurrence. In the advanced-stage group, the 5-year survival outcome in the 25 patients who underwent neck dissection was similar to the 3 patients without neck dissection. However, this does represent a biased selection in which the patients who had nodal disease present may have fared worse had they not undergone neck dissections, and equivalence cannot be interpreted from this small number of patients. On the contrary, in the early-stage group, the 15 patients without neck dissection had a better survival than the 57 patients with neck dissection (<italic>P</italic> = .042). However, the group without neck dissection consisted of only a small portion of the overall series (21% of the early-stage group). They were highly selected patients whose treatment was discussed in multidisciplinary fashion after review of physical examination findings and radiologic imaging. In our series, it is a concern that a high rate of occult nodal disease was found in 30.5% of patients on neck dissection, and this may argue for stronger consideration for neck dissection in all patients undergoing salvage surgery.</p>
<p>Most patients achieved functional swallowing postoperatively, and only 4% of patients required PEG tube placement for partial or total nutrition. In the 28 patients who underwent salvage PL, functional speech was achieved in most of the patients (71.4%). In the 82 patients who underwent TL, 3 options (electrolarynx, primary TEP, and secondary TEP) were available to allow for functional speech. All 3 options were successful in restoring speech function after TL without significant statistical differences noted. However, our study was limited by the lack of objective assessment of speech function postoperatively. In a study of this nature in which the cohort spans the course of more than a decade, it is almost impossible to find a consistent objective method in reporting speech function. Because of the lack of standardized reporting methods on speech, most of the current literature uses descriptive methods to report speech function after laryngectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813486257">13</xref></sup> Despite the lack of objective assessment, the subjective evaluation of a patient’s speech still offers important insights into the different options for restoring speech after salvage laryngectomy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Initial and recurrent staging, types of initial or salvage treatment, neck dissection, and nodal disease at the time of recurrence were not factors affecting the long-term survival in patients with recurrent laryngeal cancer. Both PL and TL are effective salvage procedures in patients with recurrent laryngeal cancer. However, PL should be considered in only a highly selected group of patients without advanced locoregional disease. Because of the high rate of nodal disease found on neck dissection at the time of recurrence and lack of further therapeutic options, neck dissections should be strongly considered when treating patients with recurrent disease.</p>
