<abstract>
<p>Scholars like Alison Kadlec, Melvin Rogers and R.W. Hildreth have recently confronted the claim that Dewey’s pragmatism lacks resources to approach issues of power, but they have not given a unified account of what theoretical framework Dewey’s pragmatism provides to grapple with such issues and to articulate standards for social criticism. In this article, I explore one such framework: Dewey’s outline of a social philosophy developed in his <italic>Lectures in China</italic>. Here, Dewey derives immanent standards for social criticism through sociological and historical perspectives. Such standards are articulated in terms of social relationships of mutuality and recognition in and between groups; on such standards, social institutions and practices are to be criticized in so far as they embody relationships of domination disabling individual development and social and political participation. Dewey’s critical project extends to cultural sources of normative authority, and I further explore his social philosophy in terms of an ‘immanent cultural criticism’.</p>

<p>Scholars and theorists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011432373">1</xref>
</sup> have recently corrected interpretations of pragmatism given by representatives of early Critical Theory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368431011432373">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, against the claim that pragmatist social science would make no value judgements but rather become a pure instrument for subjective interests and, in effect, affirm the existing social order, they have pointed out that Dewey’s notion of social inquiry not only allows for judgements of value but may, in fact, support and inform social criticism. Yet, in making their case, only a few scholars have confronted the claims elaborated in C. Wright Mills’ <italic>Sociology and Pragmatism</italic> [(1963)1969], and echoed recently in Steven White’s ‘The very Idea of a Critical Social Science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368431011432373">2004</xref>), that pragmatism is uninterested in, and lacks resources to approach, issues of power, structurally embedded power in particular.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368431011432373">3</xref>
</sup> In response to these claims, Alison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011432373">Kadlec (2007</xref>), Melvin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368431011432373">Rogers (2009</xref>) and R.W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011432373">Hildreth (2009</xref>) have shown that Dewey, on several occasions, in fact, addresses such issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1368431011432373">4</xref>
</sup> However, basing their arguments on a wide range of Dewey’s works, they give no unified account as to what theoretical framework Dewey provides for addressing such issues and for establishing normative standards for social criticism. In particular, neither of them considers Dewey’s lectures on social philosophy as providing such a framework.</p>
<p>In the only book length account on the systematic and historical relationships between pragmatism and critical theory, Kadlec points out that Dewey’s ‘antifoundationalism’ involves a rejection of the idea of transcendent and absolute standards, as well as the idea of a philosophers elite having privileged access through reason to “the highest and ultimate reality” separated from “the realm of everyday experience” (2007: 41). Addressing epistemological, as well as normative issues raised by this rejection, Dewey makes it imperative to cultivate “critical reflection in the complex medium of lived experience” (2007: 13). The mention of ‘the medium of lived experience’, when construed as “intrinsically social and communicative” (2007: 19), suggests that social criticism would apply standards with some immanent social origin. In fact, early in her book Kadlec makes clear that, in Dewey’s pragmatism, standards for criticism are to be taken as a set of values or moral commitments to democracy and must, as such, be articulated as immanent standards and as “not justifiable in any realm outside of the ‘experiential continuum’ in which they are pursued” (2007: 13). Distinguishing Dewey’s approach from a Habermasian reconstruction of immanent standards of rationality in communicative action (2007: 19–25), and in line with Rogers’ and Hildreth’s interpretations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368431011432373">5</xref>
</sup> Kadlec explicates the content of the moral commitments to democracy in terms of what Dewey designates by ‘growth’. On Kadlec’s reading, ‘growth’ articulates the normative end of expanding “the capacity for critical inquiry” (2007: 46) in, and through, developing individual potentialities and capacities in so far as ‘growth’ is simultaneously “the goal and the process, the critical standard and the product of social intelligence” (2007: 46).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1368431011432373">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, from what philosophical or theoretical perspective does Dewey derive, and apply, immanent standards for social criticism? By drawing on Dewey’s <italic>Reconstruction in Philosophy</italic> (1920) and particularly <italic>Democracy and Education</italic> (1916), Kadlec spells out what she calls Dewey’s “philosophy of ‘the social’” (2007: 81) and qualifies the use of the latter term broadly as “the name Dewey gives to the world produced in and by communication and conjoint activity” or “the world we inhabit when we ‘grow’ properly, … [and which] is the breeding ground … for all our habits, institutions, beliefs, relations and aspirations” (2007: 74). However, Kadlec thus fails to consider how the issue of deriving immanent standards is, in fact, treated more systematically in those of Dewey’s works that have the term ‘social philosophy’ in the title, or that use the term with a systematic intent. In fact, in his ‘Syllabus: the Study of Institutions and morals’ [<italic>Middle Works</italic> (MW)15: 230–72]. Dewey emphasizes that, to derive immanent standards for assessing social phenomena, social philosophy needs an empirical basis: “[a]n immanent standard is relative to [social] phenomena, but at the same time it is experimental and hence is checked up by social processes similar to those which suggest it” (MW15: 235). As he makes clear here (MW15: 235–6), but argues more extensively in his <italic>Lectures in China</italic>
<italic>, 1919–1920</italic> (LC), social philosophy gains empirical support, not only by appealing to the lived experience of some agents but through integrating perspectives and resources from the <italic>social sciences</italic> to the extent that “[t]he relationship between the social sciences and social philosophy is … one of interpenetration” (LC: 59).</p>
<p>Dewey’s lectures on social philosophy in LC suggest several ways in which resources from the social sciences may be employed to derive immanent standards for social criticism. In fact, consistent with Kadlec’s general contention that Dewey’s “philosophy of the social” is concerned with social conditions for <italic>growth</italic>, Dewey, in LC, considers conditions for the development of individual capacities that enable social and political participation. Such conditions are specified in terms of <italic>social relationships</italic> <italic>in and between groups</italic>, and <italic>embodied in social practices and institutions</italic>. A conception of immanent standards thus arises with a certain degree of sociological specificity: positive conditions for individual development are analyzed in terms of relationships that contribute “to free intercourse, to unhampered exchange of ideas, to mutual respect and friendship and love” (LC: 90). Negatively, practices and institutions are to be criticized to the extent that they embody relationships of <italic>domination</italic> disabling individual development and social and political participation. In fact, Dewey’s social philosophy confronts the issue of domination and power on a broad scale: in line with Rogers’ interpretation of Dewey’s ethical and political writings, it is concerned with ways in which political power is exercised arbitrarily in modern democracies (2009: 213–24); but it also, and consistent with Hildreth’s interpretation (2009: 791–4), shows sensitivity to how power relations are embedded in customs in the civil and private sphere. Dewey seeks, in LC, to establish an ideal typical conception of domination meant to capture “any system of relationship which effectively places one person in subjugation to another – children subjects to their parents, wives to their husbands, subjects to their rulers, laborers to their employers” (LC: 92). As Hildreth has pointed out on the basis of other textual sources (2009: 793), there are parallels between Dewey’s approach to power and Steven Lukes’s ‘third dimension of power’;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1368431011432373">7</xref>
</sup> in LC, Dewey aims to capture the more inconspicuous aspects of power that shape agents’ attitudes and views of themselves: he thus accounts for “servility, ignorance … and obsequiousness” in terms of “a system which forces men into subservience’ (LC: 96) and he particularly mentions the ways in which most Western women until recent times have accepted their inferiority ‘as an established fact” (LC: 77).</p>
<p>What has passed unnoticed in the scholarly literature is that, in LC, Dewey betrays his Hegelian legacy by deriving immanent standards <italic>historically</italic>:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1368431011432373">8</xref>
</sup> Dewey considers how relations of recognition have emerged in Western societies through conflicts and struggles between groups, and through the development of social movements and their struggles for the demands of subordinated groups, such as women and workers (LC: 64–81). By its historical focus on recognition struggles, Dewey’s study anticipates Axel Honneth’s interpretation of social movements (1994), although, as we shall see, it does not square easily with the distinctions of Honneth’s theoretical framework. Nevertheless, in line with several theoretical contributions of the Frankfurt school, Dewey, in LC, extends his social criticism to the <italic>cultural</italic> sources of normative authority or “the authority of tradition” (LC: 167); below, I consider James Good’s recent proposal of qualifying Dewey’s mature philosophy in terms of a Hegel-inspired “immanent cultural criticism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011432373">2006</xref>: 245). Further, the very context in which the lectures in LC are given invites reflection on hermeneutical conditions for articulating immanent standards: talking to Chinese reform leaders in 1919–20, Dewey is forced to compare and reflexively confront Western and Chinese political and moral values. Hence, the very <italic>intercultural encounter</italic> provides both an enabling condition and a testing ground for the articulation of immanent standards.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows: I first consider Dewey’s historical account of how relations of recognition develop; then, I will look into his sociologically informed criticism of relationships of domination embedded in social practices and institutions; finally, I explore how Dewey’s social philosophy may be qualified in terms of ‘an immanent cultural criticism’. I conclude by considering practical and educational measures for applying his social philosophy.</p>

<title>Reconstructing an immanent standard for social criticism historically: recognition</title>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011432373">Hildreth (2009</xref>) has found exegetical reasons to confront C. Wright Mill’s claims in <italic>Sociology and Pragmatism</italic> that Dewey’s notion of social inquiry sidesteps conflicts between groups in society and that it rather assumes a homogenous society without deep structural divisions or deep seated conflicts about values, it is in LC that Dewey develops an outline of a social theory that most effectively answers to Mill’s charges. Here, Dewey outlines a theory of how social conflicts are rooted in relations of domination between groups in society, and how conflicts have unfolded historically through the development of modern social movements. He also suggests how such a theoretical outlook may motivate social inquiry and provide an immanent standard for social criticism. Let us first consider his account of the origin of social conflicts.</p>
<p>As “a society is made up of a multiplicity of groups each of which is constituted on the basis of at least one interest held in common by its members” (LC: 65), Dewey thinks that social conflict is to be accounted for in terms of conflict between groups. Further, as history shows how the suppression of groups has eventually contributed to disorder and conflict, the origin of social conflict may be accounted for in terms of a certain <italic>pattern of</italic> <italic>suppression and legitimisation of group interests</italic>, such as can be seen in European history by The Roman Catholic Church’s institutionally embedded control over “the family, the arts, education … even over the state” (LC: 67). Generally,<disp-quote>
<p>[w]hen one group achieves a position of recognized privilege and power, when it becomes the dominant group in a society, its members tend to define all those interests that do not pertain to their group as the interest of individuals, and their own as the interest of society (LC: 73).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This sets the stage for a brief historical study of social conflicts unfolding through the development of social movements. Using the women’s right movement and the labour movement as paradigmatic cases, Dewey boldly claims that “every major reform movement in the world has gone through three phases” (LC: 76), and he exploits the Hegelian language of recognition to account for the social and historical processes involved in the women’s rights movement’s and the labour movement’s struggles for reform.</p>
<p>Briefly, Dewey’s first phase is marked by absence of manifest conflict; yet, even if “the subordinate group may, on the surface, appear complaisant and acquiescent” (LC: 66), such absence is caused by the dominant group’s successful legitimisation of its suppression of other groups’ interests (LC: 76–7). The sway of custom conditions how such relation of domination is perceived on both sides: hence, “[s]ince women always had been subservient to men, they tended to accept the inferiority of women as an established fact” or “as a fact of nature” (LC: 77). In the second phase, the conflict between dominant and suppressed group becomes manifest (LC: 77): moral demands raised by representatives of the latter are not recognized as legitimate, but are generally rejected and attributed only to “individual persons” (LC: 73), and the demands are countered by demands of preserving “the social order” (LC: 78) however, the dominant group is increasingly seen not to represent the general interests of society. Finally, in the third phase, the manifest conflict is resolved through the public recognition of “the social validity of the demand” of the subordinate group, and institutional reform follows (LC: 78).</p>
<p>Dewey’s three-phase developmental pattern carries a Hegelian stamp in that social conflict is seen to arise, become manifest and finally resolved in terms of ‘a struggle for recognition’. Despite the fact that Dewey uses the term ‘interest’ to define social conflict, the language of recognition establishes a Hegelian alternative to two available conceptualizations of conflict in terms of ‘interest’. On the basis of a social-psychological perspective Dewey, on the one hand, rejects a Hobbesian conceptualization of the origin of conflict in terms of individual interest and mutual “mistrust” between individuals (LC: 137); on the other, he resists a Marxian categorization by which interest is determined solely socio-economically: interest as <italic>class</italic>-interest. As for the latter, although Dewey’s definition of conflict in terms of legitimisation of a dominant group’s interest would allow for a categorization of conflict in terms of class opposition, he does not conceive of group interest as being determined by socio-economic structure alone. Moreover, with regard to the first phase above, Dewey does not account for group dominance merely in terms of economic or political power but in terms of <italic>asymmetric recognition</italic>. Using pre-modern, as well as early modern, examples, Dewey maintains that, up until early modernity, “the ecclesiastical establishment” identified its interests with the interests of society, and “[t]he interests of the Church were publicly recognized; those represented by its slowly emerging competitors did not yet enjoy such public recognition, and hence were largely regarded as being individual rather than social in nature” (LC: 73–4). As for the second phase, exemplified by the rise the labour movement and that of the women’s rights movement, Dewey surely sees such social phenomena as conditioned by the vast technological and economical changes taking place in the 18th and early 19th century, i.e. “[t]he industrial revolution” (LC: 77). However, the development and the action motivational potential of such movements are seen to be caused by a shared sense of moral wrong. Thus, the very “organization of labor unions” is a reaction to “the worst of the inequalities and injustices engendered by free enterprise” (LC: 105). As for the women’s rights movement, “[m]ore and more women became aware of, and resentful of, the injustice of their being deprived of the right to vote and hold office, and so to participate directly in the improvement of society through political channels” (LC: 77). Such a sense of moral wrong motivates a struggle for public recognition of demands for rights. By assuming <italic>recognition</italic> as the measure in virtue of which rights are achieved and institutionalized, Dewey’s account thus connects to the tradition from Fichte and Hegel.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1368431011432373">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Dewey’s approach anticipates Honneth’s revival of Hegel in <italic>Kampf um Anerkennung</italic> (1994); on the face of it, his suggestion that his account may provide “a framework within which leaders of reform movements may adopt an attitude of inquiry” and through which they can “thoughtfully diagnose the ills and deficiencies of their society” (LC: 80) may even recall Honneth’s notion of ‘social pathologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368431011432373">2007a</xref>: 3–48). Yet, Dewey’s account is not wholly consistent with Honneth’s typological distinctions between forms of recognition. Taken collectively, Dewey’s three phases may be seen to involve the two processes of ‘materialization and ‘generalization’ taken by Honneth’s to lie within the developmental potential of <italic>legal recognition</italic>, i.e. the process toward a richer specification or materialization of rights afforded to citizens in a <italic>Rechtstaat</italic>; and the process toward distribution of legal rights to more members of society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1368431011432373">10</xref>
</sup> In Dewey’s third phase (LC: 78–9), however, the ‘struggle for recognition’ takes on traits that rather recall one of Honneth’s other recognition types; social esteem: the achievement of public recognition requires that the leaders of social movements convincingly show that the skills and performances of their reference groups contribute to the welfare of the whole society. This mixture of forms of recognition in the historical process does not, in itself, represent a decisive break with Honneth’s typology as the latter has, Honneth reminds us, a “mere analytical character” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368431011432373">2007b</xref>: 368). Nevertheless, Dewey’s third phase involves public dispute and reason giving, something which Honneth’s notion of recognition-as-esteem hardly seems to require or which would even be inconsistent with his Durkheim- (and Hegel-)inspired understanding of the work sphere as a normative and social sphere where esteem, and hence necessary conditions for self-realization, is given through the social division of labour in society, not inter-subjective speech.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1368431011432373">11</xref>
</sup> Further, Dewey’s emphasis on how the achievement of legal reform is <italic>dependent</italic> on a growing public recognition of a certain group’s contribution to society seems to contradict Honneth’s philosophical-historical assumption that in modern societies legal recognition has become structurally differentiated from social esteem and thus represents a different ‘moral grammar’ of social conflicts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1368431011432373">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This discord between Dewey’s and Honneth’s accounts of Western recognition struggles should give us pause to consider how Dewey’s social philosophy articulates immanent standards of social criticism. While Honneth’s structural differentiation between legal recognition and social esteem aims at an abstract logic of moral development on a societal level, Dewey’s triadic developmental pattern accounts for a historical dynamics reaching its culmination when one distinct segment of society achieves public recognition and institutional reform follows. This dynamics not only concerns ways in which moral experiences of injustice have had a collective action motivational role but how they have become publicly articulated to the effect of resisting and finally breaking existing modes of legitimisation and corresponding forms of social and political domination. Dewey’s developmental pattern thus specifies what he in <italic>The Public and Its Problems</italic> (1927) in more abstract terms conceives of as the process of organising <italic>a public</italic> consisting of individuals or groups suffering large scale consequences of interactions and transactions in society and which, “[t]o form itself, … has to break existing political forms” (LW2: 255). Dewey’s approach thus diverges from Honneth’s strategy of deriving immanent standards for social criticism from social and historical processes. In so far as Dewey’s social philosophy accounts for the outcome of social conflicts in terms of <italic>recognition</italic>, recognition would, in turn, specify social conditions for <italic>self-realization</italic>, to use Honneth’s Aristotelian idiom, or, to use the Deweyan idiom, <italic>growth</italic>, primarily in so far as the latter qualifies a development of capacities to effectively resist modes of social or political domination. This further suggests that an immanent standard arising from Dewey’s historical study could be made further intelligible in terms of <italic>freedom</italic> as <italic>non-domination</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1368431011432373">
<title>Analyzing institutionally embedded modes of domination</title>
<p>Despite the divergences noted above, Dewey’s social philosophy shares a basic assumption with Honneth’s social philosophy. Dewey’s approach would accord with Honneth’s Left Hegelian objective of “re-establish[ing] theoretical access to the social sphere in which an interest in emancipation can be anchored pre-theoretically” (2007a: 66). So far, we have seen that Dewey seeks to establish theoretical access to the social sphere through a sociologically informed consideration of the origin of social conflicts and a historical study of how conflicts have unfolded through the development of social movements. The next move in Dewey’s theoretical exploration is to outline a categorical framework for analyzing social relationships embedded in practices and institutions; it proceeds, however, on the premises already laid down concerning the negative effects of domination on individual and social development.</p>
<p>Dewey develops “categories of human activity” (LC: 85) to be used to establish “criteria for judging” practices and institutions (LC: 82–89). Dewey’s categories suggest an ascending ladder of generality and abstraction in sociological analysis: <italic>habit</italic>, <italic>custom</italic>, <italic>tradition</italic>, <italic>institution</italic> and <italic>associated living</italic>. The way in which the categories are used to inform normative criteria is consistent with the historical approach above in so far as a <italic>habit</italic> or <italic>custom</italic> is to be criticized when “obstructing social growth and development, until it finally occasions social conflict” (LC: 87), while a <italic>social institution</italic> is to be criticized and reformed if it “tends to restrict opportunity for free development, and to inhibit creativity” (LC: 87). Moreover, by means of these categories Dewey is able to specify immanent standards of critique in terms of social relationships embedded in practices and institutions and being either of an intragroup type [i.e. parent-child, teacher-pupil (LC: 91, 97)] or of an intergroup type [i.e. employer-employee; government-governed (LC: 93–7)]. Negatively, institutionally embedded relationships are to be criticized in so far as a “pattern of dominance-subservience makes the development of personality extremely difficult” (LC: 92). On the other hand, positive standards are explicated in terms of mutual relationships enabling “free intercourse … unhampered exchange of ideas … mutual respect and friendship and love” (LC: 90).</p>
<p>As for the critical assessment of relationships of domination, what kinds of institutions and practices are considered? Addressing a Chinese audience, Dewey wants empirical focus on pre-modern, as well as modern, institutions. Generalizing over the waste sociological differences between, on the one hand, “the caste systems of ancient Egypt and modern India” and, on the other, “the class systems that have been characteristic of European societies” (LC: 90), he attempts ideal typically to conceive of ‘master-slave’ relationships to capture “any system of relationships which effectively places one person in subjugation to another” (LC: 90). Although such generality can, indeed, be questioned sociologically, it is worth noting how Dewey informs his ideal typical view of domination by reference to modern Western societies in particular. The latter conceptual strategy, however, is prepared in ‘<italic>Democracy and Education</italic>’ (1916) where Dewey focuses on circumstances under which social relationships are being economically instrumentalized. In modern industrial societies, labourers generally have little, or no, voice in determining the ends of their work activities, which, Dewey points out, is caused by a social division of labour such that the intelligence of some men is “devoted to the manipulation of other men for ends that are non-human in so far as they are exclusive” (MW9: 143).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1368431011432373">13</xref>
</sup> In LC, he develops his observations more systematically through his categorizations: <italic>social institutions</italic> generally develop from “delegation of responsibility, division of labor, and the necessity of cooperative endeavour” in a society (LC<italic>:</italic> 85). In Western societies, the institutionalization of the public and civil sphere has reached a point where “[a]ccountability and responsibility have to be centralized”, and hence “power is centralized” (LC: 88), the effect of which, however, tends to be that of “relegating the rest of those involved to the status of automata” and thus “inhibiting free development of individual creative ability” (LC: 88). Such concern for modes of institutionally embedded domination, disabling individual initiative, participation and democratic control, recalls Max Weber’s analysis of bureaucratic organizations and their ambiguous status for modern democracies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1368431011432373">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The categorizations are to be used to inform critical analyses of domination and to motivate social reform. To clarify such normative motivation, it is instructive to follow up the suggestion above and see Dewey’s use of his categories as being conceptually consistent with the neorepublican notion of freedom as <italic>nondomination</italic>, as well as echoing strands of classical republicanism. In accordance with the neorepublican notion, already Dewey’s historical approach shows that institutionally embedded domination does not always involve <italic>actual</italic> interference:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1368431011432373">15</xref>
</sup> the asymmetric legal distribution of civil and political rights between men and women up until recent times shows that the asymmetry was tacitly “regarded as a fact of nature” (LC: 77). <italic>Actual</italic> interference in womens’ wishes to participate socially and politically was seldom needed. Further, in the categorical approach, as in the historical approach (LC: 78 –9), an important test case is the legally regulated relationship between capitalist and worker. As for the theoretic defence of the latter, Dewey points out, the notion of “free contract between persons … ignores the fact that the parties to a contract must be of <italic>equal ability</italic>, if the contract is in reality to be an agreement reached willingly and freely” (LC: 112– 13, my emphasis). Hence, given the massive inequality of resources between capitalist and worker “[t]here is not even a pretense of equality of ability in the two parties to such a contract” (LC: 114).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1368431011432373">16</xref>
</sup> Such inequality has serious consequences: it gives the capitalist the legally sanctioned ability not only to control the actual activities of the workers, but the ability to effectively prevent them from exercising and developing their intellectual capacities by excluding them from participation in “matters of policy” (LC: 165). Such domination suggests a dilemma: on the one hand, non-domination is to be secured through civic engagement, rather than through institutional measures initiated by state officials, law makers or other experts; the republican notion of <italic>civic virtue</italic> thus comes into play. Dewey points out that “American workers are now demanding a voice in determination of policy, not only in the particular industries in which they work, but for the economy as a whole” (LC: 95). On the other hand, however, given the power asymmetry at stake, and the fact that “powerful American capitalist … have … often controlled government and exploited its power to their own advantage” (LC: 69), social reform initiated through civic engagement is not enough. Dewey would thus accept what Phillip Pettit calls “<italic>nonarbitrary</italic> interference” or “interference <italic>without domination</italic>”, i.e. “the public official or authority who interferes with people in a way that is forced to track their interests and ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368431011432373">Pettit 1997</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>Dewey specifies two conditions on which such ‘nonarbitrary’ interference would be legitimate; firstly, “the use of force [that] contributes to the public welfare” (LC: 129), such as the law enacted in the USA to “set a maximum of hours per day and per week during which women could be employed” on the consideration that working too long hours is detrimental to their health and would “increase the likelihood of their bearing weakly children” (LC: 115). Secondly, employment of force is legitimate to the degree that such employment “can lead to the maximum development of knowledge and thought” (LC: 129). This consideration, however, links up with the concern for civic engagement above: only to the extent that workers and women are enabled to develop their intellectual capacities such as to effectively demand a voice in the determination of policies are they themselves able to resist domination. In one of the last lectures in LC, Dewey emphasizes the requirement of education for resisting social and political domination. He asks why “a relatively small number of men have control over the behaviour and destinies of the vast majority of the people of the world” (LC: 291), and suggests that “the achievement of freedom” is so hard because most people fail to “to anticipate the consequences of their decision to turn over to a small military clique the management of the affairs of the world” (LC: 290–91). This shows why education is needed, and why, Dewey agrees with Hegel, promotion of education should be among “major governmental enterprises” (LC: 139).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Dewey’s critique of various forms of domination not only links up with the overarching theme of emancipation in Critical Theory; as noted above, his sociological focus on <italic>relationships</italic> embedded in institutions and practices suggest parallels with Honneth’s theory of recognition. As we have seen, Dewey’s historical approach shares Honneth’s interest in the dynamics of misrecognition or disrespect; Dewey’s categorical analysis of an institutionalized “pattern of dominance-subservience” obstructing “the development of personality” but also the “integration of society” (LC: 92) points in the same direction. Still, in shaping and applying his categories at different sociological levels of generality and abstraction, Dewey would not be committed to take ‘domination’ as conceptually or as extensionally equivalent with ‘misrecognition’ or ‘disrespect’. When he says that modern institutions and organisations create attitudes “inhibiting free development of individual creative ability” (LC: 88), this does not so much invite criticism in terms of attitudes and relationships of ‘disrespect’ as criticism of the extent to which the centralization of power in large organizations in developed societies—such as power centralized in “boards of directors and managers in industry” (LC: 88) —effectively undermines conditions for freedom. The latter criticism may be seen as sociologically informed in terms of ‘systemic’ or ‘structural domination’ rather than through adapting Hegel’s notion of recognition, and it seems better served by being normatively explicated in terms of a neorepublican notion of non-domination.</p>
<p>A similar interpretation may be given of Dewey’s most general category, ‘associated living’. In LC, the category is explicated through “the simple fact that every human being lives in – and can live only in – some sort of association with other human beings” (LC: 85). However, if we follow its carrier, we see, firstly, how the category is ontologically generalized or ‘naturalized in <italic>Experience and Nature</italic> (1925) in so far as <italic>human</italic> association is not seen as “different in origin from other modes of interaction” [<italic>Later Works</italic> (LW)1: 138)]; and, secondly, how it is reapplied as a sociological category in <italic>The Public and Its Problems</italic> (1927) to capture new scales of economic- and technology-based activity across national borders. In the latter work, Dewey uses it to conceptualize how such activity in turn affects the power of political institutions at a national level: “The forms of associated action characteristic of the present economic order are so massive and extensive that they determine the most significant constituents of the public and the residence of power. Inevitably they reach out to grasp the agencies of government” (LW2: 302). In fact, by seeing Dewey’s categorization here as grappling with the fact of “scale and complexity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011432373">Bohman 2007a</xref>: 3), James Bohman has recently made it relevant to his own critical project. The latter is also informed by a critical adoption of a neorepublican notion of freedom as non-domination, and Bohman, in particular, accounts for the domination suffered by modern immigrants in terms of “basic structural features of the organization of modern political economy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431011432373">2007b</xref>: 271). By both its sociological and normative objective, Bohman’s analysis would thus be consistent with Dewey’s analysis of domination, even if the latter, and particularly in LC, operates at lower levels of sociological generality and abstraction.</p>

<title>Social criticism as immanent cultural criticism</title>
<p>Even if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011432373">Honneth (1998</xref>) is one of those who have drawn attention to the Hegelian background of Dewey’s social and political thought, he tends to overlook an influential Hegelian notion— namely, <italic>Bildung</italic>. As James Good argues in his recent study (2006), there are, indeed, deep connections between this notion and Dewey’s mature educational and social thought. In LC, a source curiously ignored by Good, the notion of <italic>Bildung</italic> surfaces when Dewey explicitly refers to Hegel’s political philosophy by favouring its “promotion of culture and education” (LC: 139) on part of not only the individual, but her cultural and political community. In fact, Good helpfully suggests how the Hegelian notion may be connected to Dewey’s mature philosophy more generally by qualifying the latter in terms of an “immanent cultural criticism” (2006: 245); in the following, I will explore how this Hegelian qualification may apply to Dewey’s social philosophy in particular.</p>
<p>As Dewey makes clear, the critical function of social philosophy must extend to the cultural sources of normative authority as “[p]eople everywhere are calling into doubt the traditions and beliefs upon which their whole social structure has been built” (LC: 166–7). While he does articulate a response to this situation in terms that might easily invite charges of elitism and naïve optimism on part of social science,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1368431011432373">18</xref>
</sup> Good’s proposal provides an alterative way of articulating such a response. To see how Good’s Hegelian qualification would apply, I will make two considerations, and which, for the sake of simplicity, I dub ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ respectively.</p>
<p>The first consideration concerns a subjective condition for criticizing the normative authority practices and institutions exert over actions and judgements. A subjective condition for criticism can be qualified in terms of Dewey’s “categories of human activity” (LC: 85); the distinction between <italic>custom</italic> and <italic>tradition</italic> suggests a mode of social development involving a rising common recognition of authoritative norms implicit in social practices. Hence, while “[a] custom is a habit which is common to the members of a society”, we have a tradition “[w]hen custom becomes regularized, systematized, and consciously insisted upon” (LC: 85). As, to Dewey, a traditional type of normative authority would consist in some “thought or belief which directs human behaviour” (LC: 167), a <italic>tradition</italic> would, in fact, provide an effective condition for critical appraisal of normative authority by making the very <italic>content</italic> of norms implicit in customs cognitively accessible (qua beliefs) for its members. In so far as members of traditions participate in criticism in virtue of an explicit or articulate consciousness of such implicit norms, criticism may thus be said to proceed on conditions that are ‘immanent’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1368431011432373">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Secondly, criticism of normative authority may also be spelled out more ‘objectively’, or from a third person perspective. The sociologically informed approaches considered above may be extended to trace cultural and historical sources of beliefs legitimizing domination in the eyes of the dominating party and in those of the dominated one. In fact, throughout LC, Dewey provides several examples suggesting how social criticism involves cultural criticism; in each case the strategy of the critic would be to undermine the authority of traditional beliefs by identifying their historical origins and by relating such origins to the present situation and thereby showing their social inadequacy. Firstly, as the struggles to achieve suffrage for women show, such achievement requires contestation and rejection of certain traditional beliefs, i.e. beliefs regarding “the inferiority of women” (LC: 77). While such beliefs reflect social conditions in Western societies before the industrial revolution when “women [did] remain in their homes, doing household tasks, and producing many of the material goods of life such as handicrafts” (LC: 77), they are contradicted by the recent situation where women take on new roles and tasks in civil society. Secondly, Dewey points out how educational institutions and practices are still under the sway of ideas dating back to Aristotle through the dichotomy of ‘liberal’ and ‘mechanical’ education. Historically, such dichotomy has served to legitimize various forms of social hierarchies: in Greek antiquity ‘liberal education’ was quite literally to be “fit for free men”, while education for workers was “mechanical or servile education, or education fit for slaves” (LC: 281). Throughout history, the former kind of education has been for “the rulers…, while the ruled were workers whose labours produced the material goods of life” (LC: 280). Such dichotomy, however, “has been rendered obsolete by the development of science and technology in the past two centuries, and by changing social conditions and modern social movements” (LC: 281). Thirdly, in considering political relationships at an international level, Dewey attacks a particular kind of authority exerted through the diplomatic practice of keeping negotiations secret “rather than laying things out and making them accessible to public examination” (LC: 170). This practice deplorably leaves “the state’s diplomatic policies … under the hand of a few governmental officials” (LC: 161). Yet, long before the internet age and <italic>Wikileaks</italic> Dewey conjectures that “the day of secret diplomacy is passing” as “people are better informed than ever before, and public opinion is becoming more influential” (LC: 162).</p>
<p>While social criticism may thus be seen to involve immanent cultural criticism, the ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ considerations above would anchor critique epistemically in a <italic>first</italic> and a <italic>third</italic> <italic>person</italic> perspective respectively. Nevertheless, Dewey’s cultural criticism suggests a certain prioritization of a <italic>second</italic> <italic>person</italic> perspective. This can be seen most instructively by focusing on the <italic>intercultural</italic> <italic>context</italic> in which the China lectures are delivered: as Dewey addresses and actively engages Chinese intellectuals and reformers over a certain stretch of time (more than two years), the context for the written and retranslated text is basically that of an intercultural dialogue. Although Dewey by his “broad categories of human activities” (LC: 85) does theorize and ‘objectify’ cultural sources of normative authority that (on his theory) would condition the prospects of social and political reform in China, his categories are also formed with a universal intent meant to capture traits of developments in Western societies. Moreover, through applying the categories on the Chinese, as well as other Eastern societies, past and present, he reflexively captures aspects of modern Western societies. In particular, through contrasting comparisons he captures forms of domination typical of Western societies: while many Eastern societies may be said to be “bound by habits and traditions” (LC: 68), members of Western societies are rather seen to be subjected to strong governmental control or “big government” (LC: 68), particularly in times of crisis such as World War I. Further, while the Chinese society may be seen to lack a level of “organization and institutionalization” that would enable prospective planning and efficient administration, we have seen that Dewey emphasizes that Western societies have reached a level of institutionalization and centralization of power such that members of private and public organizations are controlled and the “free development of individual creatively ability” is inhibited (LC: 88).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1368431011432373">20</xref>
</sup> Further, while the modernity of the Occident is generally contrasted to the Orient by the distinction between societies hierarchically structured by <italic>status</italic> and those regulated by <italic>legal</italic> <italic>contracts</italic> (LC: 108), we have seen that Dewey emphasizes how legally valid contracts between capitalists and workers in Western societies are ‘agreed to’ under economic conditions such that “workers sign the contract under the force of circumstances, and not by the exercise of free will” (LC: 114). Focusing more particularly on the American context, he also points out that the moral and cultural emphasis on economic factors in America, “almost automatically accord[ing] [the man who has fortune with] respect and admiration”, is strikingly different from the moral sentiments of the Chinese and may be seen to enable ‘American capitalists’ to ‘exercise disproportionate control on government, even at the national level’ (LC: 69).</p>
<p>Generally, then, Dewey may thus be seen to capture socially and culturally embedded forms of domination <italic>reflexively</italic> through addressing a Chinese audience. However, such intercultural encounter is not only the circumstance of a singular Western academic on an occasional visit: Dewey points out that “[m]odern developments in transportation and communication have brought all regions and all peoples into some degree of contact, and have made it possible for social scientists to survey and record their behavior” (LC: 60). He, in LC, thus suggests that intercultural encounters generally provide contexts in which lay agents, as well as social scientists, may become reflexively aware of cultural sources of authority and domination.</p>

<title>Final remarks: practical application, education and emancipation</title>
<p>Let me end by considering how Dewey’s social philosophy is methodologically linked to an overarching objective shared by Critical Theory: emancipation. Even if Dewey’s envisages that his social philosophy is to provide “a framework within which leaders of reform movements may adopt an attitude of inquiry” and by which the needs of yet dominated groups are to be identified (LC: 80), and even if he insists that social philosophy is “an applied science” (LC: 59), we would need further methodological specifications of how emancipation may be enabled through social inquiry. Taking our first clue from James Bohman, such consideration would specify the transition from the third person perspective of general theory to a second person perspective rooted in the interactions of expert and lay participants, and thus enabling what Bohman calls “ ‘practical verification’ ” (1999: 466). The second person perspective is crucial, however, not only in the justificatory sense but also with regard to developing mutual understanding and appreciation of the relevance of issues and proposals in a ‘context of discovery’. At the end of LC, Dewey affords a further clue. As noted above, in providing a general answer to the question why political domination is so persistent throughout the world, Dewey focuses on conditions for education. This answer, however, is a response not only to a theoretical issue but is practically motivated to make people understand how they may resist domination and develop active citizenship:<disp-quote>
<p>‘How does it happen that a relatively small number of men have control over the behaviour and destinies of the vast majority of the people of the world. It is because the majority have not known how, or have refused, to accept responsibility. The great mass of people have failed to anticipate the consequences of their decisions to turn over to a small military clique the management of the affairs of the world. This is why so many people all over the world are at the beck and call of the few who are in positions of power. It has been this same failure to accept responsibility that has delayed the development of democracy’ (LC: 291).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To develop responsibility, however, one needs knowledge of possible consequences of one’s decisions and actions or, as Dewey specifies in the very last lecture, knowledge that “enables [the individual] to anticipate the consequences of his actions within the framework of his society” (LC: 295). Such knowledge suggests the usefulness of Dewey’s social philosophy in understanding general social conditions for action; in particular how consequences of action are conditioned by power relations in and between groups, and by habits, customs and institutions in which power relations are embedded. However, such understanding only becomes practically effective through a transition from the third person perspective of theory to the first and second person perspective of action and interaction. A final clue to how such transition may be achieved is given where Dewey qualifies democratic group membership by “the art of discussion” (LC: 300):
<disp-quote>
<p>‘[w]hen engaged in a discussion, a person is a leader at the moment he offers a suggestion that contributes to the progress of the discussion, a follower when he accepts appreciatively the contributions of other members of his group. It is in the practice of this art that almost everyone can achieve a sense of real membership and contribute to the solution of the problems of democracy’ (LC: 300–1).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By making the “perfection of the art of discussion” a necessary educational complement to his social philosophy, Dewey suggests one way in which the latter may become an instrument to resist domination. Moreover, as is stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011432373">Kadlec (2007</xref>: 55–86), such practical and educational complementation, rather than Dewey’s theoretical contribution taken alone, is part and parcel of Dewey’s pragmatist social thought. Moreover, while James Bohman is correct in that Dewey’s theoretical contribution needs amendment to adequately capture the “fact of globalisation”, Dewey’s practical specification of democratic membership in terms of a capacity both to ‘lead’ and ‘follow’ through discussion would accord not only with Bohman’s epistemic prioritization of the second person perspective; such practical specification would point to an educational condition for developing the kind of <italic>freedom</italic> that Bohman, by drawing on republican sources, qualifies as “a normative status sufficient for citizens to exercise their creative powers to reshape democracy itself according to the demands of justice” (2007a: 28).</p>

<p>In a formulation that needs some qualification, Dewey calls for “replacing the authority of tradition with the authority of science” (LC: 167), although, he goes on, the authority of ideas and beliefs ”can be shifted only gradually, and by the combined efforts of many people” (LC: 167)—particularly ”leaders of reform movements … in an ongoing process of social reconstruction” (LC: 80). The normative and epistemic basis of such collective effort, ’the authority of science’, is constructed in terms of certain generalized norms of scientific practice that would ideally enable a polity to examine its beliefs and values critically. These norms are such that, firstly, the epistemic authority of any belief should be made dependent on ”its accessibility to public examination” (LC: 169); secondly, authority would be based on ”investigation of fact with a judgement about its value” (LC: 169); and, finally, such authority requires ”the reform and popularisation of education” (LC: 171). The application of such generalized norms would ideally transform cultural traditions into public inquiries.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1368431011432373">
<label>19.</label>
<p>Later, in ‘Context and Thought’ (1931), Dewey similarly elaborates on the distinction between custom and tradition: ”there is no thinking which does not present itself on a background oftradition, tradition, and tradition has an intellectual quality that differentiates it from blind custom. Traditions are ways of interpretation and of observation, of valuation, of everything explicitly thought of” (LW6: 12). In fact, Dewey here advocates immanent criticism of normative authority in arguing that ”attitudes and responses” expressed by influential beliefs and by ”institutions and practices allied to them” constitute ”the immediate primary material of philosophical reflection” such that ”the aim of the latter is to criticize this material, to clarify it, to organize it, to test its internal coherence, and to make explicit its consequences” (LW6: 18).</p>
