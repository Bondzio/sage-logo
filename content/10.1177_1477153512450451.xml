<abstract>
<p>The study investigated whether United Kingdom-based extra-care housing, which provides older people with individual dwellings, communal facilities and care support, complies with current guidance on design for people with visual impairment and satisfies the needs of residents with sight loss. A total of 41 apartments/bungalows in 11 schemes were surveyed and interviews conducted with the occupants. Participants’ comments suggest the current specialist guidance on design for people with sight loss is sound, although there is scope for additional guidance on aspect and daylight, which were highly valued. Little of this specialist guidance is included in mainstream design guidance, which might explain some deficiencies in extra-care housing, including low lounge and bedroom illuminances, few dimmer switches, and limited use of colour to enhance the legibility of spaces.</p>

<body>
<sec id="sec1-1477153512450451"><title>1. Background</title>
<p>One consequence of the United Kingdom’s ageing population is that more people are living for longer with chronic health conditions and physical disabilities, including sight loss. The aged eye is particularly susceptible to conditions such as macular degeneration, cataract and glaucoma. It has been estimated that approximately one in eight people over 75, and one in three people over 90, have a visual impairment sufficiently serious that they should be registered as blind or partially sighted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512450451">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Impaired health and physical disabilities have a number of consequences, including the loss of independence. One solution to the problem of how to enable older people to retain their independence, popular with policymakers in recent years, is the creation of specialist housing designed specifically for the typical needs of older people. In particular, extra-care housing schemes, where each resident has their own apartment or bungalow but also has access to onsite communal facilities such as restaurants and to care if necessary, have received extensive funding. Under the previous government, £227 million was invested in extra-care housing through the Department of Health’s Extra-Care Housing Fund Initiative alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512450451">2</xref></sup> This figure does not include the money invested in extra-care housing through other government agencies such as the Homes and Community Agency, or through local authorities, housing associations and private developers.</p>
<p>Given the prevalence of sight loss amongst older people, we would expect extra-care housing schemes to be well designed for people with sight loss, but currently there is little evidence to show that this is the case. Recent studies of lighting in older people’s housing have mostly focused on general needs housing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512450451">3</xref></sup> and nursing homes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512450451">4</xref></sup> with extra-care housing receiving limited attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477153512450451">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies have also raised questions about the guidance available to designers of extra-care housing schemes. Evans et al. questioned the usefulness of generic recommendations of optimal illuminance levels for people with sight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512450451">6</xref></sup> Goodman and Watson have identified potential conflicts between guidance for people with sight loss and for dementia sufferers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512450451">7</xref></sup> Littlefair has observed that current guidance contains little on daylighting for people with sight loss and has suggested that further research is required in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512450451">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1477153512450451"><title>2. Aims and methodology</title>
<p>This study aimed to investigate whether existing extra-care housing schemes:
<list id="list1-1477153512450451" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>comply with current guidance on design for people with visual impairment and</p></list-item>

</list></p>
<sec id="sec3-1477153512450451"><title>2.1. Scheme survey</title>
<p>To investigate the extent to which extra-care schemes meet current guidance on design for people with sight loss, 41 apartments/bungalows in 11 extra-care schemes were surveyed using an adapted version of the EVOLVE survey tool described below.</p>
<p>Schemes were purposively sampled to ensure a wide variety of building types were included in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512450451">Table 1</xref>). The aim was to recruit 10 schemes and survey four living units in each scheme. A total of 15 housing providers were approached regarding their possible participation in the study, but one declined to participate, one withdrew due to a lack of interest from residents and two were non-committal in their response. Two schemes included in the sample (7 and 10) catered specifically for people with sight loss, and scheme 7 was designed for this user group. The other schemes were designed for older people in general and not specifically for those with visual impairments.

<p>In adapting the tool, the key sources were those specialist design guides focused on the needs of people with sight loss, particularly <italic>Housing for People with Sight Loss</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup> that brought together much of the research on this topic and guidance issued by the Royal National Institute of Blind People.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup> Where there were contradictions between more general design guides, preference was given to the recommendations made in these specialist guides.</p>
<p>The design guidance review also included generic lighting guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512450451">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup> and relevant British Standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512450451">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512450451">15</xref></sup> Also included were those design codes issued by Government agencies, such as the Homes and Communities Agency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512450451">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512450451"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512450451">18</xref></sup> and Department of Health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512450451">19</xref></sup> with which architects and housing providers have to comply if a scheme is part-funded by public money.</p>
<p>As part of the scheme survey, an illuminance meter was used to measure electric light illuminance. In order to minimise disruption to the participants, a simple procedure was adopted in which one measurement was made per room, with the illuminance meter placed at floor level in the centre of the room. Measurements were taken with all fitted general lighting at full output, and all task lighting and portable lighting switched off, to allow observations to be compared with recommendations issued by Thomas Pocklington Trust.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup> As most measurements were made during daytime, one reading was taken with the light on and another reading taken with the light off, and the latter figure subtracted from the former. Measurements were made with curtains closed if the illuminance meter was found to be in direct sunlight, or if it became apparent that the illuminance from natural light was varying rapidly owing to drifting clouds obscuring the sun. Uniformity of illuminance was assessed by eye.</p>
<p>Average daylight factors were calculated for the lounge, kitchen and main bedroom of each apartment and bungalow included in the study. The formula used was that developed by the Building Research Establishment for calculating average daylight factor on a horizontal working plane at desktop height,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512450451">14</xref></sup> with the sky component obtained using a dot diagram placed over a fish-eye photograph, following a process described by Tregenza and Wilson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153512450451">20</xref></sup> In addition, an extensive photographic record was made of each dwelling for reference purposes.</p>
<p>EVOLVE tool data were analysed using descriptive statistics, primarily through grouping items into categories, or ‘domains,’ relating to aspects of building design that are important in design for people with sight loss, such as ‘daylight’ and ‘colour and contrast’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>). Each domain score was calculated as the sum of the items in the domain scoring ‘yes,’ divided by the total number of applicable items in the domain, and multiplied by 100 to indicate the percentage of building features that comply with current design guidance.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1477153512450451"><title>2.2. Qualitative interviews</title>
<p>To investigate whether extra-care schemes satisfy the needs of older people with sight loss, qualitative interviews were conducted with the occupants of the homes surveyed using the EVOLVE tool. A total of 44 people were interviewed; three interviews were conducted with married couples who occupied the same apartment. Individual participants were recruited through scheme managers. The sample was purposive with the aim of recruiting two people with serious visual impairments and two people with moderate sight loss in each scheme.</p>
<p>All but three participants had serious pathologies of the eye (e.g. macular degeneration, glaucoma or cataracts), but participants had a wide range of visual function (see Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477153512450451">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1477153512450451">4</xref>).

<p>Participants were asked about their experiences of undertaking everyday activities such as preparing food, ironing and reading, as a way of exploring their views on the design of their home in relation to lighting, aspect, layout, internal finishes, technology and safety features. Interviews lasted between 20 minutes and 107 minutes, were recorded using a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were anonymised to ensure confidentiality. Data were coded and analysed thematically, with N-Vivo 8 software used to store and retrieve data. Two researchers reviewed the transcripts to ensure agreement on coding frames.

<p>It is difficult to prescribe ideal illuminance levels for people with sight loss not least because there is no strong correlation between optimum light levels and specific pathologies of the eye.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512450451">6</xref></sup> This study draws on guidance published by the Thomas Pocklington Trust on illuminance in domestic settings for people with sight loss.

<p>Bathroom illuminance was below the recommended minimum level of 200 lux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup> in two schemes only (2 and 6 – <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1477153512450451">Table 5</xref>).

<sec id="sec7-1477153512450451"><title>3.2. Electric lighting – general</title>
<p>For the purposes of evaluating the schemes, items on illuminance were incorporated into a domain, ‘Electric lighting – general,’ along with items on the even distribution of light and degree of control over lighting afforded to occupants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Guidance on housing design for people with sight loss indicates that artificial light should be well distributed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup> although the CIBSE suggests that in domestic environments local areas of higher illumination can be introduced, as this will ‘assist partially sighted residents by enabling them to suit the lighting to their own clinical conditions.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup> Specialist and CIBSE guidance recommend the use of dimmer switches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup> and specialist guides recommend individual switching for each light fitting, to maximise the degree of control an occupant has over lighting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the survey of extra-care schemes it was found that illuminance levels and the distribution of light was generally good in domestic kitchens and bathrooms, but less good in lounges and bedrooms. Lighting schemes afforded little control over illuminance levels, with only one of the 11 schemes surveyed having dimmer switches, although in five schemes fitted lights closest to the widows could be switched on or off independently of lights furthest from the windows.</p>
<p>Scheme 7 achieved the highest score for the ‘Electric lighting-general’ domain, achieving a score approximately 31% higher than the next highest scoring scheme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477153512450451">Table 6</xref>). This high score reflects the even distribution of light in all rooms, high illuminance levels and the high degree of control afforded to occupants, scheme 7 being the only one to feature dimmer switches for all fitted lights except for those in bathrooms. Scheme 7 was one of two schemes in the sample that catered specifically for older people with sight loss and was the only scheme purpose-built for this use, and consequently is not typical of extra-care schemes generally.

<p>In general, those participants who had control over their lighting, through dimmer switches or through having fitted lights on separate switches, appreciated having this flexibility and took advantage of this high degree of control, either to prevent glare (including for watching television) or to improve the ambience.</p>
<p>Some participants with dimmer switches liked to keep lights on at a low level because soft light ‘is more soothing’ (female, age 78 years), only turning the lights up to full power when undertaking activities such as ironing or eating a meal. Others found their sensitivity to light varied from day to day.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I've always loved dimmer switches … Some days … I want everything on up bright, other times when I've got a bit of an eye ache and I want to, want to sit down and, you know, rest my eyes I will have the lighting right down dim.’ (Male, age 50 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants without dimmer switches for the fitted electric lights used the dimmer switches incorporated into standard lamps. Some participants with glare problems liked wall-mounted up-lighters.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I prefer the side lights … the bulb itself is not showing’ (Female, age 80 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants with glare problems, who did not have dimmer switches or wall-lights, rarely used ceiling lights, preferring to use standard lamps or table lamps for most purposes.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I use the side lights … I don't often use it [the ceiling light] … it's a little bit bright but if I want to, say if I'm having my supper or anything like that, if I want more light I put it on then … [But] it makes my eyes ache.’ (Female, age 100 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants with total sight loss, even though they did not benefit from the light themselves, reported that they used the electric lights in their home for social reasons, such as for the sake of a partner, family members, visitors or carers, or because ‘it’s natural’ to do so (male, age 73 years) or to activate extractor fans. Some of these participants experienced difficulties with specific types of dimmer switch, or with pull-cord switches or where lights had more than one switch, because it could be difficult to know whether a light was on or off. Dimmer switches could be problematic if the same action is used for turning lights both on and off.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1477153512450451"><title>3.3. Daylight</title>
<p>Although current specialist guidance on design for people with sight loss includes recommendations that natural light be maximised in circulation spaces and task areas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup> particularly in kitchens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup> there are no specific recommendations regarding daylight factors. Similarly, the <italic>Housing Quality Indicators</italic> recommend that all kitchens and bathrooms have windows, but do not specify daylight factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512450451">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>CIBSE’s guidance on lighting for communal residential buildings suggests that lounges have a daylight factor of 1.5%, kitchens 2% and bedrooms 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup> This advice is echoed by <italic>BS-8206 Part 2: Code of Practice for Daylighting</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512450451">14</xref></sup> and the <italic>Code for Sustainable Homes</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512450451">18</xref></sup> which make identical recommendations for lounges and kitchens, with the further recommendation that in both cases 80% of the working plane should receive direct light from the sky.</p>
<p>In the scheme survey, schemes were assessed using a ‘daylight’ domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>), comprised of items on the number of habitable rooms with daylight, and whether the daylight factors in lounges, kitchens and bedrooms comply with those recommended by CIBSE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In undertaking the survey it became apparent that many extra-care schemes are deep-plan buildings with single aspect apartments that have windows to lounges and bedrooms only. The schemes that achieved the highest domain scores were those where dwellings had the greatest area of external wall (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477153512450451">Table 6</xref>), as these are more likely to have windows to all rooms, and be dual aspect with windows on two sides of the building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477153512450451">Figure 2</xref>). Scheme 6 was the only scheme included in the study, which consisted entirely of bungalows, which consequently achieved the highest score. Of the homes surveyed in scheme 7, three out of the five were dual aspect apartments in a cluster block, which increased the number of rooms with daylight and increased daylight factors. The high-scoring home in scheme 11 was an end-terrace house, while the lower scoring homes in this scheme were apartments.
<fig id="fig2-1477153512450451" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>A dual aspect lounge; participants with a dual aspect dwelling appreciated having windows on two sides because it brought extra light into some rooms or because it increased the amount of direct sunlight.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512450451-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Schemes 2, 9 and 10 achieved high scores because of high daylight factors in lounges and master bedrooms, attributable to floor-to-ceiling height windows in these rooms. In some other schemes, such as scheme 11, the advantages attained by having large lounge windows were undermined by the presence of projections over the windows such as balconies to apartments above or overhanging eaves.</p>
<p>Many participants felt that having lots of daylight was important, either because it improved the feel of a home or because it enabled people to undertake tasks requiring close vision.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I can see a bit better in the normal daylight to the artificial lighting.’ (Male, age 75 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Those with a dual aspect dwelling appreciated having windows on two sides because it brought extra light into some rooms or because it increased the amount of direct sunlight.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I'm lucky because I've got a side window facing south as well as the west facing bay window … ’ (Female, age 69 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Those with kitchen windows appreciated having them because they brought in daylight or because ‘it's nice being able to look out’ (female, age 69 years). Some participants whose apartments lacked kitchen or bathroom windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477153512450451">Figure 3</xref>) wished they had them for daylight or to provide views out. Some participants in apartments with low daylight factors wanted more daylight and some participants in this situation found they had inadequate light to undertake everyday activities such as applying make-up, picking out clothing or putting on shoes.<disp-quote>
<p>‘The room is dark … to get dressed, choosing colours, I often have to walk towards the light to get a true, true picture.’ (Female, age 66 years)

<sec id="sec9-1477153512450451"><title>3.4. Sunlight</title>
<p>In relation to sunlight, most of the specialist guidance on design for people with sight loss focuses on the need to enable occupants to control the amount of sunlight that enters their home through the use of blinds, in order to reduce glare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup> In <italic>Building Sight</italic> it is noted that blinds bring problems of adjustment and control, and additional methods of reducing glare are suggested including structural shielding. Only brief reference is made to the benefits of direct sunlight, specifically to the high illuminance provided by sunlight, although it is also noted that illuminance levels can change rapidly resulting in problems of adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>CIBSE’s <italic>Lighting Guide 9</italic> notes that, ‘Sunshine lifts the spirits,’ and sunlight in the home is beneficial for the occupants’ well-being, and brings additional illumination and warmth, although it can also cause unwanted solar gain. It is suggested that the ideal home is rectangular in plan with the longitudinal axis oriented to within 30° of east/west, and with the principal rooms on the south side. Ideally bedrooms should be within 45° of due east to allow early morning sun to enter, while intermittently used spaces, such as bathrooms, can face north.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref></sup> Similar advice is offered in the <italic>Housing Quality Indicators</italic>, which recommend that lounge and kitchen windows be oriented to face within 30° of south or receive ‘good daylight.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512450451">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ‘sunlight’ domain comprised of items relating to whether dwellings were single or dual aspect, whether individual rooms receive direct sunlight in the morning or afternoon and whether there are any obstructions to direct sunlight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The domain scores arising from the scheme survey showed much more variation between individual dwellings within each scheme than with other domains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477153512450451">Table 6</xref>). This is partly attributable to the high proportion of single aspect dwellings in the sample (24 out of 41 units, 58.5%). A north-facing single aspect apartment will receive no direct sunlight, while an identical apartment facing south will receive direct sunlight throughout the day, which will be reflected in its domain score. For example, the variation in scores for scheme 10 results from two southeast-facing apartments achieving high scores and a northwest facing flat scoring low.</p>
<p>Other factors affected scores. Only one participant was interviewed in scheme 8 and the low scores are not representative of the scheme as a whole. In this case, the participant struggled to open curtains and blinds, as described below, and the domain score reflects the conditions of the building at the time of the survey, rather than the quality of the building as designed.</p>
<p>Looking at the domain scores across the sample, it seems that while architects are often constrained by the site conditions, many find ways to maximise a site’s potential. In the sample, 85% of lounges and 83% of master bedrooms received some direct sunlight, although only 46% of lounges and 41% of double bedrooms received direct sunlight in both the morning and afternoon. Of the 20 dwellings where kitchens had windows, 60% received some direct sunlight but only 20% received direct sunlight both morning and afternoon. Bathrooms and hallways were the rooms least likely to receive direct sunlight, with no bathrooms in the sample receiving sunlight.</p>
<p>Obstructions to windows were common. Of those rooms oriented to receive some direct sunlight, only 41% (15 out of 37) of lounges were free from obstructions to direct sunlight. Similarly, only 47% (7 out of 15) of kitchens and 45% (17 out of 38) of master bedrooms had windows free from obstruction to direct sunlight. Common obstructions were buildings and high hedges.</p>
<p>Many participants appreciated sunlight because it made them feel better and some liked having some direct sunlight despite problems with glare.<disp-quote>
<p>‘It's very nice, it's absolutely lovely but sometimes when it's, sun's over there and I'm here I can't face it because it's so brilliant, I have to move, you know, because it's so brilliant, but it is lovely, I wouldn't have it any other way.’ (Female, age 89 years)</p>
<p>‘I like it because I'm a bit of a sun worshipper but in practical terms it's a bit of a nightmare for me … ’ (Male, age 50 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants also appreciated sunlight because it gave them information about the time of day and the weather, which in turn gave them a greater sense of connection to the wider world, particularly important if they were largely housebound.<disp-quote>
<p>‘Well just to know that life is there and that life’s going on and that it’s a difference between day time and night time. Yes you can tell … I can tell the heat or the coldness of the wind. That combined with the sunlight or lack of it makes a big difference to sort of general awareness of things.’ (Male, age 88 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A total of 13 participants reported experiencing problems with glare from sunlight, and most reported using blinds to reduce glare. One participant reported experiencing serious difficulties in operating their blinds and curtains owing to sight loss and arthritis. In addition to experiencing difficulties in drawing back the curtains and manipulating control-cords, the participant struggled to see the white cords for controlling the blinds against the magnolia-coloured walls.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I pull the string to close the blind in the kitchen and, and I've got it all, all twisted, you know, in a mess somehow, and I don't want to do that … so I just leave it as it is.’ (Female, age 77 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, the participant kept the blinds closed and had only one curtain drawn back throughout the day and night, relying on artificial light in preference to experiencing problems with sunlight glare.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1477153512450451"><title>3.5. Aspect</title>
<p>Little research literature exists on what people with visual impairments want in a view from the window, which perhaps explains the absence of this issue from guidance on design for people with sight loss. There is extensive literature on aspect in relation to people with normal vision,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153512450451">23</xref></sup> and aspect is well covered in mainstream design guidance.</p>
<p>CIBSE’s <italic>Lighting Guide 9</italic> and the British Standards document <italic>BS8206</italic> recommend that buildings be provided with views of natural features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512450451">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512450451">14</xref></sup> or dynamic urban scenes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512450451">14</xref></sup> and emphasise the importance of depth of view, suggesting that the ideal view contains features in the foreground, middle-distance and far-distance. Similarly, the <italic>Housing Quality Indicators</italic> recommend that dwellings have ‘urban views of over 50 m or distant or rural views’ and suggests that the sill height in lounges should not exceed 800 mm above the finished floor level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512450451">17</xref></sup> a recommendation that echoes Lifetime Homes standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153512450451">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the scheme survey, the ‘aspect’ domain comprised items on the sill height, depth of view, whether the window affords a view of natural features or human activity, and whether there were any obstructions such as blank walls, for the lounge, kitchen and bedrooms in each dwelling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>As with the sunlight domain, there was found to be much variation between individual dwellings within each scheme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477153512450451">Table 6</xref>). In most schemes, views from lounge windows were good with the lounge sill less than 600 mm above floor level in 76% of cases. Also, 80% of lounge windows had a view of natural features, 76% a view of human activity (only three units had views of neither) and 78% of lounge windows were free from obstruction, although only 46% had views of near and distant features. Schemes that achieved a high median domain score generally afforded views with a greater depth of field, and views were good from most rooms throughout each dwelling, not just from the lounge.</p>
<p>Scheme 8, which achieved the lowest score in this domain, is a special case; the scores reflect the participant’s difficulty in opening blinds and curtains, which meant that in practice the participant’s view was minimal.</p>
<p>Interviews with occupants suggest that many people with poor visual function appreciate similar qualities in a view as people with normal vision. Many participants, particularly those who were largely housebound, talked about having an increased awareness of the wider world through proximity to human activity and natural features. For example, one participant who can see objects only in silhouette talked about how seeing the trees outside his lounge window moving in the wind enhanced his awareness of the external environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512450451">Figure 4</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-1477153512450451" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The type of view favoured by participants; even participants with poor visual function appreciated views of natural features or of human activity as it gave them greater connection to the outside world.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512450451-fig4.tif"/>
</fig></p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I know everybody gets fed up with the wind but it’s a friend to me, seeing it move those trees … I get a lot of pleasure just from seeing the winds out there even though I can’t distinguish the trees … It gives a general feeling of the weather.’ (Male, age 88 years)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Many participants lived alone, and some talked about how external views relieved the sense of isolation.<disp-quote>
<p>‘ … when my husband died I felt that this was a little prison and I was a prisoner within four walls, so in a sense I think that window was a bit of a lifeline, that, although there wasn't an awful lot to see there was another world out there.’ (Female, age 66 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Even for participants with low visual function, being able to see signs of human activity was important.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I'm glad I've got [a view] but I can't make out who's walking up and who's walking down, you know, or what, or what vehicles are at the, at the entrance … [I like] the feeling that there's some activity out there, you know’ (Female, age 81 years)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For participants with very low visual function, sounds from the outside world could also be important. For some, hearing human activity was ‘very important … it's knowing that there's someone around.’ (Female, age 81 years) Others liked hearing nature.<disp-quote>
<p>‘I love listening to the birds and I've got my bird table kind of outside, near my spare bedroom window and, you know, I can hear all the birds singing and I love that, yeah.’ (Female, age 40 years)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec11-1477153512450451"><title>3.6. Colour and contrast</title>
<p>Current guidance on design for people with sight loss includes recommendations on the use of colour in building design, either to increase the internal reflectance of room surfaces or to enhance the legibility of a room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512450451">Figure 5</xref>) by highlighting features such as doors, door furniture, skirting boards, grab rails, shower curtains and light switches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup>

<p>For the scheme survey a ‘colour and contrast’ domain was created comprised of a wide range of items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477153512450451">Table 2</xref>), based on recommendations made in <italic>Housing for People with Sight Loss</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two schemes that cater for older people with sight loss (7 and 10) achieved significantly higher scores than the others in the sample, with median scores of 80% and 76%, respectively, compared to the third highest scoring scheme that achieved 42% and the lowest that scored 21% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1477153512450451">Table 6</xref>). While in many schemes rooms are decorated in a light colour thus maximising internal reflectance, including 90% of lounges and 95% of bedrooms, the use of colour schemes to enhance the legibility of rooms was rarer. The most common use of contrasting colours was for hand-painted building elements such as doors. Across the whole sample, 97% of front doors and 38% of lounge doors were in a contrasting colour to the surrounding walls. Also, 95% of bathroom floors were in a contrasting colour to bathroom walls and fittings. However, much less use was made of contrasting colour schemes for services, with electric light switches contrasting with the switch plate in schemes 7 and 10 only, and manual thermostats contrasting with surrounding walls in one unit alone.</p>
<p>Participants with limited visual function, living in schemes where contrasting colours were used, appreciated these colour schemes because they enhanced the legibility of internal spaces.<disp-quote>

<p>While few participants whose homes had light-coloured walls commented on them, some of those whose dwellings had dark-coloured walls were critical of them.<disp-quote>

<sec id="sec12-1477153512450451"><title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>Using current guidance on design for people with sight loss as a benchmark, the findings of the scheme survey suggest that many extra-care housing schemes provide adequate electric light illuminance levels and a good distribution of light in kitchens and bathrooms. However, electric light illuminance levels in lounges and bedrooms are below that recommended in the specialist guidance, lighting systems afford little control, and few schemes feature colour schemes that enhance the legibility of spaces.</p>
<p>Many of the issues raised by participants in the study are covered in the current specialist guidance on design for people with sight loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512450451">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512450451">11</xref></sup> suggesting that this guidance is essentially sound, although there is scope for additional guidance. Specifically, on the evidence of this study, aspect, daylight and sunlight are important to people with sight loss, particularly to those who are housebound as it can engender a greater sense of connection to the world, and design guidance should reflect this. Few of the recommendations made in the specialist guidance feature in more mainstream guidance, such as that published by the Homes and Communities Agency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512450451">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512450451"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512450451"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512450451">19</xref></sup> and this probably explains why many existing extra-care schemes are deficient in some areas.</p>
