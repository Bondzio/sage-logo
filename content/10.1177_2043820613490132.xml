<abstract>
<p>Writing regional narratives of the sort envisaged in this article is much more fraught with difficulties than acknowledged by its author. Four conditions are identified for avoiding the glib story telling that afflicts the genre: reflecting on the limits of previous narratives, particularly the foundational myth of the disinterested observer of timeless truths; being clear about the metanarratives that unavoidably inform meaningful descriptive narratives; avoiding the call of elite and popular appeal at the expense of scholarly integrity; and cultivating an outsider status that speaks to the epistemological fragility of all regional narratives including those we might write, particularly when the emphasis in academia, for good philosophical as well as practical reasons, is on more analytic endeavors. The barriers set by these conditions suggest reasons why the genre is so little practiced.</p>

<p>This article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613490132">Murphy, 2013</xref>) is bemusing. It proposes to be about encouraging “geographers” to write “grand regional narratives,” but its critique of such efforts mainly by “non-geographers” is its strength. I think that this happens because once Murphy reaches the examples, he realizes that writing such narratives is a fraught exercise unless the writer is willing to reflect self-consciously on their limits. Few of those he mentions in the conclusion as influencing US “elites” (Thomas Friedman, Robert Kaplan, and so on) show such scholarly inclinations. They are in fact propagandists for various types of geopolitical snake oil in which empirical information is cherry-picked to fit interpretive frameworks that appeal to the simpleminded or ignorant who have little knowledge of previous incarnations of these narratives or of the places swept up into the narratives.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that I think it is possible to write critically informed “grand narratives” of the type Murphy is advocating, but only on four conditions. The first is to reflect on the historiography of previous grand regional narratives. “Knowing your natives” was the basic adage that informed hubristic colonial-era European and American geography. In our collective retreat from the simple generalizations about places that the old explorer-empiricist logic authorized, we should remain sensitive to the fact that the narratives in question are always written from somewhere with someone’s interests and identities foremost in mind. So, if you wish to write for US elites you need to give them stories they can make use of. Mackinder, as most professional geographers know, was primarily an apologist for the British Empire of his day in developing a geopolitical logic in service to that cause. Mackinder must be given a transcendental “scientific” authority his framework manifestly lacks (e.g. what is the technological equivalent of the railway giving Eurasia a new geostrategic advantage today?) in order to provide grounding to contemporary US debates about “pivoting” to China. I think that, as geographers often familiar with these old stories, our duty is not to endorse such flimflam but to actively expose it as such (e.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613490132">g. Agnew, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if there is no “view from nowhere” that stands beyond geography, quite where to locate your focal point as you try to write a regional narrative is a serious problem. Different regions at different geographical scales are needed for different purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613490132">Agnew, 2012b</xref>). Murphy’s examples range far and wide: some are truly global, based on polarities such as the Global North and South; others are more conventional accounts of world regions that are themselves impositions on the world map (such as the “Middle East”). Some sort of world-ranging theoretical framework would seem to be absolutely necessary to provide a basis other than ad hoc reasoning for the narratives one wishes to relate, particularly when one is aiming for the “grand.” Inevitably, this leads us to the “metanar-ratives” that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613490132">Murphy (2013</xref>: 4) seeks to avoid in pursuit of descriptions that are somehow not “conceptually rooted.” This seems like an impossible task to me. Many of the grandest narratives necessarily fall back on theoretical assumptions that, while providing principles for selecting what information to privilege, such as material factors versus ideas or “drives” within cultural contexts, are often deliberately vague about why they chose the approach that they did. To open up their hidden metanarrative is to question the total geography on offer. In my efforts at providing “global stories” with serious geographical <italic>analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613490132">Agnew, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613490132">2009</xref>), I have tried to lay out very clearly the metanarratives that inform my perspectives. By contrast, only in an interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613490132">Parry, 2013</xref>) did I discover that Ian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613490132">Morris (2010</xref>), author of <italic>Why the West Rules … For Now</italic>, based his grand regional narrative on the adage that: “Change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things.” Although this sentence helps me understand his book a whole lot better, I also feel even more intellectual unease about the book than I did before. In the end, a synthesis is only as good as the analytic principles that inform its construction. As a result, analysis versus synthesis should be seen as a false polarity. Unfortunately, it is very much at the center of the claims made on behalf of regional narratives, grand, or otherwise. Ad hoc synthesis usually trumps rooting the synthesis in careful analysis.</p>
<p>Grand regional narratives may appeal to Murphy and to many others because they provide synthetic accounts of information about places that address one of the great themes of geography: integrating knowledge in broad accounts that also, coincidentally, appeal to wider publics put off by more analytic approaches to geographic (or any other) understanding. But the latter part of Murphy’s article leads me to suspect that the question of scholarship is entirely secondary. The appeal of the grand regional narratives is much more about the style of presentation, and about the possibility of publicity and recognition by elites than it is about scholarship. The goal is getting your book reviewed in the <italic>New York Times Book Review</italic> or the <italic>London Review of Books</italic> and having extended book tours that publicize your personal and disciplinary brand to the general public. I fear that complex historical geographies that invoke the vital importance of colonialism for the contemporary world order and point to the inadequacy of American or European nostrums about “modernization” or “the Steam Engine” as the motors of history (or, for their part, say Chinese ones about the miracle-working properties of “Confucianism”) will not make it into print with trade publishers, let alone show up in airport bookshops. It is not only about dumbing down; it is also about conforming to popular prejudices. So, in writing grand regional narratives, the temptation to enter into a Faustian Compact with commercialization and elites should be rejected as often reflecting the betrayal rather than the fulfillment of scholarly purpose.</p>
<p>Academic geography is a relatively “minor” and marginalized field in terms of numbers of self-labeled practitioners and institutional presence within universities around the world, even relative to fields such as economics and political science, let alone history. Moreover, its outsider status as a field predating the “variable”-defined (the social, the economic, etc.) and superanalytic disciplines of the late 19th century such as sociology, economics, political science, and so on, has always left it open to the charge as a haven for dilettantes and misfits producing pedestrian travelogues. As a counter, this has led to much imitation of the other fields in philosophy and method, thus eschewing the goal of writing “descriptive” narratives about places. Purportedly, “explaining” and “predicting” relatively limited phenomena under limited geographical circumstances have become much more important to professional careers than writing broad syntheses about large parts of the earth’s surface with which any one person can only have at best a nodding familiarity. In addition, “regional specializations” have long been in retreat in Anglo-American academic geography, which makes the emergence of the broader narratives based on first-hand local knowledge rather than half-baked generalizations culled from second-hand sources even less likely than in the past. Finally, the academic pressures to write relatively brief articles rather than books, such as 3-year personnel review periods in many US universities and the Research Assessment Exercise/Research Excellence Framework in the United Kingdom, encourage an emphasis on explicitly avoiding grand regional narratives of the sort envisaged by Murphy. Yet, in my view, the outsider status is actually a valuable one to cultivate, not just in providing justification for the sort of syntheses that Murphy is proposing, if accompanied by a large dose of critical self-awareness, but also in challenging the presuppositions and simplicities that attend the writing of grand regional narratives of whatever type no matter what the departmental affiliations might be under which they are advertised.</p>
