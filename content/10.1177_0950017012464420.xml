<p>In Richard Wilson and Kate Pickett’s book, <italic>The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone</italic>, they ask the questions: what are the characteristics of inequality and how might societies as a whole be improved by equality? Although epidemiologists, the authors assert that their studies are primarily ‘evidence-based politics’. Wilkinson and Pickett build the case on their own research as well as on international health and supra-governmental research reports and a commendably exhaustive literature review.</p>
<p>Many of the headline facts that Wilkinson and Pickett present help to underpin their case for a more welfarist approach towards poverty reduction with, in particular, an emphasis on the redistribution of wealth. They assert that in most societies, many of the problems facing a society – from child well-being, to health and social problems – reflect the size of the median income gap rather than national average income. Levels of trust, mental illness, life expectancy, infant mortality, obesity, children’s educational performance, teenage births, homicides, imprisonment rates and social mobility are more pronounced the larger the gap in living standards. The simultaneous intensification of individualism leads to whole societies becoming compromised in terms of the quality of community social and cultural capital that <italic>both</italic> the rich and the impoverished have at their disposal. Further, large differences in living standards make it more difficult for citizens either side of the socio-economic divide to empathize.</p>
<p>The authors also raise and challenge readily and appropriately a number of academic and ideological criticisms made against earlier editions of the book. However, other criticisms remain. A major weakness of the book, given the assertion that it is ‘the elephant in the room’, is that relatively little is said about corporations. Corporate power challenges that of the state and societal norms are becoming increasingly marketized. Governments often struggle to close the socio-economic gaps in society while corporations increasingly wield the power to widen them at will.</p>
<p>But perhaps one of the most significant criticisms lies in an observation made by Wilkinson and Pickett. They note that they often found themselves invited to speak to audiences, largely comprised of like-minded individuals:<disp-quote>
<p>Audiences have been so uniformly positive and appreciative that we have sensed there is an intellectual vacuum, a hunger for the evidence we present – as if under the surface the world was full of closet egalitarians. (p. 274)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wilkinson and Pickett suggest that certain factors might explain the ‘intellectual vacuum’: plausible explanations for social problems against a background of unprecedented affluence; an unease with consumerism and materialism; a desire to raise the importance of family and community; and the drawing together of what is felt but only weakly understood, a world ‘both quite new to them yet somehow almost immediately recognizable’ (p. 274).</p>
<p>There may be more underpinning the intellectual vacuum. In an interview on the BBC television programme <italic>Newsnight</italic>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, the most senior cleric in the Church of England, spoke of a society in which many have ‘put the shutters up’, creating a culture in which people are becoming ‘fist-clenching, anxious, not generous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012464420"><italic>Newsnight</italic>, 2012</xref>). There is a collective fear of strangers and collective contempt for the unsuccessful. The shame felt by the poor and weakening empathy have grown into increasingly embedded and legitimated negativity and aggression towards the poor.</p>
<p>Martha Nussbaum has developed an eloquent, philosophical rationale of how social inequality and injustice regularly result in the development of cultural norms of shame felt by and disgust towards the poor. Nussbaum cites Goffman, an important influence for her work, regarding the actions of the majority to shame those less fortunate.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… deny both the humanity we share with the person and the person’s individuality. He is reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one …. By definition, of course, we believe the person with a stigma is not quite human. On this assumption we exercise varieties of discrimination.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The consequence, Nussbaum argues, is that impoverishment becomes continuously reinforced and that:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the most stigmatized life conditions, in all societies, is poverty. The poor are routinely shunned and shamed, treated as idle, vicious, of low worth. Perhaps this is especially likely to be true in America, where it is widely believed that poverty is evidence of laziness or lack of will power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012464420">Nussbaum, 2004</xref>: 282–3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The nature of ridicule is ever evolving and, indeed, so are those subjected to ridicule. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012464420">Owen Jones’s popular (2011)</xref> account of the demonization of the working class details how the working class, once brimming with pride, are regarded increasingly as those left behind (by implication, not sufficiently driven or able) in the rush to join the expanding middle classes, finding themselves on the receiving end of increasingly pejorative accounts of their lives and culture. Societal alienation often leads to political alienation, especially so as working class voices become less and less represented among the political classes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012464420">Robert Golembiewski’s pioneering (1986)</xref> studies of politically alienated communities during the 1960s Civil Rights Movement in the USA illustrated graphically the difficulty of getting those left out of political activities for some time reconnected and mobilized. A combination of the liminality of the nature of poverty among more liberal ‘like-minded individuals’ and political disenfranchisement of the poor may lead to soft political thinking towards what requires hard political action.</p>
<p>Crucially, this shift has taken place in parallel with decades of rolling back of the welfare state. Those in greatest need have less assistance from the state and a lack of social mobility means access to opportunities are likely to lessen further. The gap between the wealthiest and the poorest continues to rise. Rowan Williams suggests that things will only change when generosity is ‘etched in the granite of life across the country’. By implication, only when poverty is not only acknowledged but also evokes collective shame from the more prosperous will more rapid progress be made.</p>
