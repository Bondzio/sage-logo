<p>I count <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> as one of my early influences. My copy of the book still has marginalia that I scrawled on its pages when I was an undergraduate in the late 1970s (outraged notes of ‘no!’ at the declaration ‘men <italic>act</italic> and women <italic>appear</italic>’ [original emphases]) that indicate that I had yet to develop the reading skills to understand the difference between embracing a position and critiquing it. That seems like a very long time ago, certainly long enough ago for nostalgia. Yet the book’s ongoing resonance is remarkable. The revolutionary qualities of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> have only become more apparent with time.</p>
<p>I attribute much of the book’s continued relevance to its declarative voice –assured, unapologetic, and bold. It is filled with highly quotable phrases: ‘Seeing comes before words’; ‘To look is an act of choice’; ‘The visible world is arranged for the spectator as the universe was once thought to be arranged for God’; and even, it must be admitted, that vexing ‘men <italic>act</italic> and women <italic>appear.</italic>’ The mode of address of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> manages to be both declarative and suggestive. The book does not do a significant amount of textual analysis, rather it gives the reader various frameworks to interpret a broad array of images on its pages. Some of its essays are purely visual, inviting viewers to make connections and see patterns without guiding them with a proscribed narrative.</p>
<p>My co-authored book, <italic>Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture</italic>, written with Lisa Cartwright, deliberately riffs off Berger’s title (from ways of seeing to practices of looking) and, in our words, takes the cross-disciplinary model of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> as a ‘distant inspiration’. In an early iteration of <italic>Practices of Looking</italic>, we submitted a manuscript that attempted to replicate this declarative tone, one with images that, like <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, dotted the pages in a way that asked the viewer to do their own interpretation. It is perhaps not incidental that we were told by readers (this would have been in about 1999) that this declarative–suggestive approach would not work, that we needed to guide, analyze, and demonstrate visual analysis more. Our book thus migrated from the <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> free form, one that has appealed for 40 years to general readers as well as students, to a more insistently pedagogical style. One could speculate that <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> paved the way not only for teaching books on visual culture but for the vast publishing domain of books that have minimal text and many images open to interpretation exemplified by Taschen (a publishing enterprise that replicates its embrace of images without, of course, its Marxist critique).</p>
<p>It is precisely the unself-conscious way in which <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> makes connections across social arenas that marks the most radical nature of its intervention. At the time of the BBC series and the book’s publication in 1972, the kind of contemporary disciplinary boundary crossing that now characterizes the field of visual culture had little currency. The mixing of art history, cultural analysis, and communication theory, the deployment of Walter Benjamin and Marxist theory, all commonplace within a decade or two, were adept and crucial interventions when Berger and his collaborators enacted them. Most importantly, in the approach of the book and the TV series, it is a <italic>given</italic> that images from different social arenas such as news, advertising, and art, not only influence each other but share vocabularies, approaches, and intents.</p>
<p>The radical nature of the book’s interdisciplinary approach can be seen most clearly in the book’s final chapter on publicity and art. While the notion that art and advertising occupy different social realms and registers continues to hold sway (with art retaining much higher cultural capital and advertising defined as a debased form of visual culture), the fact is that their histories are long intertwined and the industry of advertising has long borrowed from art and modern art from advertising. In the 1910s and 1920s, for instance, modern design evolved across art, industrial design, and advertising in cross-fertilized ways, with art deco and art nouveau very common styles for the advertisement of modern products.</p>
<p>The move in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> to see advertising, a visual form relegated to the study of communication and persuasion, in relation to art history, with its own disciplinary boundary policing, was certainly bold. And it is precisely the declarative tone of the book that allows this new way of considering publicity/advertising to make sense. Thus, the book shifts an analysis of publicity/advertising from the study of the industry’s strategies, rhetoric, and persuasive tactics, to an understanding of advertising as a language of transformation, as part of a visual language that intersects with and borrows from art, news images, and other visual forms. As the book declares:
<disp-quote>
<p>Publicity is not merely an assembly of competing messages: it is a language in itself which is always being used to make the same general proposal … It proposes to each of us that we transform ourselves, or our lives, by buying something more. (p. 131)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Transformation and envy are the key themes made clear in this final chapter. Glamour is defined here not as a standard of beauty or way of looking so much as it is the state of being envied. The glamorous do not see us, we gaze upon them with envy and, in another highly quotable phrase, this ‘explains the absent, unfocused look of so many glamour images. They look out <italic>over</italic> the looks of envy which sustain them’ (p. 133). Publicity works on anxiety, it defines the present as insufficient as it speaks a language of the future, and it is eventless: ‘Experience is impossible within it. All that happens, happens outside it’ (p. 153).</p>
<p>The migration from publicity/advertising as a category of visual images to the complex multi-media saturation of brand culture has created a dramatically different world of consumerism in 2012 from that of 1972. Yet, the declarative statements of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> remain sharply relevant in the context of iPad and social media culture. The language of publicity is not just of selling, it is that of transformation. And, in the complex image culture today, with its digital networks, linkages, aggregation, and rapid, viral circulation, we can still say, ‘Seeing comes before words.’</p>
