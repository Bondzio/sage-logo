<abstract>
<p>The article discusses the spontaneous popular movement J14 that erupted into the Israeli public sphere during the summer of 2011. Inspired by the Egyptian and Spanish movements, J14 was ignited by opposition to housing prices, later expanded into protests against neoliberal economic policies and socioeconomic inequalities. The concept of <italic>resistance mo(ve)ment</italic> is used to comprehend the peculiar intersection between the <italic>movement</italic> and <italic>moment</italic> of mass mobilization. The article explores the mo(ve)ment focusing on the political and economic background and context, and analyzing the role of a new generational class who were suffering the effects of a neoliberal political economy. The B Generation in Israel is the product of a double crisis, global and local. The local crisis involves the disintegration of Israeli society after Rabin’s assassination in 1995, and the repression of socioeconomic agendas by fanning hostility to external ‘enemies’. The global crisis is the outcome of a neoliberal economy that weakens middle and lower classes, especially young people living under precarious conditions. The argument is that socioeconomic protests in Israel take place when the external ‘conflict’ is quiet. The calm summer of 2011 was framed in-between Netanyahu’s US campaign against UN recognition of a Palestinian state in May and the scheduled UN discussions in September.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Cet article examine le mouvement populaire spontané J14 qui apparut dans l’arène publique d’Israël durant l’été 2011. Inspiré par les mouvements égyptien et espagnol, J14 a été initié comme opposition aux prix de logement, et il a adressé plus tard les politiques néo-libérales et l’inégalité socio-économique. Le concept de mouvement/moment de résistance est utilisé pour comprendre l’intersection particulière entre le mouvement and le moment de mobilisation massive. L’article examine le mouvement/moment en se concentrant sur le contexte politique et économique, et en analysant le rôle d’une nouvelle class-générationnelle qui a souffert les effets d’une politique économique néo-libérale. La Génération B en Israël est le produit d’une double crise, globale et locale. La crise locale est associée à la désintégration de la société israélienne après l’assassinat du Rabin in 1995, et la répression des agendas socio-économiques en avivant l’hostilité des ‘ennemis’ externes. La crise globale est le résultat d’une économie néo-libérale qui affaiblisse les classes moyennes et bases, spécialement les jeunes vivant dans des conditions précaires. L’argument est que les protestation socio-économiques in Israël ont lieu quand le ‘conflit’ externe est calme. L’été calme de 2011 était le cadre entre la campagne de Netanyahu aux USA contre la reconnaissance de Palestine comme Etat par l’ONU au mois de mai et la discussion programmée aux Nations Unies au mois de Septembre.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>El artículo discute el movimiento popular espontáneo J14 que estalló en la esfera pública israelí durante el verano de 2011. Inspirado por los movimientos egipcio y español, el J14 fue encendido por la oposición a los precios de la vivienda, que más tarde se extendió a protestas contra la política económica neoliberal y la desigualdad socio-económica. El concepto de <italic>resistance mo(ve)ment</italic> se utiliza para comprender la intersección peculiar entre el movimiento y el momento de la movilización de masas. El artículo explora el mo(<italic>ve)ment</italic> centrándose en el trasfondo y contexto político y económico, y analiza el papel de una nueva clase generacional que ha sufrido los efectos de la política economía neoliberal. En Israel la generación B es el producto de una doble crisis: global y local. La crisis local consiste en la desintegración de la sociedad israelí tras el asesinato de Rabin en 1995, y la represión de las agendas socioeconómicas atizando la hostilidad hacia los ‘enemigos’ externos. La crisis global es el resultado de una economía neo-liberal que debilita a las clases medias y bajas, especialmente a los jóvenes que viven en condiciones precarias. El argumento es que las protestas socio-económicos en Israel tienen lugar cuando el ‘conflicto’ externo está tranquilo. El tranquilo verano de 2011 se enmarcó entre la campaña de Netanyahu en EE.UU. en mayo contra el reconocimiento por la ONU de un Estado palestino y los debates en la ONU programados en septiembre.</p>

<p>Immediately after the fall of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt many Israelis raised a question: Why can’t we do something like this in Israel? This was not an obvious question. After all, Israel is apparently a democracy: there are periodic free elections and changes of government. Nevertheless, the feeling was that popular discontent in Israel was unable to mobilize masses to affect politics. Half a year later, however, Israel was swept by a spontaneous protest movement called J14, and masses of young people occupied public spaces all over the country, two months before Occupy Wall Street. This was a sudden eruption of ‘popular’ inclusive social protest against the government which took place in the ‘quiet’ (warless) summer of 2011, inspired by the Egyptian democratic mobilization in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and the Spanish 15M movement of <italic>Indignados</italic>.</p>
<p>This sudden and unexpected movement saw 10% of Israel’s total population go out on the streets, probably more people in relative terms than all other mass mobilizations in 2011, except Egypt. Over a period of 52 days (14 July–3 September), demonstrators protested against the unaffordable housing and increasing socioeconomic inequalities, and their call for social justice gained the support of 85% of the population (according to a YNET poll, 2 August 2011). Mainstream media covered the movement sympathetically and ultimately facilitated the mobilization of more than half a million demonstrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392113479748">Shechter, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The movement’s popularity forced the government to acknowledge its responsibility for the crisis. Following recommendations by the especially appointed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392113479748">Trachtenberg (2011)</xref> commission the government took some important decisions, including new taxation of the rich, military budget cuts, and new policies aiming to reduce poverty and social gaps. After the 3 September One Million March, the leaders of J14 announced the dismantling of the tent camps, and most protestors were demobilized. When the government reverted to its neoliberal policies leaders and activists found themselves unable to mobilize a new mass protest.</p>
<p>This article aims to discuss both unusual phenomena: Why was J14 so successful in summer 2011, and why did it prove unable to mobilize supporters later on? The goal is to expand my previous work on political processes of democratization and the dynamics of political space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010b</xref>) and mo(ve)ments of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479748">Grinberg, forthcoming</xref>) by suggesting an explanation for the sudden emergence and no less sudden disappearance of the movement. To do so I briefly analyze the historical context of the Israeli political crisis of representation and economic neoliberalization, the background of the generational class that led the J14 movement, and the unique window of opportunities opened in the summer of 2011.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011392113479748">
<title>Mo(ve)ments of resistance: Between global and local</title>
<p>To analyze J14 I use an analytical concept recently developed in my comparative research of protest movements in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479748">Grinberg, forthcoming</xref>). I refer to the intersection of the <italic>movement</italic> and <italic>moment</italic> of mass mobilization as a <italic>mo(ve)ment</italic> of resistance, aiming to distinguish it from the social movement literature concepts of cycles of protest and political opportunities structure. I then show why the movement is not a cycle or wave of protest, why the moment is more than just a matter of political opportunity, and why the moment and movement must be taken together.</p>
<p>A certain marginalized social group (class, ethnic, racial, gender, religious, national or some unique combination of these groups) will initiate a massive movement of resistance to the oppressing power of a dominant group that exploits or discriminates them when two conditions coexist: (1) they have no political space to express themselves – no recognition of their claims, agendas, identities or ideas, and no legitimate representation of the group; and (2) when the political mechanisms previously used by the dominant groups to close their political space are temporarily weakened or removed. This moment is not a question of closed or open political opportunity structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392113479748">Eisinger, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479748">McAdam, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392113479748">Tilly, 1978</xref>) but a matter of an almost complete closure of legitimate channels of representation. Nor is this just a matter of structural, institutional or formal politics, but also a symbolic matter of repression of identities, narratives, discourses, and agendas. This is why, following the eventful sociology approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392113479748">Brubaker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392113479748">Sewell, 1996</xref>), we cannot formulate a general theory of social protest able to predict future waves. What we must do is to study and comprehend the local conditions of the specific case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392113479748">Kriesi et al., 1995</xref>), the social conflicts and tools used by the dominant groups to maintain their power, and the sequence of events that provoke the political dynamics of protest, including the influence of international waves.</p>
<p>Movements of resistance seek to gain recognition and representation of their claims, and protest in that sense against the dominant power, as well as against the entire political system, including the opposition, for failing to represent the claims of the oppressed social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392113479748">Snow, 2004</xref>). The mo(ve)ment of resistance is not necessarily the culmination of any long-term action by social activists and organizers but a volcanic eruption of repressed discontent that suddenly finds a way up to the public surface.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392113479748">1</xref></sup> It is not a cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392113479748">Tarrow, 1989</xref>), however, because when the moment ends the institutionalized political actors threatened by the movement react to prevent a new cycle. I call this reaction counter-mo(ve)ment, meaning that the resistance mo(ve)ment has always some effect – whether in the short, middle or long term – which doesn’t necessarily represent its original claims, with unintended consequences, provoking in some cases a completely opposite reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479748">Grinberg, forthcoming</xref>). Here my analysis departs from the social movement literature that usually assumes various positive outcomes, including the institutionalization of social protest and actors, and even actual change in government policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479748">McAdam, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392113479748">Tarrow, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Just like most other 2011 movements, the Israeli movement emerged by way of contagion. Events in Tunisia and Egypt fueled strong emotions in the Israeli media and public opinion, and Tahrir Square became a byword in local public discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392113479748">2</xref></sup> A few months after the Egyptian uprising Israeli social workers went on strike, and the image of Tahrir Square loomed large during their demonstrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392113479748">3</xref></sup> On 14 July, when the first tents were erected in Rothschild Boulevard, one of the most visible posters read ‘Rothschild at the corner of Tahrir’ (MAKO website, 7 August 2011). The key strategy in the repertoire of J14, occupying the main square, was adopted from the Egyptian uprising, and its main slogan – ‘The people demand social justice’ – was the Hebrew version of the most chanted slogans in Egypt.</p>
<p>However, the Israeli demonstrators’ repertoire wasn’t adapted only from Egypt but also from Spain. The Spanish 15M movement inspired not only the sister movement’s name (J14) but also key forms of organization, communication, and discourse. As in Spain, the Israelis organized general assemblies and constantly attempted to listen to everyone and make consensual decisions; even the hand sign language was copied from Madrid’s Puerta del Sol. Most crucial was the strategic refusal to negotiate with the government and compromise with the political establishment. The Spanish experience was critical for mobilizing Israeli protestors because it gave the protest movement its global image: more than local discontent against Arab dictators, it now became a protest in democratic regimes against the crisis of political representation.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most salient feature of the global wave of protests in 2011, from Egypt to Spain, from New Delhi to New York, from Chile to Israel: all were resistance movements against political systems unable to represent the masses, against ruling governments and established opposition parties. Everywhere, the uprising was led by a skilled young generation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392113479748">4</xref></sup> crushed by neoliberal economic policies, increasing inequality, and the precariousness of their economic position who protested against the linkage between big capital and national elites.</p>
<p>Despite such commonalities, the political context is always local. The more striking differences are between Egypt and Spain: while in Egypt the most overwhelming and clear demand was free elections, in Spain the protest was against absence of political alternatives to neoliberal policies <italic>despite</italic> free elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392113479748">5</xref></sup> The Israeli version is a combination of the two, a peculiar mix of democratic regime for Israelis and military regime for Palestinians, which I’ve elsewhere dubbed the dual military-democratic regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2008b</xref>); this is the main obstacle for popular mass mobilization. While political space for representing Palestinians under occupation is clearly closed, the closure of political space for representation of Israeli citizens’ interests and demands is much more subtle. It is this peculiar situation which has inspired me to develop the concept of mo(ve)ments of resistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011392113479748">
<title>Historical background:  The disintegration of Israeli solidarity</title>
<p>The lack of recognized state borders that define who the equal citizens are, combined with the legitimation crisis of the Israeli regime, gave birth to two political blocs that legitimized the 1967 occupation with different national myths, and mobilized opposing social groups, without any open representation of their interests, claims, and opinions. In my previous work I analyzed the peculiar political process that created two blocs named the ‘left’ and the ‘right’: the ‘left’ mobilized the middle and upper classes, while the ‘right’ mobilized the lower classes. Although the ‘left’ is seen as supporting territorial compromise and the ‘right’ as an expansionist movement claiming the entire Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), both have excluded the Palestinians from the legitimate political space using different discourses and national myths.</p>
<p>The hostility between the ‘left’ and ‘right’ was tribal and polarized, with no space for representation, debate, compromise or middle ground, in other words, without political space to contain the economic, cultural, and social conflicts between Israeli citizens. The most important container was the ‘enemy’, either neighboring countries or the Palestinians under occupation, and during the quiet periods, moments for resistance movements were created, facilitating the emergence of socioeconomic conflicts to the public surface, due to their underrepresentation and oppression by the national conflict and politically manipulated feelings of fear and danger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392113479748">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A significant change of this pattern took place after the First Intifada. The demarcation of Palestinian claims in the West Bank and Gaza facilitated majoritarian support for opening political space for negotiations with Palestinian representatives, but also opened up ‘internal’ conflicts between the Israelis for representation and negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2013</xref>). After the 1992 elections and mutual recognition of the Israeli government and the PLO in September 1993, new ‘post-conflict’ agendas and coalitions emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392113479748">Ram, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392113479748">Shafir and Peled, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392113479748">2002</xref>). The entire political party system became reshuffled under the assumption that negotiations with the Palestinians would lead to an agreement and the end of occupation – but then, in 1995, Rabin was assassinated. This was a crucial turning point in the political process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392113479748">Peri, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The original opening of political space for new agendas and coalitions deteriorated into a deep disintegration of Israeli society into hostile tribes, mobilized by political parties that gained support when hostility and fear increased. Between Rabin’s assassination and the 1999 elections the combined strength of the two main parties (Likud and Labor) shrunk from almost two-thirds of the Knesset to almost one-third. The main concern of most Israelis was the disintegration of Israeli society,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011392113479748">7</xref></sup> and several sociologists suggested theories to explain the national disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392113479748">Kimmerling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392113479748">Ram, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392113479748">Shafir and Peled, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Second Palestinian Intifada broke out in 2000, at a moment when no political power in Israel was able to negotiate a compromise, and the majority of the population was willing to unite and rediscover a shared identity when the ‘enemy’ reappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2013</xref>). In this political context the military elites were able to mobilize significant popular support for repression and neutralize political negotiations aimed at containing the violence by compromise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479748">Ben Eliezer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392113479748">Peri, 2006</xref>). The Second Intifada give birth to a new national myth: Israel has ‘no partner for peace’, and under these circumstances has no choice but to continue fighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010b</xref>). The continued military domination of the Palestinians is legitimized by this new myth, which unites the myths of the ‘left’ (security) and of the ‘right’ (Divine Promise), facilitating consensual use of violence in the repression of the Intifada (2000–2004), the Second Lebanon War (2006), and the Cast Lead attack against Gaza (December 2008–January 2009). This new myth also provided wide support for the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the blockade of over 1.5 million Palestinians living there since 2007.</p>
<p>However, in ‘quiet’ periods the marginalized ‘internal’ conflicts emerged. This was the case of a popular movement of single mothers in the summer of 2003, but, more importantly, this was the case of the 2006 elections, which took place after the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and before the Second Lebanon War. These were elections with a clear socioeconomic emphasis: new parties were formed, old parties changed their platforms and discourses, and the neoliberal Likud Party led by Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got only 12 out of 120 Knesset members, forcing him to the opposition. It is the disenchantment with the promises of the new ‘center-left’ coalition combined with the popularity of the critics of the neoliberal economic policies that gave birth to the J14 movement, in a relatively extraordinary moment of Palestinian non-violent strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392113479748">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392113479748">
<title>The disenchanted B Generation</title>
<p>The symbol of the J14 movement was the letter Beth (B), which also means ‘home’. When the first tents were erected on 14 July the protestors wrote on them: ‘B is a tent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392113479748">9</xref></sup> I call them the B Generation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392113479748">10</xref></sup> and associate them with a combination of deep political and economic disappointment. The B Generationers were 25–35 years old in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392113479748">Rozenhek and Shalev, 2013</xref>), and had politically traumatized at age 10–20 by Rabin’s assassination. This had been their major political experience: the strong hope that they would live in peace and the disappointment that the leader was killed. Immediately after the assassination the process of social disintegration began, and five years later the no-partner myth became dominant. B Generation is also the name of the collective wage agreements signed during the 1990s and 2000s which discriminate against new workers in terms of salary, social and pension rights. In line with the neoliberal adjustment of Israeli society, this created a background in which B Generationers could clearly see the rising economic inequality in general, and particularly the deterioration of their position compared to their parents: skilled academic workers now had less chance of reaching highly paid positions and their incomes fell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392113479748">Rozenhek and Shalev, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In reaction to their collective experience, members of the B Generation started to differentiate themselves from established political parties, and develop their own distinct behavior, views, and attitudes. They organized mainly in civil society organizations, activist groups, and NGOs, which were also one of the main forms of organization in the world under globalization in the 1990s and 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392113479748">Gidron et al., 2003</xref>). One of the salient features of NGOs is their total dissociation from the established political actors, increasing the alienation between civil society and politics.</p>
<p>One of the first appearances of the B Generation in the Israeli public sphere was the 1998 students’ strike. Organized by National Student Federation, it lasted 50 days and paralyzed academic studies in all universities and public colleges within the 1967 borders. The students had several similarities with the future J14 movement: the media were very supportive and constantly covered their struggle in the front pages and public support was almost 80%. The prime minister at the time was Benjamin Netanyahu, and some of the leaders of 2011 recalled that he broke their glorious strike in a very nasty way, which made them aware of his manipulative skills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392113479748">11</xref></sup> Another important similarity was one of the slogans of the 1998 strike that reappeared in 2011, claiming that the students include everyone: Jews and Arabs, left and right, religious and secular, Oriental and European Jews, new migrants and veterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This slogan was crucial for the B Generation’s ability to gain popularity and public support: while all the political parties are active contributors to the disintegration of Israeli society by inciting hostility between the ‘tribes’, we (the students in 1998 and J14 in 2011) represent all social groups and their shared interests, building a new formula for Israeli peoplehood. This slogan had been used also in another student strike in 2007,which once again paralyzed all the universities and colleges for 44 days and gained wide public support. This time the country was ruled by the disappointing ‘center-left’ coalition that had promised social-democratic reforms but continued the neoliberal economic policy dictated by the Finance Ministry’s bureaucratic elites and the Central Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479748">Maman and Rozenhek, 2011</xref>). After prolonged negotiations a compromise was reached in 2007, but the most important meaning of this strike was the politicization of the students, that had a direct impact on the activists of 2011. The 2007 activists underwent a process of radicalization: they started to talk about an ‘educational revolution’, and even ‘social revolution’, criticizing the shrinking of the welfare state, and not only of education budgets. Some activists started working with non-unionized workers who were suffering the impact of neoliberal flexibilization of labor markets and ‘privatization’. After the end of the strike many activists continued working in social organizations and trade unions, and a part of them initiated a new trade union called ‘Power to the Workers’ (Koach Laovdim), which started organizing unorganized workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0011392113479748">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ‘revolutionary’ spirit of the 2007 strike had its impact on the young generation of skilled workers in several strikes, most importantly the secondary teachers’ (2007), social workers’ (2011), and physicians’ (2011) strikes. In all these strikes, B Generation members rose against the older generation that had led their union, mainly because the agreements discriminated against them. The tendency of trade unions to compromise the interests of the young workers and sign unfavorable agreements for this generation was a result of neoliberal policies aiming to reform the labor markets, lower wages, and reduce tenured positions and pension funds. The new phenomenon was that the B Generation rejected the option to continue compromising in the name of younger workers and revolted against their unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0011392113479748">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>My interpretation of B Generation is that they are the product of a double political economic crisis, global and local. The local political crisis is related to the disintegration of society into ‘tribes’ and the complete repression of social and economic agendas by the hostility to ‘external enemies’, and internal hostility between the ‘tribes’. The global crisis is the crisis of representation originated by a neoliberal economy that weakens middle and lower classes as well as the state’s capacity to redistribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479748">Amin, 1997</xref>). In the absence of a balance of power between dominant and dominated classes, and without state capacities, political parties cannot fulfill their promises and are unable to represent the majority of the people. Tribal hostility is one of the repertoires used by political actors to mobilize the anger and fears of voters without representing their social and economic needs and demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>The Israeli B Generation suffered the effects of precariousness caused by the neoliberal political economy and became the generational class category <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392113479748">Standing (2011)</xref> has dubbed the precariat. This generational class suffered all the negative effects of the neoliberal economy, with no promise of stable jobs, or any jobs at all, no stable and increasing salaries, and decreasing social rights including pensions. In addition, in Israel B Generationers suffered from the local features of the dual regime, the structurally discriminated and oppressed Palestinians, and the hostility between various ethno-class communities constructed as rival ‘tribes’. In this context prospects for mobilizing a popular resistance movement did not seem promising. The J14 movement managed to emerge at a very opportune time, however, thanks to the coming of political age of an entire generation.</p>

<sec id="section4-0011392113479748">
<title>The political economic context: Neoliberal reforms and the absence of opposition</title>
<p>The direct background for the J14 window of opportunity starts with the parliamentary elections in 2003. Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister in 1996–1999, and towards 2003 he tried again to remove PM Sharon in internal Likud elections. Given the US invasion of Iraq and its pressure on Israel through the Quartet and the Road Map Plan, Netanyahu’s economic agenda remained marginal. However, after the elections Sharon nominated Netanyahu as Minister of Treasury and gave him all the support to implement radical neoliberal reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392113479748">Peled, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Netanyahu is the classical political leader dreamed of by neoliberal economists: he thinks in neoliberal terms and also identifies his personal political success with the implementation of the reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0011392113479748">14</xref></sup> Netanyahu’s quick implementation of his explicit agenda of privatization and deregulation provoked immediate social protests. This was made possible by the Palestinian acceptance of the Road Map and declaration of a unilateral ceasefire, which reduced the prominence of the ‘existential threat’ in Israeli discourse; in other words, it allowed the opening of political space. In the summer of 2003 a small foretaste of 2011 took place, with a single mother’s long march protesting against tax reforms and her subsequent encampment in front of the Ministry of Finance offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0011392113479748">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the most important confrontation was with the trade unions, who were being forced to invest most of their pension fund savings in the stock market instead of government bonds guaranteeing a stable interest. The tax and capital market reforms were the first significant moves, followed by the budget cuts due to the reduction in state income. The most important and significant opposition was led by the Histadrut and its chair Amir Peretz, who emerged as the most articulate and coherent leader opposing Netanyahu’s neoliberal policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0011392113479748">16</xref></sup> After the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005 and thanks to the expectations for a calm (warless) period, economic agendas occupied the center of Israeli public debate, and Amir Peretz was elected by the Labor Party as its prime ministerial candidate. Immediately afterwards, PM Sharon split from his own party, dissociating himself from both Netanyahu’s neoliberal policies and the Likud’s opposition to withdrawal from Gaza. Together with Shimon Peres, who had lost the internal elections to Peretz, they formed a center party (Kadima) with splinters from both Labor and Likud, promising a more moderate economic policy, criticizing Netanyahu’s economic policies as ‘piggish capitalism’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0011392113479748">17</xref></sup> and suggesting a new unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank based on the ‘no partner’ discourse.</p>
<p>The elections were mainly a vote of repudiation of the neoliberal policies combined with total neglect of the future relations with the Palestinians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2008a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0011392113479748">18</xref></sup> After the elections a center-left coalition led by Kadima was formed, and it succeeded in preventing Amir Peretz from being nominated as Minister of Finance. Peretz deeply disappointed his supporters because he accepted the nomination as Minister of Security, and was responsible together with Sharon’s successor, PM Ehud Olmert, for the Second Lebanon War, which both academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010b</xref>) and the governmental commission of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011392113479748">Winograd, 2008</xref>) deemed disastrous and unnecessary. The disenchantment with the center-left political parties that promised a more egalitarian economic policy but actually pursued Netanyahu’s policy, was rapidly ‘covered up’ by the renewed agenda of war and conflict, but nevertheless fueled the resistance movement of 2011. The oppression of socioeconomic agendas increased as the 2009 elections approached, when the Kadima–Labor government initiated a ruthless military action against the blockaded Gaza Strip (Operation Cast Lead).</p>
<p>The elections were held two months later, but almost no agenda was discussed: neither socioeconomic issues nor war and peace. A strong anti-Arab message was expressed by a party representing new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, demanding that ‘disloyal’ demonstrators – such as those who had protested against the attack on Gaza – be denied citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2010a</xref>). This party (Yisrael Beitenu, meaning ‘Israel is our home’) became the third strongest force in the Knesset, with 15 members, after Kadima (28) and Likud (27), with the Labor Party winning only 13. The resulting right-wing coalition excluded Kadima, but included the Labor Party now led by Ehud Barak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0011392113479748">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Netanyahu’s new government initiated a series of anti-democratic laws against human rights organizations, freedom of expression and a free press, and particularly against Israel’s Palestinian citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0011392113479748">20</xref></sup> A racist discourse became legitimate in the open public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479748">De Malach, 2009</xref>), and Netanyahu rolled out an ambitious economic plan to continue with tax reductions and budget cuts. For the first time the treasury’s bureaucratic elites found themselves opposing more neoliberal reforms, and these disputes were leaked to the media, which started to criticize Netanyahu’s economic plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0011392113479748">21</xref></sup> In the long run, it was this split among the elites which fueled the 2011 resistance movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0011392113479748">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite divisions among the economic elites, the main agenda remained the external ‘enemy’, and the differences in opinion between the Israeli and US governments over the need to promote negotiations with the Palestinians, the continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank, and the economic blockade of Gaza. Given their total mistrust of the new Israeli government, the Palestinian Authorities in the West Bank<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0011392113479748">23</xref></sup> decided to opt for a diplomatic initiative in the UN aiming to mobilize international support for Palestinian statehood.</p>
<p>The Palestinian initiative helped Netanyahu once more to cover up the socioeconomic unrest against his economic policies with a new external threat. Catastrophic forecasts of the danger involved in Palestinian statehood started to emerge, and the government began an international campaign against the Palestinian efforts to win international support at the UN discussion scheduled for September. Throughout almost the entire first half of 2011 the media were concerned with the threat of a Palestinian state, culminating on 24 May when Netanyahu spoke before the two Houses of the Congress for 40 minutes, winning 29 standing ovations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0011392113479748">24</xref></sup> The image was characterized, as a matter of fact, as Netanyahu defeating Obama in his own playground.</p>
<p>Despite the intensive media preoccupation with the so-called Palestinian threat, Israeli public opinion was apparently much more concerned with a material, realistic threat: the high prices of basic goods. A massive Facebook campaign against the price of cottage cheese mobilized almost half a million supporters for a consumer strike and succeeded in forcing state intervention (<italic>Haaretz</italic> [<italic>HA</italic>], 30 June 2011). Later on, the threat of a strike against the increase in fuel prices led to the reversal of a government decision. This was the atmosphere when Netanyahu returned from his triumphant speech in Congress, the climax of his anti-Palestinian campaign. But the climax turned out to be an anti-climax: nothing to report about the ‘enemy’ and the ‘threat’, waiting for the real ‘confrontation’ in September. It is my argument that some kind of awareness of the narrow window of opportunity influenced significant decisions of the J14 leaders: the initiative in July, the quick mobilization, the declaration of the One Million March on 3 September, and the immediate dismantling of the tent camps afterwards. This short-lived mo(ve)ment explains its ‘carnival’ features,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0011392113479748">25</xref></sup> and the erroneous expectation that the protest movement would return the next summer, based on the assumption that the success was due to the summer holiday. The Israeli mo(ve)ment in the summer of 2011 was framed by the Palestinian refusal to play the role of enemy before the September debate at the UN and Netanyahu’s tour de force in Congress in May, and not only by the summer holiday for school and university students.</p>

<title>J14’s imagined people</title>
<p>The story of J14’s inception is well known. Daphne Leef, a 25-year-old student, was evicted from her rented apartment because she refused to pay a higher price. She decided to move to a tent on the street, in protest against the rising cost of housing (30% over four years).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0011392113479748">26</xref></sup> She first called a small group of friends to join her and posted the event on Facebook, calling others to join her. Dozens of tents were erected on the very first day, in Tel Aviv’s trendy Rothschild Boulevard, and within days the boulevard was filled with tents. New encampments appeared every day in Tel Aviv and then all over Israel (<italic>HA</italic>, 19 July 2012). While the Rothschild Boulevard encampment and the leaders of the movement were characterized as middle-class students of European descent, other encampments in other parts of the city and in peripheral areas of Israel were more representative of the Israeli class structure, including homeless families. Several encampments were also organized by Arab citizens in their neighborhoods and towns,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0011392113479748">27</xref></sup> and one in downtown Tel Aviv was populated by migrant workers. No encampment was erected in the OPT by either Jewish settlers or Palestinians: the protest movement clearly demarcated the borders of the Israeli sovereign state, but its leaders avoided any reference to the military occupation, the erasure of state borders, housing subsidies for Jewish settlers or house demolitions targeting Palestinians.</p>
<p>At first there was an attempt to delegitimize the protestors as radical leftists due to their middle-class, secular background, and the encampment’s central, fashionable location and carnival atmosphere. This strategy was orchestrated mainly by the government, the pro-government newspaper <italic>Israel Hayom</italic>, and some other journalists, but it failed. The rapid joining of other social groups from the periphery, usually voters of the ‘right’, and the quick decision of non-partisan student associations to join the movement neutralized this attempt to delegitimize its leadership. Nevertheless, the tension and differences between the European (Ashkenazi) middle classes in the center and the peripheral ethno-classes were real and never disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392113479748">Bernstein, 2012</xref>). Many civil society organizations joined the movement, including the youth movement affiliated with the Histadrut trade union federation (Dror Israel), Koach Laovdim, the New Israel Fund, and also the medical interns who were in the middle of their strike. The rapid growth and expansion of the movement took the country by surprise: 10 days after the inception of J14, 20,000–40,000 were mobilized, the week after there were already 150,000, and a week later 300,000 (<italic>HA, Yedioth Aharonot</italic> [<italic>YA</italic>], <italic>Maariv</italic> [<italic>MA</italic>], 24 July, 31 July, 7 August 2011). Finally, in the One Million March, more than half a million protestors took to the streets in 12 cities (<italic>HA, YA, MA</italic>, 4 September 2011). There is no Israeli precedent for such massive and rapid mobilization on socioeconomic issues; the only comparable movement was the opposition to the First Lebanon War in the summer of 1982.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0011392113479748">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The movement expanded not only in numbers and geographical areas, but also in terms of the issues raised by the participants. Every group felt free to raise their own issue and join the movement, including questions of education, prices, salaries, women and minority rights, health, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392113479748">Schechter, 2012</xref>). The common denominator was inequality and discrimination within the 1967 borders; however Jewish settlers were welcome like any other citizen when they joined the protestors in Tel Aviv (<italic>HA</italic>, 12 August 2011). Anyone could set up their own tent in Rothschild Boulevard, not only homeless people, Arabs, and illegal migrants, but also racist activists. This apparently apolitical attitude created what Shenhav<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0011392113479748">29</xref></sup> called the ‘carnival’, the atmosphere that everyone can join, do, say, and wear whatever they want, in addition to the summer timeframe, that was bound to end when the students returned to school.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the timeframe was not, according to my interpretation, dictated by the academic calendar but by the Palestinian calendar: the students went back to school on 30 October, and the Rothschild encampment was dismantled on 7 September, a few days before the UN discussion of the Palestinian proposal. The apolitical and carnival image was obviously a crucial element of J14’s success, but not everyone can mobilize such carnival, so the question remains: why did so many join the movement?</p>
<p>I suggest that the political space for representation of socioeconomic issues in Israel is closed not only by the salience of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the manipulations of the external ‘threat’. The political space for discussions based on a shared, inclusive identity was also closed by the internal tensions and hostility between ethno-classes which are instigated by the institutionalized political actors and constructed as ‘tribal’ conflicts. No universal claim can be made within the framework of neoliberal economic policy, and only sectorial parties representing specific, privileged social groups are able to provide some benefits to their voters, like ultra-Orthodox, national-religious, and Russian migrant parties. These differential benefits only exacerbate the tribal hostility.</p>
<p>Against the background of a political discourse focused on tribal hostility (facilitated by a weakening of the external threat), the non-religious middle and lower classes had no representation or political space. They responded by going to the streets and avoiding the tribal hostility discourse, which would have rapidly prevented any mass mobilization. The inclusive discourse of the B Generation – we are ‘left’ and ‘right’, Jews and Arabs, center and periphery, Oriental and Ashkenazi Jews, religious and secular – reconstructed peoplehood in inclusive terms: we represent all citizens, we are ‘the people’. The inclusive discourse and agenda expansion gave birth to the movement’s most chanted slogan – ‘The people demand social justice’ – and to a sense of ‘togetherness’ in the streets and assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392113479748">Talshir, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The apolitical feature of the movement is obviously the attempt to represent all the people, with the inclusive construction of the borders and boundaries of the people acting as a precondition for democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479748">Linz and Stepan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392113479748">Mann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479748">Rustow, 1970</xref>). While the J14 movement succeeded for a short time in imagining and reconstructing a people inclusively and apolitically, it also added two very radical innovations crucial for democratizing the Israeli dual regime: (a) the borders were tacitly demarcated by the places where housing was demanded to the exclusion of the OPT; (b) the boundaries of the people were inclusive, claiming that ‘we are Jews and Arabs, all of us equal citizens’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0011392113479748">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The discourse of ‘togetherness’ and the willingness to discuss every idea upset many political activists. However it was, in my opinion, essential for mobilizing the people, opening political space to socioeconomic claims, and starting a movement for democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392113479748">Talshir, 2012</xref>). The catch of this strategy was that it is very difficult to continue such a movement without taking any clear democratic stand in order to prevent the future closure of political space. This is why the dismantling of the camp ended the mo(ve)ment. At the moment the ‘people’ didn’t meet each other in the occupied public space, each community returned to its original isolation and was subjected to the pre-J14 manipulations of mutual hostility. This isolation between the ethno-classes facilitates the work of the political actors who started the counter-mo(ve)ment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392113479748">
<title>The counter-mo(ve)ment</title>
<p>Movements of resistance emerge when certain social groups lack political space and go to the public sphere to demonstrate their presence, seeking recognition and representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479748">Grinberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479748">Grinberg, forthcoming</xref>). The lack of recognition by dominant groups is an act of symbolic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392113479748">Bourdieu, 1992</xref>); hence, resistance to them is physical and requires collective presence in the public sphere. However, all movements have a moment framed in time, which starts when political conditions open an opportunity at the very moment dominant actors fail to close a political space. When this mo(ve)ment ends, institutionalized political actors, both in government and opposition, initiate their counter-movement. Their attempt is to prevent the movement from giving birth to autonomous political power and new political actors, because in that case the old political actors might lose power. The techniques of the old political actors are varied, from cooptation of leaders to channeling anger and fear, tribal hostility, and polarization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0011392113479748">31</xref></sup> This entire repertoire is designed to close political space to new autonomous actors representing underrepresented groups. However, the old actors cannot ignore the resistance movement, and in this sense it always has some impact and effect, even when the effect is the complete reversal of the original intentions and demands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0011392113479748">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The counter-mo(ve)ment in Israel was immediate and even expected in advance. It went into gear in the UN in September, when the Israeli government succeeded in preventing a UN resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, and continued with the escalation of hostilities in and around the Gaza Strip (<italic>HA, YA</italic>, 31 October 2011). The most striking evidence that the leaders and activists of J14 were aware of the danger of the counter-movement’s use of violent escalation was during their last attempt to keep the masses on the streets, after the UN General Assembly. Symbolically, this demonstration took place in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square, where PM Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995, and was attended by more than 50,000 demonstrators, an impressive number given the fact that the event took place during the mutual bombings in the south (<italic>HA</italic>, 30 October 2011). The central drama was a sketch performed by five famous actors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0011392113479748">33</xref></sup> which directly referred to the danger that a belligerent counter-movement might kill the movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0011392113479748">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Immediately after the ‘Palestinian threat’ vanished, Netanyahu started manipulating the Iranian nuclear threat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0011392113479748">35</xref></sup> This more durable and sustainable threat, however, proved unable to keep the socioeconomic agenda ‘covered up’ for the entire year. New issues, dangers, and divisions had to be constantly introduced by the political actors supporting the government. The first wave was the passage of anti-democratic and anti-Palestinian legislation: almost all supporters of J14 in the summer were attacked by some special legislation, including civil rights organizations, the media, courts, and mainly the Palestinian citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0011392113479748">36</xref></sup> In addition, a new ‘threat’ was ‘discovered’ in the form of refugees and asylum seekers from Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, and other conflict areas in Africa who entered the country through open borders in Sinai and requested legal protection. A racist demonstration against the refugees in an inner city area in Tel Aviv where the refugees are concentrated created ethno-class tensions among the J14 activists (<italic>HA</italic>, 23 May 2012).</p>
<p>The first attempts to reorganize protests towards the summer of 2012 were rapidly and violently repressed (<italic>HA</italic>, 3 June 2012). However, while the repression and the counter-mo(ve)ment of extreme right-wing political parties was obviously expected, the less expected sabotage of J14 came from central and leftist parties, also indirectly criticized by the mo(ve)ment of resistance. These parties prevented the reappearance of the movement by their attempt to ‘help’; namely, channel the movement’s demonstrations to support their own sectorial positions and to coopt their leaders and activists. The center-left channeling of the movement caused the demobilization of the masses: while the majority of the J14 protestors were activists and supporters of center and leftist parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392113479748">Rozenhek and Shalev, 2013</xref>), in 2011 they recognized the value of an apolitical image and didn’t impose their parties’ signs, colors, and flags. In 2012 this attitude changed, provoking tensions with the activists who sought to continue the inclusive discourse of 2011, and deteriorating into violence between activists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0011392113479748">37</xref></sup> The sense of ‘togetherness’ was gone, and in 2012 each group regained its separate identity, the carnival never began, and different activist groups demonstrated separately, unable to join forces and to mobilize the second ring of supporters.</p>
<p>A particularly blatant attempt to channel the protest movement was initiated by the center parties, Kadima and a new party called Yesh Atid. They shifted the claim for equality of rights towards equality of obligations, fanning the old hostility against the ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab citizens who do not serve in the military. They took the images and discourse of the 2011 protest, coopted some of the leaders, and organized demonstrations, taking up the place and time planned by the J14 movement to renew the carnival. The expectations of both activists and media for a new hot carnivalistic summer in 2012 were very high, and the failure to unite the movement led many to despair. One veteran disability rights activist, Moshe Silman, died of self-immolation in the middle of one such demonstration, sacrificing his life in the hope it would help unify the movement. It didn’t happen. The splintered demonstrations continued and led to violence between the activists. The ‘equal [military] service camp’ was supported by the National Student Federation and Dror Israel, two key mobilizers of the 2011 movement. This camp’s tribal attack against the poorest populations of the country (ultra-Orthodox Jews and Palestinian citizens) – by the more wealthy middle class – failed to mobilize the masses and rapidly vanished. The most salient phenomenon in the summer of 2012 was the constant attempt to mobilize the masses again, and the constant failure, despite the fact that several thousands of activists took to the streets almost every week. Even the reversal of some economic policies, such as new taxes on the middle and lower classes, didn’t provoke any significant mobilization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The J14 movement of resistance was an unprecedented, albeit short-lived movement: the window of opportunity opened after Netanyahu’s speech in the Congress, and closed when the UN General Assembly started discussing Palestinian statehood. The movement was initiated, organized, and supported mainly by the B Generation, which emerged in 1998 with the first national students’ strike, in the wake of the first Netanyahu administration’s neoliberal reforms (1996–1999), which had expanded and deepened since 2003. This generation developed a new strategy to oppose the disintegration of society and the weakening of middle and lower classes through an inclusive discourse of the ‘people’, mobilizing a very pluralist public with a very apolitical image. This image was essential for the initial success of the movement, but became its most significant obstacle later on, as it was subsequently exploited by all institutionalized parties to prevent the return of the masses to the streets.</p>

<p>In 1998 Netanyahu effectively manipulated the media, bringing pizzas to the negotiators when some of them were supposed to be on hunger strike, making it appear as though the hunger strike were a fiction. In 2011 he tried to split the J14 by a very attractive package of benefits for the students, hoping that the National Student Federation would accept it and abandon the movement. The rejection of the offer was crucial for the further success of J14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392113479748">Smoli, 2012</xref>).</p>
