<abstract>
<p>This study analyzes differences on two value dimensions, conservation and self-enhancement, at both the individual and regional level across Europe. Within-country regions represent “cultunits” that often have belonged to different nation-states in history. Eight antecedent variables are explored. At the regional level, the variables include historical sociopolitical context, recent sociopolitical context, regional affluence, and main religion of the region; at the individual level, they feature religiousness, education, gender, and age cohort. The largest effects for region are associated with Gross Domestic Product, including differences between former Communist and non-Communist regions. Hardly any effects pertain to more distant history. At the individual level, there are substantial differences across age cohorts and effects of education, religiosity, and gender. Interactions between region- and individual-level conditions suggest people’s values are shaped in their youth; the largest differences mark cohorts in Central and Western Europe who were raised during the Cold War.</p>

<p>Research into culture and values tends to use current nation-states as units of analysis, even if they are not culturally homogeneous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022022111429719">Van Rosmalen, Van Herk, &amp; Groenen, 2010</xref>). Most measures also pertain to the present, even though explanations of value differences often refer to deeply historically rooted cultural factors. We take a different tact and report on multilevel analyses of value scores, with individuals and regions as levels, using representative samples from the European Social Survey, which spans 195 regions throughout Europe. These regions reflect entities with a historical basis, often with borders that represent divisions from the past within contemporary countries or nation-states. Some regions have been part of their current sociopolitical entity for several centuries, whereas others were independent or belonged to other countries previously. With this study, we aim to broaden the range of antecedents of cultural values. Although the design is exploratory, we preselect variables and explicitly seek to address confounds for some effects, especially effects of distant and proximal historical context.</p>

<title>Values</title>
<p>Values tend to be conceptualized as psychological dispositions or socially constructed meanings, acquired in the process of socialization and enculturation and passed from generation to generation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111429719">Hofstede (1980)</xref> refers to a value as “a broad tendency to prefer certain states of affairs over others” (p. 19). Well-known contributions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111429719">Hofstede (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart (1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111429719">Schwartz (e.g., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111429719">2006</xref>) describe dimensions of cross-cultural differences in values. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede (2001)</xref> suggests five culture-level dimensions: individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and Confucian dynamism or long- versus short-term orientation. Inglehart considers two dimensions: traditional versus secular-rational orientations and survival versus self-expression. Schwartz’s research identifies 10 value types that he organizes into two individual-level dimensions, usually labeled conservation versus openness to change and self-enhancement versus self-transcendence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111429719">Fontaine, Poortinga, Delbeke, &amp; Schwartz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111429719">Steenkamp, ter Hofstede, &amp; Wedel, 1999</xref>). This study is based on these two dimensions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022111429719">Schwartz (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111429719">2006</xref>) has argued for three dimensions at the level of cultures, but recent evidence suggests that factors at the individual level and the culture level tend towards isomorphism across levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022111429719">Fischer &amp; Poortinga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111429719">Fischer, Vauclair, Fontaine, &amp; Schwartz, 2010</xref>). This suggests that a two-dimensional representation of the values domain is adequate at both levels.</p>
<p>Empirical cross-cultural research into value dimensions consists mainly of self-reported data, with samples of individual respondents nested in countries. By aggregating the individual scores in a sample, a country mean is obtained for each item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022111429719">Smith, 2011</xref>). Factors or clusters of values are derived through multivariate analyses, and these are labeled as value dimensions. Such dimensions are presented in the literature as pervasive and broad, and differences across countries on the dimensions are seen as bearing on many aspects of people’s psychological functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022111429719">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111429719">Schwartz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A striking feature is that most literature regards value differences as rooted in the histories of countries, such that continuities can be traced across centuries and even millennia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111429719">Kagitçibasi (1997)</xref>, in reviewing arguments about early indications of individualism in Western countries, mentions philosophers such as Descartes and Hobbes and persistent themes in family interactions, marriage, and residence patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede (2001)</xref> states that differences in power distance between Catholic and Protestant European countries have to do with the fact that the former countries once belonged to the Roman Empire. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022111429719">Hofstede and Hofstede (2005)</xref>, “the cultural diversity among our ancestors has been inherited by the present generation” (p. 16) (these ancestors include Assyrians, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede (2001)</xref> explains differences between the Latin and the Northern European countries by the former countries belonging to the Roman Empire, whereas the latter did not. Differences in power distance between the Netherlands and France are explained using the contrast between the hierarchical system in the French “Ancienne Regime” more than 300 years ago and the more egalitarian Dutch fight for independence from the Spanish oppression in about the same period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022111429719">Bendix (1974)</xref> explains the different reactions to Communism in Central Europe and in Russia to Czarism in Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, historical data do not lend themselves to replication; authors refer to events and relationships that seem to support their opinions, but it remains unclear whether or not there are better alternative explanations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most cross-cultural studies on values take countries as units of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022111429719">Schwartz, 2006</xref>), which is obviously a debatable practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111429719">Berry, Poortinga, Breugelmans, Chasiotis, and Sam (2011)</xref> recommend that the unit of selection, called “culture bearing unit” or “cultunit” by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022111429719">Naroll, 1970</xref>), should be determined by the group level at which a postulated explanatory variable operates. Countries are not homogeneous; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022111429719">Vandello and Cohen (1999)</xref> find varying levels of collectivism in different regions of the United States. Insofar as cross-cultural differences refer to a more distant past, rather than to recent or present circumstances, regions in Europe which in history did not belong to the same political entity as they do today should be better cultunits than countries. An extreme example is Silesia, now in South Poland, which was part of Germany in 1900, Prussia in 1800, and the Habsburg Empire in 1700.</p>
<p>Europe likely experienced a significant shift in values due to a salient episode in recent history, the Second World War. Yet it is difficult to differentiate between regions for this influence, considering that virtually the entire continent was affected. A clearer distinction exists between regions that experienced Communist regimes until 20 years ago and those that did not. Moreover, the transition from Communist to non-Communist forms of government also occurred in a distinct, short period of time. Effects on values of Communism, including work-related values, have been mentioned in the literature, especially for former East and West Germany (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022111429719">Adler &amp; Brayfield, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022111429719">Borg &amp; Braun, 1996</xref>). A study of 13 Eastern and 9 Western European countries by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022111429719">Schwartz and Bardi (1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022111429719">Bardi &amp; Schwartz, 1996</xref>) reveals differences in various value types, which they interpret as adaptations to Communist rule.</p>

<title>Region-Level Antecedents</title>
<p>In our reading of the literature, most empirical correlates come from four domains: (i) affluence (including GNP, GDP, HDI, and so forth at the region level) and affluence-dependent measures (notably education), (ii) political organization, (iii), religion, and (iv) personality (especially the Big Five dimensions), for which there are no data at the region level in Europe. The choice of the region-level antecedents is guided by research in sociology and economics on country-level antecedents of values. We specifically consider economic development, major religions in a society, and sociopolitical history.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the (political) history of a country is widely considered important to explain current values. In addition to history, we consider two other prominent antecedents of values: economic development and the religious heritage of a society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart (1997)</xref> in his writing on modernization and post-modernization states that economic development has systematic cultural consequences. When societies develop economically, traditional values become less important and are replaced by values that are more rational and open. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart and Baker’s (2000)</xref> scarcity hypothesis and his socialization hypothesis both emphasize the importance of wealth: In countries with a higher level of economic development, people consider post-modern values more important. Many relationships have been found between GDP per capita and other characteristics such as quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111429719">Easterly, 1999</xref>), social well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022111429719">Diener, Diener, &amp; Diener, 1995</xref>), and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022111429719">Van Hemert, Van de Vijver, Poortinga, &amp; Georgas, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Religion is taken as the third antecedent. Cross-national differences in religion explain differences in economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111429719">Barro &amp; McCleary, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022111429719">McCleary &amp; Barro, 2006</xref>) and consequently (directly or indirectly) values; religion affects how people think about individual freedom, coping with uncertainty and gender roles. For example, in secular nations, people generally hold more feminine values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022111429719">Verweij, Ester, &amp; Nauta, 1997</xref>). The religious heritage of a society may attenuate the shift towards openness; when religious traditions are still powerful, more traditional values may persist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022111429719">Huntington, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>We limit ourselves to the three macrolevel antecedents of values mentioned. Other antecedents could also have been included, such as for example human development. However, indices of human development are closely related to economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022111429719">Easterly, 1999</xref>). When wealth increases, elements of human development such as (women) schooling and health care also improve and similar shifts in values are to be expected.</p>
<p>For the first antecedent, history, we examine three variables, two of which pertain to long-term historical influences: whether a region belonged to the Roman Empire and whether a region in 1800 was part of the political entity to which it currently belongs. The former variable reflects a major division between the south and north of Europe that extended for several centuries, whereas the latter refers to changes in boundaries more recently. Some present-day nation-states have existed for centuries as more or less homogeneous societies, in terms of their political organization, language, and religion. An example is France, whose regions mainly have remained part of this single country with a central administration since late medieval times. However, other states, such as Germany, have shorter national histories and include regions that historically had their own economies, rulers, urban centers, influential thinkers and artists, and even dominant religion. For our third sociopolitical history variable, we consider more recent history, namely whether or not a region belonged to a Communist state.</p>
<p>The current context in a region includes its current level of economic development or affluence. Wealth (GDP per capita) is by far the most important correlate of national differences in value scores (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022111429719">Arrindell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111429719">Kagitcibasi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022111429719">Van Hemert et al., 2002</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022111429719">Hofstede (1980)</xref> finds that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlates with individualism at <italic>r</italic> = .82. The GDP per capita, and similar economic indices, refer primarily to present levels of economic affluence. A recent update of Hofstede’s cultural value indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022111429719">Tang &amp; Koveos, 2008</xref>) confirms the association of GDP with values; countries with an average to large GDP per capita indicate greater individualism. In Europe, economic conditions have improved in recent decades, which is likely to have led to an increased emphasis on openness.</p>
<p>The final factors that we consider at the regional level are religious orientation and religious pluralism. For Europe, the main distinction is Roman Catholicism versus Protestantism, with the Eastern Orthodox Church as a third category. A fourth religious tradition is Islam, which is expanding rapidly in several European countries, though it has a comparatively short tradition—with the specific exceptions of Turkey, some Balkan countries, and Spain in medieval times. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart (1997)</xref>, a shift toward a secular orientation and self-expression values follows from growing economic resources, though there appears to be persistence in religious (e.g., Protestant vs. Catholic) traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022022111429719">Welzel, Inglehart, &amp; Klingemann, 2003</xref>). The growth of affluence and the political changes referred to by Inglehart are rather recent, suggesting an explanation of value differences in terms of recent history, whereas religious orientations span centuries.</p>
<p>Most cross-cultural analyses label countries on the basis of their dominant religion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022111429719">Georgas, Van de Vijver, &amp; Berry, 2004</xref>), but we also take into account the extent to which variation in religions is found within a region. Religious pluralism is distinct from religion as such and may affect religious participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022111429719">Barro &amp; McCleary, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022022111429719">Welzel et al., 2003</xref>), and in this way influence individual values. For example, according to Barro and McCleary, in pluralistic regions people attending religious services are more inclined toward conservative values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022022111429719">
<title>Individual-Level Antecedents</title>
<p>At the individual level, we examine effects of age, gender, formal education, and religiousness. For age, we trace the effects of short-term historical events with comparisons among age cohorts. We make a distinction between “the past,” which in cultural terms can be said to refer to the time before a person was born, and “the present,” or one’s own lifetime. Historical continuity would imply that younger and older people in a region hold similar values, whereas a strong influence of the present context suggests that changes in conditions during people’s lifetimes, especially economic conditions, should lead to substantial value differences across age cohorts. Prior research indicates shifts in values both between age cohorts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022111429719">Boehnke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022111429719">Egri &amp; Ralston, 2004</xref>) and during a person’s lifetime, especially after life-changing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111429719">Bardi, Lee, Hofmann-Towfigh, &amp; Soutar, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart’s (1997)</xref> socializing hypothesis proposes that adults’ values reflect the socioeconomic and political conditions in their childhood and adolescence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart and Baker (2000)</xref> argue for a shift toward secularization in Western countries. Cohorts growing up during a period of physical insecurity or socioeconomic distress learn survival values; those who come of age in times of prosperity and growing affluence likely prefer postmodernist values (e.g., independent decision making, egalitarianism). In Schwartz’s terminology, this distinction implies that growing up in insecure times should enhance conservation values over openness to change and prioritize self-enhancement over self-transcendence.</p>
<p>The presence of Communism offers opportunities to study some such changes. In the data set we use, some respondents grew up before Communist regimes took hold of most of Central and Eastern Europe; some grew up during these regimes; and youngsters who came of age mostly after 1990 never experienced them. In the Communist regions, income was lower, the political ideology rejected religion, and regimes were more authoritarian than in Western Europe, at least until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. With our data at both individual and regional levels for various age cohorts, we can trace the interactions between age and sociopolitical conditions.</p>
<p>Religiousness is another individual-level variable that reflects the degree of observance of religious rites and practices mandated by a religious denomination, and for which correlations have been found with various value items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022111429719">Saroglou, Delpierre, &amp; Dernelle, 2004</xref>). In most Western samples, more religious individuals tend towards more conservative values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022111429719">Cukur, De Guzman, &amp; Carlo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Huismans, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyze the possible effects of average education as an individual-level variable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111429719">Schwartz and Rubel (2005)</xref> report that education can explain differences in the importance of self-direction and tradition, such that more educated people tend to be more open and less traditional.</p>
<p>Finally, we include gender, because prior research reveals that women tend to emphasize self-transcendence values more than men. Men favor openness more than women; however, men and women differ minimally in their conservation values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Rubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Rubel-Lifschitz, 2009</xref>). As in the case of age, we also anticipate interactions between the regional and the individual level for gender. In former Communist regions, gender equality was a proclaimed ideal, though the system of equality was authority based, rather than rooted in people’s minds. The transition to capitalism in the 1990s largely eroded the legacy of gender equality, leading to shifting gender gaps in former Communist states after 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022111429719">LaFont, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022022111429719">
<title>Confounding</title>
<p>Affluence in a society may not be only an antecedent of current values, but also could result from developmental processes with historical roots, including psychological factors that enable such processes. Thus a correlation of a value dimension with GDP may point to a causal link from financial wealth to value dimensions but also to a reverse direction of influence. A similar confounding could mark the relation between wealth and religion. Confounding also might be expected for other combinations of antecedents, which has serious consequences for any analysis. The value differences between regions thus cannot be attributed at face value to a presumed antecedent; we must correct for possible confounding variables.</p>
<p>To summarize, this study includes various presumed antecedents of cultural values at both the individual and the context level. At the context level, we investigate affluence, religion, and proximal and distal historical antecedents. At the individual level, we test expected effects on values of education, gender, religiousness, and age. We also examine cross-level interactions to gain a better understanding of the effect of historical and sociopolitical context on age cohorts.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022022111429719">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We used data from the 2004 European Social Survey (ESS). The original sample consisted of 49,059 respondents from 26 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Turkey, and Ukraine). The ESS gathered a representative sample in each country, with response rates averaging 61.6% (minimum 43.6% in France, maximum 73.7% in Poland).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022022111429719">
<title>Individual and Regional Information</title>
<p>For each respondent, the demographic information included gender (1 = female; 0 = male), number of years of full-time education, year of birth, religious affiliation, and religiousness (i.e., “How religious are you?” correlated highly with church attendance, <italic>r</italic> = .61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The ESS defined regions within countries at the NUTS level; the NUTS regions in Europe form the basis for applying regional policies, and their formation took historical circumstances into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022111429719">Eurostat, 2007</xref>). For countries not present in the Eurostat database, we used the region classification by the statistical agencies in the relevant countries (Ukraine and Turkey); these regions also are distinguishable in terms of cultural, socioeconomic, and historical characteristics. The 2004 ESS data set distinguished 225 regions at the NUTS level. To ensure stable estimates, regions with fewer than 60 respondents were excluded from the sample, so our final study sample included 40,144 individuals nested in 195 regions.</p>
<p>For each region, we added information on history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022111429719">Euratlas–Nüssli, 2010</xref>), including whether the region was part of the Roman Empire, belonged in 1800 to the same country as at present,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022022111429719">1</xref></sup> and belonged to the Communist Bloc before 1989 (for all three variables 1 = characteristic present; 0 = not present); wealth (i.e., GDP/capita per region in 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022111429719">Eurostat, 2008</xref>); and main religion and religious pluralism (from both country statistics and aggregated data using the ESS data set), The main religions are Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, and Islam; in 74 regions the majority considers itself nonreligious. To enhance comparability between all region-level variables, we recoded GDP per capita using a mean split<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022022111429719">2</xref></sup> at a GDP of 19,000 Euro (1 = high GDP; 0 = low GDP). This split distinguished regions within countries, such as wealthier Northern Italy versus poorer Southern Italy. Moreover, in countries such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain, the regions in which the capital or other major cities are located fall in the high-GDP category, whereas the other regions do not.</p>

<sec id="section8-0022022111429719">
<title>Values Questionnaire</title>
<p>As a measure of values, we used the Schwartz value items from the European Social Survey, which represent a modification of the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022111429719">Schwartz, Melech, Lehmann, Burgess, Harris, &amp; Owens, 2001</xref>). Each item describes an individual, and respondents indicate on a 6-point rating scale the extent to which this person is like them (1 = “very much like me” and 6 = “not like me at all”; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022111429719">Jowell, Roberts, Fitzgerald, &amp; Eva, 2007</xref>). As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022111429719">Schwartz (2007)</xref>, before calculating the domain scores, we centered the 21 values in the PVQ within subjects to avoid possible biasing effects of prominent response styles, such as acquiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022111429719">Van Herk, Poortinga, &amp; Verhallen, 2004</xref>). The items are ordered into 10 value types that can be described in two dimensions. We use openness to change versus conservation and self-enhancement versus self-transcendence, dimensions that have been reported commonly in prior literature. These two dimensions, resultant conservation and resultant self-enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111429719">Steenkamp et al., 1999</xref>), both have an 11-point scale ranging from −5 to 5 (for details on the calculation, in which centering is followed by subtraction of the opposing values, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022111429719">Steenkamp et al., 1999</xref>, p. 62). We refer to these dimensions, which are somewhat correlated in our data set (<italic>r</italic> = .23), as the conservation and the self-enhancement dimension, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022022111429719">
<title>Age Cohorts</title>
<p>To study differences between respondents at various ages, we recoded the year of birth into five approximately equally sized age cohorts; the medians for each group were 1930 (born between 1904 and 1940), 1947 (1941–1953), 1959 (1954–1964), 1970 (1965–1976), and 1983 (born after 1976). These cohorts can be related to historical changes in Europe: The oldest cohort was born and raised before World War II; the 1947, 1959, and 1970 cohorts were born and raised during the Cold War period; and the youngest cohort grew up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We coded the cohorts with dummy variables and used the oldest generation as the reference group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022022111429719">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We estimated the models using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM 6.08; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022111429719">Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, &amp; Congdon, 2004</xref>) with 195 observations at the region level (Level 2), and 40,144 observations at the individual level (Level 1). HLM was developed specifically to deal with multilevel data in which observations (individuals) are nested within higher levels (regions). In the multilevel model, the coefficients of the individual-level effects may be treated as random effects, partially explained by region characteristics. This allows analysis of interaction effects of individual- and region-level variables. In the analyses, we used group mean centering for the individual-level data and grand mean centering for the region-level data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022111429719">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999</xref>). The data set included 195 European regions, each with at least 60 respondents. In multilevel analysis, the number of cases should be no fewer than 20 for the highest level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022111429719">Selig, Card, &amp; Little, 2008</xref>), though some authors recommend no fewer than 50 cases for dimensions that explain a small percentage of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111429719">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis satisfies all such conditions. In the ESS data, approximately two-thirds of the total variance at the region level can be accounted for by country, leaving approximately one-third of the variance as region-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022111429719">Van Herk &amp; Poortinga, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022022111429719">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>To disentangle possible confounds, we created dummy variables that contrasted low and high scoring regions for GDP and Communism, resulting in three combinations: (1) regions with low GDP that were formerly Communist, (2) low-GDP and not formerly Communist regions, and (3) high-GDP and not formerly Communist regions. The fourth category, high GDP and former Communism, featured only one region (Berlin); we excluded this region from the analysis. The third category served as the reference category for our analysis. We created similar contrasts for the combination of wealth and having been part of the Roman Empire and for the combination of Roman Empire membership and former Communism. An interesting further confound could emerge between religion and GDP. When we considered the separate religious contrasts, we found that in combination they explained more variance than GDP (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111429719">Table 1</xref>); however, the number of dummies required (for each major religion) made this complicated analysis infeasible. When coded as dichotomies (e.g., Protestant versus non-Protestant), GDP could hardly be separated from religion for some combinations; many Protestant regions were high on GDP, Orthodox regions were low, and only Catholic regions showed variation in GDP.</p>

<title>Region-Level Characteristics</title>
<p>We focus first on contextual antecedents of values and summarize in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111429719">Table 1</xref> the extent to which the separate region characteristics explain differences across the two value dimensions. Each region characteristic is entered separately to show the effect it has on individual values if no other antecedent is taken into account. We note that GDP per capita explains the most variance for the conservation dimension (41%; Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 95.70, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), followed by religious pluralism (29%), recent history (i.e., part of the Communist Bloc, 14%,), belonging to the current nation-state in 1800 (14%), and belonging to the Roman Empire (6%). The latter effect is still highly significant (Δχ<sup>2</sup>= 11.66, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Conservation is associated negatively with high GDP per capita and with religious pluralism. The historical variables are pointing to less conservative values in non-former-Communist regions and in regions that belonged to the Roman Empire. For the self-enhancement dimension, we observe a very similar pattern (see the right side of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111429719">Table 1</xref>), with 32% of the explained variance attributable to GDP (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 71.22, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), 21% to religious pluralism, and 8%, 3%, and nearly 0% for the respective indices of recent, less recent, and distant history. GDP per capita negatively affects self-enhancement.</p>
<p>When we enter the four effects of Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Islam religion simultaneously, their joint effect explains most variance for both dimensions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111429719">Table 1</xref>, bottom). Together the various religions account for 50% of the variance at the region level for conservation (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 118.11, <italic>df</italic> = 4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and 34% for self-enhancement. The reference category (nonreligious) and the Protestant regions tend to be less conservative and to lean less toward self-enhancement. Overall the antecedents explain less variance in the self-enhancement dimension than in the conservation dimension, which probably reflects the smaller variance for self-enhancement compared with conservation and an associated relatively larger error component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022111429719">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022111429719">Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Identifying Confounds at the Region Level</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111429719">Table 2</xref>, we show that, for example, GDP relates to Communism (<italic>r</italic> = −.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and to a lesser extent to being part of the Roman Empire (<italic>r</italic> = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Most regions in Western Europe have a high GDP; regions in Southern Europe that belonged to the Roman Empire have a lower GDP. Former Communist regions are less wealthy than Western European regions. This confounding of GDP and indices of history may result in an over- or underestimation of effects when we analyze all variables simultaneously, as well as an overestimation if we analyze them separately.</p>

<p>To disentangle possible confounds of wealth and history, we created dummy variables to contrast low and high scoring regions. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref> (upper part) show that conservation is affected by low GDP in both former Communist regions (γ = .405, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and those that were not Communist (γ = .475, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These two coefficients are fairly similar and differ substantially from the reference category (high GDP, non-Communist), indicating that GDP explains the differences, rather than former Communism. For self-enhancement, the low-GDP, former Communist, and low-GDP, former non-Communist regions (γ = .350, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and γ = .542, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively) also differ notably from the high-GDP, non-Communist regions that were taken as a reference category. High-GDP regions are less conservative.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref>, we summarize corresponding analyses with dummy variables for belonging to the Roman Empire and having been part of the present country for more than 200 years. The former shows for conservation: γ = .318, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for low-GDP, Roman Empire regions, and γ = .503, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for low-GDP, non-Roman Empire regions, while with high GDP, both γ entries are not different from zero. Since similar results are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref> for self-enhancement, Roman Empire turns out to be a variable that does not add to the variance explained by GDP. Similarly, the entries in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref> for the same GDP (high or low) are much more similar than are entries for the categorization of whether the region belonged to the current country around 1800. In summary, little additional variance is explained by the context of either Roman times or the administrative status of the region a few centuries ago. By far the most important antecedent is current GDP per capita.</p>
<p>For one further analysis of confounding effects, we examined GDP and the various religions. In the lower part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref> we present findings for religions, contrasting regions with low and high GDP, where possible. All predominantly Islamic and Orthodox regions were in the low-GDP category and all Protestant regions in the high-GDP category. Only Roman Catholic regions were found to be either low or high on GDP. Thus, the table includes the categories low GDP–Catholic, high GDP–Catholic, Islam (with low GDP), and Orthodox (with low GDP); Protestant (with high GDP) was used as the reference category. Results show that independent of religion the low-GDP regions are more conservative (i.e., γ = .807, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for low-GDP Eastern Orthodox, γ = .505, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for low-GDP Roman Catholic; high-GDP Roman Catholic regions are somewhat less conservative, γ = .232, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Similar results are found for self-enhancement.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we can only check for the effect of Catholicism, for which there are high and low-GDP regions. GDP per capita is an important antecedent in the case of both the conservation and the self-enhancement dimension, showing a similar trend as for the other blocks of variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref>. Current GDP per capita turns out to be a more important antecedent than religion. However, religion clearly adds to the effect of GDP per capita: for both conservation and self-enhancement, about 15% more variance is explained at the region level when religion is considered in addition to GDP per capita.</p>

<title>Individual Characteristics</title>
<p>In the upper part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111429719">Table 4</xref>, we provide the individual-level coefficients for the conservation and self-enhancement dimensions. As expected, religiousness relates positively to conservation (γ<sub>70</sub> = .060, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); respondents who report that they follow the rites of their religious denomination hold more conservative values in all regions, irrespective of the dominant religion. We also find a negative effect on self-enhancement (γ<sub>70</sub> = −.022, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); religiousness is associated with higher self-transcendence values at the individual level. Education (γ<sub>20</sub> = −.050, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) has a significant effect only on the conservation dimension. This effect is substantial; the average of 11 years of education in the sample leads to an approximately 0.5-point lower conservation score (11-point scale). The entries for gender show that women hold more conservative values than men (γ<sub>10</sub> = .184, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas on self-enhancement, men score appreciably higher (γ<sub>10</sub> = −.372, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>For the purposes of this study, with its emphasis on historical antecedents of values, the findings on differences between age cohorts are of interest. Taking the cohort born around 1930 (which grew up during the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II) as a reference, the results for conservation show a negative trend, such that the youngest cohort (born around 1983 and coming of age after the collapse of the Soviet Union) is least conservative (γ<sub>60</sub> = −1.267, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For self-enhancement, we find an opposite trend, and younger cohorts have higher scores on this dimension, mostly for the generation born around 1983 (γ<sub>60</sub> = .689, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The difference in the mean score on the conservation dimension between the youngest and oldest cohorts was −3.81 (<italic>t</italic> = −85.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas for self-enhancement, it was 1.55 (<italic>t</italic> = 46.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In comparison, the mean differences for people in low and high-GDP regions were 1.13 (<italic>t</italic> = 36.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for conservation and .77 (<italic>t</italic> = 34.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for self-enhancement. The different economic and sociopolitical conditions that mark people’s youth appear to explain notable differences in values between the cohorts; we continue to explore this possibility in the next section.</p>

<title>Cross-Level Interactions: Sociopolitical Context and Cohorts</title>
<p>By comparing differences in values across cohorts for individuals living in former Communist and non-Communist regions, we can examine whether Communism affected age cohorts differently than Western political environments did. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111429719">Table 4</xref> shows (also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022111429719">Table 3</xref>), regions that combine low GDP and former Communism reveal a positive main effect on conservation (γ<sub>01</sub> = .405, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and self-enhancement (γ<sub>01</sub> = .350, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The interactions between levels in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111429719">Table 4</xref> show that Communism increases the importance of conservation values for the intermediate cohorts of 1947 (γ<sub>31</sub> = .151, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and 1959 (γ<sub>41</sub> = .112, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but this trend is not observed for the 1970 cohort (γ<sub>51</sub> = −.007, <italic>ns</italic>). Conservation even seems to reverse for the youngest (1983) cohort (γ<sub>61</sub> = −.100, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), such that it appears more similar to the parallel cohort in more wealthy regions of Europe. All cohorts in the low-GDP, non-Communist regions are more conservative than the same cohorts in wealthy regions and in the former Communist regions. For self-enhancement, the interaction effects are smaller. Communism hardly seems to have affected the cohorts; the 1959 cohort has a slightly higher score, but hardly significant compared with the same cohort in wealthy regions (γ<sub>41</sub> = .099, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). The cohorts in low-GDP, non-Communist regions (in Southern Europe) differ from the cohorts in the wealthy regions. Substantial positive interactions are found for the cohorts in low-GDP, non-Communist regions for conservation and negative interactions for self-enhancement.</p>
<p>We illustrate cohort-based shifts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111429719">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111429719">2</xref> for the three categories of regions (low GDP and (formerly) Communist, low GDP and non-Communist, high GDP) with the scores for the 1930 cohort set to be equal. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111429719">Figure 1</xref>, we note less conservation for each successive cohort. Moreover, the youngest cohorts in wealthy Western and former Communist regions have become more similar to each other, whereas the difference between the low-GDP, former Communist and other low-GDP regions increases. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111429719">Figure 2</xref>, we show that the cohorts in former Communist regions follow a trend similar to those in the high-GDP regions of Europe: The youngest cohort considers self-enhancement far more important than the oldest. In the low-GDP, non-Communist regions the difference between the oldest and youngest cohorts is notably smaller.</p>

<p>Regarding gender, women are more conservative (γ<sub>10</sub> = .184, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and consider self-enhancement values less important (γ<sub>10</sub> = −.372, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than men (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111429719">Table 4</xref>). These differences vary though (see cross-level interactions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022111429719">Table 4</xref>): In the low-GDP, former Communist regions, women are more conservative (γ<sub>11</sub> = .113, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than women in other regions. Women in low-GDP, non-Communist regions (γ<sub>12</sub> = .222, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) consider self-enhancement values relatively more important, unlike women in former Communist and high-GDP regions. Thus, the difference in self-enhancement values between men and women (i.e., the gender gap) is smaller in low-GDP, non-Communist regions than in either high-GDP or former Communist regions. For conservation, the gender gap is largest in former Communist regions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study combines multiple features relevant to the analysis of values across cultures. We distinguish the two levels of individual and geographical region and examine a set of variables that are plausible, overlapping antecedents of value differences. These antecedents reflect both current and historical contexts. Finally, we investigate interactions of age cohorts with recent sociopolitical and economic contexts.</p>
<p>To gauge the implications of these findings, we note three limitations of our design and analysis. First, it would be desirable to have longitudinal data to examine within-subject changes, as well as the shifts in values between cohorts. Second, the operationalizations of the regional-level historical factors are rather coarse, and variables tend to be confounded. We dealt with this problem by analyzing combinations of regional characteristics using dummy coding. Third, we do not report all possible interactions between region-level characteristics; we limited our presentation to those that we considered most relevant. Even with these limitations, our study is the first to combine various antecedents at the individual and context levels; prior studies focused on either individual antecedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022111429719">Bardi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Rubel, 2005</xref>) or country-level antecedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Bardi, 1997</xref>). This study therefore enables us to explore effects that the context may have on individual values.</p>
<p>Overall, the results confirm the importance of GDP as a key antecedent of cross-cultural differences in values at the regional level. If taken separately, we also find significant effects for the other variables, including historical antecedents, such as whether a region belonged to the same political entity over 200 years ago and whether it was part of the Roman Empire (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022111429719">Table 1</xref>). However, these contributions decrease sharply when we take GDP into account. By separating the effect of wealth and history, we could determine that current wealth is the main antecedent of values. At the same time, the evidence is clearly at variance with the widespread viewpoint (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022111429719">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022111429719">Kagitçibasi, 1997</xref>) that current cultural values are rooted in the past, even a far historical past.</p>
<p>With lower GDP per capita, there is a tendency of higher endorsement of both conservation values and self-enhancement values. Furthermore, within-country regional differences in values also tend to correspond to differences in wealth. For example, in Spain, the difference in conservation values between Madrid (<italic>M</italic> = −.20) and Andalucía (<italic>M</italic> = 1.54) corresponds to the difference in wealth between those regions (GDP per capita of €25.800 and €15.200, respectively). We used dummy coding for GDP, distinguishing only high- and low-income regions. The reason was that the other region antecedents were also dichotomous. A check revealed that slightly higher estimates of explained variance emerged if GDP was taken as a continuous variable, and especially when not only linear but quadratic relationships were computed. However, this did not essentially change any of the findings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022022111429719">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second largest proportion of variance at the regional level stems from religious pluralism and religion. More religions tend to coexist in more affluent regions (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022111429719">Table 2</xref>). When we addressed the confounding of religion and GDP, Islamic and Eastern Orthodox regions were in the low-GDP category and Protestant regions in the high-GDP category. Focusing on religious regions only we found the initially high percentage of variance explained by religions as separate entries reduced to 15%. Overall, religion adds to GDP when accounting for differences in values; wealthy regions in which Protestantism or being nonreligious is most prevalent place less emphasis on conservation and self-enhancement values. The Catholic wealthy regions are relatively more conservative and consider self-enhancement more important than the wealthy Protestant regions. The importance of religion for explaining value scores also emerges at the individual level. Respondents who report higher adherence to practices prescribed by their religion (religiosity) tend to score somewhat higher on the conservation dimension and slightly lower on the self-enhancement dimension. Although the overall evidence is highly compatible with the general findings on the importance of wealth, we have to mention that the confounding of most of the dominant religions with either high GDP or low GDP limited the formal testing to the Catholic regions.</p>
<p>Other salient findings pertain to the patterns of shifts across cohorts for the two value dimensions. We find consistent trends: from conservation towards openness to change for younger age cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111429719">Figure 1</xref>) and equally consistent trends from self-transcendence to self-enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022022111429719">Figure 2</xref>). The shifts between age cohorts are substantial, which implies that younger people emphasize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111429719">Schwartz’s (1992)</xref> stimulation and self-direction (openness to change) value types, whereas older people focus on security, conformity, and tradition (conservation). In addition, youngsters score higher on power and achievement (self-enhancement), but older people show higher scores for benevolence and universalism (self-transcendence). Although these age-based differences are expected (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022111429719">Schwartz &amp; Rubel, 2005</xref>), the changes over cohorts also differ across regions, such that differences between the youngest and oldest cohorts are larger in former Communist and high-GDP regions than in low-GDP, non-Communist regions. The most likely explanation for this finding may be the rapid growth in GDP in the former Communist regions; since the collapse of the Soviet Union, far higher growth rates have been reported in former Communist regions than in low-GDP regions elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022111429719">Figure 1</xref> indicate an increase in the differences across cohorts for low-GDP regions that were or were not previously Communist. The older cohorts in both low-GDP regions are quite similar, but the youngest cohort that grew up after the fall of Communism deviates, in that these youngsters are more similar to their peers in affluent, non-Communist regions. Of course, societal changes that followed the end of Communism are drawn out over time, but the increasing trend for self-enhancement is weaker in the low-GDP, non-Communist regions. As mentioned, the available data cannot differentiate between effects of age and changes in values over time. For example, modern youngsters may become more benevolent as they grow older. The shifts in conservation move in the same direction as changes over time noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022111429719">Inglehart (1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>), but the shift toward higher self-enhancement counters the historical trend he described. We cannot explain this discrepancy, though a possible explanation for the stronger shift toward self-enhancement in former Communist regions might be found in the decreased economic security in these regions after the collapse of the Soviet Union. These regions suffered sharply rising unemployment after 1990, and people experiencing insecurity tend to focus more closely on materialism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022111429719">Chang &amp; Arkin, 2002</xref>). This would fit the argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022111429719">Bardi and Goodwin (2011)</xref> that values will adapt to changing life circumstances.</p>
<p>The former Communist rule also appears in the form of gender differences. For self-enhancement, we find that this difference is larger in high-GDP regions, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022111429719">Schwartz and Rubel-Lifschitz (2009)</xref>. More gender equality is linked with greater differences in values between genders. For conservation, the gender gap in former Communist regions is larger than that in either the other low-GDP regions or in the high-GDP regions. Thus, a history of Communism (not wealth) may be the main antecedent that explains differences between genders in conservation values.</p>
<p>It may be noted that our study was not guided by a theory on values and antecedents. We started from the two dimensions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022111429719">Schwarz (1992)</xref> had identified empirically as providing a good representation of the values domain, and from several antecedents mentioned in the literature as explanations of cross-cultural differences in values. The study was exploratory and this limits its theoretical reach. Nevertheless, the findings lend support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022111429719">Inglehart and Baker’s (2000)</xref> scarcity hypothesis and his socialization hypothesis, both of which emphasize the importance of wealth. They are also in tune with an emerging trend in cross-cultural psychology (including both its culture-comparative and its cultural psychology streams) to move to external antecedents, such as affluence and existing norms, that influence behavior expressions in a category of situations. More such limited interpretations are in line with fairly rapid changes in behavior repertoire once certain constraints have been lifted. It can be argued that an increase in wealth expands the range of choices that people have (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022111429719">Berry, Poortinga, Breugelmans, Chasiotis, &amp; Sam, 2011</xref>). Perhaps the most pertinent evidence to date for links between values and the current context comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022111429719">Bardi, Calogero, and Mullen (2008)</xref>, who traced variations in the prevalence of certain values in the United States between 1900 and 2000. They concluded that patterns of fluctuations in values in newspaper reports could be meaningfully related to major historical and political events taking place at a time.</p>
<p>To finalize, we provide insight into the effects of distal and proximal historical antecedents at the region level. Mostly GDP but also religion affects values; it would be insightful to disentangle their joint influence further. This may be difficult because of the association that we found between dominant religion in a region and GDP. An aggregate religiousness score for a region would not be a good proxy for religion, because these two variables would be non-isomorphic in meaning across the individual and regional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022111429719">Van de Vijver, Van Hemert, &amp; Poortinga, 2008</xref>). At face value, religion as a variable adds to affluence in accounting for differences in values; in wealthy regions with predominantly Protestant or nonreligious populations, conservation and self-enhancement values appear less important.</p>
<p>Another important avenue for research would be to focus on more fine-grained regional differences. For example, what effect do changes in a region’s economic activity or unemployment rates have on values? What is the effect of a change in regional wealth? In the past few decades, wealth has increased all over Europe, coinciding with lower endorsement of conservation and more endorsement of self-enhancement values. Yet we do not really know the effects when wealth is decreasing. For example, could conservation values become more important for age cohorts who grow up in a region that has been particularly hard hit by an economic crisis?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For our analysis of individual- and regional-level variables as antecedents of differences in conservation and self-enhancement values, the pattern of findings suggests rather rapid changes in the value dimensions as a consequence of changes in GDP per capita. A telling finding is that GDP explains most of the total variance in value dimensions in a model that includes potentially competing factors. When we analyzed the combined effects of GDP and belonging to the Roman Empire, the combination did not explain more of the variance between regions on the conservation dimension and barely more on the self-enhancement dimension. Only the religion of a region had a clear additional effect on the explained variance in the value dimensions next to GDP. Thus, it appears that any ongoing effects of events from distant history are marginal. The effect of more recent changes in the sociopolitical context (Communism) could be traced when focusing on differences between age cohorts. Of course, we do not have longitudinal data going back to the Middle Ages or the Roman Empire, but we find plausible evidence only for extensive changes over short periods of time related to the societal context. This finding does not totally rule out distal antecedents, but it makes any notable effects unlikely. If values are subject to major changes in relatively short periods of time, any perceived consistency over centuries likely reflects incidental similarities.</p>
<p>At the individual level, age explains the most variance. We also discover some contribution of religiousness and gender on self-enhancement and of education on the conservation dimension. Some of the more salient findings relate to age cohorts, with higher self-enhancement and lower conservation as we are dealing with younger cohorts. Another notable finding results from the interactions of age cohorts with former Communism, an influence that occurred during the lifetime of the respondents.</p>
<p>In summary, at the region level, a contemporary factor, GDP, is the most important antecedent of differences in the value dimensions of conservation and self-enhancement. In regions with a high GDP per capita, both conservation and self-enhancement are lower. At the individual level, age has a large effect: Younger people score lower on conservation and higher on self-enhancement. The differences in shifts in various regions across age cohorts reveal recent historical effects (Communism), in addition to wealth, that explain differences in values. The direct links of the value dimensions with the current economic context, the apparently rapid changes after the fall of Communism, and the absence of notable effects from earlier times all suggest that cultural values tend to reflect present circumstances rather than the cultural context of a more or less distant past.</p>
