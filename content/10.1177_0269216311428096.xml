<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Syringe drivers are routinely used in palliative care for the subcutaneous administration of drugs for pain and symptom control. Local reactions occurring at the site of infusion can lead to discomfort for the patient and the possibility of sub-optimal symptom control. Several mainly small-scale studies, vary greatly on their reporting of the rates of site reactions due to syringe drivers, ranging from 4% to 24% of patients encountering problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311428096">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311428096">2</xref></sup> The authors’ earlier review of the literature has highlighted the inconsistencies in reported incidence, and also in the identification, causes and management of site reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311428096">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A site reaction has been described as ‘An adverse incident occurring at the point of delivery of the drug(s)’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311428096">3</xref></sup> Effective prevention of such site reactions is likely to have a positive impact on patients’ quality of life and hence, good management of syringe driver sites is important.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that some drugs such as cyclizine and levomepromazine administered subcutaneously via syringe drivers are potential irritants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311428096">4</xref></sup> However, there appear to be few studies that have looked at the time to onset of problems at the cannulae sites when these drugs are used, i.e. how frequently a site should be changed to prevent site reactions occurring when particular drugs are in use.</p>
<p>Many approaches have been suggested in the literature for preventing or overcoming syringe driver site reactions. Such approaches include avoiding irritant drugs, diluting the solution as much as possible, and altering the type of needle and giving set used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311428096">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311428096"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311428096"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311428096"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311428096">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper reports on the findings of a prospective study mapping syringe driver use within hospice specialist palliative care practice. Potential causes for syringe driver site reactions are identified and recommendations for prevention made.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269216311428096">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to investigate whether there was an association between specific drugs administered subcutaneously via a syringe driver and the occurrence of site reactions further linking this to time to site reaction. Other possible causes of site reactions would also be identified. Findings thereafter would inform the development of guidelines for syringe driver use and management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269216311428096">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>A 60-bed hospice split between two centres (26 beds at Centre A, 34 beds at Centre B). Clinical staff worked primarily within one centre only. One identifiable difference between the two centres pre-data collection, was the nearly exclusive use at centre A of a metal butterfly needle (the Graseby Flo-Safer winged infusion set). At Centre B a Teflon cannula (MiniMed Sof-Set infusion set) was in routine use. Prior to commencement of the study, approval was sought from the hospice’s internal governance/clinical management committee and categorized as audit/evaluation, involving the analysis of existing clinical data derived from routine clinical intervention.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>For each subcutaneous infusion via a syringe driver, nursing staff completed a data collection form. The following information was recorded: centre (hospice), date, patient identification, age, gender, drug combination, drug dose, type of needle/giving set and diluent used. Site changes were recorded and any site reactions were categorized. Data were subsequently input into SPSS, though these data were subsequently analyzed in Stata as it was seen to provide better flexibility with analysis of survival data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216311428096">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Data were collected on all patients at the hospice who received a continuous subcutaneous infusion via a syringe driver lasting more than 24 hours (during 2003–2004). Patients who did not receive a subcutaneous infusion via a syringe driver or where the infusion lasted less than one day (24 hours) were excluded. The sample of patients reflected a commonly seen spread of diagnoses, with baseline characteristics at both centres being comparable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311428096">Table 1</xref>). Most common diagnoses were lung cancers (18.5%); upper gastrointestinal cancers (16.0%); urological cancers (12.5%); bowel/anal cancers (10.0%); breast cancers (8.5%); head and neck cancers (6.0%); gynaecological cancers (5.5%); non-malignant (4.5%); unknown (4.0%); other (4.0%).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed using Stata (Stata IC version 10.0 and 11.0), and within that time-to-events methods, whereby multiple events per person, as well as time-varying covariates such as drug combination, can be calculated. Time-to-event analytical methods including Kaplan Meier survival curves and partial likelihood (Cox) regression were applied. The effects of centre, gender and drug were investigated. It was expected that centre and giving set would be highly correlated; therefore centre was investigated over needle type as it was expected that there would be fewer missing data.</p>
<p>The dataset included a total of 28 drugs. Medicines were entered into the Cox regression as ‘any cyclizine’, ‘any haloperidol’, ‘any diamorphine’, ‘any morphine’, ‘any levomepromazine’ or ‘other’ as 0–1 ‘indicator functions’. For example, if the patient in question had a drug combination that day which included cyclizine and morphine, but no haloperidol, diamorphine or levomepromazine, that particular entry into the dataset would be cyclizine = 1, haloperidol = 0, diamorphine = 0, morphine = 1, levomepromazine = 0, other = 0.</p>
<sec id="section14-0269216311428096">
<title>Primary analysis</title>
<p>To account for the possible correlation between concurrent subcutaneous infusions via syringe drivers within a patient (that is, the potential for a reaction from one subcutaneous infusion in a patient to indicate that a reaction is more or less likely to occur in another subcutaneous infusion in that same patient), the ‘subjects’ in the Cox regression were regarded as the ‘separate subcutaneous infusions’, as opposed to the conventional study participants. Subcutaneous infusions administered to one person were linked via a ‘frailty term’, the subject ID number. This was carried out for the first visit data only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269216311428096">
<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>To assess whether the data in a subsequent visit behaved comparably, this model-fitting was repeated using the dataset to include both first and second visits (if they occurred).</p>

<p>Of the 170 patients who received medication for a minimum of 24 hours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311428096">Table 1</xref>), 39 patients had two or more syringe drivers running concurrently (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311428096">Table 2</xref>). 10 patients had several subcutaneous infusions at different time points – that is, more than one visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311428096">Table 2</xref>) (See ‘Terminology’). There were 1020 daily data entries in total, 938 of which stated whether the syringe driver was resited (or not) and whether the resite was due to a site reaction (or not) (9.2% of missing data for this variable).</p>

<p>Of these patients, 50 patients began their first subcutaneous infusion via a syringe driver with only one drug being administered via the syringe driver, 73 started with two drugs in combination, 45 with three drugs in combination, and two patients with four drugs in combination. The median doses administered per drug on the first day of the infusion period were 150mg (cyclizine), 3mg (haloperidol), 20mg (morphine), 20mg (diamorphine), and 12.5mg (levomepromazine).

<p>There were more infusion periods recorded at Centre A than Centre B, for a similar number of patients, indicating that site changes occurred more frequently for these patients on the whole. A much greater percentage of infusion <italic>events</italic> at Centre A were due to site reactions, rather than routine site changes (26.5 % at Centre A vs. 7.7% at Centre B). At Centre A, bleeding was the reason for 30.6% of the site reactions, whereas at Centre B, bleeding did not account for any.

<p>Hazard ratios indicate an association between the two centres (HR = 9.82, 95% CI: 1.46–65.92) and potentially whether or not cyclizine contributed to the drug combination (HR = 5.65, 95% CI: 0.50–63.64) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311428096">Table 3.2</xref>). The remaining sample hazard ratios for the different drugs indicate an increased risk of site reaction with their individual inclusions except for haloperidol, for which the hazard ratio is very small (8.92 x 10<sup>-18</sup>). However, the wide confidence intervals for these hazard ratios suggest notable imprecision in these estimates, especially for haloperidol (95% CI: 0 to ‘does not estimate’) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311428096">Table 3.2</xref>). These wide confidence intervals are due to be likely to the sparse events in this dataset.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has identified that an incidence of approximately 20% of infusion periods ended in some form of site reaction. However, a marked difference in incidences was observed between the two centres in the study (26.5% vs. 7.7%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0269216311428096">
<title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>This work has generated a large dataset for statistical analysis. Whilst data collection was initiated in 2003, the range of drugs captured continues to reflect current practice. However, limitations include issues such as other potential risk factors for site reaction which ideally would have been investigated; for example, inter-individual patient variability, such as skin integrity and oedema, allergy or nutritional status may have also been possible factors. Neither was the effect of tonicity investigated, literature suggests that this may affect the longevity of the site. Practice at the two centres was the same, in that water for injection was used unless an alternative was suggested by compatibility data and diluted to a 9ml volume unless the contents without diluent exceeded this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311428096">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distribution of the data limited the depth of analysis possible; the paucity of site reactions meant that the degrees of freedom would have reduced had we investigated any more hypotheses – the data would have been ‘overstretched’.</p>
<p>The multi-factorial nature of site reactions and the frequency and fluidity of prescribing resulted in a complex dataset for analysis. Survival analysis techniques were chosen that would model multiple reactions and syringe drivers but with a sensitivity analysis to investigate multiple visits, as a compromise. This was an attempt to make as much use of the data available, especially as repeat reactions and visits may provide a different angle of information, but also to not use such complex modelling that the results would be incomprehensible to readers and therefore deemed useless in practice.</p>
<p>Although this study investigated many loose hypotheses, the observational nature of the data collection means that this study cannot confirm what the results suggest. Further studies should address specific hypotheses resulting from this study – such as investigating cannula type via a randomized trial approach – using these data to inform their design.</p>
<p>Within the previously reported literature, incidences of syringe driver site reactions were found to occur in between 4–24% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311428096">3</xref></sup> It is generally accepted that some drugs such as cyclizine and levomepromazine, administered through syringe drivers are potential irritants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311428096">4</xref></sup> Where a greater number of drugs have been used in combination, an increase in reported skin reaction rates has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311428096">1</xref></sup> Cyclizine has been reported to appear frequently in such instances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311428096">1</xref></sup> The study confirms an association between drugs administered and rates of site reaction. For both centres, combinations of drugs including cyclizine and/or levomepromazine are more likely to result in a site reaction (first visit only data). Subsequent analyses further supported these findings. Combinations including cyclizine were up to five times more likely to result in a site reaction in this sample, with the upper limit of its related hazard ratio’s confidence interval suggesting this could possibly be as high as approximately 60 times more likely in the study population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311428096">Table 3.2</xref>). When levomepromazine was present within a drug combination, it was 2.68 times more likely to result in a site reaction than those not containing these drugs. Data for all visits at both centres confirmed these findings, with cyclizine still five times more likely to result in a site reaction. For levomepromazine the risk increased to 3.76 times more likely. However, the current study would suggest that the presence of these drugs is only one of several potential causes, such as choice of cannula.</p>
<p>This study has provided data to help inform guidelines regarding the length of time for the infusion period. For the first visit data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311428096">Table 3.1</xref>), the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of number of days to a first site reaction was three days; that is, only 10% of reactions occurred in less than three days of one site being used, 90% occurred after at least three days of a site being in use. Therefore, recommending changing the cannula at three days, whether a site reaction has occurred or not, could potentially help avoid up to 90% of site reactions in a similar sample of patients.</p>
<p>In contrast, the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of number of days to first site reaction was six days; that is, 25% of reactions occurred within this time period. Hence, the majority of patients (75%) would be likely to only experience a site reaction beyond six days.</p>
<p>When repeated with the full dataset (i.e. for first and second visit data), the 10<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> percentiles of number of days to site reaction remained the same (with an improved confidence interval).</p>
<p>For drug combinations containing high-risk drugs such as cyclizine and levomepromazine (as suggested by the hazard ratio), it could be suggested that the site is changed every three days. For drug combinations with lower risk of reactions a suggested frequency of site change could be six days, which may be more practical and cost-effective.</p>
<p>However, as the median length of time a patient uses a subcutaneous syringe driver during the study period was three days, an earlier site change than usual practice would not be required for the majority of patients.</p>
<p>A marked difference in reaction rates was identified between centres. Baseline characteristics of patients at both centres were comparable, therefore the likely reason proposed for this finding is that it was due to the one identifiable difference in practice between the two study centres, in the use of a different type of giving set and cannula. A metal butterfly needle was routinely used at Centre A (26.5% reaction rate) as opposed to a Teflon cannula at Centre B (7.7% reaction rate). Hence, cannula type could potentially be a key cause of the higher incidence of site reactions at Centre A compared to Centre B.</p>
<p>The most common types of site reaction observed between centres also differed. For Centre A, bleeding (30%) was the most common. As bleeding was unobserved at Centre B, it could be surmised that site bleeding may again be attributable to the cannula (metal) rather than the drug combination used, though this could not be confirmed in the current study.</p>
<p>Again, with the only identifiable difference in practice pre-data collection between the two sites being the use of different cannula, the clear differences in reaction rates (and reaction types) between the two sites point towards cannula type as a primary cause. While this cannot be categorically stated (as comparison of cannula type was not included in the study design), the evidence points towards a change in practice from metal butterfly needs to Teflon cannula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0269216311428096" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The authors recommend a change in practice from a metal butterfly needle to a Teflon cannula at both hospice sites where applicable.</p>
<p>A recommendation can be made to change the syringe driver site every three days routinely if cyclizine or levomepromazine are included in the drug combination. If these known irritant drugs are not present then a more practical recommendation to routinely change the site every six days can be made.</p>
<p>This study could provide justification for further research into the effect of the cannulae used on the incidence of site reactions. Other aspects, such as methods of care, location of site, etc., also merit investigation.</p>
