<p>Many guidelines for reporting hearing results use the threshold at 3 kilohertz (kHz), a frequency not measured routinely. This study assessed the validity of estimating the missing 3-kHz threshold by averaging the measured thresholds at 2 and 4 kHz. The estimated threshold was compared to the measured threshold at 3 kHz individually and when used in the pure-tone average (PTA) of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz in audiometric data from 2170 patients. The difference between the estimated and measured thresholds for 3 kHz was within ±5 dB in 72% of audiograms, ±10 dB in 91%, and within ±20 dB in 99% (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.965). The difference between the PTA threshold using the estimated threshold compared with using the measured threshold at 3 kHz was within ±5 dB in 99% of audiograms (<italic>r</italic> = 0.997). The estimated threshold accurately approximates the measured threshold at 3 kHz, especially when incorporated into the PTA.</p>

<p>The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines for reporting hearing results in vestibular schwannoma, Ménière disease, and conductive hearing loss treatment recommend a pure-tone average (PTA) using thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437156">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437156"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437156">3</xref></sup> Audiometry standards for determining hearing disability and ototoxicity also include the threshold at 3 kHz as a standard measurement. However, because thresholds at 3 kHz are not universally measured in routine audiometry, thresholds at 3 kHz are often missing. Missing data at 3 kHz present a dilemma for researchers and clinicians. Does one discard an otherwise complete audiogram when the threshold at a single frequency is missing?</p>
<p>When an audiogram is missing a measured 3-kHz threshold, is it possible to obtain an accurate approximation of the threshold at 3 kHz from measured threshold values of the more standard adjacent frequencies? This study was undertaken to determine whether an interpolated value at 3 kHz using measured values at 2 and 4 kHz would closely approximate a measured threshold at 3 kHz. Our objective was to determine the magnitude of PTA errors resulting from using 3-kHz thresholds interpolated from 2- and 4-kHz measurements.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812437156" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We reviewed all audiograms within our electronic medical record system from March 12, 2008, to November 18, 2011. Institutional Review Board exemption was given since the data were interrogated without any patient identifiers. Audiograms were excluded if there was a “no response” recorded at any frequency at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 kHz. One audiogram from one ear per patient was evaluated using a random-number generator to select either the left or right ear audiogram. Only 1 audiogram per patient was evaluated if a patient had multiple audiograms. The measured pure-tone air-conduction threshold at 3 kHz for each audiogram was compared with an interpolated threshold at 3 kHz calculated by averaging the measured thresholds at the adjacent frequencies of 2 and 4 kHz from the same audiogram.</p>

<title>3 kHz Interpolated versus Measured</title>
<p>A total of 2170 audiograms met inclusion criteria. The difference between the interpolated and measured values for 3 kHz was within ±5 dB in 72% of audiograms, ±10 dB in 91%, and ±20 dB in 99% (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.965). Of those 9% of audiograms in which the calculated and measured thresholds diverged by more than 10 dB, the interpolated threshold was better than the measured threshold in 82.5% of cases. The mean difference between the averaged and interpolated 3-kHz thresholds was 2.0 dB (SD, 6.50). Measured versus interpolated 3-kHz values had a Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> value) of 0.955 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812437156"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To draw meaningful conclusions from hearing data for research, it is imperative that audiologic variables are reported in a standard fashion. For this reason, the Hearing Committee of the AAO-HNS recommended minimal reporting standards for hearing outcomes in research dealing with acoustic neuromas, Ménière disease, and conductive hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437156">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437156"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437156">3</xref></sup> Each of these official recommendations stipulate the inclusion of thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz in the PTA. Guidelines for determining hearing handicap and chemotherapeutic ototoxicity monitoring also require 3-kHz thresholds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437156">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812437156">5</xref></sup> The inclusion of thresholds at 3 kHz is particularly relevant in vestibular schwannoma research because these tumors often cause hearing loss predominantly in the high frequencies.</p>
<p>Our results show that an interpolated 3-kHz threshold will approximate a measured 3-kHz threshold to within 10 dB 91% of the time. This error rate is greatly minimized when the interpolated value is included in a PTA with 3 other measured values (0.5, 1, 2 kHz). PTAs with an interpolated value fall within 5 dB of PTAs with a measured threshold in 99% of the audiograms. Although interpolation is very accurate, when critical decision making for individual cases depends on measurement accuracy, such as calculating hearing handicap for disability claims, we recommend formal audiometry with measured values at 3 kHz. For research purposes that assess aggregate results of hearing outcomes, however, rather than discarding an audiogram because of missing data at 3 kHz, it is reasonable to use an interpolated value in the 4-frequency PTA. The potential error introduced by this interpolation is negligible and unlikely to alter an individual patient’s hearing classification score in any significant way. For population-based studies of aggregate hearing results, the potential error introduced by interpolation is even more negligible.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of an interpolated threshold at 3 kHz introduces a small degree of error at this specific frequency compared with the measured threshold. The effect, however, of using the interpolated value on the PTA is minor. These data suggest that an interpolated 3-kHz threshold can accurately approximate the measured value in the great majority of cases, especially when incorporated into the PTA.</p>
