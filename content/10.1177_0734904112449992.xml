<p>Polyamide 6,6 is used in many industrial fields such as housing materials, transport or electrical engineering applications. Due to its chemical composition, this polymer is easily flammable. As far as the main applications concern electrical and electronic equipments, its flame-retardant properties become an important requirement.

The aim is to obtain high limiting oxygen index values, V0 rating at UL94 test for 1.6- or 0.8-mm-thick samples and a validation at 960°C of the glow wire flammability index. The usual way to fire retard polyamide 6,6 consists of incorporating an important loading of fire-retardant additives, which often reduce the intrinsic properties of the polymer. It is also difficult to combine a thin polymer thickness (e.g. 0.8 mm) and a high amount of additives because of processing issues. In this article, we first carried out a rapid screening to determine the best fire retardant for polyamide 6,6 and its optimized amount to achieve the previously defined fire retardant properties. It was shown that an amount of 23% of aluminium diethylphosphinate Exolit OP1230 allows reaching the requirements. Then, carrying out two different surface treatments (coating of polysiloxanes by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition and use of an intumescent waterborne varnish), we have tried to reach the same results. It was shown that the use of surface treatment alone does not allow reaching the objectives. As a consequence, the combination of the bulk approach at low loadings with the surface treatment was investigated. This new route allows the combination of the condensed phase mechanism of the intumescent barrier with the gas phase mechanism of the OP1230 and leads to very good results: the use of 5% of the flame-retardant additives combined with a 100-µm-thick waterborne intumescent varnish leads to better results than a 23% of additive loading.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyamide 6,6 (PA6,6) is used in many industrial fields such as housing materials, transport or electrical engineering applications (connectors, circuit breakers, electric distribution and industrial controls). Due to its chemical composition, this polymer is easily flammable. As far as the main applications concern electrical and electronic equipments (EEEs), its flame-retardant properties become an important requirement, and the materials have to comply with severe fire-retardant test methods. The most discriminating tests are the limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL94 and glow wire flammability index (GWFI). The aim is to obtain the highest LOI values, V0 rating at UL94 test for 1.6- or 0.8-mm-thick samples and a validation at 960°C for GWFI test.</p>
<p>To reduce the fire hazards of polymeric materials, several ways can be considered: the most common one consists of incorporating flame-retardant additives into the polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112449992">1</xref></sup> This technique is quite simple and cheap, and numerous flame retardants are commercially available. However, this approach leads to some processability issues and to the decrease of the intrinsic properties of the polymer since the loading is usually rather high (typically more than 15 wt.%). Moreover, some of the commonly used additives (in particular some halogen-based compounds) can have ecological drawbacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112449992">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112449992"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112449992">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The chemical modification of the macromolecule is another method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112449992">5</xref></sup> This technique is not easy to conduct on an industrial scale with most thermoplastic polymers, and can be rather expensive and so is not commonly used.</p>
<p>Surface modification (physical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112449992">6</xref></sup> or chemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734904112449992">7</xref></sup> treatments) seems to be an attractive alternative method as it would allow concentrating the fire retardant properties onto the polymer surface (where the flammability occurs) and would thus allow preserving the bulk properties of the material. In a previous study carried out in the laboratory, a new route to improve fire retardant properties of a polymer by deposing a thin film on its surface using plasma-assisted polymerization technique has been investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734904112449992">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112449992"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734904112449992"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112449992"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734904112449992">12</xref></sup> The plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is one of the most widely used process for the deposition of thin films. The plasma-assisted polymerization of organosilicon compounds is an interesting technique to create thin polysiloxane-based films on the surface of various substrates even if the literature data about this process are rather sparse. Polysiloxane-based films are known to show good thermal stability, interesting flame properties and an interesting hydrophobicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112449992">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, two approaches are used and then combined in order to improve the flame-retardant properties of PA6,6. First, flame-retardant additives are added to the matrix, and the influence of the additives content on the flame-retardant properties is investigated. Second, two different surface treatments are investigated. The cold plasma polymerization of organosilicon films has first been used to coat PA6,6. Films are obtained from the polymerization of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) monomer doped with oxygen under nitrogen microwave post-discharge low-pressure cold plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112449992">11</xref></sup> The second way consists of applying an intumescent waterborne transparent varnish on the PA6,6. An intumescent coating is a coating that ‘when heated above its critical temperature, begins to melt, to bubble and to swell, forming a thick, non flammable multi cellular insulative barrier which affords protection for substrate’. Intumescent varnishes are generally developed for wood and metals as they usually show poor adhesion to polymers. However, as detailed in precedent articles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112449992">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734904112449992">15</xref></sup> an adequate treatment of the polymer surface allows improving the adhesion between the coating and the polymeric substrate, and thus allows keeping the properties of the intumescent coating during a fire.</p>

<p>PA6,6 has been supplied by Rhodia Engineering Plastics. Polymer plates (100 × 100 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, 130 × 10 × 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> and 60 × 60 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) have been prepared by Rhodia Engineering Plastics using an injection press DEMAG (injection pressure between 500 and 700 bars, and mould temperature between 70°C and 90°C). Some samples (PA6,6 glass fibre (GF)) have been prepared with 25% of boron-free GFs (Advantex 983; Owens Corning Corporation) via melt compounding using a twin-screw corotating extruder ZSK40 (rotating speed of 250 r/min and injection flow rate of 35 kg/h). Different fire-retardant additives have been incorporated using the same melt compounding process: aluminium diethylphosphinate (Exolit OP1230; Clariant), melamine polyphosphate (Melapur 200; BASF), melamine pyrophosphate (Budit 311; Budenheim), melamine cyanurate (Budit 314; Budenheim) and Exolit OP1312 (Clariant; mixture of OP1230, Melapur 200 and zinc borate (FB500; US Borax)).</p>
<p>TMDSO (97%) provided by Aldrich Chemicals was used for the plasma treatment. The intumescent varnish was ‘Pyroplast HW100’ supplied by Rütger Organics. It is a varnish of confidential composition; however, we analysed its chemical composition using an electron probe microscopy analysis (EPMA) on a CAMECA SX100 at 20 kV and 20 nA. We showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112449992">Figure 1</xref>) that this varnish is mainly composed of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and silica with traces of iron, aluminium and magnesium. It is thus halogen, boron and heavy metal free.</p>

A nitrogen flow (purity: 99.995%, supplied by Air Liquide) is excited by a microwave discharge produced in a quartz tube. By continuous pumping, excited and long-life species are led to the reactor chamber where the cold remote nitrogen plasma appears like a yellow afterglow. The cold remote nitrogen plasma is free of charged particles (substrate damages are avoided), and the temperature is approximately ambient.</p>

<p>The monomer (TMDSO), premixed with oxygen (purity ≥ 99.5%, supplied by Air Liquide), is injected into the cold remote nitrogen plasma through a coaxial injector. The deposition process is carried out in two steps: first the samples are treated by the cold remote nitrogen plasma in order to increase the adhesion quality of the organosilicon film on the polymer. Then, the deposition step is performed without air re-exposure. The polymerization process leads to a previously studied white glow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112449992">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734904112449992">17</xref></sup> Samples are successively coated on each face with an open-air exposure between the two steps.</p>

<p>The best results in terms of LOI with and without GFs correspond to the incorporation of 23% of aluminium diethylphosphinate (OP1230). The mechanism of action of OP1230 in PA6,6 has been elucidated by Braun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734904112449992">24</xref></sup> Their conclusion is that the mechanism of action of OP1230 in PA6,6 is mostly a gas phase mechanism with flame inhibition by the release of phosphorus-containing radicals. The authors explain that this flame inhibition effect corresponds to the superior LOI performance of the formulation PA6,6/GF/OP1230.</p>
<p>The additive Budit 314 also shows interesting results when the PA6,6 does not contain GF, but the LOI decreases drastically (from 40% to 25%), and the sample is NC when GFs are incorporated. The reason for the interference by glass reinforcement in the action of melamine cyanurate has not been completely elucidated. However, it could be suspected that the GFs retard melt flow that is responsible for the good fire retardant properties of PA6,6, since heat is ‘evacuated’ by dripping. Moreover, the fibres could act as a ‘wick’ and should favour heat transfer to the polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734904112449992">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734904112449992">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The influence of the content of OP1230 on fire retardant properties of PA6,6 GF is then investigated.

<p>It can be observed that the incorporation of only 8% of OP1230 allows obtaining good fire properties. Indeed, even if V0 rating at UL94 is not achieved, the sample, which is NC at 5%, shows a V1 rating for 8% of additives (extinction time superior to 10 s and dripping of polymer). Moreover, it validates the GWFI at 960°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112449992">Figure 3</xref>) and decreases the pRHR of around 50%. The V0 rating is only obtained when 23% of the additives are added, which is an important amount that might modify the intrinsic properties of the polymer such as its mechanical properties. The IT decreases to about 30 s when OP1230 is incorporated; however, the RHR max reaches 147 kW/m<sup>2</sup> for a 23% of loading against 515 kW/m<sup>2</sup> for pure PA6,6 GF.</p>

<p>We have seen that the GWFI test is validated for 8% of OP1230, but 23% is needed to obtain the highest LOI values as well as lower pRHR and V0 rating. This is why the idea to develop a surface treatment allowing to put only few amounts of additives or to suppress them has been developed.</p>
<p>Some of our precedent articles showed that a polysiloxane deposit on different textiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734904112449992">26</xref></sup> as well as on polyamide 6 nanocomposites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112449992">11</xref></sup> allows improving the fire resistance of the substrates.

<p>Flame-retardant performances of the films deposited on PA6,6 have been evaluated using LOI, GWFI, UL94 and cone calorimeter measurements. All samples are NC at UL94 test, and none of them validate the GWFI test. However, even if the GWFI test of treated PA6,6 is not validated, it has to be noted that a thin protective silicon barrier is formed during the first seconds of the test, but once this layer cracks, the sample burns completely as it does not contain a fireproofing agent in its formulation to stop the flame spreading.</p>

Then, it decreases to 34% for a film thickness of 11.7 µm. This might be due to the poor adhesion of the coated layer for this thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112449992">Figure 4</xref>).

In the value of oxygen concentration corresponding to the LOI, the combustion stops quicker after inflammation, and the sample burns only on a height of less than 1 cm. When the oxygen concentration corresponds to LOI + 1, the material degrades faster, producing a large amount of carbonaceous residue, which shows weak mechanical resistance. However, the behaviour of the treated PA6,6 sharply differs from the one of virgin PA6,6. A thin protective silicon crust is formed on the surface of the PA6,6 when the material is treated, which prevents the flowing of the sample. This might explain the increase of LOI as soon as 1.2 µm of deposit is done.</p>

<p>RHR curves corresponding to the untreated PA6,6 can be described as follows. Towards 75 s, the material degrades enough to release flammable gases in a sufficient amount so that their mixture with air is ignited by the electric arc of the electrode in the cone calorimeter. The combustion begins with the liberation of a strong calorific flow (RHR increases rapidly). Towards 110 s, slowing down of the liberation of heat occurs and then a new peak is observed with a maximum towards 150 s corresponding to the thermal return of the back face. Beyond this time, the majority of the polymer was consumed, and then fuel gases rarefy until exhaustion of the whole polymer.</p>
<p>The treated samples ignite approximately at the same time than the untreated PA6,6. Further to this ignition, a thin white film is formed at the surface of the material. This structure is not particularly effective because it does not cause reduction of the RHR in regard to the untreated polymer. However, the curve profile is not exactly the same as that of the PA6,6 profile: the plasma coating shows a small protective effect after ignition (appearance of a peak between 100 and 150 s), which disappears when the thin layer cracks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that a thin layer of polysiloxane coating shows some effectiveness in the first minutes of fire, but it is too thin to have a long-time effect. This is why we developed an approach by combining a little amount of the fire-retardant additive (OP1230 in our case) and polysiloxane coating.</p>

<p>Looking at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0734904112449992">Table 9</xref>, it can be noticed that the best fire-retardant behaviour (V0 rating) is obtained for PA6,6 containing 8% GF OP1230 coated with a film with thickness of 11.7 µm. During the test, the structure of the polymer leads to the formation of a protective layer, which is reinforced by the polysiloxane coating.</p>
<p>The coating of a thin film (11.7 µm) of polysiloxanes on a PA6,6 fire retardant with a low amount of OP1230 (8%) shows an improvement of the classification at UL94 test. In theory, this experiment gives interesting results when the coating is thick enough. Even if the low-pressure cold plasma technique seems not really adapted for big panels, it could, however, be interesting for industries to apply it on small pieces, as this technique is well adapted for small dimensions. However, we did not test the application of such process on three-dimensional complex shape panels, and we, thus, cannot extrapolate if the coating will cover the whole sample homogeneously. This is why we decided to test another type of surface treatment: the use of a thin waterborne transparent intumescent varnish applied on the polyamide substrate.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0734904112449992">
<title>Surface treatment: waterborne intumescent varnish</title>
<p>Intumescent coatings and varnishes have had a large increase in use as a method of passive fire protection over the past few years. Their main purpose is to protect construction materials such as steel and wood in case of fire. Intumescent coatings provide passive fire protection and resist fire and avoid its passage and/or that of gaseous products of combustion. When heated above a critical temperature, the intumescent coating swells and forms an expanded charred layer acting as a physical barrier, which slows down heat and mass transfers between gas and condensed phase.</p>
<p>Intumescent coatings are very rarely applied on polymers, usually because of their bad adhesion. In previous articles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112449992">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734904112449992">15</xref></sup> we showed that by making a preliminary flame treatment on polypropylene, polypropylene composites and polycarbonate, a good adhesion of waterborne intumescent coatings and varnishes could be achieved, thus allowing the intumescent coating to protect efficiently the polymeric substrates in case of a fire. In fact, passing a flame very rapidly onto a surface allows cleaning it from organic residues, oxidizing it (creation of hydroxyl or carboxylic functions) and improving its wettability, thus enabling a good contact between the coating and the surface. Moreover, it does not degrade the polymer surface, and no change of colour or charring is observed.</p>
<p>In this study, we decided to work with a transparent waterborne intumescent varnish usually applied on wood. We did not add any primer or topcoat but first carried out a flame treatment on the polymer surface (PA6,6 GF).</p>

<p>The 100-µm-thick intumescent varnish is very efficient both on 0.8- and 1.6-mm-thick PA6,6 plates: the LOI values reach 52–54 vol.% for coated PA6,6 GF compared to 21 vol.% for pure PA6,6 GF. All samples reach the V0 ranking for UL94 test. However, one of our main criteria is also to pass the GWFI test at the maximum temperature, that is, 960°C. With a 100-µm-thick coating, we only reach 750°C, which is not sufficient for use as EEE. If we apply a 200-µm-thick coating, the GWFI test at 960°C is validated. However, since materials are 0.8 mm thick, the coating, applied on both sides, represents an excessively large increase (+50%).</p>
<p>This is why we decided, as previously described in the case of plasma-treated materials, to combine the bulk and surface treatment by incorporating a very low amount of OP1230 in PA6,6 GF and by coating it with the 100-µm-thick coating.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0734904112449992">
<title>Combination between fire-retardant additive and intumescent varnish</title>
<p>In that case, the OP1230 content in the PA6,6 GF was fixed at 5 wt.%. Indeed, it was previously reported that for PA6,6 GF 5% OP1230 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112449992">Table 3</xref>), the material is NC at UL94 and presents a low LOI value (26 vol.%). However, considering the intumescent coating as surface treatment, it was demonstrated that both UL94 and LOI can be sharply improved (V0 rating and LOI higher than 50 vol.%). That is why we have chosen 5% in this case and not 8%.</p>

<p>The addition of 5% of OP1230 to the formulation combined with the 100-µm-thick coating allows increasing the LOI to high values (63–65 vol.%), keeping the V0 ranking for samples of 0.8 and 1.6 mm thickness and validating the GWFI test at 960°C. It has to be highlighted that the results in terms of LOI are even better than those obtained with the formulation loaded with 23% of OP1230.</p>

<p>The 100-µm-thick intumescent coating allows reducing the RHR drastically. pRHR decreased by around 60% compared to the non-coated PA6,6 GF 5% OP1230 and by around 80% compared to the PA6,6 GF. The RHR of coated with PA6,6 GF 5% OP1230 shows a maximum value of around 100 kW/m<sup>2</sup> after 600 s, whereas the formulation PA6,6 GF 23% OP1230 shows a maximum value of 147 kW/m<sup>2</sup> after 200 s. The IT also increases: ignition begins at around 220 s for coated samples versus 54 s for non-coated materials loaded with 5% OP1230 and begins at 69 s for PA6,6 GF with 23% of OP1230. Only little differences are observed with and without OP1230 when the coating is applied: in terms of cone calorimetry, the results are even better without any bulk treatment.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the best formulation to be used as EEEs could be defined as a combination of 5% of OP1230 and 100-µm-thick intumescent varnish. For this formulation, the LOI is the highest (63%–65%), the sample is V0 rated at both 0.8 and 1.6 mm, the GWFI test is validated at 960°C and the sample shows excellent results during cone calorimeter test. The interest of this new approach is to combine two different mechanisms of action: a condensed phase mechanism through the formation of an intumescent barrier and the gas phase action of OP1230, which releases phosphorus-based radicals. We could have thought that the OP1230 action would be inhibited by the presence of the intumescent coating; however, it seems to play a complementary effect, particularly for LOI and GWFI test. It seems that when the intumescent barrier is crossed, the OP1230 takes over from it and releases the species allowing protecting the polymer at 960°C. A complementary study on the mechanisms involved will be published in another article.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed at developing new routes to fire retard PA6,6 for application as EEEs by combining two approaches : the incorporation of little amount of fire retardants in the bulk (in order to avoid the modification of the intrinsic properties of the polymer as much as possible) and a surface treatment.</p>
<p>The objective was to meet the severe criteria of EEE, that is, highest LOI values, a V0 ranking at UL94 test on 0.8- and 1.6-mm-thick samples and validation of the GWFI test at 960°C. We first showed that these properties are obtained by adding 23% of aluminium diethylphosphinate (OP1230) in the bulk, and our aim is to reduce this amount. Two different surface treatments were applied: a polysiloxane coating deposited using PECVD and a waterborne transparent intumescent varnish deposited by spraying.</p>
<p>Combining a 11.7-µm-thick polysiloxane coating with 8% of OP1230 added in the bulk allows validating the V0 ranking and the GWFI test at 960°C. However, in that case, the LOI is relatively low (34 vol.%). This is the reason why a second route was investigated, consisting of applying an intumescent varnish on the material. A 100-µm-thick coating is not sufficient enough to validate the GWFI test at 960°C on virgin PA6,6 GF, even if V0 ranking, high LOI values and excellent cone calorimeter test results are obtained. However, the incorporation of 5% of OP1230 in bulk, combined with the use of 100 µm intumescent coating, allows achieving the best performances: very high LOI values (63%–65%), V0 ranking on 0.8- and 1.6-mm-thick samples and GWFI test validated at 960°C. Moreover, this solution gives even better performances in terms of LOI values, IT and RHR than a 23% of OP1230–containing material.</p>
