<abstract>
<p>Interviews were completed with eight counseling psychologists who viewed their careers as a calling. Using the Consensual Qualitative Research guidelines, six domains emerged: definition, process of discerning, content of the calling, professional impact, personal impact, and maintenance. Generally, interviewees viewed the discernment of their calling as the result of an indirect route that included self-reflection, support from others, and an identified calling source. Interviewees generally viewed their calling as what one is meant to do, as something that evolved over time, as synonymous with one’s purpose in life, and as tied to helping or serving others. Generally, interviewees were satisfied with their personal and professional lives and noted that the calling positively impacted their daily work tasks and interpersonal relationships. Interviewees generally viewed their calling as an ongoing process, and they identified role models and supportive work environments that aided in maintaining their calling.</p>

<p>“I found my calling.” This phrase has become common nomenclature in American culture. But what exactly does it mean to find one’s calling? And through what kind of process does a person discern one? Despite the widespread popular use of the term, a growing body of literature suggests that those who truly perceive their work as a calling view their work differently than those who simply believe their work is a good fit for their skills and interests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1069072711436145">Wrzesniewski, 2010</xref>). However, little is known about the phenomenological process through which individuals develop and maintain a sense of calling. This lack of knowledge may be especially important to address, given studies finding that those living their calling tend to be satisfied with their work and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711436145">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711436145">Peterson, Park, Hall, &amp; Seligman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711436145">Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, &amp; Schwartz, 1997</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1069072711436145">Seligman (2002</xref>) noted in his book <italic>Authentic Happiness</italic>, following a calling may be one route to achieving a meaningful and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to qualitatively explore the meaning of “calling” and the process of discerning a calling with a group of counseling psychologists. This group was chosen for two main reasons. First, qualitative methodologists have recommended that for studies exploring a specific subject area, a homogenous population is most appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711436145">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>). Second, the job of a counseling psychologist has been characterized as a meaningful career which is often focused on helping others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1069072711436145">Forrest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1069072711436145">Vera &amp; Speight, 2003</xref>). Given the centrality of meaning and helping others in many definitions of calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>), we expected that this group may be especially inclined to view their careers in such a fashion. In the following sections, we discuss the limited, but growing, theoretical, and empirical work related to calling and make a case for why studying this construct in a qualitative manner may provide an important contribution.</p>
<sec id="section1-1069072711436145">
<title>Calling Background</title>
<p>In their review of the literature addressing the constructs calling and vocation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik and Duffy (2009</xref>) noted that these terms have existed for centuries and that calling has most often had religious connotations (e.g., called by God). However, a religious worldview is not a prerequisite for finding the terms relevant, and numerous authors have proposed nonreligious definitions of the construct. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik and Duffy (2009</xref>) explored the overlap among the diverse definitions in the literature and defined calling as,<disp-quote>
<p>a transcendent summons, experienced as originating beyond the self, to approach a particular life role (in this case work) in a manner oriented toward demonstrating or deriving a sense of purpose or meaningfulness and that holds other-oriented values and goals as primary sources of motivation. (p. 427)</p>
</disp-quote>
According to this definition, a calling to a particular career is believed to come from a force outside the person (e.g., God, a social need, a family legacy) and applies to areas of both paid and unpaid work that help others in some way and that also help provide, or are consistent with, a broader sense of meaning and purpose in life.</p>
<p>Empirical research on calling has been growing within the last 20 years, and most research has explored (a) how salient the construct is to certain populations, (b) how calling relates to career or work outcomes, and (c) how calling relates to well-being outcomes, such as life satisfaction and life meaning. With regard to salience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711436145">Duffy and Sedlacek (2010</xref>) distributed the Brief Calling Survey (BCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711436145">Dik, Eldridge, Steger, &amp; Duffy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711436145">Dik, Sargent, &amp; Steger, 2008</xref>) to over 5,000 undergraduate students. This survey assessed calling through 2 items: “I have a calling to a particular kind of work” and “I have a good understanding of my calling as it applies to my career.” The authors found that over 35% of students viewed each of these statements as mostly or totally true of themselves and found that the endorsement of a calling was extremely similar across gender and racial groups, and was moderately higher in students seeking advanced degrees. Similar and even higher prevalence rates have been found with other samples of college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711436145">Hunter, Dik, &amp; Banning, 2010</xref>) and in studies with working adults, where approximately one third tended to view their career as a calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711436145">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of existing research on calling has explored how it relates to career- and work-related outcomes. College students who endorse a calling have been found to be more decided and comfortable in their career decisions and have greater levels of vocational self-clarity, career decision self-efficacy, intrinsic work motivation, work hope, and academic satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711436145">Dik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711436145">Duffy, Allan, &amp; Dik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711436145">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711436145">Steger, Picking, Shin, &amp; Dik, 2010</xref>). Studies with adults in the teaching profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711436145">Serow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1069072711436145">Serow, Eaker, &amp; Ciechalski, 1992</xref>) and with general samples of working adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711436145">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1069072711436145">Duffy, Dik, &amp; Steger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711436145">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711436145">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>) have found that those endorsing a calling are significantly more satisfied with work and express greater levels of occupational identification, occupational commitment, occupational importance, work meaningfulness, work zest, and perceived organizational duty. The link of calling to career commitment and work meaning is especially pronounced for adults able to live out their calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9a-1069072711436145">Duffy, Bott, Allan, Torrey, &amp; Dik, 2012</xref>). </p>
<p>A few studies have examined how the presence of a calling relates to well-being, most often exploring links to life meaning and life satisfaction. With college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711436145">Duffy and Sedlacek (2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711436145">Steger, Picking, Shin, and Dik (2010)</xref> each found the endorsement of a calling to positively but weakly correlate with life satisfaction and to positively, moderately correlate with meaning in life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1069072711436145">Duffy, Allan, and Bott (2012)</xref> extended these findings and found life meaning and academic satisfaction to fully mediate the calling-life satisfaction relation. Slightly stronger relations have been found with working adults, as those who view their career as a calling tend to be moderately more satisfied with life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711436145">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711436145">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>). This result is perhaps institutive, since those actually living their career-related calling (working adults) would likely experience a stronger tie between calling and well-being than college students who have yet to enter the work world.</p>
<p>This brief review of the calling literature is meant to highlight two main points. First, across several studies, a substantial proportion of the populations studied thus far seem to view their career as a calling, and this is consistent for both college students and adults. Second, the presence of a calling appears to be related to positive work and personal outcomes. Those with a calling tend to display greater levels of career maturity, greater work commitment and satisfaction, and greater life meaning and satisfaction.</p>

<title>Studying Calling Qualitatively</title>
<p>All of the research reviewed above explored the calling construct in a quantitative manner, either by categorizing people based on how they view their work or by scaling their responses on continuous measures of calling. Each of these approaches contains a number of weaknesses, however. Studies using the categorization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1069072711436145">Davidson &amp; Caddell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711436145">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1069072711436145">Wrzesniewski et al., 1997</xref>) used author-developed descriptions representing a small number of ways to view one’s work (e.g., as a job, career, or calling) and classified participants using the option deemed most characteristic of them. Studies using the BCS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1069072711436145">Dik et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711436145">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1069072711436145">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1069072711436145">Duffy &amp; Sedlacek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1069072711436145">Steger et al., 2010</xref>) and other brief instruments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1069072711436145">Serow, 1994</xref>) primarily assessed the extent to which people viewed their career as a calling and often allowed each participant to interpret what this term actually means without documenting those personal meanings, potentially leading to unique response patterns among participants.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these simple methodological approaches are unable to capture the potentially complex ways that individuals define and live their calling, as well as the process by which individuals understand the career to which they perceive a calling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik and Duffy (2009</xref>) offer one, theoretically-based definition of calling, describing it as an external call to a meaningful and service-oriented career. But is this how individuals actually describe this term?</p>
<p>Two qualitative studies have examined the question of how people personally conceptualize calling using college student samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711436145">Hunter, Dik, and Banning (2010</xref>) used emergent quantitative document analysis to investigate open-ended written responses from 295 college students regarding how they defined calling and perceived its influence on their career development and nonwork roles. Results suggested that participants’ sense of calling originated from guiding forces, corresponded to a strong sense of fit and well-being, included prosocial values and motives, and was relevant for multiple life roles rather than only work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711436145">French and Domene (2010</xref>) examined perceptions of life calling using interviews with seven White, Christian, female university students. This group described the nature of their callings using five characteristics: an altruistic focus, intensity, a deep passion for the area to which they felt called, a sense of facilitating the discovering of a calling in others, and burdens of having a calling. Participants noted support from valued others, early exposure to relevant roles, and personal attributes (e.g., proactivity, tenacity, resiliency, and identity) as factors that facilitated the development of their callings.</p>
<p>Four other studies have used qualitative methods to explore aspects of calling using samples of working adults. Two studies have targeted Christian mothers in faculty positions and examined their experiences balancing their faculty work and motherhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1069072711436145">Sellers, Thomas, Batts, and Ostman (2005</xref>) found among their sample of 11 women that calling “denoted a sense of early recognition of God-given gifts and longings that manifested themselves later in life” as articulated in words such as “drive,” “passion,” “longing,” and “compelled,” (p. 201) when applied to the work role. When applied to motherhood, most women framed calling more in terms of their commitment to their children and their approach to parenting than to the decision to become a mother. They described their dual callings as complex and demanding, but as deeply satisfying and a source of gratitude. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1069072711436145">Oates, Hall, and Anderson (2005</xref>) analyzed interviews from 32 women, also Christian mothers in academia, and found that a sense of calling provided a sense of certitude, collaboration, and a context of purpose, which helped facilitate adaptive coping with interrole tension. Their sample described both internal (passion, interests, giftedness) and external (circumstances, God’s leading, social needs) influences on of their sense of calling, and described calling as providing a strong sense of commitment, a source of strength, and a healthy perspective on failure.</p>
<p>A third study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez, Foley, and Beitin (2011</xref>) explored the phenomenological process through which individuals discern and maintain a calling, using a sample of seven Roman Catholics (three male and four female) representing diverse occupations, whose source of calling was explicitly religious. For this sample, the process of discerning a calling arose from a mutual relationship with God, often coincided with a period of struggle with one’s faith, utilized supports such as prayer and other individuals, often involved both positive and negative emotional reactions, and impacted the participants’ families in both positive and negative ways.</p>
<p>Finally, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson and Thompson (2009</xref>) was completed on the experience of a calling among zookeepers. They reported, from a grounded theory analysis of interviews with 23 participants, that calling was viewed as a job “that one feels destined to fill by virtue of particular gifts, talents, and/or idiosyncratic life opportunities” (p. 39). They also found that calling provided zookeepers with a sense of identification, meaning, and importance as well as a sense of moral duty, personal sacrifice, and vigilance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1069072711436145">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>This group of six qualitative studies provides an important starting point for understanding the meaning and role of calling for those represented by the samples investigated thus far: college students, Christian women and mothers working in academia, Roman Catholic adults, and zookeepers. In the current study, we sought to build on this prior research by highlighting the experience of a calling from a previously unstudied occupational group-counseling psychologists. We also sought to study the complex, multifaceted experience of a calling in an individual’s life, beginning with simply understanding a participant’s personal interpretation of the term to more complexly learning how calling developed over time and how it is currently experienced. We believe that the ability of qualitative research to capture this developmental process will provide rich data on the role of calling in an individual’s life.</p>

<title>Interviewees</title>
<p>Eight counseling psychologists were interviewed. The group was evenly divided between males and females as well as across job settings, with half of the participants working primarily in academic faculty positions and the other half working primarily in practice settings. Seven of the participants identified as White/Caucasian and one identified at White/Latino. Four participants had no religious affiliation, one identified as Roman Catholic, one identified as Christian/Protestant, one identified as Unitarian Universalist, and one identified as Catholic with Buddhist tendencies. Interviewees had an average age of 44.75 years (range 31–59) and had an average of 11.88 years in the field since earning their doctoral degrees (range 3–22).</p>

<sec id="section7-1069072711436145">
<title>Research team</title>
<p>The research team was made up of seven individuals: a 54-year-old White female, a 29-year-old White male, a 35-year-old White female, a 33-year-old White male, a 33-year-old White male, a 33-year-old White female, and a 26-year-old multiracial female. Three members on the team are currently faculty at counseling psychology programs, one is currently faculty within a general psychology program, and three members are currently doctoral students in counseling psychology programs. Four team members had previously conducted qualitative studies (two had used Consensual Qualitative Research [CQR]), and three team members had no experience with qualitative research. All team members read the 1997 and 2005 CQR articles by Hill and colleagues and the team met several times prior to commencing interviews to ensure that all members had a strong knowledge of the methodology.</p>
<p>Following the CQR guidelines developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1069072711436145">Hill, Thompson, and Williams (1997</xref>), and recently updated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711436145">Hill et al. (2005</xref>), prior to developing the interview protocol the research team discussed their own assumptions and biases about the term calling as well as how this term applies to their careers. Most of the team felt that a calling had to do with careers that were oriented toward helping others, and two team members felt that some sort of summons was part of a calling. Three members of the team currently viewed their career as a calling, one member felt called to work with underserved populations, one member was searching for a calling, and two members did not define their career as a calling.</p>

<title>Interview protocol</title>
<p>The research team worked together to assemble a semistructured interview protocol consisting of six general themes. These included career background, definition of calling, the process of learning/developing one’s calling, the current experience of calling in one’s life, the impact of calling on one’s personal and work life, and the process by which the individual maintains her or his calling. Guided by previous qualitative research on calling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez, Foley, &amp; Beitin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1069072711436145">Hunter et al., 2010</xref>), we developed a series of general questions (i.e., How has answering the call affected your personal and professional life?) and a number of potential follow-up questions to help the interview fully elicit each participant’s experiences (e.g., How has your calling influenced the jobs you have chosen? What impact, if any, has having a calling had on your quality of life?). At the end of the interview, participants were asked what the process was like of completing the interview and if they had anything else they would like to share. Prior to conducting the formal interviews, the interview protocol was pilot tested with two individuals in the counseling profession, and minor adjustments were made based on their feedback.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section12-1069072711436145">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>We sought to interview individuals who (a) had graduated with a PhD in counseling psychology and (b) described their career as a calling. Similar to previous research with psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1069072711436145">Jennings &amp; Skovholt, 1999</xref>), we used a nomination approach to secure participants. First, we e-mailed 12 academic training directors at counseling psychology doctoral programs and asked them to nominate graduates who they felt may view their career as a calling. Through this method, 15 people were nominated. Second, we consulted with counseling psychologists with scholarly or clinical interests related to this topic and asked them for nominations; through this method, 10 people were nominated. The individuals who were nominated were contacted by the primary investigator via e-mail and told about the purpose of the study. Those expressing an interest in participating were then sent a copy of the interview protocol to review and assess if they felt fully able to participate. Of the initial 25 people contacted, a final total of eight individuals responded to the request and agreed to participate. This sample size met the criteria proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711436145">Hill et al. (2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1069072711436145">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Participants were interviewed over the phone by one of the two doctoral students in counseling psychology, after giving their informed consent. Each interview took approximately 1 hour and participants were given the opportunity to make any additional comments at the end of the formal questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1069072711436145">
<title>Transcription</title>
<p>All phone interviews were audio recorded and transcription was completed by a masters student in counselor education, who is currently a doctoral student in counseling psychology.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1069072711436145">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The CQR analytic strategies proposed by Hill et al. in 1997, and updated recently by Hill et al. in 2005, were used to code and interpret the interview data.</p>
<sec id="section16-1069072711436145">
<title>Coding of domains</title>
<p>The coding of domains commenced with each member of the coding team (the first four authors) independently reviewing the same two transcripts. The team then met and, through consensus, developed an initial list of primary domains. All additional transcripts were reviewed independently and then changes to the domain list were made based on consensus reached at team meetings. After developing a final domain list, the first two initial interviews were reviewed again to ensure all transcripts fit under the constructed domains. Afterward, all remaining transcripts were reviewed individually by team members and discussed in coding meetings until group consensus was reached. All text other than demographic information within each interview was coded under a specific domain, although two domains identified were not related to the research questions. These included general narrative comments about the sequence of jobs the participants may have held (which we coded as career path) and feedback to the interviewers about the interview process itself. These domains were eliminated from further coding, leaving six primary domains. The six primary domains were (1) Definition, (2) Process of discerning, (3) Content of the calling, (4) Professional impact, (5) Personal impact, and (6) Maintenance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1069072711436145">
<title>Coding of core ideas</title>
<p>The coding of core ideas commenced with each member of the coding team once again independently reviewing the same two transcripts and searching for more concise descriptions, or core ideas, within the primary domains. The research team met and discussed these two interviews and came to consensus with a list of core ideas under each domain. Each team member then proceeded to independently code the remaining six interviews for core ideas. Identical to the process we used for domain coding, the research team met and came to consensus on the core ideas for each interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1069072711436145">
<title>Cross analysis</title>
<p>The research team independently reviewed each interview and then worked collaboratively to group the core ideas within the primary domain across all cases. Interviews were reviewed by each team member, categories were created that best represented the core ideas, and through consensus among team members these categories were given appropriate labels. The categories went through several revisions as all of the interviews were reviewed, and categories that were represented by just one case were removed. A final list of categories was developed after each member of the research team felt all interview data was appropriately represented. Each of the categories was then coded as general (all or all but one case), typical (more than half of the cases), and variant (half or fewer of the cases).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1069072711436145">
<title>Auditing</title>
<p>After the coding process was complete, the auditor provided comments and suggestions. The auditor was an advanced assistant professor in a counseling psychology program with expertise in the research area and qualitative research. The auditor reviewed several interviews and assessed the validity of the domains, core ideas, and categories. Auditor comments and suggestions were discussed by the research team and, once consensus was reached based on these comments, this feedback was incorporated into the final list of domains, core ideas, and categories.</p>

<title>Definition</title>
<p>The <italic>definition</italic> domain referred to how interviewees defined what the term <italic>calling</italic> meant to them. Typically, interviewees viewed a calling as something they were meant to do and as synonymous with one’s purpose in life. For example, one participant stated, “It does still feel very intertwined with me, with what you believe, you know, our purpose is on the earth.” Interviewees also typically viewed their definition of calling as something that changes or develops over time. For example, one participant stated,<disp-quote>
<p>What I used to think was, you got this stack of phone messages, like God would tap you on the shoulder and this was my plan … So what I think about now, after thinking about it quite a bit and having all this experience, it much more seems to me that it’s two things. And part of that is having that kind of small voice that is guiding you in a certain way, but also situations or opportunities present themselves in a way that also lead you in that direction.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1069072711436145">
<title>Process of Discerning</title>
<p>The <italic>process of discerning</italic> domain contained more categories than the other domains and referred to interviewees’ descriptions of the process by which they discovered, found, or learned their calling. Generally, interviewees noted support from other individuals throughout the process. For example, one interviewee stated, “Even in my discerning process I’ve been in touch with, and had contact with, and been inspired by men and women who have found their calling and discerning and been encouraging me to.” Interviewees generally noted that the path to discovering their calling was indirect, often containing other career paths before they understood what they were called to. When discussing the feeling of being called to a career as a psychologist, one interviewee stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I had no idea that was a job someone could have and I thought, well, what do I like better than sitting getting to know people and talking with them? It just seemed like, well my goodness, where has this been all my life? But it took a while. It took a while to really let myself fully embrace that because I had come to college to be an Accounting major.</p>
</disp-quote>
Additionally, interviewees generally recognized a specific source of their calling, which ranged from a higher power to the needs of society. In response to an interview question about the source of the calling, two example quotes for this category include, “Well, I would say God” and, “You know, as I think about that, I’m not sure how this will sound but: the universe. There’s an aspect of this that for me is absolutely spiritual.” Finally, participants generally noted using self-reflection as a mechanism to understand their calling. One participant stated, “I got into college and had more of an awareness of my own personal development and realized that there’s a lot going on with me that I need to figure out here.”</p>
<p>Along with these general responses, participants typically noted struggles in finding their calling. For example, one participant stated,<disp-quote>
<p>Here was the situation where it was different. There were barriers, but I still really had to decide, do I pursue it, is this for me? It seemed like things really aren’t going my way now and I really had to work towards this goal and is it really for me?</p>
</disp-quote>
Participants also typically noted that part of the process was trying to figure out what was natural or what one was supposed to be doing. A response that illustrates this point is, “It feels good; the word that comes to mind is like a ‘clicking’.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1069072711436145">
<title>Content of the Calling</title>
<p>The domain with the fewest categories concerned what interviewees believed was their individual calling. That is, what exactly did our interviewees believe they were called to do? Of the four coded categories, only one was generally stated by all interviewees: being a support to others and/or helping others. The following quotes from three interviewees are used to illustrate this category: “To some extent, my calling is about helping people wake up and be connected to themselves and how they feel, and for them to be able to use that in helpful and adaptive ways,” “All these people suffering in the world and a big part of the calling is to try and do something about that,” and, “I think it’s to help people, you know in the most general terms. And more specifically, I think it’s to listen to people and to be there for them.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1069072711436145">
<title>Professional Impact</title>
<p>The <italic>professional impact</italic> domain referred to the impact of having a calling on interviewees’ professional lives. Generally, participants were satisfied with their work and/or felt blessed to be in the professional situation they were in. One interviewee noted, “You know, I feel really satisfied with sort of where I am and what I’m doing right now. I feel really fortunate to have the kind of the balance that I have.” Interviewees generally felt their calling had an impact on how they performed counseling or research activities. An example response is,<disp-quote>
<p>We all bring our own life experiences as a therapist or counselor, so I bring my own experience. Part of my experience has been changing careers and making a choice that is more aligned with my values and what I believe I am created to be about. So I think it influences my work in regard to how I might work with someone to increase their perception of options and that they have choices.</p>
</disp-quote>
Typically, interviewees expressed high levels of work passion, energy, and productivity. For example, one participant stated, “Right now, I've never been so productive with research in my entire life.” Participants also typically felt that their calling was the centerpiece of their professional identity and felt that their work was a good fit for their skills, values, and interests. One interviewee noted, “My identity feels so wedded to it and I wonder how it feels different to those [for whom] it is just kind of a job,” and another noted, “I found a place where my values match up with the values of the institution.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1069072711436145">
<title>Personal Impact</title>
<p>The <italic>personal impact</italic> domain referred to the impact of having a calling on interviewees’ lives outside of work. Generally, interviewees were satisfied with their lives and/or felt blessed and typically endorsed a sense of fulfillment. One interviewee stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I think there is a lot to be said for coming alive and being alive and when I'm able to make myself resonate with whatever it is I'm called to and to really get in touch with it; it's actually really nice. I have a lot of contentment, satisfaction, and a lot of joy.</p>
</disp-quote>
Another stated, “I think I have a really great life. I feel really fortunate.” Interviewees generally reported that having a calling positively impacted their interpersonal relationships, although they also typically reported that their calling sometimes had a negative impact on others in their lives. For example, noting the positive impact, one interviewee noted,<disp-quote>
<p>Well, for me, my relationships are better. I think I’m a little more at peace with myself because I feel like I’m doing something that’s worthwhile and that creates meaning in my life so I'm easier to be around than I was before.</p>
</disp-quote>
Conversely, noting the negative impact of following a calling, another stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I had hoped that I could have provided a better life for my wife…This is just a hang up that I’ve had and a personal one. I’ve drug her from one place to another and it just gets colder each round and she hates cold weather.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1069072711436145">
<title>Maintenance</title>
<p>The final domain, <italic>maintenance</italic>, concerned how participants fostered their calling over time. Generally, participants viewed calling as a process, not something that one just finds “once and for all” but as something that one further discovers and adapts over time. Two quotes to illustrate this point include, “It’s always a process, I don’t think you ever arrive,” and, “I think the question that comes up for me sometimes is ‘what’s next?’” Participants also generally identified role models whom they could look to for guidance and supportive work environments that served to foster the calling. For example, one participant stated,<disp-quote>
<p>You know, it's funny, I think of a woman that I worked with who reminds me of my dad (who was a psychologist) in some ways, and it kind of comes full circle. She really values the social justice component and not only to help within the counseling center, but I think our center is really trying to push outreach and really getting themselves out onto the campus and helping in just little ways. So it's kind of like how my father practiced, so that’s a really good role model and something I’m working on.</p>
</disp-quote>
When discussing the role of her supportive work environment in maintaining the calling, another participant stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I think it really sort of reinforces it. I was really lucky to happen into a sublease in an office with three incredible psychologists. They are all really different and they’ve been together leasing this office space for many years so they know each other really well but they are really different and I love them. And I don’t know if I would be feeling as settled and satisfied if I didn’t have that.</p>

<sec id="section27-1069072711436145">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of the present study was to deeply explore the experience of a calling among a group of counseling psychologists. Indeed, the results highlight the rich and diverse ways in which participants described what a calling is and the ways in which it impacts their lives, yet also reveals convergent themes. In the following sections, we discuss several of the major themes that emerged from the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1069072711436145">
<title>The Meaning of Calling</title>
<p>Participants were asked how they defined the term calling, and perhaps the most striking finding from the definition domain was that no general category emerged. Specifically, no single category was endorsed by all or all but one of the participants. For our participants, definitions of calling were unique, and in particular the religious or spiritual notions of calling (often described as the traditional foundations of the construct) were variant responses. The typical responses of a calling as consonant with one’s purpose in life and what one is meant to do fit well with both colloquial and scholarly uses of the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1069072711436145">Duffy, 2006</xref>) and is synonymous with findings from previous qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>). Additionally, the typical response of the definition of calling changing over time suggests that for the majority of our participants, how they view the term now is different than in the past, and may in turn be different in the future.</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to describe what they were currently called to do. Here, a general theme emerged of a being called to help or serve others. This was a theme endorsed by all eight of our participants and speaks to an altruistically rooted view of one’s calling. It is noticeable that serving others emerged as the only general category, and that only three other categories were apparent under this domain, all of which were variant. This suggests that serving others was the dominant calling for our participants, a result that converges well with previous scholarship that has tied calling to prosocial motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik &amp; Duffy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez, et al., 2011</xref>). As counseling psychologists work in a helping profession (counseling, teaching, advising, etc.), this finding may not be surprising. An important direction for further research is to explore how the meaning of a calling differs across professions, especially those that are not explicitly defined in terms of helping others.</p>
<sec id="section29-1069072711436145">
<title>Calling as a Process</title>
<p>For all of our participants, the path or process to understanding their calling was complex, and this domain not only had the most categories but also was represented by the greatest volume of text in the interviews. In our initial coding meetings, we had included a core idea of “realizing one’s calling during a critical episode,” as some of the participants in the interviews we coded first described rather significant events in their lives, and our team expected that some of the participants may report a onetime profound experience that made them understand their calling. Ultimately, this expectation proved inaccurate. While many of the participants described significant experiences that cumulatively drew them toward their calling, none of them reported a single dramatic event as their primary path to discerning a calling, and all discussed the discernment of their calling as a process that unfolded over time.</p>
<p>The discernment process generally occurred through an indirect route and typically contained struggles. Participants generally tried out different majors, jobs, or career paths before learning their calling and (often in part because these paths were not their calling) typically described struggles during this process. These struggles included being dissatisfied with jobs, careers, or majors, financial or familial barriers that could prevent following one’s calling, and a lack of clarity over what career path can best facilitate living one’s calling. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez et al. (2011</xref>), who also found that individuals generally described struggles in discerning the calling. However, the process was not only made up of roadblocks or struggles, but also of support and self-reflection. Participants generally reported looking inwardly to discern their calling. Often, this involved reflecting on how one’s interests, values, and skills could best match a career they were meant to do, thereby leading to a life of purpose and the ability to serve others. Participants also generally reported support in their discernment process, often from friends, family, and mentors encouraging the participants to seek their calling, which again is consistent with the findings from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1069072711436145">French &amp; Domene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, participants generally noted a specific source of their calling. Most often these sources were external to the individuals, such as God or a higher power, the universe, or society in general. This finding matches up well with the external source or “transcendent summons” component of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1069072711436145">Dik and Duffy’s (2009)</xref> definition of calling. Overall, for our participants, the process of discerning one’s calling took time, was a circuitous path that often involved struggles, and contained both internal (e.g. self-reflection) and external (support from others, outside source) components.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1069072711436145">
<title>Calling Impact</title>
<p>As all the participants in this study viewed their current career as a calling, we were able to explore more deeply how this impacts their personal and professional lives. Overall, participants viewed their calling as affecting their lives in much more positive than negative ways. Generally, our participants were satisfied with their jobs and lives and/or reported feeling blessed for being in the position they are in, and typically felt a sense of fulfillment. A majority of our participants exuded a sense of enthusiasm and vigor for the work they were doing that tied directly to their calling and specifically discussed how well their job fits with their personality. These results match findings from previous quantitative research, in which those with a calling tend to be more satisfied in work and life and more enthusiastic about their jobs than those with other approaches to work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson &amp; Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1069072711436145">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1069072711436145">Peterson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of the calling also extended beyond participants’ feelings and into their experiences of their work tasks and interpersonal relationships. The calling generally impacted how participants approached the main tasks associated with their work settings, which in our sample was either counseling or research and teaching. Most often, participants reported placing a greater focus on serving or helping others through their professional activities as a result of their calling. The calling had both positive (general) and negative (typical) effects on our participants’ personal relationships. A number of participants described the interpersonal push and pull that existed as a result of their callings. It seemed that although the calling helped participants feel more centered and fulfilled, leading to more positive relations with others, it often resulted in work overload and stress as a result of feeling so passionate about their career. For some participants, similar to results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1069072711436145">Bunderson and Thompson (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1069072711436145">Hernandez et al. (2011</xref>), there was also a concern that following the calling was not as financially rewarding and these issues led to interpersonal struggles. Overall, however, the positives of living one’s calling far outweighed the negative for our participants and had a beneficial impact on participants’ professional and personal lives.</p>

<sec id="section31-1069072711436145">
<title>Calling Maintenance</title>
<p>Finally, we attempted to gain a deeper understanding of how participants maintained their calling as we were curious about the ways they were able to keep it alive and consistent. Generally, our participants viewed their callings as an open-ended process and not as something they found once and were trying to keep in its original form. This was a key point, as there may be a preconceived idea that once one discerns a calling she or he tries to hold onto it, akin to starting a fire and having the goal of keeping the fire alive. This was certainly not the case for our participants. Instead, many of our participants expressed enthusiasm over how their calling might change in the future and discussed keeping their eyes open for new ways to express that to which they are called. This result was perhaps unsurprising, given the finding that participants typically saw the very definition of calling as something that could mature and grow over time. This is consistent with quantitative research that has found a strong correlation between measures of the presence of, and search for, a calling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1069072711436145">Dik et al., 2012</xref>); it seems having a calling means seeking ways new ways to live out or enhance that calling. Simply put, our participants viewed maintaining their callings as less about preserving and more about remaining open, adapting, and growing.</p>
<p>A major factor facilitating the positive adaptation and growth of our participants’ calling was support from others, either in the form of a healthy work environment or role models. Role models were generally described by participants and often used as guides for how the participants approached work. Additionally, our participants generally discussed positive aspects of their work environment, such as supportive coworkers, flexible schedules, and accommodating administrators who allowed for a participant to freely live out her or his calling. This point was highlighted in a few participants’ process domain, where they indicated that their calling was only realized once they were in a healthy work environment. Overall, participants viewed their callings as a work in progress and as best facilitated by identified role models and supportive work environments. </p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The results and conclusions from the present study need to be considered in light of a number of limitations, several of which point to important directions for future research. First and foremost, this was a qualitative study that deeply focused on a relatively homogenous sample of eight individuals in one specific occupation. Like any qualitative study, the transferability of results must be considered in light of the sample at hand. However, these results may offer ideas for future researchers to investigate, such as how calling is experienced in other professions and how calling relates to work-related and general well-being outcomes in more diverse samples. Second, the sample size was at the low end of the range suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711436145">Hill et al. (2005</xref>) and was comprised of counseling psychologists in only counseling or research/teaching positions. It is important to note, however, that studies using in depth interviews with homogenous samples are the studies in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1069072711436145">Hill et al. (2005</xref>) view smaller samples as most acceptable. Third, the sample was predominantly White. More research is needed that explores the role of calling cross-culturally, especially among those from minority groups, those from non-American countries, and those from lower and working class backgrounds.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>The eight counseling psychologists interviewed for this study painted a rich and complex picture of the experience of calling in their lives. The process of discerning and living one’s calling was often complicated, with barriers and missteps along the way. But just as often this journey was laden with deep self-reflection and support from others, and ultimately a specific source of this calling was identified. Interviewees differed on how they defined a calling, but they were in agreement in how their calling was expressed: helping and serving others. Perhaps most importantly, the experience of a calling had a positive impact on the professional and personal lives of the interviewees, as well as a generally positive impact on interpersonal relationships. Even after attaining a calling, interviewees continued to view their calling as a process and were aided in this process by supportive work environments and role models.</p>
<p>The significance of this study lies in its ability to capture a complex process among a select occupation and to further lay the groundwork for the study of the construct. Future research may explore the ways in which the definitions of calling and the discernment and maintenance processes unfold for those in different fields of work, as well as for those from more diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. While the term <italic>calling</italic> has become part of the common vernacular, this study supports a unique and special meaning of this construct for those who feel they have been called to their careers. This study and others like it may serve as a starting point for practitioners working with those seeking to discern a calling to specific career, which may unfold in a less structured and planned way than may have traditionally been viewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1069072711436145">Dik, Duffy, &amp; Eldridge, 2009</xref>). Counseling psychologists, career counselors, and those who train these professionals would do well to develop increased awareness and knowledge of these pathways, and eventually to identify and develop the specific skills needed to assist those whose career search is leading them toward a higher purpose.</p>
