<abstract>
<p>The title of this article is inspired by a question raised by Herman Melville in the face of the first American “immigration crisis” occasioned by the Irish potato famine of the 1840s. On this basis, this article discusses arguments on behalf of “open borders.” Although under present world circumstances this is not realistic, this stance remains vital for a normative discussion of immigration policies.</p>

<p>My provocative title “Why Not the Whole World?” is borrowed from Herman Melville, who, having recently served on an immigrant ship during the “Great Hunger,” proclaims in the novel <italic>Redburn</italic>, published when the Know-Nothing movement had made its appearance on the American political scene,
<disp-quote>
<p>Let us waive that agitated national topic, as to whether such multitudes of foreign poor should be landed on our American shores; let us waive it, with the one only thought that if they can get here, they have God’s right to come; though they bring all Ireland and her miseries with them. For the whole world is the patrimony of the whole world; there is no telling who does not own a stone in the Great Wall of China. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212443821">Melville, 1849/1976</xref>, p. 382).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Adjusting for language, Melville’s position evokes that of today’s “Rawlsian Cosmopolitans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212443821">1</xref></sup> Its adherents do not include Rawls himself, who, when he belatedly theorized about justice at the global level, abandoned the “veil of ignorance” incorporated in the original position devised to construct his theory of justice (so as to prevent facts about citizens, notably their location in the society’s stratification system, from influencing the instructions they give to their representatives; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212443821">Rawls, 1999</xref>, pp. 529-564). Consequently, in a Rawlsian perspective, you don’t know if you were born a man, or woman, of what color, of what level of wealth but you <bold><italic>do</italic></bold> know whether you are part of the U.S. population, <bold><italic>or</italic></bold> of Haiti’s, which language you speak, and which religion you profess, and will presumably instruct your representatives accordingly.</p>
<p>Charles Beitz, Thomas Pogge, and Linda Bosniak,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212443821">2</xref></sup> among others, have criticized Rawls for arbitrarily limiting the original position of liberalism to the “domestic” level; I shall not examine their arguments in detail, nor consider whether Rawls’s response is satisfactory or not for a general theory of justice, since that is not my present topic. But I do believe any consideration of our obligations toward refugees must take into consideration the more general context of immigration policy within which they are to be carried out. This is particularly relevant to the issue of refugee settlement or resettlement in the relatively affluent societies of Europe, North America, as well as Australasia and Japan.</p>
<p>More immediately relevant, for the present purpose, Joseph H. Carens, in a 1987 article, insisted on applying the “veil of ignorance” concept to a normative evaluation of international migration practices by formulating an argument on behalf of “open borders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443821">Carens, 1987</xref>). Carens thereby fundamentally reoriented the normative debate on international migration by positing an ideal world in which borders would not prevent movement. As he explained in subsequent publications, he adopted that position to be able to criticize present conditions from a normative perspective, in full awareness that the cosmopolitan stance was not realistic. I agree with Carens that such an exercise is required for a normative discussion of immigration policies and shall therefore follow suit.</p>
<p>I begin by briefly considering the significance of international migration in a Hobbesian world of sovereign states and the impact of these Hobbesian dynamics on human movement. In the second section, I demonstrate that this Hobbesian perspective generated persistent attempts to create an international border-control regime and a division of publics into two camps, cosmopolitans and nationalists. In the third section, I examine in greater detail how this division manifests itself in the contemporary world. And in a concluding section, I estimate the consequences of more open border in the contemporary world.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764212443821">
<title>International Migration in a Hobbesian World</title>
<p>From a demographic perspective, the outward and inward movement of persons is one of the constitutive processes of any population entity, be it a local community or a country, the others being birth and death. But the demographic perspective does not help us understand how in the modern world, movement from one country to another differs from all other kinds of movement. Rather, this is a function of the political organization of the world into mutually exclusive territorial spaces, each tagged as all or part of a sovereign state. International migration therefore does not constitute “movement” only, but relocation from one sovereignty to another even if it involves the mere crossing of a bridge (as in the notorious case of movement from Ciudad Juárez in Mexico to El Paso, Texas, which I experienced repeatedly while doing military service at Fort Bliss, outside of El Paso; and less colorfully, the commuting process linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan).</p>
<p>The much more numerous temporary entries by travelers into a country, even when they involve the same displacement, do not amount to migration and are always distinguished from them in official statistics, even if in some cases they turn into unauthorized immigration by way of “overstaying.”</p>
<p>Viewed from this angle, international migration is a historically bound political phenomenon, arising from the advent of territorial sovereignty as the dominant form of modern political organization, usually associated with the European-dominant 17th century, and in particular the Treaty of Westphalia. That is what I mean by a “Hobbesian world.” The 17th century was still an era of high mortality, and hence slow population growth. Economic production of any sort was labor-intensive, as was international conflict; population was in effect a scarce commodity; hence state rulers were more concerned with keeping their subjects <bold>in</bold> than with preventing others from entering the realm, unless they did so in the course of an invasion.</p>
<p>Both then and now, international migration differs essentially from the process whereby individuals constantly redistribute themselves across space by moving short or long distances <bold><italic>within</italic></bold> the state under whose authority they fall. The distinctiveness of <bold><italic>international</italic></bold> migration arises not from the nature of the movement, but rather from the change of jurisdiction from one sovereign state to another. If the transfer becomes permanent, it constitutes a deviation from the norm in terms of which the world is politically organized. That norm prevails not only in the popular conception of a “normal” world consisting of countries considered as natural entities but also in the conceptual apparatus of most of the social sciences for both empirical and normative analysis.</p>
<p>In relation to this, the distinctiveness of the cosmopolitan perspective in normative discussion was identified nearly a century ago by Henry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212443821">Sidgwick (1919)</xref> at the time of what we now recognize as a first phase of globalization.</p>
<p>Sidgwick himself did not fully endorse the cosmopolitan perspective. He did do so with respect to trade, asserting that the economic argument on behalf of free trade “is now generally admitted as decisive” and that the cosmopolitan principle should be adhered to, apart from limited military considerations, to the contrary (p. 303).</p>
<p>As for immigration, he argued that to the extent it involves the movement of labor, immigration is an aspect of trade, to which the same rule would apply. In keeping with this, free immigration “is a recognized feature of the ideal which orthodox political economists have commonly formed of international relations” since to fully realize the advantage of freedom of exchange “it is necessary that labour should move with perfect ease from country to country to meet the changes that are continually likely to occur in the industrial demand for it” (p. 303).</p>
<p>However, at this point Sidgwick abruptly rejects the “cosmopolitan point of view” on behalf of the “national ideal.” His justification for doing so is grounded in an earlier discussion of membership and his conception of what a later social scientist might term “the prerequisites of a national society.” He goes on to suggest that the cosmopolitan position “is perhaps the ideal of the future; but it allows too little for the national and patriotic sentiments which . . . appear to be at present indispensable for social well-being.” Because sentiments of common humanity are not widely shared, “the casual aggregates that might result from perfectly unrestrained immigration would lack internal cohesion.” Under these circumstances, “the governmental function of promoting moral and intellectual culture might be rendered hopelessly difficult by the continual inflowing streams of alien immigrants, with diverse moral habits and religious traditions,” and “a large intermixture of immigrants brought up under different institutions might inevitably introduce corruption and disorder into a previously well-ordered state” (p. 309). Without entering into details, let us note that Sidgwick’s justification for the shift of perspective is very similar to that of Carens’s critics, notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212443821">Isbister (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212443821">Meilaender (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>At the time Sidgwick originally formulated his normative approach to state policy (1891), issues arising from immigration and its consequences were moving to the top of the political agenda in both Europe and North America. Adoption of the national perspective led to the creation of a restrictive international migration regime whose dynamics provide a baseline for understanding the present situation despite significant modification in the post–World War II era. The late-19th-century crisis erupted as a result of a concatenation of factors, mostly related to the progress of industrial capitalism. They included, most notably, a transportation revolution, combining the railroad and the iron steamship; the further expansion of the geographical domain of the “great transformation,” involving the commercialization of land and labor, to encompass nearly the whole earth by way of trade; and the more active penetration by Europeans and their overseas descendants into Asia, Africa, and South America. Concurrently, demographic growth took off in consequence of the declining death rate—largely attributable to the spread of immunization against major diseases—in regions with hitherto relatively stagnant populations, particularly Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as parts of Asia.</p>
<p>These processes uprooted huge rural populations, subjecting them simultaneously to the necessity of moving to find work in urban centers within their own countries or abroad, and providing them with the capacity to do so. Following the pattern of Western Europe in the first half of the century, they also prompted most governments to reduce barriers against the free exit of their citizens, or even to encourage their departure so as to reduce the burden of welfare, lower social tensions, and obtain foreign exchange. The leading countries’ demand for cheap, disposable, and reputedly “docile” labor, such as foreign workers from less developed countries, increased substantially as well, not only in the overseas settlement countries but now also within industrializing Europe itself. However, the supply steadily grew much larger than the demand, leaving the receivers to face a surfeit of newcomers, of whom a substantial number sought to remain in the destination country and relocate their families there. But this was contrary to the interests of the receiving states, which sought to develop measures to prevent such settlement. As I put it in an essay some years ago, workers were “wanted but not welcome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212443821">Zolberg, 1987</xref>, pp. 36). To go back to Sidgwick, in an economic perspective, they were wanted as labor, but not welcome as potential members of the society.</p>
<p>Perceptions of immigration as a “problem” were exacerbated by the increasing diversity of the arrivals, which entailed greater “cultural distance” from the receivers and hence lent credibility to arguments about their unassimilability, and the reduction of fertility among the receiving populations, which precipitated fears of population decline and a concomitant swamping of natives by immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212443821">Zolberg, 2006b</xref>, pp. 199-243). Debated within the framework of the then prevailing racialist ideational structures, this reinforced existing prejudices and stimulated a proliferation of xenophobic myths, such as the Protocol of the Elders of Zion and Sax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu novels. In the overseas countries, including the United States, fears of invasion initially focused on the Chinese, trickling in from an immense reserve of more than 400 million, whose apparent willingness to work for low wages and under dreadful conditions was expected to depress conditions for White workers.</p>
<p>Although the determination to dam the incoming tide was undoubtedly amplified by anti-Oriental prejudices, the arguments developed to justify restrictions against the Chinese were shortly applied to other groups as well, notably Europeans from the East (including, but by no means only, Jews) and South. Britain and Germany closed their gates early on—with Britain nevertheless ensuring a continuing flow of labor from Ireland that was incorporated willy-nilly into the United Kingdom, whereas Germany innovated institutionally by recruiting Polish “guest workers,” subject to tight controls to prevent their permanent settlement. France—because of its precocious achievement of “zero population growth,” which triggered security as well as economic concerns—was the major European exception and actively encouraged foreign immigration not only of culturally similar neighbors, notably Italians in the south and Belgians in the north, but also Eastern Europeans, notably Poles; consequently, as of 1930, it had the same proportion of foreign-born as the United States.</p>

<title>Building an International Wall</title>
<p>Well under way on the eve of World War I, the movement to build a wall around the “West” was vastly strengthened by the outbreak of international conflict and revolutionary upheavals, which simultaneously amplified the “push” factors and provided additional reasons of strategic and political security for protecting oneself against the invasion. Most prominently, in the United States the movement to enact a literacy requirement for immigrants, advocated since the 1880s as a measure to reduce arrivals from Eastern and Southern Europe, finally succeeded in 1917 over President Wilson’s second veto.</p>
<p>As the reliance by nearly all states on mass armies enhanced the importance of cultural integration of the rural and urban masses, homogeneity acquired greater value, and immigrants were assessed in terms of their putative assimilability into the dominant national culture. This in turn further enhanced the instrumental value of racialist frameworks founded on the erroneous theory that culture was inherent in “blood” and well-nigh impossible to alter. The effects were mutually reinforcing. Aware of the global situation, decision makers in each of the individual states concerned viewed enhanced border control as necessary because of increased “migration pressure” occasioned by the closing of doors elsewhere. The fear of acting too late triggered anticipatory moves, and thereby unleashed an upward spiral of restriction founded to the extent possible on “remote control,” that is, control at the point of departure. Obviously, this was much easier to accomplish when it involved ocean crossing in a closed container such as a ship. Simultaneously national and international, these dynamics resulted in the emergence of a restrictive international migration regime, with zero immigration as its normative baseline. In effect, the basic question was not “Why not the whole world?” but “Why anyone at all?”</p>
<p>The most visible consequence of this development was a drastic reduction of immigration into the world’s affluent countries, and since this constituted a large part of ongoing flows, of international migration more generally. Beyond this, however, adoption of the “zero baseline norm” contributed to the <italic>normalization of nativism</italic>, that is, of a cultural construction that views “normal” national societies as essentially self-contained population entities with a common and fairly homogeneous ancestry, perpetuating itself exclusively by natural reproduction. In relation to this, immigration came to be regarded as an essentially pathogenic disturbance. This conception subsequently entered the political culture of many European countries and others, whose ruling elites were largely of European origin.</p>
<p>Another important consequence of the closing of borders was the impossibility for persecuted groups to secure asylum abroad, at a time when the need was escalating because of the proliferation of authoritarian regimes and ethnic conflicts; moreover, the closing of doors legitimized the persecution of target groups as people who were demonstrably undesirable because nobody would accept them (this was later used prominently in Nazi propaganda regarding Jews). The implementation of such a restrictive international movement regime required a vast increase in state power by way of the issuance of reliable identity documents and border-crossing permits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212443821">Torpey, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764212443821">3</xref></sup> In the United States, for example, the imposition of visa requirements for visitors as well as immigrants required a fundamental transformation of consular services from a largely honorific part-time organization staffed by natives of the countries where they were located into a U.S.-staffed bureaucracy trained to police newly imposed U.S. entry requirements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the affluent countries continued to rely on foreign migrant workers when conditions in specific sectors warranted it, with formal and informal barriers to their settlement. For example, after excluding the Chinese, the United States encouraged the recruitment of workers from Mexico, initially largely self-propelled, and when the United States adopted a highly restrictive immigration regime in the 1920s, it was not applied to the Western Hemisphere, allowing for largely unregulated freedom of movement from Mexico, to supply stoop labor for Texas cotton and California produce farms, and Canada, whose Quebeckers were regarded as “Mexicans of the north,” working largely in grain-producing and forest industries of the Northeast. Moreover, the U.S. government supplied the police force required to return these workers to their country of origin when no longer needed at the onset of the Great Depression. Similarly, Britain, while enacting restrictive immigration policies around the turn of the 20th century, ensured the availability of a continued supply of labor from Ireland by integrating the island into the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The restrictive features of the international regime were further reinforced at the outbreak of the Great Depression. Among other things, the United States enforced more strictly than ever the “liable to become a public charge” prohibition of its immigration regulations. This functioned as an additional barrier to the admission of victims of Nazi persecution, already handicapped by the national origin quotas designed to sharply limit immigration from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>When the United States entered World War II, the federal government departed from the long-established policy against the importation of contract labor (formally prohibited by an 1885 law directed against the trade in Chinese “coolies”) and organized the systematic recruitment of <italic>braceros</italic>, a program of temporary contract workers similar to the “guest worker” arrangements developed around the turn of the century in Germany, France, and Switzerland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002764212443821">
<title>Post–World War II Changes</title>
<p>In the wake of World War II, the international regime was liberalized in two distinct ways. On one hand, the economic boom induced among the leading countries by the liberalization of trade, of exchanges, and of capital movement, created a vast demand for certain types of labor. Under conditions of relatively slow demographic growth, which facilitated the achievement by indigenous workers of more favorable conditions, foreign workers provided a very convenient solution to the problem of inflationary pressure on wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212443821">Zolberg, 2006b</xref>). Turning initially to neighboring less developed countries—Mexico for the United States; Italy, Greece, and Portugal for the original European Economic Community countries; Caribbean colonials for the United Kingdom—the receivers subsequently expanded the domain of their recruitment farther afield, so that the diversity of the immigrants was broadened as well. Although in many cases formal or informal institutions were established to ensure that they could be disposed of when no longer needed, the comings and goings of these workers produced everywhere a significant residue of settlement. Concurrently, given lasting favorable economic conditions, the overseas “immigration countries” (including the United States) eliminated the egregious discriminatory features from their immigration policies and raised the annual cap on permanent immigration, allowing for broader family reunion.</p>
<p>At the same time, in response to the tragic consequences of the refusal to provide asylum for the victims of persecution in the interwar period and during World War II itself, the Western countries undertook to establish a limited international refugee regime. Western motivations for taking in refugees were subsequently enhanced by the onset of the Cold War, when the encouragement of “defection” and the provision of asylum for those who did served as a strategic instrument for demonstrating the superiority of liberal democracy over communism. In keeping with this, most of the Western countries adopted some sort of asylum policy; however, this was initially restricted to Europeans—including their overseas descendants, notably Latin Americans—and they shunned taking on the obligation of admitting large numbers of refugees for resettlement—except in the case of Germany and Israel, and then only with regard to persons identified as being of their own origin. The United States began by opening a sizeable side door for displaced persons, so as to avoid their interfering with German recovery, but did not accede to the International Refugee Protocol until 1980.</p>
<p>A similar growth of consciousness regarding the morally unacceptable consequences of racial theories brought about their rejection by postwar social scientists and contributed to a more widespread ideological transformation that underlay what was called in the United States the civil rights revolution. This deprived racially and ethnically based immigration restrictions from legitimacy—resulting in the abandonment by the United States of the notorious ethnic origins quota system in 1965, and similar policy changes in Canada and Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0002764212443821">
<title>The Contemporary Scene</title>
<p>The debates immigration provokes are especially contentious because they straddle disparate spheres of concerns and interests and also involve both domestic and external policy considerations. On the domestic side, immigration can be assessed in terms of two distinct dimensions, neither of which is reducible to the other: on one hand its impact on the labor market—that is, in the perspective of class; on the other its impact on politics and culture—in Durkheimian terms, in the perspective of societal integration. On the external side, since the regulation of incoming flows concomitantly affects <italic>emigration</italic>, a state’s immigration policy constitutes an element of foreign policy that affects the international migration system as a whole, much as is the case with trade. Although immigration also evokes issues of security, notably with regard to penetration by potential terrorists, it must be noted that here, the relevant issue is not so much immigration as “alien entries,” most of which are temporary, and much more numerous. It is worth noting, for example, that none of the 9/11 perpetrators were immigrants and that despite vastly increased surveillance since then, only a handful of immigrants have been suspected of involvement in terrorism. Because they involve the two very different dimensions noted, immigration issues cut across the usual left–right divide, making for strange political bedfellows. Leaving aside outright xenophobes, the debate often entails “a contest of ‘right’ versus ‘right’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212443821">Teitelbaum, 1980</xref>, p. 22). Immigration pits free-market advocates who view it as increasing the labor supply and lowering its price and welcome it as a stimulus to economic growth against others concerned with protecting the job market for indigenous workers, and particularly those who are already the most deprived. It also pits “humanitarians” who believe affluent democracies have a moral obligation to provide asylum for refugees in need against “realists” who contend this obligation cannot be discharged because too many refugees are being produced in the world at large and that a country has the right—and, some would argue, even the obligation—to use immigration to better itself by acquiring valuable manpower, notably trained scientists and health providers.</p>
<p>Another confrontation involves “cosmopolitans,” who believe borders violate the unity of humanity, against “communautarians” (at root “nationalists”) who believe the world’s division into distinct national communities is a sine qua non for liberal democracy, and that the viability of these communities would be jeopardized by a very large influx of immigrants, particularly if they are culturally very different from the receivers and hence likely to actively or passively resist integration.</p>
<p>For some the answer is simple: Draconian measures are called for to deter the “invaders,” especially because by virtue of their origins in the developing world they are so different from Western receivers as to be “unassimilable”; moreover, it is alleged, experience with recent arrivals from those regions indicates that they insist on maintaining their alien ways, thereby sowing the seeds of future ethnic conflict. Most ominously, this type of reaction is fueling a resurgence of right-wing extremism, especially in Europe, where the “invasion” is largely identified as the intrusion of Islam, whereas in the United States the threat is viewed principally as one of “hispanization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212443821">Zolberg &amp; Long, 1999</xref>, pp. 5-38).</p>
<p>Although the crisis is real and suggests there is a need for a worldwide reconsideration of prevailing regimes governing international population movements and the incorporation of newcomers, I believe the resurgence of nativist responses and the enhancement of state controls over persons that they precipitate present more immediate threats to liberal democracy than does immigration itself, including its unauthorized segment. The most pressing danger today is a reenactment of developments triggered by the first global “immigration crisis” outlined above.</p>
<p>The effective elimination of unauthorized immigration would require no less than the transformation of the affluent liberal democracies into police states, protected by a new iron curtain or a Berlin Wall, whereas the further tightening of asylum procedures would jeopardize the very possibility of providing havens for refugees in need. Rigid adherence to the cultural status quo in the face of pressures to include elements from the cultures of recent immigrants constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy that would render the incorporation of newcomers more problematic. At the international level, the maintenance by the affluent democracies of relatively open borders is a sine qua non for the development of a more liberal world and is particularly vital for the success of democratizing forces in the Third World and the ex-communist countries.</p>
<p>The elaboration of a more measured response requires first of all a dispassionate analysis of the “crisis” itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212443821">Goldin, Cameron, &amp; Balarajan, 2011</xref>, pp. 183-210). The disparate migratory flows within and between countries constitute interconnected components of the global system. Shaped by “[t]hose who send, those who go, and those who receive,” the overall system “mirrors the world as it is at the time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212443821">Davis, 1974</xref>, p. 91). It is molded by broad demographic, economic, political, technological, and cultural conditions in the world at large, including also the policies pursued by the states of origin and potential destination and the regulations they impose on movement across their borders. For example, the populations of communist-dominated Europe were largely immobilized for several decades.</p>
<p>By virtue of the interconnectedness of all parts of the stream, the actions of individual states are interactive, in that the opening and closing of gates affects flows in the stream as a whole, and particularly the pressure on other gates. For example, an important contributing factor to the present crisis is the generalization of freedom of exit, arising not only from the recent collapse of communism but also from the achievement of independence by colonial populations whose international mobility was hitherto severely limited, a situation rendered more critical by the emergence of authoritarian regimes in many of them and the resurgence of internal conflicts arising from religious and ethnic diversity. Incidentally, many of the countries currently complaining about immigration pressures contributed to the achievement of “freedom to leave,” now broadly recognized as an important human right. Yet although in a world of self-contained nation-states it is evident that freedom to leave cannot be exercised without the concomitant availability of some place to enter, the latter has not been acknowledged as a counterpart of the former. Paradoxically, when freedom to leave is denied, those affected and who manage to escape ARE likely to have a place to go because they qualify as refugees. But once the door opens, this qualification is lost.</p>
<p>Driven by a sense of crisis, issues arising from immigration and its consequences are once again moving to the top of the political agenda in both Europe and North America. Even as some progress is being made in dismantling thermonuclear arsenals, ominous developments intimate that human pressure on the borders of the world’s affluent countries will rank as one of the leading problems of international security in the 21st century. The pressure is reflected in the formation of very long queues when some attractive country provides an opportunity to apply for admission, and most dramatically in the proliferation of requests for asylum, of unauthorized border crossings, often under very dangerous conditions—by crossing deserts or bodies of ocean in frail vessels—as well as “overstaying” where circumstances allow. Even after discounting for exploitative exaggerations, there is no gainsaying that because international migration is governed by the profound inequality of worldwide political and economic conditions, the situation is likely to become more acute in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Reacting to the energy crisis of the 1970s and the subsequent abrupt end of the postwar boom, many of the European receivers immediately terminated their foreign labor procurement policies, not only imposing a freeze on further recruitment but also seeking to dispose of foreign workers who were no longer needed. By and large, however, they failed to achieve their objectives, largely because the workers in question were reluctant to return to their countries of origin, where the economic situation also deteriorated and support structures were much weaker. Despite their own lack of political power, foreign workers were able to find allies within the indigenous population, thanks to the surge of “postindustrial humanitarian norms.” Faced with the likelihood of a much longer stay than originally anticipated, the workers also sought to bring in their families; and they once again largely succeeded, in part because the receivers viewed this as a way of ensuring greater social control over immigrant populations, but also because of the emerging norms noted. Concurrently, as prevailing conditions in the countries of origin continued to stimulate departures, the receivers were also faced with mounting numbers of unauthorized entries, facilitated by the presence of substantial immigrant communities in their midst. Finally, as the doors to ordinary transnational movement began to close, an increasing number of potential migrants also availed themselves of established procedures for asylum to gain admission or postpone expulsion.</p>
<p>Thus, paradoxically, rather than decreasing in accordance with stated objectives, immigration continued to grow; temporary workers began to turn into settlers; and these young, fertile settlers produced a sizeable second generation. With the immigration crisis already well under way, the sudden liberalization of exit from the communist countries, and the subsequent collapse of their economies together with explosions of violent ethnic conflict in some of them, was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
<p>The mounting crisis precipitated disparate attempts to build more effective walls, including the further elaboration of “remote control”—that is, the requirement of pre-embarkation visas—for travelers from countries identified as sources of unwanted immigration, putting a heavier burden on applicants for asylum, and in the American case, an attempt to control unauthorized immigration by imposing unprecedented sanctions on employers of such labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212443821">Zolberg, 2006a</xref>, pp. 418-421). In Europe, the crisis stimulated international cooperation to police the borders of the European Community more effectively, introducing a basic status distinction between their citizens, who gained freedom of movement, and others. This was usually translated into discriminatory treatment of European-appearing persons and others at the community’s internal borders.</p>
<p>But as in the case of the first crisis, contemporary realities generate processes that exceed the capacity of established control mechanisms. Dawning awareness that traditional border controls are not much more effective than the notorious Maginot and Siegfried Lines has triggered a panic and propelled “immigration control” into the sphere of “security policy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764212443821">4</xref></sup> Yet from a more realistic perspective, similar to that used for automobile traffic control—notably viewing successes and failures in terms of the costs and benefits inherent in any system of control—it is arguable that the established system functions quite effectively in containing immigration well below the level if might otherwise attain as a consequence of the vastly enlarged global pool of potential international migrants.</p>
<p>In short, we are once again faced with the debate between the cosmopolitan/optimist and the nationalist/pessimist. However, some things are very clear. The immigration policies of diverse countries are interactive and amount in effect to a global international migration regime. This regime’s ongoing development contributes to a further accentuation of the division between haves and have-nots—those who can move internationally without visas and those who cannot. The imposition of draconian “remote control” measures has also had a deleterious effect on the asylum process.</p>
<p>It is precisely these emerging realities that make the Rawlsian “original position,” and especially the presumption of a “veil of ignorance,” vital for thinking about normative issues across different societies, as set forth by Joseph Carens, and as I have attempted in the present essay.</p>

<title>Components of Choice</title>
<p>To simplify my argument somewhat, the following principal policy questions arise for affluent liberal democracies with regard to immigration, including asylum admissions and refugee resettlement:</p>
<list id="list1-0002764212443821" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Level of admission</italic>: Although the theoretical level ranges from zero to unlimited, in practice it goes from very close to zero indeed (notably Japan) to a level that is high only in relation to the hypothetical “near-zero” baseline. This can be conceived either in absolute terms (e.g., in the United States, which currently admits some 800,000 legal immigrants and refugees a year) or in relation to population size (e.g., Canada, whose annual intake around 1980 amounted to some 5% of population, as against 0.2% for the United States).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Allocation of priorities</italic>: Given that with any sort of limit the number of candidates for admission will exceed the number authorized, some sort of triage must be imposed. On what criteria should this be based? And whose needs and interests should be accorded priority, those of the receivers or of the applicants?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Modalities of incorporation</italic>: Although this arises only after immigration takes place, it is inseparable from immigration properly speaking. Theoretical possibilities (as illustrated historically) range from totally segregated status without rights (African slaves) to ready admission into full membership by virtue of admission itself (as in the case of persons recognized as Jews in Israel, or <italic>aussiedler</italic> in postwar West Germany), with various intermediary situations such as high or low naturalization requirements (e.g., Canada’s 3-year residence requirement vs. the United States’s 5), the application of <italic>jus sanguinis</italic> or <italic>jus soli</italic> to native-born children of immigrants, provision of various rights to foreign residents (social, civil, political, cultural) or their denial.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What sorts of principles should govern the making of these choices? A recent review of leading perspectives, which include “Marxism,” “realism,” “libertarianism,” “liberal egalitarianism,”—with a further distinction between “cosmopolitans” and “nationalist/communautarians”—and “natural law,” suggests that the differences that arise among them arise largely from the extent to which the perspective ascribes moral legitimacy to existing institutions, especially the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212443821">Nardin, 1992</xref>) In keeping with this, “realists” are wont to advocate quite restrictive immigration,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764212443821">5</xref></sup> whereas “libertarians” are usually found among the most ardent defenders of open boundaries in keeping with a view of human beings as essentially “labor,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764212443821">6</xref></sup> “liberal egalitarians”—who constitute the mainstream among political theorists dealing with the subject—usually offer an eclectic compromise between an ethic of rights and consequences; they constitute a family of viewpoints, in which different weights are attributed to various considerations regarding “freedom” and “equality.”</p>
<p>Much of the debate within liberalism revolves around different weights attributed to these two basic values, as well as differing interpretations of the consequences of immigration on them. “Communautarians” tend to argue that since it is well established that cultural heterogeneity can be a source of acute political conflict, a democracy might well be justified in restricting the immigration of very large numbers of people who are culturally very different because of the difficulty of integrating them. Such arguments are made today not only by the extreme nationalist fringe such as LePen in France or David Dukes and Pat Buchanan in the United States. Among the most influential intellectuals providing ammunition for this camp are the late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212443821">Samuel Huntington (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212443821">2004)</xref> for the United States and Christopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212443821">Caldwell (2009)</xref> for Europe, but also eminently respectable traditionalists such as George Kennan and even social-minded liberals such as Michael Walzer.</p>
<p>A very important distinction arises also from the choice of <italic>unit</italic> of reference; this pits “cosmopolitan” liberals such as Charles Beitz (where I also place myself), who espouse the perspective of a global community founded on the unity of the human species, against “communal” liberals, who espouse the perspective of a particular national community (and take the existence of such communities as a desirable state of affairs and even as a necessity for the realization of liberal regimes). Although both are led to make compromises, the “cosmopolitans” in effect place the burden of proof on those who would limit immigration, whereas the “communautarians” place it on candidates for entry and their supporters.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, I present a brief on behalf of the “cosmopolitan” strain of “liberal egalitarianism,” tempered by a realistic analysis of contemporary trends such as has been sketched here. A consideration of choices to be made might start from the hypothesis of a world without borders, as Joseph Carens set forth in his seminal 1987 article referred to earlier, granted—as Carens himself has done in later publications—that this is unrealistic as a guide for policy. Nevertheless, the choice of starting point itself makes considerable difference. If we adopt a “realistic” position and start with the status quo of a world divided into mutually exclusive national communities that are markedly unequal in many respects, the fundamental question might be, why any of these communities should—and especially the most privileged ones—admit <italic>any</italic> strangers. But if we start instead with a theoretical world that has no borders, we are led to ask a more radical question: What gives a group the right to exclude others? This was precisely Melville’s question also. Bruce Ackerman has posed this in terms of a situation involving an explorer landing on a desert island and then refusing access to someone who comes later. If we are to any degree “consequentialists” (as everyone engaging in moral analysis is necessarily to some degree), then we are led to ask, what difference do borders make? What is their function?</p>
<p>The answer is twofold. To begin with, under prevailing conditions, borders are a <italic>sine qua non</italic> for maintaining affluence and privilege. Brian Barry, for example, has argued that under conditions of free movement, conditions among the affluent countries would quickly decline to the level of the less developed ones. And this would be the case with regard to not only economic conditions but also political ones. Second, borders are necessary to establish and preserve distinct communities, notably self-governing democracies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002764212443821">7</xref></sup> As I have demonstrated, once borders are established, international migration entails not merely <bold>physical</bold> relocation, but a <bold>transfer</bold> from one political community to another—from one perspective, a change of jurisdiction, from another, a change of membership.</p>
<p>One starting point for my approach is the observation that the liberal world order is founded on a striking asymmetry. Although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own,” there is no concomitant principle to the effect that “everyone has the right to enter any country, or even <bold>some</bold> country.” On the contrary, there is a universal and unambiguous consensus on the very opposite principle, namely, that every country has the right to restrict the entry of foreigners—modified only to the extent as adhered to in the refugee convention—in which case it is obligated to consider the case, but not necessarily to grant admission. And although the international community has belatedly come to object to the exercise of exclusive nationalism when it provokes the exclusion of minorities, it voices little disapproval in the face of “preventive exclusion,” that is, the run-of-the-mill exercise by national communities of their power to excluded nonnationals.</p>
<p>Brian Barry has argued that there is no good reason why emigration and immigration policies should be symmetrical, given that this is the generic characteristic of associations, whereby people are free to leave but not to join. Accordingly, there is a presumption in favor of asymmetry rather than symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212443821">Barry, 1992</xref>, p. 284). But this reasoning, which parallels Michael Walzer’s, is based on a faulty analogy. Membership in a comprehensive political community is different from membership in an association, because the latter is not a sine qua non for existence. If one is excluded from an association, it is usually possible to join another, or even to found a more welcoming one with others who are excluded (as was done, for example, by American Jews who wished to become Masons in the first half of the 19th century). But to remain relevant, liberalism must adapt to the inexorable globalization we are undergoing by developing a more explicitly “cosmopolitan” orientation. Such questioning of national sovereignty is in keeping with our dawning awareness of the interdependence of all the segments of the human species, arising from the global nature of the thermonuclear threat and of environmental degradation that occasions global warming, as well as steadily increasing evidence of our common origins out of Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764212443821">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a cosmopolitan liberal perspective, unwanted immigrants are not “invaders” but rather people voting with their feet in support of the “Melville principle,” founded on rights arising from membership in a common and unique species. Concomitantly, the burden of justification must be borne not by those who seek admission in some country but rather by those who would exclude them. The appropriate question therefore remains not “Whom shall we admit?” but “Why not the whole world?”</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that under present conditions of global inequality, in the absence of border controls, the world’s affluent and relatively affluent countries would be quickly overwhelmed by truly massive flows of international migrants in search of work and safety. Although this is a counterfactual, there can be little doubt of its very high degree of plausibility, as indicated by the long lines that form wherever a possibility of legal admission exists, as well as the proliferation of surreptitious entries. The likelihood that in the absence of borders a major redistribution of the world’s population would take place is suggested also by theoretical models of migration founded on current and prospective income differentials, to which one must add political conditions as an additional major source of emigration “push” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212443821">Zolberg, Suhrke, &amp; Aguayo, 1989</xref>, pp. 227-258).</p>
<p>Considered more generally, the Melville principle suggests that the strict confinement of individuals to membership in the states under whose jurisdiction they happened to be born negates their being members of a common species and concomitantly imbues the states in question with an aura of “naturalness” that obfuscates their reality as historical constructs. Descended from common ancestors, in the course of their history, which we are only beginning to understand, humans scattered over the face of the earth by way of untold migrations; and throughout this history, they also constantly organized and reorganized themselves into bounded communities. But what gives the generations alive today a warrant to regard the present configuration that has resulted from these two processes in our own time as the definitive outcome of history? As empires gave way to “national” states (some visibly “multinational”) in the course of the 20th century, the resulting reorganization also tended to be regarded as definitive; but we now know that this freezing of history proved illusory as a variety of “national” groups emerged to press claims on behalf of a distinct state of their own. In the same vein, a freezing of the current distribution of political membership by way of prohibitively restrictive immigration policies is contrary to the constitutive principles of a liberal world order because it would in effect confine individuals alive today as well as the generations to come to the jurisdiction of their states of origin, thereby vastly enhancing the power of the latter. Although there is room for debate about the details, there is no gainsaying that population movements into the affluent countries would be extremely large to the point of jeopardizing regime maintenance. And there is no normative requirement for liberal regimes to adopt policies that would genuinely jeopardize their survival.</p>
<p>This prospect imposes a major constraint on the application of the “Melville principle.” On reflection, it is evident that Melville’s generous stance was implicitly predicated on the knowledge that Ireland contained but some 6.5 million people, and that there were just so many sailing ships available at any given time to bring the Irish to the United States, which had many areas still hardly settled by White people (Melville’s generous cosmopolitanism obviously did not extend to Native Americans). In effect, from the perspective of the American side of the Atlantic, prevailing conditions in the world at large kept the mid-19th-century immigration crisis within bounds, even in the absence of restrictive action. But as we have seen, the situation changed dramatically in the final third of the 19th century, and continued to evolve in the same direction throughout the 20th.</p>
<p>What are we to do today, in a world that consists of numerous Irelands and in which there is in effect an unlimited number of ships? Although there are no simple answers, the perspective of “cosmopolitan liberalism” does provide an ethically valid and practical guiding principle. Recognizing that <italic>unlimited</italic> immigration would jeopardize the material welfare of the receivers, without enhancing that of the newcomers, and that it would also jeopardize democratic self-government, we can nevertheless insist that those who would restrict immigration assume the burden of proof regarding the probable nefarious consequences of various levels.</p>
<p>Since a limit will be imposed, selection will necessarily be brought into operation. Hence, in practice, the most important ethical questions pertain to the criteria for selection. Triage involves positive and negative rules: Some categories of persons will be excluded altogether, others assigned various priorities in the queue. In keeping with liberal norms, grounds for exclusion must be limited to those validly invoked to disqualify persons <bold>within</bold> the state from the exercise of citizenship rights, temporarily or permanently. In practice, this means properly tried and sentenced felons—which happens to be the oldest ground for exclusion in American immigration practice. A second traditional category, mental incompetents, is already more problematic, as standards for such assessments have evolved considerably. This would still leave an enormous pool of eligibles.</p>
<p>On the positive priority side, neither the cosmopolitan nor communautarian versions of liberalism provide a warrant for basing an affluent liberal state’s immigration policy on “acquisitive” principles. Hence, an ethical policy would have to significantly reduce present priorities attributed to immigrants with rare and valuable skills. Incidentally, this should be considered in relation to the normative obligation to improve the education and opportunities of the less well-off among the indigenous population. In practice, the most difficult choice will be that between relatives and refugees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443821">Walzer (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212443821">Dworkin (1986)</xref> have emphasized obligations to family, including extended ethnic kin. But if priority were attributed to kin, there would be little room for anyone else. Hence, family must be defined narrowly and totals kept within bounds to allow for the admission of those in greatest need, that is, refugees.</p>
<p>There is fairly widespread agreement in the present international regime that priority must be attributed to <bold>political</bold> refugees ahead of the economically desperate. This is founded on two justifications: the priority attributed to freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212443821">Carens, 1987</xref>) and the impossibility of exporting relief to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212443821">Walzer, 1983</xref>). But there is considerable disagreement on who is a refugee. Foreign policy grounds—as practiced during the cold war—of themselves are not justified. And it must be acknowledged that the United Nations protocol leaves something to be desired, as persecution assumes a nefarious agent, usually the state. This was clearly based on the European experience and quite realistic in relation to that. But it must be recognized that many people in the South today are victims of violence—under conditions where the state is unable or unwilling to provide minimal protection. Such victims also meet the Walzerian criterion of not capable of being helped <bold>in situ</bold>. Clearly, they should also be considered refugees.</p>
<p>Moreover, the category should be expanded to include victims of economic deprivation, where this is attributable to state policies gravely inconsistent with liberal principles of justice, notably conditions of grave inequality of land or wages, maintained by force. This would be applicable retroactively to 19th-century Irish Catholics, whose starvation was attributable not solely to the potato plight but to Whig policies imposed on the island after 1690.</p>
