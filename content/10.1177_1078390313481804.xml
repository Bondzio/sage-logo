<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I’m a member of the “potentially powerful” group of psychiatric nurses, and American Psychiatric Nurses Association member, that you mentioned. I’m also a psychiatric nurse practitioner treating active duty soldiers, and I fully support the National Rifle Association and their mission. However, I’m also fully informed about firearms.</p>
<p>Let me enlightened you. Effective gun control is a volatile subject, but one thing is clear. It won’t work as criminals don’t give a hoot about any gun control laws. In fact, they would probably love to see more of them in order to keep guns out of the hands of their intended victims.</p>
<p>I grew up with guns, as did my wife. My father wasn’t available to teach my brother or me about how to use them, so we did our own research. We picked up Coke bottles off the side of the road and earned enough money to buy a used .22 caliber rifle for $7.50. This purchase ensured that we had enough rabbits and squirrels to fill our hungry bellies. On the other hand, my wife had parental figures to teach her about firearms, and to provide food.</p>
<p>In the past 2 weeks I have purchased a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special for my wife and ordered a 9 mm pistol for myself. Last weekend, we completed our concealed carry class for this state. The police officer teaching the course said that 100% of gun-related crimes in my town were committed with illegally obtained firearms.</p>
<p>You’re right about Obama’s Gun Purchase Stimulus Plan. I was number 50 in line for my one specific pistol in a town of about 20,000! The gun dealers are ecstatic these days with their increase in revenue.</p>
<p>My wife and I will be at the gun range in the morning, this time to shoot my newer model .22 caliber rifle. I just finished loading up seven 25-round magazines. It sure is convenient rather than loading up a bunch of 5- or 10-round magazines. However, it would take me only seconds longer to fire the same amount of shells with a smaller round capacity magazine than with my 25-round magazines. Should we make all firearms single shot? That’s absolutely ridiculous!</p>
<p>I have no problem with background checks (already in place), nor even requiring classes on gun safety. I do have a problem with idiot politicians not knowing what an assault rifle is, or who think that removing cosmetic touches such as a pistol grip or folding gunstock makes a gun safer! Holding up an “assault-looking” rifle that is not fully automatic or that fires three-round bursts and calling it an assault rifle makes you look very stupid to those who are informed. An assault weapon must have a fire selector switch that can select between single shot, a three-round burst shot, or full-auto fire. None of the civilian “assault-looking rifles” have these features. They are all single shot just like all the other firearms in the civilian world.</p>
<p>You know what it takes to buy a true assault rifle? Anywhere from $15,000 to $40,000 plus an extensive background check from the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms) that will last 6 months or longer.</p>
<p>You will never solve this problem until you can absolutely ensure that criminals will not have access to guns. Do you have a way to do that? Those of us who are responsible adults, and who have a weapon close by the majority of the time, do not need gun control.</p>
<p>Chicago has some of the strictest gun controls yet one of the highest murder rates in the country. Know why . . . criminals.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do about uneducated parents who don’t teach their kids how to safely handle firearms or who allow easy access for a kid to shoot themselves. Perhaps they should ban mind-numbing communication via two-thumb texting and get them back to nature where there’s a better connection.</p>
