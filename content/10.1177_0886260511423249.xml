<abstract>
<p>Colleges and universities across the US have prioritized minority enrollments in their recruitment strategies, but theories offer to possible outcomes of increasing diversity on campus—increased racial harmony or increased racial tension. This study examines the impact of racial diversity on the reported number of hate crimes that occur on campus. Findings suggest that those schools that are most successful in recruiting the hardest to recruit minorities (Black and Latino students) report fewer hate crimes on campus. Implications for campus climate and racial dynamics on campus, as well as future research, are discussed.</p>

<p><italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic> marked an important turning point in the history of education in the United States. Rejecting the <italic>Plessy</italic> standard of “separate but equal,” the <italic>Brown</italic> decision highlighted the importance of diversity in education. Social science research has demonstrated a link between increased exposure to diversity in higher education and a variety of social and educational outcomes, but the scope and extent of diversity’s impact as a policy strategy is still poorly understood. Some have even suggested that increasing diversity is not an exclusively positive experience for universities and colleges and that the increased focus on diversity can increase racial tensions, create self-segregation, and generate feelings of racial hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511423249">U.S. Department of Justice, 2000</xref>) if other structural features are not in place to create a truly inclusive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511423249">Hurtado, 1992</xref>). Taking into account these two possible outcomes—increased levels of racial harmony and understanding, or increased levels of racial hostility and aggression—this study examines the relationship between student and faculty racial/ethnic diversity in colleges and universities on the overall reported racial/ethnic hate crimes on campus. More specifically, this study examined whether or not increased presence of Blacks and Latinos (who are often perceived as “historically disadvantaged” in higher education) and Asian students (who are perceived as the “model minority”), as well as the percent of minority faculty, on campus would increase or decrease the number of reported hate crimes.</p>

<title>The Goals of Diversity in Higher Education</title>
<p>Despite the ongoing legal debate, higher education has and continues to become increasingly diverse. Although diversity can be defined in many ways, reflecting “the presence of different points of view and ways of making meaning, which generally flow from the influence of different cultural and religious heritages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511423249">Schneider, 1996</xref>, p. 5), given the history of racial/ethnic challenges throughout the United States, the presence of racial/ethnic minorities on campus has become an issue that has received a high level of scrutiny. With the minority populations increasing in the United States, colleges and universities will be serving increasing numbers of students of color. The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) projects that current trends regarding increased enrollment of minority students will continue over the next 10 years. According to their most recent annual report, college enrollment will increase 4% for White students between 2007 and 2018, 26% for Black students, 38% for Hispanic students, 29% for Asian or Pacific Islander students, 32% for American Indian or Alaskan Native students, and 14% for nonresident aliens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511423249">Hussar &amp; Bailey, 2009</xref>). Thus, whether through purposeful enrollment through mechanisms like affirmative action, or through the natural increase in college applications as minorities make strides toward equality in U.S. society over all, institutions of higher education will see increased enrollments of minority students.</p>
<p>For the past several decades, most universities and colleges have prioritized the inclusion of a diverse student body, with a particular focus on racial/ethnic diversity. This goal has been met with substantial legal challenge in the last decade. Courts at all levels are struggling with whether or not diversity is a compelling interest of the state, and thus, higher education. In particular, there is a question as to whether or not there are “academic freedoms” possessed by institutions of higher education in determining the composition of their student body that are in conflict with individual freedoms protected by the constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511423249">Grossett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511423249">Notes, 1996</xref>). Courts have been split, but the dominant message sent from such cases as <italic>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Grutter v. Bollinger</italic>, and <italic>Gratz v. Bollinger</italic> is that admissions policies must be narrowly tailored. However, the inability of the courts to present a clear reasoning for or against promoting diversity in the university community stems from a lack of information provided to the courts regarding the benefits and costs related to ensuring a diverse campus. Studies in the business arena have found that diversity adds values in profits, higher numbers of customers, market share, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511423249">Herring, 2009</xref>), but few studies have examined the direct impact of diversity in higher education. Research that does exist has tried to measure cognitive and educational outcomes, when there are a variety of other outcomes to consider. Thus, this research examines a different potential outcome of divert—campus safety—and examines the relationship between the level of racial/ethnic diversity at colleges and university and their reported number of hate crimes.</p>
<p>Many theoretical writings and empirical studies have explored the potential benefits of diversity, including improving social and intellectual development, increasing openness to diversity, increased commitment to racial understanding, and increased cultural awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511423249">Chang, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511423249">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511423249">Duster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511423249">Pascarella et al., 1996</xref>). The implication is that increased opportunity to meet and interact with people from diverse backgrounds results in better, more well-rounded students.</p>
<p>Existing research regarding racial perceptions and college students primarily focuses on individual outcomes for students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511423249">Antonio et al. (2004)</xref> looked at the effects of racial diversity on complex thinking of college students in small group settings and found a correlation between open-mindedness and the amount of racial diversity in a student’s social group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511423249">Gurin (1999)</xref> found that students with increased exposure to diversity in college went on to have increased involvement in community organizations as adults. Gurin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511423249">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>) found a positive relationship between students’ social and classroom experiences with diverse peers and a variety of educational outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511423249">Gottfredson et al. (2008)</xref> similarly found a positive correlation between diversity and educational outcomes and recommended that institutions of higher learning encourage informal interactions between students of diverse background as well as enrollment in classes that deal with diversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511423249">Chang, Astin, and Kim (2004)</xref> found that both generic interactions in the classroom with a diverse group of students, as well as more intimate interactions such as dining with, dating, and studying with a diverse group of students, resulted in higher intellectual ability, better social ability, and higher rates of civic interests.</p>

<title>Race Relations on Campus</title>
<p>In one of the few works on strategies an institution can employ to improve racial/ethnic interaction on campus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511423249">Hurtado, Milem, Clayton-Pederson, and Allen (1999)</xref> describe a host of factors included in campus climate, such as institutional history of inclusion/exclusion, psychological climate (e.g. perceptions of racial tensions), behavioral dimension (e.g. social interactions across races), and structural diversity (diverse students, faculty, and staff). This multidimensional model of campus climate was validated in later research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511423249">Hutchinson, Raymond, &amp; Black, 2008</xref>), suggesting that there are many features beyond just the presence of a numerically diverse campus community that will affect the overall impact of diversity.</p>
<p>There are two basic perspectives as to what may happen when the number of racial minority students increases. The first perspective is that a rise in minority representation in the student body would result in a negative or violent reaction from the majority students. The campus climate would be tenser, and “under conditions of increasing cultural diversity . . . the differences between groups become salient on an everyday basis. For the first time, many students must learn to deal with classmates and roommates who are <italic>different</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511423249">U.S. Department of Justice, 2000</xref>). This tension is evident in studies that ask students about their perceptions of campus climate, with minority studies reporting more experiences of bias than nonminority students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511423249">Rankin, 2003</xref>), and although these experiences are less frequently overt forms of bias, more subtle forms of bias are evident even in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511423249">Boysen, Vogel, Cope, &amp; Hubbard, 2009</xref>). In fact, some argue that the more “mixed” a campus is, the higher the potential for campus ethnoviolence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511423249">Fenske &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511423249">Marcus, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>There are many ways that students, faculty, and staff can experience institutional and interpersonal discrimination and violence, and hate crimes are a growing concern for campus safety. The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines hate crimes as those “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511423249">FBI, 2009</xref>). Cases of “campus ethnoviolence” as defined by Howard Ehrlich are then a reflection of the relationships between groups in the community and the level of tension between those groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511423249">Ehrlich, 1994</xref>). Rather than a haven from social norms and stereotypes about groups, Ehrlich sees the campus as a place where those norms are played out, which is evidenced by the fact that nearly a third of all hate crimes are reported on school grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511423249">ADL, 2008</xref>). Surveys of college students also reveal high rates of hate crimes, both reported and unreported, with about 16% of students responding that they’ve been the victims of prejudice, and 25% of racial and ethnic minority students specifically report being the victims of prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511423249">Ehrlich, 1994</xref>). However, other research has suggested that even these surveys may be undercounts, and when comparing general surveys utilizing an unmatched count technique, the rate may in fact be much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511423249">Rayburn, Earleywine, &amp; Davison, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the famous typology of hate crime perpetrators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511423249">Levin and McDevitt (1993)</xref> found that the majority of hate crime perpetrators were not members of organized hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan or Neo-Nazis. Rather, they found that most perpetrators engaged in crimes for a variety of personal reasons such as thrill seeking, to get revenge, or to defend territory. Most pertinent is their category of “retaliatory” hate crimes, where people who perceive that there is a wrongful incursion of racial/ethnic minorities into “White” spaces can lash out in an attempt to preserve territory. Given that colleges and universities are traditionally white domains, the increase of racial/ethnic minorities could potentially trigger resistance to their increasing presence through race-based hate crimes and other forms of ethnoviolence. However, retaliation can come in many forms, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511423249">Craig (1999)</xref> found that when African American students were exposed to a hate crime scenario, they reported being much more likely to come back to the scene of the crime with friends (which Craig interpreted as a desire to retaliate) compared to White students who saw the same vignette. Thus, hate crimes themselves can be a result of racial conflict, or act to spur further conflict.</p>
<p>Although many theorists propose that diversity can cause increased racial tension, the second perspective is that the increased numbers of minority students would begin to foster a campus climate that is tolerant of racial differences. This builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511423249">Allport’s (1954)</xref> theory that positive outcomes result from contact between members of a majority “in-group” and minority “out-group” if the situation allowed both groups equal status. Extending this logic, if more institutions of higher learning could meet the conditions of brining in-group and out-group members together as equal partners, this in turn would foster a climate where racism was less acceptable, leading to less campus ethnoviolence. This possible outcome also builds upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511423249">Robert Park’s (1949)</xref> idea that cross-ethnic conflict goes through stages of change. He argued that though increased campus ethnoviolence may have occurred throughout the decades after segregation was declared unconstitutional, the majority and minority groups will eventually reach a stage where accommodation and assimilation of diversity can occur. These final stages could foster more cooperative organizations on campus, which would create multiple forums that could address conflict if it does occur, continuing to move the campus climate forward in terms of racial tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511423249">Fenske &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>). This perspective is supported by prior research that demonstrates that increased exposure to diversity can generate more tolerant racial attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511423249">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>) but is less conclusive in how diversity affects behaviors such as decreasing levels of race-based violence.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that “diversity” is not a monolithic concept and that different racial/ethnic groups trigger different responses from students, faculty, and administrators. In addition, when striving for the condition of “equal status” as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511423249">Allport (1954)</xref>, it is important to recognize that different racial/ethnic groups have different statuses in the educational system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511423249">Hurtado (1992)</xref> found that the more African American students were enrolled in a university or college, the higher the perceived racial tension among students, whereas higher Hispanic enrollment correlated with lower perceived racial tension. There is also the phenomenon of the “model minority” versus “historically disadvantaged” minorities bringing an additional layer to racial/ethnic diversity. Asians are often perceived as not needing help to get into college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511423249">Museus &amp; Kiang, 2009</xref>); for example, Asians make up 11% of the population in California, but 40% of undergraduates admitted in the University of California system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511423249">Chea, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511423249">Golden, 2004</xref>), and somewhat ironically, research has increasingly shown admissions standards that make it more difficult for Asians to be admitted. Conversely, Black and Latino students are often perceived as needing extra consideration in the admissions process, and schools often engage in aggressive recruitment and retention strategies that target these populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511423249">Credle &amp; Dean, 1991</xref>; McNairy, 1996). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511423249">Espenshade and Chung (2005)</xref> found that if affirmative action policies were abandoned in higher education Blacks and Latinos would suffer while Asians would see the largest gains in admissions. Thus, model minority students and students who are perceived to have been admitted because of affirmative action may have a different meaning to White students and their sense of “protecting” academia from students of color.</p>
<p>Given that increased diversity has been predicted to either exacerbate or alleviate racial/ethnic tensions, this study was designed to examine whether the racial/ethnic diversity of a college or university is related to the rate of racially/ethnically motivated hate crimes on campus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260511423249" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Although no database exists that contains hate crimes on campuses across the United States, the FBI does collect data from colleges and universities that choose to participate in the annual Uniform Crime Reports. Technically, schools are supposed to report crimes, including hate crimes, to the Department of Education according to the Clery Act of 1992. However, most schools do not appear to realize that they are supposed to be including hate crimes in their report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511423249">Lively, 1998</xref>). Thus, at this point the FBI data is the most comprehensive available.</p>
<p>Embedded in each year’s report to the FBI is information about race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and disability based hate crimes that occur on campus. The first step in creating a database about hate crimes on campus was to extract the campus data from the FBI’s reports from 1998 to 2008. Because hate crimes are an infrequently reported event and represents an unstable variable, it has been recommended that the reports from multiple years should be collapsed to represent any one geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511423249">Alden &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>). Thus, 10 years of data were then averaged to create a single variable that was the mean of the number of hate crimes in the reported years to represent the frequency of hate crimes at that institution.</p>
<p>The FBI data contain information pertinent to crimes, but not to universities. Thus, three other sources were utilized for information about the participating schools—the Carnegie Classification website, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Princeton Review website. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511423249">Hurtado et al.’s (1999)</xref> model on the many factors that can alter the perception of diversity on campus, and that climate is a multidimensional construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511423249">Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>), many campus features were included as control variables in the analysis. The Carnegie Classification website was used to get basic demographic information about each school: (a) size, as measured by total student enrollments; (b) enrollment profile, measuring the percentage of undergraduate to graduate students; (c) status as a public or private university; (d) selectivity, measured by the Carnegie foundation as more or less selectivity based on transfer rates and incoming students scores on standardized tests and GPAs; and (e) residentiality, the percentage of students who live on campus versus commute. Along with these institutional-level factors that may influence hate crimes and hate crime reporting, prior research has suggested that state level policies can also alter reporting rates on campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511423249">Stotzer, 2010</xref>), so larger contextual factors such as whether or not the state in which the school was located had hate crime laws that included racial/ethnic crimes and whether or not the state had mandatory hate crime training for law enforcement personnel were included. A binary control variable was also added to account for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, since campus diversity may have a different meaning given the different emphasis on race at these schools. Regarding the primary variables of interest, the <italic>Princeton Review</italic> was used to find measures faculty diversity, although the only variable given was a percentage of “minority” faculty. Student diversity is available by racial/ethnic groups, but faculty was only “minority” meaning all non-Whites. Student diversity was available from the National Center on Education Statistics, and percentages of the student body who were reported as Asian, Black, and Latino students were added to the dataset.</p>
<p>The main hypothesis, consistent with evidence that shows positive outcomes of increasingly diverse institutional environments, is that an increase in diversity as measured by minority student enrollments and the presence of minority faculty will be associated with lower reported rates of hate crime when controlling for other factors. In particular, consistent with prior literature that emphasized the importance of the presence of historically disadvantaged groups on campus, we hypothesize that schools with the highest percentages of Blacks and Latinos will report the fewest hate crimes when controlling for other factors.</p>

<title>Institutional Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 418 baccalaureate degree (or higher)–granting colleges and universities are included in the sample for this article (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511423249">Table 1</xref>). The mean of the population of enrolled students is 13,027 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10,689) students. Included in the sample are 354 (84.7%) public universities and 64 (15.3%) private universities. In considering the ratio of graduates and undergraduates, most had more undergraduate students than graduate students. Most were schools considered inclusive or selective with a high transfer rate and most were primarily or highly residential. Of the universities in the sample, the majority were located in states with hate crime laws that included race and ethnicity, whereas the majority of schools were located in states that did not have mandatory law enforcement hate crime training.</p>

<p>Regarding the primary variables of interest, the mean percent of faculty who are minorities is 15.94% (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.75), enrolled Black students is 13.9% (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.76), enrolled Latino students is 7.69% (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.01), and enrolled Asian students is 4.95% (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.17).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Because hate crime data are comprised of count data that is not normally distributed, and the mean is smaller than the standard deviation, a standard OLS regression cannot be used, and instead, nonnegative binomial regression is appropriate. Of those schools in which hate crime data were available, complete information along other demographic variables was available for 347 colleges and universities.</p>
<p>First, a negative binomial regression was run including the eight control variables and the total number of minority faculty and Asian, Black, and Latino students with the variable of interest—the average number of hate crimes per year between 1998 and 2007. In this analysis, diversity did not appear to have an overall effect on reported hate crime rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511423249">Table 2</xref>). Contrary to the hypothesis, the racial/ethnic diversity of the student body and the faculty was not associated with overall hate crime rates. However, in the second model, which separated Asian students from Black and Latino students, an association between hate crimes and race/ethnicity of student body emerges. In this model, partially consistent with the hypothesis, schools that were more successful in being able to admit and enroll Black and Latino students reported fewer hate crimes per year. However, there was still no statistically significant effect for minority faculty. Given the importance of separating out those students who are the most disadvantaged, it is possible that this lack of effect for minority faculty may also be due to collapsing across racial and ethnic groups and further analysis is warranted.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Given the theoretical literature on the benefits and consequences of a more diverse learning environment in higher education, these results suggest a promising relationship between increased diversity of the student body and a reduced number of hate crimes on campus. Although the percentage of minority faculty and percentage of Asian students were not found to be significant, the percent of students who were Black or Latino at these institutions of higher education had a significant relationship with reported hate crimes, namely, as the percentage of Black and Latino students increased, the overall reported ethnic/race-based hate crimes decreased, even when controlling for a variety of other factors that can influence reporting rates. Although this relationship clearly cannot identify causation and the reasons for this association must be further explored, these results offer increased support for the importance of diversity on college and university campuses.</p>
<p>Rather than setting up a binary between whites and non-Whites, considering a more complex meaning of race is critical, particularly among minority groups are perceived as “struggling” versus those who are “succeeding.” Asian students are often perceived as the “model minority” in higher education, having extremely successful rates of entry into college despite historical prejudices and biases barring them access to these institutions. One possible explanation for this association between increased presence of Blacks and Latinos and decreased hate crime rates is the efforts of the university/college itself to provide a more inclusive environment. This is not to say that Asian students and faculty do not matter in the overall diversity and sense of inclusiveness on a college or university campus. All groups make a significant educational contribution as their myriad voices and perspectives can be heard. These results suggest that one possible explanation for the relationship between hate crimes and racial/ethnic diversity is that colleges and universities that are more successful in enrolling students with a current and historical disadvantage may be more successful in part because of the atmosphere and commitment at the university. For example, after the California Board of Regents declared that they were no longer going to consider race in admissions in 1995, the number of Black and Latino applicants declined precipitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511423249">Geiser, Ferri, &amp; Kowarski, 2000</xref>). Some have cited the fact that the University of California system was perceived as no longer caring about Black and Latino students, so they would apply to colleges and universities that actually valued their enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511423249">Weiss, 1997</xref>). Thus, those universities that are the most successful in reaching and enrolling Black and Latino students may be providing an atmosphere that is more inclusive for <italic>all</italic> students and that values diversity more than those that have lower enrollments of Blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>However, another area worthy of exploration is how students, rather than the institutions, influence campus climate. It is possible that as tokenism is avoided and more Black and Latino students are enrolled and the overall composition of the student body is more diverse and diversity seems more commonplace. In addition, studies of the rural South during the lynching era have suggested that the relationship between increasing numbers of a minority and reported race-motivated bias may not be linear (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511423249">Corzine, Creech, &amp; Corzine, 1983</xref>), although what that association is has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511423249">Tolnay, Beck, &amp; Massey, 1989</xref>). One suggestion is that as the population of a minority group increases, so does the sense of threat for the majority group, resulting in increased bias-motivated crime. However, past a certain point where the minority group moves toward the majority, the rate of bias-motivated crime decreases because of a hypothesized perception of increased threat of retaliation. This could be reflect on campus as well; when the percentage of Blacks and Latinos are too low, then there is actually increased risk of hate crime because of their token status, but when the percentage of Blacks and Latinos goes up, the risk decreases because of the threat of retaliation from Blacks and Latinos. Although these results suggest a relationship between increased Blacks and Latinos and decreased reports of racial/ethnic hate crimes, it is not clear whether this is due to changes in the institution’s climate from institutional sources, or from the students themselves. These results cannot tease apart these two possibilities, but given the multidimensionality of campus climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511423249">Hurtado et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511423249">Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>), it is likely a combination of many factors outside of percentage of racial/ethnic minorities alone that are contributing to this relationship. However, this research highlights the importance of racial/ethnic minorities’ presence on campus as an important starting point for considering how diversity is related to campus safety.</p>
<p>Whenever dealing with hate crime data, there are limitations that are inherent to accurate analysis. First, it has been cited repeatedly that due to collection strategies, there is an undercount of hate crimes, particularly among college/university students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511423249">Ehrlich, 2009</xref>). Students have reported a variety of reasons for underreporting hate crimes to their university and college administrators, such as seeing the incident as not serious or important, believing the authorities would do nothing, or believing that there was nothing that the authorities could do about the incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511423249">Ehrlich, 1994</xref>). The Department of Justice has suggested that in addition to state police needing training, campus security are also in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511423249">Wessler &amp; Moss, 2001</xref>). Second, there are some temporal concerns regarding the mismatch between the time frame of the variable of interest (hate crimes) and all those tested. To solidify the fragile hate crime variable, it is recommended that many years are collapsed together, but the independent variables all reflect a static picture of each school since data were collected about size, selectivity, and so on, on 2007-2008 numbers. Third, it is also important to note that this study included only baccalaureate or higher degree–granting institutions. Initally, FBI data was scanned for all institutions, including community colleges, but the extremely limited number of community colleges that participated in the hate crime reports made including them in the sample a generalizability issue. Future studies need to address the question about diversity on community colleges, given their unique place in the education landscape. Fourth, other findings have suggested that hate crimes can be a reflection of changing social and community composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511423249">Grattet, 2009</xref>), and changes to that composition can elicit prejudicial responses. Undoubtedly, many of these schools underwent changes in racial/ethnic composition, campus climate, and a host of other factors in that 10-year span that is reflected in the hate crime data and not in the demographic data. Thus, future research needs to find ways to capitalize on campus changes while still managing to take into account the instability of any one year’s hate crime reports in any one location. Last, the importance of a diverse faculty, staff, and administration could only be touched on in this analysis with one lump evaluation of “minority faculty” provided by the <italic>Princeton Review</italic>. A more complex analysis of the importance of diversity at all levels of the educational institution needs to be examined.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, these results are promising evidence of the effectiveness and importance of diversity on college and university campuses. Universities and colleges with higher percentages of Black and Latino students reported fewer hate crimes than less racially/ethnically diverse campuses, when controlling for other factors. Further research is needed to explore what factors contribute to the relationship between the increased presence of Black and Latino students on campus and decreased hate crimes. However, in addition to the prior research that suggests the relationship between racial/ethnic diversity and an institution’s educational goals, these results suggest that an institutions’ increased efforts to recruit minority students is related to campus safety as well.</p>
