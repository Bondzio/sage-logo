<abstract>
<p>Various techniques have been presented to detect rolling element bearing faults, however, it is still a huge challenge to accurately extract features under high noise level. In this paper, a new approach based on matching pursuit for analyzing the signals of rolling element bearings is proposed. Different from most of the matching pursuit related works focusing on the time-frequency plane, complexity spectrum and complexity spectrum entropy are proposed in this research to accurately extract the fault feature of a rolling element bearing signal under a low signal to noise ratio. Both simulation and experiment show that complexity spectrum works better than envelope spectrum in distinguishing characteristic frequencies of fault bearings submerged in noise. An accelerated whole lifetime test of bearing has been performed to collect vibration data, which is analyzed by complexity spectrum entropy and other normal approaches. Results show that complexity spectrum entropy has some unique characteristics.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311405369"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Rolling element bearings are widely used in rotary machinery, but they are also one of the major factors for machinery faults. Timely fault detection of bearings plays an important role in machine condition monitoring and has received considerable attention from researchers and engineers. Localized defects such as surface spalling are typical faults of rolling element bearings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311405369">Barkov et al., 1995</xref>). These defects will reduce the bearings’ lifetime or even cause the breakdown of machines, thus make a great loss or even threaten human life.</p>
<p>Vibration analysis has been established as the most common and practical method for detecting rolling bearing defects. Defects cause impacts at frequencies depending on the operating speed of the unit and the geometry of the bearings, which in turn are modulated by machine natural frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311405369">Nikolaou et al., 2002</xref>). The signal of a damaged bearing consists of an exponentially decaying ringing that occurs periodically at the characteristic defect frequency. The location dependent characteristic defect frequencies make it possible to detect the presence of a defect and to diagnose on which part of the bearing the defect is. Nevertheless, vibration signals acquired from accelerometers mounted on the outer surface of a bearing housing always consist of vibration from bearings, shafts, meshing gears and other components under all kinds of background noise. Thus, features of bearing defects are submerged in noise making it hard to diagnose especially during the early stage of fault.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, several methods have been proposed, based on either the time domain or traditional spectral analysis. Among them, the most popular and well-established approaches may be time-domain averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311405369">Braun and Datner, 1979</xref>), cepstrum analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311405369">Barkov et al., 1995</xref>) and envelope analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311405369">Ho and Randall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077546311405369">Randall, 1987</xref>). Envelope analysis is very helpful in the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, but it usually needs to select a frequency band in which the impulsive components excited by the defect are dominant. This is difficult to ascertain inmany practical applications. The development of time-frequency domain methods such as Short Time Fourier Transform, Wigner-Ville Distribution, Wavelet Transform, and advanced signal processing techniques such as empirical mode decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077546311405369">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), cyclostationary analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311405369">Antoni, 2007</xref>) have added significant potential for accurate bearing fault diagnosis.</p>
<p>Compared with the approaches mentioned above, matching pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311405369">Mallat and Zhang, 1993</xref>) is a more adaptive algorithm using time-frequency dictionaries to decompose a signal. Its objective is to generate sparse and highly informative signal representations, given a particular over-complete dictionary. Some valuable achievements have been obtained in the machinery fault diagnosis area using matching pursuit algorithm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311405369">Feng and Chu (2007)</xref> exploited a new gear damage detection method using matching pursuit. In the bearing defects detection area, it has been applied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311405369">Liu et al. (2002)</xref>, who used the selected atoms to present a time-frequency plane to identify the defects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311405369">Lonescu and Stefanoiu (2006)</xref> combined a genetic algorithm with matching pursuit for bearings’ fault detection and prediction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077546311405369">Zhang et al. (2007)</xref> proposed an early bearing failure detection approach utilizing probabilistic matching pursuit. This study attempts to detect bearing faults using matching pursuit from another perspective.</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows: in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-1077546311405369">section 2</xref>, the matching pursuit algorithm is briefly introduced based on which signal complexity is educed. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-1077546311405369">section 3</xref>, the complexity spectrum method is proposed and its ability to detect localized rolling element bearing faults under simulation and experiment is illustrated. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec13-1077546311405369">section 4</xref>, the complexity spectrum entropy is proposed as a complementary index for rolling element bearing performance degradation assessment. The comparison of complexity spectrum entropy, normal spectral entropy and root mean square (RMS) using accelerated whole lifetime bearing test data is shown to reveal some unique characteristics of complexity spectrum entropy. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec16-1077546311405369">section 5</xref>, conclusions are presented.</p>

We can see that the lower the correlation ratios between a particular signal <italic>f</italic> and its residues, the lower the decay of their norm.

These high energy components can be viewed as “coherent structure” with regard to the dictionary.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077546311405369">Rankine et al. (2007)</xref> defined the signal complexity to analyze newborn EEG. Given a dictionary <italic>D</italic>, the signal complexity was defined as the minimum number of atoms needed by matching pursuit (MP) decomposition to approximate the signal to a desired level of accuracy. In this paper, the approximation accuracy, [i.e., residue to signal ratio (RSR)], is defined as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula11-1077546311405369"><label>(11)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311405369-eq11.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>If an appropriate decomposition dictionary is chosen as well as a suitable approximation accuracy is set, the complexity of each segment of rolling bearing signal can be calculated as an index to indicate whether it contains an exponential decaying impact vibration. Because when the signal segment contains impact vibration, which is “coherent structure” with regard to the dictionary, its norm decreases quickly resulting in a relatively low complexity value. On the contrary, pure noise has a relatively high complexity value. Based on these, we may find a new approach to analyze signal.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1077546311405369"><title>3. Signal complexity spectrum method</title>
<p>As mentioned above, applying signal complexity to identify impact vibration from unwanted noise is a current major problem. However, the results are beyond expectation. Through analyzing and solving some crucial problems, we find a new method, which is also based on the signal complexity concept, to make it capable of getting good results under high noise.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1077546311405369"><title>3.1. Vibration Mathematical Model of Rolling Element Bearing</title>
<p>The vibration signal of a rolling element bearing is complex either under normal state or with a defect, including components resulting from its structure, tolerance, and surface deterioration such as spalling fatigue and abrasive wear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311405369">McFadden and Smith (1984)</xref> developed a model produced by a single point defect, which incorporates the effects of rolling element bearing geometry, shaft speed, load distribution, transfer function, and the exponential decay vibration. This model was extended to describe the vibration produced by multiple point defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311405369">McFadden and Smith, 1985</xref>). The models above consider shocks as exactly periodicity. However, because the rolling elements experience some random slip, these shocks’ periodicity is not exact. In addition, their amplitudes are subjected to modulation by the rotations of the inner race (inner race fault), the outer race (outer race fault), or the cage (rolling element fault). Synthetically considering these factors, the mathematical model of a defective rolling element bearing can be expressed as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-1077546311405369">equation (12)</xref>.

</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1077546311405369"><title>3.2. Signal Complexity of Rolling Element Bearing</title>
<p>To verify whether the signal complexity is feasible for bearing defection, the above-mentioned vibration mathematical model is used to generate a simulating signal for analysis. The simulating model parameters are set as the same as the later experiment with 32 Hz of characteristic outer defect frequency and 25.6 KHz of sampling rate. Natural frequency of the bearing system is set to 2000 Hz.</p>
<p>The choice of dictionary is critical for MP decomposition to achieve sparse and informative representation of a given signal. For the vibration signals of rolling element bearings, there are several optional dictionaries such as the Gabor dictionary and wavelet packet dictionary among which the Gabor atom has relatively better time-frequency features but a slower computation speed. However, time frequency features are not this work’s focus and the wavelet packet dictionary has several good advantages such as its efficiency of computation with a quadrature mirror filter bank algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311405369">Rioul and Vetterli, 1991</xref>). Besides, a wavelet packet dictionary is a family of orthonormal bases composed of vectors that are well localized both in time and frequency. So in the study a wavelet packet dictionary is chosen to implement the MP algorithm. For a signal of N samples, each vector of a wavelet packet dictionary isindexed by <italic>γ</italic> = (<italic>j</italic>, <italic>p</italic>, <italic>k</italic>), with 0 ≤ <italic>j</italic> ≤ log<sub>2</sub>(<italic>N</italic>), 0 ≤ <italic>p</italic> ≤ 2<sup>-<italic>j</italic></sup><italic>N</italic>, 0 ≤ <italic>k</italic> ≤ 2<sup><italic>j</italic></sup>. Such a vector has a similar time-frequency localization properties as a discrete window function, dilated by 2<sup><italic>j</italic></sup>, centered at 2<sup><italic>j</italic></sup>(<italic>p</italic> + 1/2), and modulated by a sinusoidal wave of frequency 2<italic>π</italic>2<sup>-<italic>j</italic></sup>(<italic>k</italic> + 1/2). Various orthogonal wavelet functions are available in the wavelet packet dictionary at present, including Haar, Daubechies, coiflets, and symlets. Considering the structure similarity of wavelet and bearing impact vibration, support range and computation complexity, we choose coiflet3 wavelet packet as the dictionary in the later calculation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311405369">Figure 1</xref> shows the simulated vibration signals of an outer defective bearing and corresponding complexity curves under different signal noise ratio (SNR) with the approximation accuracy <italic>RSR</italic> = 0.3.

<p>As seen, we cannot achieve good results through direct complexity analysis. In this section, the inner structural features of bearing and their coherence with our dictionary atoms is studied to find a solution.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2</xref> shows the decay of RSR values as MP decomposition iteration increases under various SNR. Each of the four decomposed signals consists of an integral impact vibration signal and a different level of noise as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-1077546311405369">equation (12)</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2(a)</xref>, it is observed that all the curves decay exponentially converging to 0 when the iteration is large enough, which is in accordance with the theoretical statement in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-1077546311405369">section 2</xref>. Compared with pure Gaussian white noise, RSR of the signal contained impact vibration drops remarkably at the beginning, which is caused by the coherent structure between impact component and wavelet packet dictionary atoms. Among the signals impact component contained, the added noise has reduced the high-energy coherent structures, so the lower the noise level is, the more significantly RSR drops at first. Through the above observation and analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2(a)</xref>, the reason why direct signal complexity analysis loses effectiveness under <italic>SNR</italic> = - 15<italic>dB</italic> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec7-1077546311405369">section 3.2</xref> can be described that the iteration numbers of both Gaussian white noise and signal with −15 dB SNR are round 36 where RSR is 0.3, so there is no distinctive difference and the complexity curve seems useless. What is more, the red curve is close to the blue one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2(a)</xref>, which means it is hard to distinguish them with the complexity based method.

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2(a)</xref>, it can be deduced that the optimal RSR as the decomposition stopping criteria can be obtained by making the subtraction of iterations of Gaussian noise and signal maximum. But it seems impossible to calculate an optimal RSR for each SNR, and the SNR is always unknown in real condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311405369">Figure 2(b)</xref> gives a zoomed view of RSR decay and it gives a clue to solve this problem. It can be found that after the first decomposition, the value of RSR under <italic>SNR</italic> = - 15<italic>dB</italic> is 0.917 and the value is much smaller as the SNR increase. On the contrary, RSR value after the first iteration is almost at 0.961 of a pure Gaussian noise. So we can utilize this feature to distinguish signal from Gaussian noise.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1077546311405369"><title>3.4. Complexity Spectrum with Relatively Uniform RSR</title>
<p>Based on the above study, RSR value is uniformly chosen as 0.95 that can theoretically identify an impact signal with at least −15 dB SNR from pure noise. If it works, the computational cost is reduced enormously compared with the relatively low RSR value. In order to verify the effect, the simulation result is shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311405369">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1077546311405369" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Complexity analysis of simulated vibration signals under –15 dB noise with <italic>RSR</italic> = 0.95.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311405369-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311405369">Figure 3</xref>, when RSR is chosen relatively high as 0.95, the periodical impacts reflect roughly on the complexity curve which is better than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311405369">Figure (1)</xref>b, but it is not an outstanding index to extract the characteristic defect frequencies. The complexity spectrum is proposed as a method to detect bearing fault even at the very early stage. Just as the name implies, a complexity spectrum is an amplitude spectrum of signal complexity which is obtained as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311405369">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311405369">Figure 4</xref> gives a simulation result of the complexity spectrum method. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311405369">Figure 4(a)</xref>, when noise level is relatively low, both the complexity spectrum and envelope spectrum are dominated by assumed repetition frequency of impacts (=32 Hz) and its harmonics, however, there are fewer harmonics in the complexity spectrum. As SNR decreases to −10 dB so that the impact components are completely submerged in the noise, there is almost no negative effect on the complexity spectrum while considerable interference appears in the envelope spectrum. The envelope spectrum completely loses its validity when <italic>SNR</italic> = - 15<italic>dB</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311405369">Figure 4(c)</xref>. For a further comparison, the matching pursuit time-frequency planes of the signals under different noise depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311405369">Figure 4</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311405369">Figure 5</xref>, in each plane the atoms selected in the first 80 iterations are presented and each of them describes the time-frequency features of the vibration. The average time spacing between the regions marked by ‘A’,’B’ and so on in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311405369">Figure 5(a)</xref> measures about 0.031s, which is close to the assumed characteristic defect period. However, as noise increases, the time-frequency plane is hard to identify especially when <italic>SNR</italic> = - 15<italic>dB</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311405369">Figure 5(c)</xref>. Through comparisons above, the advantage of the complexity spectrum in detecting weak defection can obviously be seen.

<p>Although the above study on RSR is based on the ideal simulation and the real condition is more complicated, the analysis results are also meaningful and have directive significance in reality. It has been explained that we can distinguish an impact signal from Gaussian white noise when the RSR is chosen as 0.95 and in many cases the noise of vibration signals collected in the real condition can be rationally assumed and dealt as Gaussian noise. Consider a machine that has many components (in good condition) except that the fault bearing is generating different types of (periodic and random) vibration. In this case, the vibration signals generated by these components can be considered as noise relative to impact signal, and this vibration noise measured on the surface of the machine tend to have a probability distribution similar to a Gaussian distribution according to the central limit theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077546311405369">Shin, 2008</xref>). Besides, the vibration signal conforms to Gaussian distribution when the bearing is running healthily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311405369">Bannister, 1985</xref>). Our experimental set is a normal machine, so the background vibration noise can be considered to conform to Gaussian distribution and the later analysis results confirm our consideration. Here the RSR is chosen as 0.95 to analyze the experimental data, however, it must be mentioned that the RSR value can be adjusted slightly around 0.95 in real application in order to achieve the best result of the complexity spectrum. A smaller RSR value should be chosen under relatively high SNR, and vice versa.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311405369">Figure 7</xref> shows the vibration signals of different fault type bearings. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311405369">Figure 8</xref>, complexity spectrums of 3 typical defection signals are demonstrated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311405369">Figure 8(a)</xref> is the normal bearing signal complexity spectrum which shows no obvious peaks.

Similarly, a clear peak at 53.5 Hz (outer race passing frequency is 51.9 Hz as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311405369">Table 2</xref>) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311405369">Figure 8(c)</xref> indicates the inner race defection. As a comparison, the envelope spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311405369">Figure 9(b)</xref> indicates nothing and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311405369">Figure 9(c)</xref> gives a relatively satisfactory result for detecting inner race defection, but interfering fluctuations are more notable than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311405369">Figure 8(c)</xref>.

<sec id="sec14-1077546311405369"><title>4.1. Performance Degradation Assessment and Spectral Entropy</title>
<p>Performance degradation assessment is a new research direction for prognostics which is much more efficient than diagnostics to achieve zero downtime performance. Compared with diagnostics, it focuses more on vibration trend over a whole lifetime. However, the majority of related works are dedicated to fault classification rather than selecting the proper indices which is critical to indicate rolling element bearing performance degradation. Some time statistical indicators are useful such as RMS, crest factor, kurtosis, among which RMS is mostly used, crest factor and kurtosis are more sensitive to impulse defect but reduce to normal-like levels as the damage grows.</p>
<p>Information entropy was firstly proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311405369">Shannon (1948)</xref> to measure information’s uncertainty. For an absolutely continuous random variable <italic>X</italic> having probability density function <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), information entropy is defined as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula13-1077546311405369"><label>(13)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311405369-eq13.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Information entropy holds the following properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077546311405369">Ozdemir, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077546311405369">Ziha, 2000</xref>).
<list id="list1-1077546311405369" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>When the outcome of an event is certain, the entropy is zero.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When all the events are equiprobable, the entropy is maximal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The increase of an events number results in entropy’s increase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The entropy is solely dependent on the probability distribution of the event occurrence.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Based on information entropy, Spectral entropy has been proposed to measure the distribution of frequencies which can be defined as below
<disp-formula id="disp-formula14-1077546311405369"><label>(14)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311405369-eq14.tif"/></disp-formula>

Spectral entropy yields larger value when amplitude distribution is flat, especially when amplitudes of each frequency component are equal, where it yields the largest value 1. Or it yields smaller value if amplitudes concentrate in a few frequency components, especially when only one frequency component has non-zero amplitude, where it yields the smallest value 0. Thus, the range of spectral entropy defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula14-1077546311405369">equation (14)</xref> is [0, 1].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1077546311405369"><title>4.2. Complexity Spectrum Entropy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077546311405369">Pan et al. (2009)</xref> have proposed spectral entropy as a complementary index for bearing performance degradation assessment and it can more obviously detect an incipient weak defect than RMS. Nevertheless spectral entropy changes abruptly when a defect occurs and keeps almost flat between these abrupt transit points. It is not an expected ideal trend to predict the later state of a bearing. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311405369">Figure 4</xref>, we have seen that the probability distribution of complexity spectrum is dependent on the SNR value. Complexity spectrum is more convergent at some frequencies when noise level is low and tends to flat under complete Gaussian noise which means the complexity spectrum entropy gets an overall downward trend during the whole life of the bearing. So we propose complexity spectrum entropy as a complementary index indicating the state of the bearing.</p>
<p>A comparison of different indices for bearing performance degradation assessment over the whole lifetime is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311405369">Figure 10</xref>. The analyzed data is collected from rolling element bearing accelerated life test on an accelerated bearing life tester (ABLT-1A) provided by Hangzhou Bearing Test and Research Center (HBRC) with the assistance of UNDP/UNIDO (ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation). One group (20480 points) data was collected per minute with 25.6 KHz sampling rate. The tested rolling element bearing’ type is 6307, and its corresponding parameters can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311405369">Table 3</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311405369">Figure 10(b)</xref>, there are two obvious transits during the bearing’s whole life which can also be seen vaguely in RMS at the same time. The first one maybe occurred by inner state change, and the second one indicates failure. Besides these two transits, there is no general trend that can help us study the state changing of the bearing. What is more, spectral entropy abruptly changes to a higher value at the first transit, which is hard to explain. However, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311405369">Figure 10(c)</xref>, the complexity spectrum entropy has a general decreasing trend with less abrupt changes at the two mentioned transits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311405369">Figure 10(d)</xref> shows its trend more clearly after fragmental averaging, which removes its strong fluctuation effect. We can see that complexity spectrum entropy has an overall declining trend during the whole lifetime of a bearing, as expected. As with the development of the bearing defect, the complexity spectrum concentrates more apparently in few frequency components, therefore, complexity spectral entropy yields a smaller value. This feature is useful for further study especially for bearing performance degradation assessment. Because complexity spectral entropy decreases gradually with the rolling element bearing’s defect development over the whole lifetime, it is unlike spectral entropy with a stable trend until the failure occurred so that no useful information can be obtained to avoid the failure occurrence. So complexity spectral entropy is an effective index to reflect rolling element bearing’s performance degradation process compared with spectral entropy, and it is very useful to realize predictive maintenance combined with some intelligent decision methods such as Support Vector Machine or Hidden Markov Modeling. Further research will be taken to study how the complexity spectrum entropy performs under different bearings’ whole lifetime data and how can complexity spectrum entropy can be utilized by some intelligent decision methods to assess bearing performance degradation.

<sec id="sec16-1077546311405369"><title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>Rolling element bearing defects detection is a very important aspect of machinery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. In this study, a matching pursuit-based method signal complexity spectrum is proposed for detecting bearing defects with relatively outstanding performance compared with an envelope spectrum especially under significant noise level. Meanwhile, further study on the reason why signal complexity and complexity spectrum can work effectively with proper RSR is discussed. Experiment results show that this method has the ability of detecting and diagnosing bearing faults at the very early stage of their development. Due to the amplitude distributions’ feature of complexity spectrum under different noise levels, we introduce entropy to the complexity spectrum method. The analysis result of bearing accelerated life test data show that complexity spectrum entropy has a general downward trend during the whole lifetime of the bearing. It is a unique characteristic compared with RMS and spectral entropy, whose trends are almost flat between abrupt transit points can hardly predict anything. However, further studies should be focused on getting to know complexity spectrum deeper as well as how to set parameters properly for the purpose of achieving optimal analysis results. Utility of complexity spectrum entropy by some intelligent decision methods to get relatively valuable assessment results is also in need of further research.</p>
