<p>The perception of oneself is rarely developed without being measured against the Other, whoever that may be. In György Péteri’s collection of essays <italic>Imagining the West in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union</italic>, the ‘West’ is the Other that the people of East Central Europe and the Soviet Union measured themselves against, yet as it quickly becomes clear, even the definition of what ‘the West’ encapsulates is inconsistent. In some cases, the West is the Other, while in different cases it is instead the East that is perceived as being the Other. What complicates matters even more is that this concept changes with time due both to social and political developments. The idea of mental mapping, or where a person considers him or herself to belong, is the central concept of the work and is explored through a variety of media, be it though travel writing, architecture, social welfare programmes, film, music and even work conditions, among others.</p>
<p>While in the case of the Soviet Union, the idea was almost always to present the nation and its culture as opposed to the West or as somehow surpassing the West, curiously this was never by having it become part of the West. The Soviet Union, be it due to ideology or geography, always remained firmly in the East, as argued in the book. By contrast, the concept of the West was different in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany and Poland (the other countries included in this collection). These countries in Central Europe were caught between east and west, and for ideological and geographical reasons (not to mention religion or even something as basic as alphabet) always inclined towards the West, if indeed they did not feel outright that they belonged to it. Karen Gammelgard’s essay on Czech travel writers who discovered to their surprise that they had far more in common with their western yet unliked German neighbours, as opposed to their linguistically similar Slavic (but in their minds backward) eastern Russian brothers illustrates this conundrum well.</p>
<p>The book spans approximately a hundred years, and this is not without its problems. While the initial chapter is useful in illustrating how the ‘east or west’ question pre-dated the Cold War, Gammelgard and Erik Ingebrigsten’s essays (the latter on interwar Hungarian health care reform) are the only ones discussing topics chronologically before the Second World War. The result is that they appear tacked on, rather than part of a flowing narrative. Additionally, placing the countries of East Central Europe and the Soviet Union together suggests more in common than there really was. East Germany was firmly a part of Western Europe before Germany was divided, and Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia (in this book specifically the Czechs) all historically belonged to the West. For this reason, Hungarians (and I assume this would also apply to the Czechs and Poles) have preferred the more neutral (and suggestively more western) term ‘Central European’. Of course, during the Cold War these nations belonged to the Eastern Bloc, but it is not as if with the introduction of communism following the Second World War the mindset somehow became ‘eastern’, even if the mindset cannot be said to be identical to that found in north-western Europe. Evidence for this is provided by the quote from the Polish architect Jerzy Wierzbicki on a trip to France and Italy described in David Crowley’s essay, in which Wierzbicki states ‘We returned to Western Europe after 17 years’ (119). The statement can of course (and should be) interpreted as Wierzbicki stating not only that he was physically in Western Europe once again, but that he and his fellow architects had returned to where the Polish mind belongs.</p>
<p>These shortcomings notwithstanding, Crowley, Elaine Kelly, Anne E. Gorsuch and Paulina Bren’s essays (the latter three on Wagner in divided Germany, Soviet Cinema and Czech attitudes towards the West during the Dubček and Husák years, respectively) are gems, being not only informative but also a pleasure to read. Perhaps one of the most important and interesting observations made in Bren’s essay regarding communism versus capitalism is that one of the main reasons for returning given by Czech repatriates, was that although communism did not supply one with a better life than one could achieve in the West, it provided an easier one, where hard work was not expected nor the lack of it punished, echoes of which still reverberate in East Central Europe to this day. Like any other collection of essays with numerous authors, Péteri’s book runs the risk of being uneven, which it frequently is. That said, this should not take away from its better parts, which stand well on their own.</p>
