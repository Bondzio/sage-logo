<p>Sociologists have long distinguished themselves from historians through an insistence that sociology focuses on recurrent activities that can be understood through analyses that deemphasize temporal fluxes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306112457651">1</xref></sup> Of course this description of sociology can easily be caricatured in a way that does not do justice to the nuance and subtlety of most of our arguments. It does however have a grain of truth in it. Much recent work in environmental sociology appears both ahistorical and decontextualized relative to work by environmental historians, geographers, and anthropologists. In the most common variant of this type of sociological work, the authors amass data from secondary sources, describe several competing but very general theoretical perspectives, and then analyze the data to find out which of the two perspectives receives support. All of this work proceeds with only minimal reference to the context or historical moment to which the data refer. In their detachment from particular contexts, these analyses resemble the abstracted empiricism that Mills inveighed against so many years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094306112457651">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To add value to socio-ecological analyses by environmental sociologists, it would seem important to pay renewed attention to the challenge of integrating unruly, disordered sequences of historical events into the recurrent social patterns that our training has taught us to emphasize. Otherwise we risk conveying to readers an unduly static impression of the dynamics that drive environment/society relations. Studies of “business as usual” conditions do not capture the ways in which single events or aggregations of events transform societies. This point is not exactly a new one (in fact this essay’s title is cribbed from Sewell<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094306112457651">3</xref></sup>), but it bears repeating, especially in a context when inertia appears to best describe the societal response to global warming.</p>
<p>How then might environmental sociologists incorporate historical events more fully into their analyses? Four recent and quite admirable contributions to environmental sociology offer examples about how we might incorporate the transformative impacts of historical events into analyses of environment/society relations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094306112457651">
<title>Shopping Our Way to Safety</title>
<p>In <italic>Shopping Our Way to Safety: How We Changed from Protecting the Environment to Protecting Ourselves</italic>, Andrew Szasz offers us a new way of looking at behaviors that seem “environmental” but differ from conventionally understood environmental activism. He distinguishes between environmentally-oriented activities which benefit an individual’s personal environment and activities that benefit the larger environment in which we all live. The first category of activities includes eating organic food, drinking “purified” bottled water, and living in safe, crime-free suburban communities. In each instance, the individuals secure a safe product for consumption by themselves and their families. In providing these goods for their families, these household heads pursue a strategy of inverted quarantine. They wall out potential environmental bads, the criminals, the dirty water, and the contaminated foods. Because this strategy protects by reducing exposure, Szasz refers to it as “inverted quarantine.” It could also be construed as a kind of defensive environmentalist practice that benefits the immediate environments of individuals as opposed to the more common altruistic environmentalist practice that benefits the globe but not anyone of us in particular.</p>
<p>Szasz’s conceptual work in <italic>Shopping</italic> represents an important contribution to environmental sociology. He goes on to argue in his book that privately-pursued strategies of inverted quarantine demobilize the larger polity. For example, if wealthy people can secure a private supply of potable water for themselves, they will not insist that local governments and water companies provide potable water to all of their users, which in turn will make it less likely that these organizations will provide the public good to their constituents. To make his case for the prevalence of the inverted quarantine strategy, Szasz provides short histories of the American move to the suburbs, adoption of bottled drinking water, and growing consumption of organic food. His purpose in these reviews is to establish that these practices of inverted quarantine are all increasing in frequency. He also reviews one completed episode of inverted quarantine, the frenzied construction of bomb shelters during the early 1960s. The case studies of the bomb shelter building spree, the move to the suburbs, the increased use of water in plastic bottles, and the growth in the popularity of organic foods all accomplish their primary goal, to establish the growing prevalence of inverted quarantine strategies in different fields of activity. The specific historical dynamics driving each trend do not, however, come through in a way that fully reinforces Szasz’s central argument.</p>
<p>The first of the examples in the book, the bomb shelter panic of the early 1960s, illustrates the problem. With the Soviet acquisition of the atomic bomb in the late 1940s and the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles during the 1950s, American policymakers began to discuss how it might be possible for at least some individuals and families to survive a cold war initiated nuclear exchange. Many of <italic>Contemporary Sociology</italic>’s older readers probably remember when, as children, we had to crawl under our school desks during air raid drills. At the same time civil defense authorities encouraged homeowners to construct and provision bomb shelters in their basements, all in an effort to somehow ensure the survival of the family in the aftermath of a nuclear blast. Popular alarm about impending nuclear attacks grew during the early 1960s with the continuing crisis over the status of Berlin and the Cuban missile crisis. Then, for reasons that Szasz does not describe, the arguments against building the bomb shelters, their ineffectiveness, their expense, and their seeming link to a more bellicose foreign policy, gradually began to win the day, but for reasons that are not clear. Bomb shelters really do embody “inverted quarantine,” but it is not clear why this strategy lost its appeal among the public.</p>
<p>Szasz’s suburban example also seems compelling up until a certain historical point. He clearly demonstrates that the middle and upper classes succeeded in building a suburban bubble around their homes. The construction of the interstate highway system during the late 1950s and early 1960s made the move to the suburbs more possible, and the episodes of racial unrest in center cities during the early and mid-1960s made the move to the suburbs seem more desirable. More recently, evidence of increased residential segregation by class has emerged, reflecting perhaps the increased construction of gated communities during the 1980s and 1990s. Do these patterns indicate that the adoption of inverted quarantine strategies are driven primarily by growing inequalities within societies, which events like riots throw into bold relief? This line of reasoning seems plausible, but not complicated enough. For example, the practice of inverted quarantine among the upper classes could increasingly prevent the middle classes from doing likewise. In the New York metropolitan area, the creation of exclusive land use controls during the 1980s and 1990s by wealthy suburban residents reduced new home construction in the suburbs to the point where most new housing construction after 2000 occurred in the urban core in relatively poor places like Jersey City.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094306112457651">4</xref></sup> In effect, the efforts of the upper classes to wall themselves off from the rest of the world may have succeeded, at least around New York City, in increasing residential integration among the middle and lower classes.</p>
<p>Szasz’s discussion about the growth in the consumption of bottled water and organic food again accomplishes his primary goal, which is to demonstrate that these consumer practices are indeed trending upward and that people adopt these practices in order to safeguard their young and themselves from various industrial contaminants in food and water. The difficulty with these narratives is that they do not attend to historical fluctuations in the consumption of both bottled water and organic foods. For example, the surge of interest in organic foods in California apparently followed three events that occurred one after another in the spring of 1989: the arrival of cyanide-laced grapes in the United States from Chile, the discovery of the pesticide Alar on apples that parents put in the school lunch boxes of their children, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094306112457651">5</xref></sup> This dynamic suggests that inverted quarantine strategies can appear suddenly. What sorts of processes lead to their atrophy? More detailed historical work on these fluctuations would provide readers with a more tangible sense about the conditions that encourage and discourage inverted quarantine strategies. The more general point would be that more detailed historical narratives might both reinforce the central theoretical message in <italic>Shopping</italic> and embellish it, even with historical exceptions that prove the rule.</p>

<title>Environmental Inequalities Beyond Borders</title>
<p>Recent research on the spread of the environmental justice movement around the globe has been enriched by techniques of narrative explanation typically used by historians. These analyses focus on sequences of events and demonstrate how “one thing leads to another” in struggles for environmental justice. Three contributions to <italic>Environmental Inequalities Beyond Borders: Local Perspectives on Global Injustices</italic>, edited by JoAnn Carmin and Julian Agyeman, do an exemplary job of integrating narrative explanations into analyses of popular struggles to curb industrial pollution in the Global South. Each one of these analyses, from Nigeria, Fiji, and Bulgaria, explains changes in the substance of the struggles from one historical phase to the next through a combination of shifts in the participating organizations that, coupled with prior events, explain historical turns in the substance of later struggles. The following paragraphs outline these narratives of political struggle.</p>
<p>An historical narrative of the struggle to reduce the exposure of the Ogoni people to flaring gases and oil spills in the Niger River delta of Nigeria recounts how democratization, political mobilization among the Ogoni, and publicity by international environmental NGOs led to a gradual increase in central government transparency and a commitment to devolve more funds to local and provincial governments. The local and regional governments do not appear to have used the additional funds to deliver services to their constituents, so basic injustices persist. By following the trail of money over time, the authors have underlined the pivotal role that local governments have recently come to play in curbing or continuing environmental injustices.</p>
<p>A second study of a mining enterprise and a bottled water company in Fiji narrates how the water company with a globally recognized brand name gradually came to recognize the importance of reaching out to local populations and providing them with potable water near the sources of water that the company bottled. The mining enterprise, located in close proximity to the water sources, had long resisted providing a supply of potable water to the miners’ families. The sudden closure of the mine in 2006 and subsequent reopening in 2007 under new ownership spurred a local mobilization around the issue of clean water in the mining community which in turn brought to light the less-than-savory environmental practices of the bottling company. Intent on defending its brand name, bottle company executives created a program to help local communities acquire potable water.</p>
<p>A final narrative involves a comparative historical analysis of three post millennial proposals for gold mining in Bulgaria. Each project would have required the use of cyanide to separate the gold from the ore, and local residents expressed fears about the contamination of their ground water with cyanide. The struggles between the mining companies and community groups played out in a rapidly changing political context marked by the adoption of democracy in the early 1990s and accession to the European Community in 2007. Variations in the extent of local mobilization around the issue and an adept framing of the issue in a way that appealed to an ethnically-based political party led to variable outcomes in the three cases, but in two of the three cases the companies withdrew their plans for cyanide-based mining. Without testimony from company officials about the factors that persuaded them to abandon the mining projects, it is difficult to gauge the importance of the macropolitical changes in the eventual resolution of these conflicts, but it is hard to imagine successful popular resistance to these projects before 1989.</p>
<p>In all three cases, historical events played a crucial role in subsequent changes in local environment/society relations. Large changes, like democratization, mattered in two of the three cases while a seemingly inconsequential event, a change in the ownership of a mine, triggered the changes in the other case. In each instance an historical narrative, featuring events that transformed social structures as well as sociological tools like framing, were crucial in providing readers with insightful analyses.</p>

<title>Who Speaks for the Climate?</title>
<p>Maxwell Boykoff’s recent analysis of the media’s coverage of climate change over the past two decades in <italic>Who Speaks for the Climate?: Making Sense of Media Reporting on Climate Change</italic> suggests other ways to incorporate historical events into sociological analyses. A content analysis of particularly salient articles in the press undergirds a narrative explanation of how, for example, beginning in 2005, the press began to make a concerted shift away from the canon of “balanced” reporting on climate change which had led to the biasing practice of pitting climate change denialists, with little or no evidence to support their views, against scientists who acknowledge change and base their conclusions on massive amounts of evidence. The practice of balanced reporting provided an outlier position, whose complete denial of climate change received an unduly prominent place in coverage of the issue. This privileging of the outliers only ended after several media outlets, like <italic>USA Today</italic>, proclaimed the issue of change or no change in the climate to be “settled.” To be sure, denialism lives on, but it does not do so because the press continues to set up head-to-head confrontations between denialists and representatives of the vast majority of scientists who acknowledge change. That practice, according to Boykoff, now occurs less frequently.</p>
<p>Some of the most trenchant of Boykoff’s analyses rely heavily on quantitative measures. For example, fluctuations in the numbers of climate change articles in the tabloid press between 2000 and 2010 leads Boykoff to conclude that there were four peaks in press coverage of the climate issue between 2000 and 2010. The last of these peaks occurred in the run-up to the Copenhagen meetings of late 2009. These month-to-month fluctuations establish quite conclusively that climate change coverage is socially constructed. In other words, people do not just wait around for historically unusual weather before they begin reading and writing about climate change. Socially constructed events like the Copenhagen meetings of the IPCC can cause significant increases in press coverage of the issue.</p>
<p>Boykoff’s analyses make it clear that numbers and event-rich environmental sociology are not inimical. Fluctuating counts of articles provide the basis for Boykoff’s analysis about the circumstances in which the coverage of the climate change issue increases. Because these counts of climate change articles rise and fall in coverage as an event approaches in time and then recedes into the past, so the analysis contains a built-in historical dimension. Unlike so many numbers in cross-national number-crunching exercises, these numbers are not decontextualized. They are historized. The fluctuating counts of articles demonstrate a fluidity to press coverage of climate change that would be easy to miss given the salience of the fossil fuel companies’ efforts to dismiss the issue.</p>
<p>Boykoff’s analyses of changes in press coverage succeed in part because he uses theoretical work on issue arenas and the media to explicate recent patterns of media attention to global warming. His book contains, for example, an enlightening discussion of Anthony Downs’ (1972) issue attention cycle and ways that it should be amended when applied to an issue like climate change. In sum, Boykoff’s work walks a fine line. It demonstrates how coverage of climate change issues can be fluid at the same time that it brings to light recurrent patterns of communication in the debates about climate change.</p>

<title>Blowout in the Gulf</title>
<p><italic>Blowout in the Gulf: The BP Oil Spill Disaster and the Future of Energy in America</italic> by the late William R. Freudenburg and Robert Gramling focuses on one historical event, the huge oil spill that occurred at a British Petroleum drilling site in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and explains its origins and its implications for Americans. To accomplish this theoretical task, Freudenburg and Gramling undertake a coupled human and natural systems analysis (CHANS). They trace out how accidents of the natural (deposits of oil in certain places) combined with human inventions and geopolitical dynamics to create complex webs of interdependencies that the massive oil spill brought to light. For example, Freudenburg and Gramling establish how the broad dispersion of oil deposits in limited pools almost guarantees that the communities that spring up above the deposits, like Pithole, Pennsylvania, will begin with a boom and end with a bust. Similarly, they recount how decisions by American elites in the years immediately after World War II to build the interstate highway system decentralized the American settlement pattern and committed us to a transportation system powered by a natural resource (oil) whose supply in North America we had begun to deplete at a rapid rate. These historical events set in motion a long-running political drama in which American politicians make repeated rhetorical commitments to achieving energy independence while our dependence on foreign sources of oil just continued to grow. This increasingly desperate search for new supplies of oil has led industry giants to the ends of the earth, like the still unexploited deposits beneath the deep waters of the ocean where BP was drilling when the blowout occurred.</p>
<p>This kind of CHANS argument features cascades of events that over time careen back and forth across the nature/society divide in a way that approximates, with allowances for a more loosely coupled system and a much larger scale, the technological interdependencies featured in Charles Perrow’ work on normal accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094306112457651">6</xref></sup> The argument unfolds as a narrative, but a socio-ecological logic ties together the events that cascade one after the other. It is not hard to imagine other CHANS analyses beginning from different kinds of global warming influenced events, like Hurricane Katrina, in the decades to come. In this sense the eventful environmental sociology produced by Freudenburg and Gramling in <italic>Blowout in the Gulf</italic> exemplifies the integration of unruly sequences of historical events with recurrent social patterns that should prove particularly useful to students of environment/society relations in the coming decades.</p>
<p>In different ways the four books under review here demonstrate in various ways the potential of a more historized environmental sociology. A more rigorously historical treatment in <italic>Shopping</italic> would have strengthened an already strong argument even further. More consistent attention to narratives of the events that transform environmental justice struggles, as in the <italic>Borders</italic> chapters, would make the transformative potential of the environmental justice movement clearer. The attention to the ebbs and flows of media attention to the climate change issue in <italic>Who Speaks</italic> underscores the capricious and uncertain course of press coverage. Finally, <italic>Blowout in the Gulf</italic> indicates in hindsight how predictable the disaster was, given BP’s compromised record and how uncertain the exact circumstances of the blowout proved to be. Taken together, these historizing tendencies should produce an environmental sociology that, while less formulaic and theoretically concise, might succeed in conveying some of the contingencies that continue to characterize our course through nature as we careen towards a more somber, environmentally compromised future. This picture of society/environment systems in flux will not reassure readers, but it will ground them in an undeniably empirical way.</p>
