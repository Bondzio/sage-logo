<p><bold>Aims:</bold> In an international prospective cohort study we assessed the relationship between glucose levels and incident cardiovascular events and death.</p>
<p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> 18,990 men and women were screened for entry into the DREAM clinical trial from 21 different countries. All had clinical and biochemical information collected at baseline, including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and were prospectively followed over a median (IQR) of 3.5 (3.0–4.0) years for incident cardiovascular (CV) events including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, and death. After OGTT screening, 8000 subjects were classified as normoglycaemic, 8427 had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 2563 subjects had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). There were incident events in 491 individuals: 282 CAD, 54 strokes, 19 CHF, and 164 died. The annualized CV or death event rate was 0.79/100 person-years in the overall cohort, 0.51/100 person-years in normoglycaemics, 0.92/100 person-years among subjects with IFG and/or IGT at baseline, and 1.27/100 person-years among those with DM (<italic>p</italic> for trend &lt;0.0001). Among all subjects, a 1 mmol/l increase in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or a 2.52 mmol/l increase in the 2-h post-OGTT glucose was associated with a hazard ratio increase in the risk of CV events or death of 1.17 (95% CI 1.13–1.22).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this large multiethnic cohort, the risk of CV events or death increased progressively among individuals who were normoglycaemic, IFG or IGT, and newly diagnosed diabetics. A 1 mmol/l increase in FPG was associated with a 17% increase in the risk of future CV events or death. Therapeutic or behavioural interventions designed to either prevent glucose levels from rising, or lower glucose among individuals with dysglycaemia should be evaluated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711409327" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is estimated that 5–10% of people worldwide suffer from diabetes, and this is expected to increase dramatically in parallel with the rising burden of overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711409327">1</xref></sup> In addition, there is evidence that elevated glucose levels below the diabetic range increase CVD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711409327">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711409327">3</xref></sup> The term dysglycaemia refers to any glucose level above the normal range including diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711409327">4</xref></sup> impaired fasting glucose (IFG) defined as a fasting plasma glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/l, and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) defined as fasting plasma glucose &lt;7.0 and a 2-h post-load glucose 7.8–11.0 mmol/l.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711409327">5</xref></sup> It is estimated that 8–10% of people worldwide have IFG and/or IGT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711409327">3</xref></sup> The presence of isolated IGT, isolated IFG, or both IFG and IGT is associated with a 2–3-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and there is a reasonable body of evidence to suggest that individuals with IFG and/or IGT suffer an increased risk of CVD and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711409327">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711409327">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently screening is recommended among high risk people to identify individuals with type 2 DM,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711409327">7</xref></sup> although there is no evidence to support widespread screening and treatment of individuals with dysglycaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711409327">6</xref></sup> It is plausible that identification and treatment of individuals with IFG and IGT is an important cardiovascular (CV) prevention strategy. Although both IFG and IGT are considered important risk markers for CVD end points, only a limited number of prospective studies have compared the relationships between these variables and risk of CVD, and data are sparse in Asian and South American populations.</p>
<p>Using the international prospective cohort study called EpiDREAM among individuals who were deemed to be at increased risk for diabetes, we sought to determine: (1) the nature of the relationship between fasting plasma glucose or the 2-h post-load glucose and incident CV events and death, and (2) if a continuous relationship exists between fasting plasma glucose or the 2-h post-load glucose with incident CV events and death.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711409327"><title>Design and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711409327"><title>Inception cohort</title>
<p>A total of 25,063 individuals at risk for DM defined by family history, ethnicity, gestational DM, or abdominal obesity, and aged between 30–85 years were screened from 191 centres from 21 North and South American, European, and Asian countries between 1 July 2001 and 2 August 2003. The screening visit consisted of questionnaire collection of information on medical history, physical activity, and diet, as well as physical measurements including weight, height, waist and hip circumference, electrocardiogram, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using a standardized protocol. Individuals with IGT or IFG were considered eligible for the DREAM trial and 5269 consented to participation. There were 13,721 individuals who were not eligible for the DREAM trial or who did not want to enter the trial who agreed to long-term follow-up, and there were 6073 who were not eligible for DREAM who did not consent to long-term follow-up. Thus, the EpiDREAM prospective cohort includes 18,990 (5269 + 13,721) middle-aged men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711409327">8</xref></sup> The study was approved by institutional ethical committees and all participants provided informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711409327"><title>Interim contact and follow-up</title>
<p>All individuals who participated in the DREAM clinical trial were followed every 3 months as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711409327">9</xref></sup> and we attempted to contact all non-trial participants approximately 12–24 months after their screening visit, and the final contact at 36–48 months after the screening visit. For the final contact visit, all trial participants were seen in the recruiting clinic for a repeat OGTT and physical measurements. All non-trial participants were invited to return to the clinic for a repeat screening but if this was not possible then telephone or mail questionnaire was accepted. The final contact visit for trial participants occurred between 4 June 2004 and 22 November 2006 and for non-trial participants occurred between 10 January 2006 and 10 October 2007. A final clinic visit was completed in 65% of non-trial participants; the remaining 35% provided information by telephone or mail. The median (IQR) time between the baseline screening visit and the final contact was 3.5 (3.0–4.0) years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711409327"><title>Outcomes definition</title>
<p>Participants were classified as having IFG, IGT, or diabetes at their initial clinic visit based on the results of a single 75-g OGTT. In the original DREAM trial analysis, IFG was defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 6.1–6.9 mmol/l (110–124 mg/dl) and normoglycaemia was defined as an FPG &lt;6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711409327">9</xref></sup> For this analysis we used the 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria to define glucose categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711409327">10</xref></sup> Irrespective of the definitions of IFG and normoglycaemia used, our results are consistent. Specifically in this analysis, normoglycaemia was defined FPG &lt;5.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl), IFG as FPG 5.6–6.9 mmol/l (100–125 mg/dl), IGT as FPG &lt;7.0 mmol/l (&lt;126 mg/dl) and 2-h post-load glucose was 7.8–11.0 mmol/l (140–199 mg/dl), and diabetes was defined if either FPG ≥7.0 mmol/l (≥126 mg/dl) or 2-h post-load glucose was ≥11.1 mmol/l (≥200 mg/dl).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711409327">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary outcomes were composed of an incident CV event alone (CV1) or an incident CV event or a death due to any cause (CV2). A non-fatal CV event was defined as new onset coronary artery disease (CAD; myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization or stroke (new and persistent neurological deficit requiring hospitalization). For all events reported among non-trial participants, by the subjects or their family members, confirmation of the events or a death certificate was sought from the subject’s recruiting centre. For the DREAM trial participants, all the events were adjudicated by a central committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711409327"><title>Statistical considerations</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (Cary, N.C.). Means and proportions are presented and statistical comparisons of continuous variables were made using ANCOVA with adjustment where indicated. Logistic regression was used to compare categorical variables with adjustment where indicated. After removing individuals who had existing coronary heart disease (<italic>n </italic>= 247), the incidence of CV events or death was calculated by counting the number of events that occurred over the duration of the study and the CV events/100 person-years was calculated by dividing the number of events by the total follow-up time in days. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to compare the relative hazard of dysglycaemia status compared to normoglycaemic status (FPG &lt;5.6 mmol/l) with minimal adjustment (age, sex) and maximal adjustment, which included all other known factors associated with CVD development (age, sex, smoking status, history of abnormal lipids requiring medication, elevated blood pressure requiring medication, abdominal obesity, and sedentary lifestyle), as well as trial status (i.e. participation in the DREAM trial vs. not), use of drug therapies at baseline which may alter CV risk factors, and ethnic group (European vs. South Asian vs. Latino vs. Other). To determine the association between FPG and CV events or death, a Cox proportional hazard model was constructed with adjustment for risk factors as described above by dividing all subjects into five categories using FPG quintiles and calculating the hazard ratio of successive quintiles compared to the lowest quintile, with a <italic>p</italic> for trend test to assess significance. The hazard ratio associated with an increase in CV events per 1 mmol/l rise in FPG increase was calculated using Cox proportional hazard modelling. Quadratic spline regression analysis using 7 mmol/l as the cut-point was used to characterize the relationship between glucose values and CV outcomes or death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711409327">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec7-1741826711409327" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 25,063 participants were screened and 18,990 (75.8%) agreed to long-term prospective follow-up. The mean age of cohort members was 51.6 (11.5) years and 60% were women. The majority of participants were recruited from North America (45.1%), India (22.2%), and South America (23.8%). Recruitment information by country is found in Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711409327">Table 1</xref>. In the study population, 8000 individuals (42.1%) were normoglycaemic, 8427 (44.4%) had either IFG, IGT, or both IFG and IGT, and 2563 (13.5%) were diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes by OGTT. The characteristics of the cohort members by glucose category are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711409327">Table 1</xref>. Briefly, normoglycaemic individuals were younger, more likely to be women, had a lower body mass index and less abdominal obesity, less likely to have abnormal lipids or hypertension, less sedentary, and less likely to use pharmacological agents including lipid- or blood pressure-lowering agents, and aspirin compared to individuals with dysglycaemia or newly diagnosed diabetes. As expected, individuals with normoglycaemia were less likely to have a history of established CVD compared to participants with evidence of glucose impairment. The median glucose among those classified as normoglycaemic was 4.9 mmol/l, compared to 5.8 mmol/l among those with IFG and or IGT, and 7.1 mmol/l among those with newly diagnosed diabetes. Normoglycaemic individuals were less likely to have a history of CVD including myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, or stroke compared to individuals with IFG, IGT, or newly diagnosed diabetes (2.0% vs. 2.8% vs. 3.9%, <italic>p</italic> trend &lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711409327">Table 1</xref>).

<p>To evaluate the association of fasting and 2-h post-load glucose levels as a continuous variable with the development of new CV events or death, we created five categories of FPG using quintiles ranging from FPG ≤4.8 mmol/l for the lowest quintile to FPG &amp;#62;6.3 mmol/l for the highest quintile, and examined the hazard of CV events in minimally (age and sex) and maximally adjusted (multiple covariates) models (Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711409327">Table 3</xref>a). The hazard of incident CV events (adjusted for age and sex) comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of FPG was 3.30 (95% CI 2.05–5.31) and for incident CV events or death was 2.36 (95% CI 1.66–3.36). Using 2-h post-load glucose levels, the associations were not as strong: the hazard of incident CV events adjusted for age and sex comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of 2-h post-load glucose was 1.55 (95% CI 1.08–2.22) and for incident CV events or total death was 1.49 (95% CI 1.11–2.00) (Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711409327">Table 3</xref>b). With maximal adjustment for predefined covariates, the hazard ratio for FPG was slightly attenuated but remained significant and the 2-h post-load glucose remained strongly associated and significant (Supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711409327">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to examining glucose quintile groups, we determined the risk of incident CV events or death for a 1 mmol/l increase in baseline FPG among all participants. We found that a 1 mmol/l increase in FPG was associated with 1.16-fold (95% CI 1.11–1.22) increase in the risk of CV events and a 1.17-fold (95% CI 1.13–1.22) increase in the risk of CV events or death. The baseline 2-h post-load glucose was also progressively related to this outcome. An increase of 2.36 mmol/l in 2-h post-load glucose was associated with a 16% increase in incident CV events and an increase of 2.52 mmol/l was associated with a 17% increase in incident CV events or death. These associations were consistent between men and women, in people less than 50 years compared to over 50 years, in DREAM trial participants vs. non-trial participants, and across ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711409327">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>To further understand this relationship we examined this association of FPG and CV outcomes or death using spline regression analysis (quadratic model with FPG of 7 mmol/l as the cut-point), and observed a near linear association between fasting glucose values and CV outcomes or death in the FPG range of 4–7 mmol/l, and FPG above 7 mmol/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741826711409327">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>In this large international prospective cohort study we observed that elevated glucose levels were associated with an increased risk of CV events and death, even among individuals without diabetes. Elevated glucose was not only a risk factor for the future development of diabetes, but it increased the risk of CV events and death by 17% for a 1 mmol/l increase in FPG. These associations were consistent between men and women, young and old, and across most ethnic groups. In addition, our data showed that a 1 mmol/l increase in FPG provides similar information with respect to CV risk as a 2.36 mmol/l increase in 2-h post-challenge glucose.

<p>The EpiDREAM cohort is a unique international cohort which was assembled when screening individuals for entry into the DREAM clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711409327">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711409327">16</xref></sup> Individuals who were deemed to be at risk of suffering from diabetes including those with abdominal obesity, a family history of type 2 diabetes or people from ‘high-risk’ ethnic groups including South Asians and indigenous peoples were screened in clinics and communities from 21 countries. Therefore, while the EpiDREAM cohort is not representative of the general population, substantial numbers of individuals from across the spectrum of normoglycaemia and dysglycaemia which includes individuals with IFG, IGT and newly diagnosed diabetes were included. Thus, considering the make up of the EpiDREAM cohort, we have made a number of important observations. First, we observed that individuals with dysglycaemia were more likely to have suffered prior cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction and stroke compared to normoglycaemic individuals, which supports previous observational data showing a greater CV risk with increased plasma glucose concentrations and A1C levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711409327">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711409327">18</xref></sup> Second, the risk of developing diabetes among individuals with IFG and/or IGT over an average of 3 years was approximately 6-fold higher than among individuals with normoglycaemia. Similar results were observed by others previously but were mostly limited to populations of European origin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711409327">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711409327">21</xref></sup> Mexican Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711409327">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711409327">23</xref></sup> Japanese Americans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711409327">24</xref></sup> and Chinese living in East Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711409327">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711409327">26</xref></sup> Third, we observed that the risk of CV events and death increased by 32% among individuals with dysglycaemia compared to those with normoglycaemia. To date, few prospective studies have examined the relationship between various categories of dysglycaemia and risk of CVD, and data are sparse in Asian and Latin American populations.</p>
<p>Fourth, our findings lend support to the evidence that glucose is a continuous risk factor for CVD. We demonstrate that a 1 mmol/l increase in fasting glucose is associated with a greater risk of CV events than is a 1 mmol/l increase in 2-h post-load glucose. To our knowledge previous studies have not described the increment in FPG corresponding to an equivalent risk of CV as predicted by 2-h post-load glucose. In our study, a 1 mmol/l increase in fasting glucose and a 2.52 mmol/l increase in 2-h post-load glucose are associated with a 17% increase in CV events or death. While most previous studies focused on European populations and showed similar CV risk associated with both IFG and IGT,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711409327">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711409327">29</xref></sup> a few studies of European,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711409327">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711409327">31</xref></sup> Japanese,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711409327">32</xref></sup> and Malaysian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711409327">33</xref></sup> populations found that a 2-h post-load glucose may be a better predictor of CV risk than FPG. Differences in study design, the study population, and the timing of glucose measurements may account for between study differences. In our study, fasting and 2-h post-load glucose were measured in all individuals at baseline, all of whom were followed prospectively to determine incident CV events or death. Our results show that both the FPG and the 2-h post-load glucose are useful for risk prediction, although the use of the fasting glucose may be more efficient in the clinical setting given the large number of clinicians who screen patients using fasting glucose alone. Our results are also congruent with the recent observations of the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration which showed using data from more than 102 prospective studies from high income countries that a fasting glucose above 5.6 mmol/l but lower than 7.0 mmol/l (i.e. non-diabetic range) is significantly associated with coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711409327">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711409327"><title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>EpiDREAM is a large, multiethnic prospective cohort study. All participants had detailed examination at baseline and prospective follow-up. Individuals who were deemed to be at increased risk for type 2 diabetes were screened using an OGTT to determine their eligibility for the DREAM clinical trial. Thus, EpiDREAM combines subjects who were followed in the DREAM clinical trial as well as a group of ‘non-trial’ participants. The use of trial medication and frequency of follow-up visits differed between the trial and non-trial subjects and this may have led to more new diabetes and cardiovascular events being captured among the trial participants compared to the non-trial participants. To minimize the impact of participation in the trial on our findings, we adjusted our cohort analysis for ‘trial status’. In addition, we relied on ‘self-reported’ diabetes and CV events to determine the incidence of new diabetes and CV events among the non-trial participants; however, over 85% of the diabetes events and close to 80% of the CV events were confirmed by a physician at the local recruiting centre. Self-reported diabetes and CV events have been used in other large cohort studies such as Women’s Health Study and Nurses Health Study and appear to be robust.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711409327">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741826711409327">35</xref></sup></p>

A 1 mmol/l increase in FPG was associated with a 17% increase in the risk of future CV events or death. Therapeutic or behavioural interventions designed to either prevent glucose levels from rising, or to lower glucose among individuals with dysglycaemia, should be evaluated.</p>
