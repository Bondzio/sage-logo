<p>Studies of globalization seemed to reach their nadir in the mid to late 2000s when, as Justin Rosenberg observed, the literature effectively stalled, describing the “lived experience of the late 1990s.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872113479228">4</xref></sup> Nevertheless, despite numerous predictions of its decline, globalization theory continues to impact many different disciplines. In the last two years there has been a wealth of edited collections on the expansion of international finance and trade organizations and their impact on the promotion of human rights. <italic>Globalization and Human Rights: Challenges and Answers from a European Perspective</italic> is an edited volume of nine different chapters broadly focusing on the process of globalization and contemporary human rights issues, which emerged from a series of European seminars and conferences on global justice, and a three-year research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education.</p>
<p>It should be made clear from the outset that the volume as a whole struggles for conceptual and definitional clarity. The introduction states that the book intends to analyze “current threats to human rights” and examine the “predomination of finances” which “implies risks for human rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872113479228">5</xref></sup> But absent a broader theory of globalization in the introduction, many of the chapters in this volume appear disjointed and disconnected. Within individual chapters there is also a lack of demonstrable causation between the analysis of global financial institutions and threats to human rights. For example Chapter Two, by Francesco Biondo entitled “Basic Structures of Tax Havens,” one of the volume’s highlights – is an excellent analysis of Rawlsian basic structure theory and a novel application of it to the arguments surrounding offshore tax havens. Yet the chapter fails to provide any real causal analysis of the propensity of tax havens to actually create human rights abuses. It is also not clear, given the explicit reference to European answers in the volume’s subtitle, what the European models actually are and what relevance they have to the rest of the book’s content. While the third section of the book is devoted to chapters on European issues these are focused either on an analysis of the theoretical foundations of European institutions or on overviews of theoretical literature and do not provide a normative description of models for protecting human rights and an explanation of what they offer for tackling wider human rights issues.</p>
<p>Edited volumes are often the platform for divergent aspects of scholarship, however this particular volume has little cohesion to it and criticism of this sort is justified given that the prospectus laid out in the introduction promises a wide synthesis of a number of different issues. The volume’s cohesion is also not helped by a massive divergence in style between the different chapters and a number of errors in copyediting which make reading the book as a continual monograph extremely difficult and unrewarding. These overall criticisms aside there are some excellent pieces of scholarship in the volume that deserve further examination.</p>
<p>The first section, entitled soft threats, contains three chapters which in turn examine a humanist theory of globalization, a theory of tax havens and an analysis of the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As noted above, the standout contribution is Biondo’s “Basic Structures of Tax Havens” and an interesting piece of further scholarship would be to explore the relationship between tax havens and the worsening provision of economic and social rights. Also of interest is Jorge Llorens’s “Human Rights and the Inclusive Society” that attempts to use a social perspective of human rights to analyze the 2006 Convention and proves to be a wonderfully concise overview of the Convention’s philosophy and principles. Whilst it fails to connect with the broader analysis of globalized problems in the rest of the volume, it does provide a fresh insight into the Convention’s formation. The theme of depriving economic and social rights again reappears in Llorens’s chapter adding some continuity to the first part of the book and providing an implicit definition of what constitutes a ‘‘soft threat’’ to human rights.</p>
<p>In the second section entitled ‘‘hard threats’’ quite detailed studies on Afghanistan, written by Encarnación Fernández Ruiz-Gálvez, and Somalia, written by Ana-Paz Garibo-Peyró, are presented. Both of these chapters broadly analyze the structural failures of both Somalia and Afghanistan in the context of the mass human rights abuses taking place within these states. In doing so both authors assiduously avoid narratives of state failure, and instead examine how different international actors may be contributing to the structural factors which generate systemic human rights abuses. The problem with both chapters is that whilst providing excellent historical narratives they lack any sort of explanation as to how these structural factors actually create human rights abuses, beyond descriptive accounts of the weaknesses of government machinery in both states. The next chapter, by Isabel Trujillo, aims to discuss the conceptual challenges posed by the existence of the different fields of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL). This chapter is beset by conceptual uncertainties, since the author relies on concepts of indivisibility and universality to assist her comparative critique, but then cannot agree on what these concepts mean. Her critique of the difference between IHRL and IHL appears dependent upon a misreading of the principles of derogation under Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which at one point is confusingly referred to as the ‘‘Pact on Civil and Political Rights.’’</p>
<p>The final section of the book focuses on European Perspectives, although it is never clear what exactly European perspectives are and some often-cited concepts, such as the European Social Model, are never defined and almost assumed to be part of the reader’s vernacular. Both Chapters Seven and Eight fall into the habit of listing a lot of individual theorists, such as Habermas and Rawls, but fail to use either’s work to advance a particularly distinct thesis. In Chapter Eight, written by Ernesto Gil, a potentially interesting idea – the concept of a European social ideal and its economic consequences – is suffocated by a badly written history of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Economic Community and by the end of the chapter the author’s overall thesis is still unclear. Chapter Nine, by Pedro Talavera, entitled “Peace as a Priority” attempts to give some sort of idea as to how the European approach could be used to construct a post- Hobbesian peace between states, echoing Kantian ideas of perpetual peace. This chapter is excellently written and is the closest the volume overall comes to providing a European approach to the problems and threats posed by globalization towards the protection of human rights.</p>
<p>The book in general leaves a lot to be desired as a standalone work but the highlights of the volume described above are worth reading. It would be interesting to see whether some of the ideas discussed in the final section of the book, such as public rationality or the European social model, could be either detrimental or beneficial responses to the human rights problems generated by globalization. Some interesting broader questions emerge throughout the course of the book as to the consequences of globalization for economic and social rights and the way that international organizations can promote and construct deeper values, which provide a valuable foundation for a wider consideration of the impact of globalization upon the protection of human rights.</p>
