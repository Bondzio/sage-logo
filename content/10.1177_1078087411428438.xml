<p><italic>Moving to Opportunity</italic> is about much more than the story of the one social experiment in its title. Authors Xavier de Souza Briggs, Susan J. Popkin, and John Goering tell many stories and offer a number of important lessons about policy making, implementation, and the realities of daily life for very low-income families. Their extensive experience working in housing and antipoverty policy making, implementation, and evaluation, and their direct involvement with the Moving to Opportunity experiment since it was begun in 1994, positioned them well to write a good book on it. That experience and the high quality of their previous scholarly works—most notably Briggs’ edited book, <italic>The Geography of Opportunity: Race and Housing Choice in Metropolitan America</italic> (Brookings, 2005), to which all three contributed chapters—led me to have high expectations for this book. When I finished reading it, those expectations were, in fact, exceeded. <italic>Moving to Opportunity</italic> is a “must read” for anyone interested in understanding the politics of policy making and implementation, the difference between neighborhoods and communities, the harsh realities of living conditions for poor people in and out of inner-city ghettoes, and the difficult trade-offs very-low-income parents must make when faced with choices about where to locate.</p>
<p>Supported by funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and philanthropic foundations, the authors directed a large research team to evaluate how participants in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment’s “treatment” group, “comparison” group, and “control” group were faring in 2004 and 2005, about 10 years after the experiment began. The treatment group had initially received housing vouchers along with housing relocation counseling and assistance searching for housing to move out of public housing projects in high-poverty, crime-ridden, racially segregated neighborhoods into private housing in low-poverty neighborhoods. The comparison group had received housing vouchers but no additional assistance to move out of public housing projects in high-poverty inner-city neighborhoods. The control group’s members continued to receive the same housing assistance they had previously had, that is, apartments in public housing projects in high-poverty neighborhoods. Almost all the families were headed by single women and more than 90% of them were black or Hispanic. The team conducted the research in Boston, Los Angeles, and New York, three of the five cities selected for the experiment, using a mixed-methods approach that included survey research from an earlier interim impact study; in-depth interviews with a random sample of 120 families, each of which included a parent, an adolescent, and in some cases, a young-adult child; ethnographic field research with a sample of 39 families; and statistical analysis and mapping of census and other data, for example, on patterns of education and crime (pp. 21-22).</p>
<p>Throughout the book, the authors make excellent use of their mixed-methods data. At the outset of the first chapter, titled “Places and Lives,” they engage the reader with their ethnographic field research, introducing several families who volunteered for the MTO experiment and were selected randomly to participate in it. These families moved out of public housing projects in inner-city neighborhoods and used housing vouchers to relocate to private housing in low-poverty neighborhoods in the city or in one of its suburbs. The poignant stories they tell about their experiences after their initial move make clear that there were important variations in the impacts of the moves and in how permanent or temporary their new locations became over time. The families’ personal situations and conditions in the places they moved from and to had significant effects on the outcomes of the experiment for them. In the remainder of that chapter and in the next three chapters, the authors use data gathered by the other methods to tell their own stories about the questions their research sought to answer, the background factors and actors that led up to the launch of the experiment, and some of the key findings and lessons they learned. In the next four chapters, they bring back the voices of the families who participated in the experiment, whose personal stories, combined with other empirical data, make those chapters especially powerful.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating and instructive stories the authors tell is about Alex Polikoff, a skillful “policy entrepreneur” whose experience, reputation, personal connections to top HUD staff members, and “relentlessness” played a major role in gaining the support that convinced Congress to authorize the MTO experiment (pp. 49-51). Polikoff was the attorney who had successfully argued the landmark <italic>Gautreaux</italic> class action suit against the Chicago Public Housing Authority (CPHA) that resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1976 upholding a lower court’s ruling ordering the CPHA to end its practice of segregating its projects by race and to remedy it by providing “desegregative” housing opportunities for residents.</p>
<p>Briggs et al. discuss how the impressive results of the Gautreaux Program’s “assisted housing mobility” remedy, which were reported in an evaluation by sociologist James Rosenbaum, led MTO’s advocates and planners to expect similar outcomes from the MTO experiment. However, in contrast to Rosenbaum’s findings, Briggs, Popkin, and Goering did <italic>not</italic> find improvements in either the employment or the education outcomes for most of the participants in the MTO treatment group. They <italic>did</italic> find that most of the families who moved reported feeling safer and more secure in their new neighborhoods (although the girls reported bigger increases in feeling safe than the boys). The authors call the increased feeling of security a “simply extraordinary” positive outcome (p. 223). They drive this point home with a quote from a woman who participated in the Los Angeles MTO experiment. Anique (not her real name) described the contrast between life in the inner-city housing project she moved from and life in the San Bernadino suburban neighborhood she moved to with these words:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So far, since I’ve been here, I’ve never heard no gunshots, no none of that. That was a big thing that I . . . I didn’t realize it, but once you’ve grown up in a neighbor-hood and that’s something you’ve heard on a daily basis, you don’t know that’s not how it’s supposed to be. (p. 91)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their “Lessons” chapter, the authors assert that “More than a move to opportunity . . . this experiment proved [to be] a move to security” (p. 224).</p>
<p><italic>Why</italic> the employment situations and educational achievements of the MTO participants did <italic>not</italic> improve is one of the biggest puzzles the authors explore. Another very significant and puzzling finding they present is that “many families who had successfully relocated to low-poverty neighborhoods were living back in high poverty ones” by the time the interim evaluation was conducted four to seven years after the program began (p. 136). This “move back” pattern helps explain why employment and education outcomes for many people in the MTO experimental group did not improve. The authors point out that “HUD planners did not design mechanisms to ensure that families could stay out of high poverty areas once they got out of them” (p. 146). They did not, for example, provide counseling after the move to help the families cope with problems they encountered, such as landlords increasing their rent or opting out of the program, or debilitating illnesses, or lack of child care or transportation to get to jobs or to go back to the inner city to visit with family and friends who continued to live there.</p>
<p>One of the major lessons the authors discuss is how the “quiet crisis of affordable rental housing,” that is, the diminishing supply and high concentration in inner-city neighborhoods of housing that’s affordable to low-income households, contributes to the “move back” and multiple moves pattern. They argue convincingly that the supply of affordable rental housing needs to be increased “in urban areas where economic growth is concentrated” but that expanding housing opportunities in higher income neighborhoods for inner city very-low-income families “should not substitute for investing in the revitalization of distressed neighborhoods” (p. 225). (HUD’s recently launched Choice Neighborhoods Program is implicitly advocated by the authors.)</p>
<p>Another major lesson that Briggs et al. elaborate on is the critical difference between “community” and “neighborhood.” The “community” for most of the MTO movers remained located in the high-poverty area they initially moved from. Their social ties were to family members and friends who continued to live there; they did not develop personal relationships with neighbors in their new locations. Thus, the gains in “social capital” that MTO’s planners assumed would come from the move to low-poverty neighborhoods, where they would have middle-class residents as role models and networking opportunities for jobs, did not occur. The authors explain that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>for relocation to matter, one must a) be willing and able to make new contacts, b) activate them in useful ways, tapping c) usefully positioned individuals who are d) willing to provide aid. (p. 199)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing that changing social relations is “much trickier” than creating more affordable rental housing opportunities in good locations, Briggs et al. suggest a few promising strategies. “The first is offering healthy, developmental alternatives to socializing with risky relatives,” for example, after-school, weekend, and summer programs for children and adolescents (p. 229). Another is providing “relationship management and support.” And a third is making “disadvantaged families less <italic>reliant</italic> on risky kin relationships for aid” by providing “institutional substitutes for some of the specific functions poor people consistently tap their strong ties to handle” (p. 230).</p>
<p>These and other lessons the authors propose are profoundly important. There are, however, some limits to their methods and findings. In particular, the fact that their research was done in just three cities makes generalizing the findings to other locations questionable. Briggs, Popkin, and Goering are sensitive to this and to other limitations, including not being able to find a substantial number of the initial participants in the experiment when the interim evaluation was done and/or when their later research was conducted. They mention these limitations with admirable candor in the book’s first chapter and present a detailed account in the Appendix. The “story” they tell about the decisions they made when designing their methodology is instructive. The trade-offs they had to make are inevitable when doing social science research, even—or especially—when sophisticated mixed methods of gathering and analyzing longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data are employed.</p>
<p>One can hope that the lessons the authors discuss in this book will inform policies aimed at fighting ghetto poverty in the future. The odds of this happening are probably better than they might be at other times because of the current position and location of Xavier de Souza Briggs as Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the White House. He presumably has the ear, and may also have the support, of the head of that Household (Barack Obama), whose career began as a community organizer.</p>
