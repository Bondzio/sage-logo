<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Reconstructions of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament in an open or arthroscopically assisted procedure are often combined with a resection of the distal clavicle to prevent or treat osteoarthritic degenerations of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. However, increased horizontal translation leading to symptomatic instability may be associated with resection of the distal clavicle.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: Horizontal translation increases in direct correlation to subsequent resection of the distal clavicle.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Twelve fresh-frozen specimens (mean age, 82.0 ± 5 years) were examined using a servohydraulic testing system. A 70-N force was applied in the anterior, posterior, and superior directions, and the translations were quantified for all directions. After native testing, sequential resection of the distal clavicle at 5 and 10 mm was performed after incision of the inferior capsule, and anterior-posterior loads were retested. Finally, the AC ligaments were incised, and repeated testing was performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Native mean (± standard deviation) anterior translation was 7.90 ± 2.62 mm. After section of the inferior AC capsule, anterior translation was 8.05 ± 2.62 mm (<italic>P</italic> = 1.0). After clavicle resection of 5 mm, anterior translation was 10.75 ± 2.38 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .122), and after resection of 10 mm, anterior translation was significantly increased to 11.6 ± 2.37 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .012). Complete AC capsule sectioning led to significantly greater amounts of anterior translation (12.12 ± 3.0 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .003). Posterior translation for the native specimen was 8.88 ± 2.63 mm. Sectioning of the inferior AC capsule resulted in 9.21 ± 2.71-mm translation (<italic>P</italic> = 1.0). After clavicle resection of 5 mm, posterior translation was 10.42 ± 2.42 mm (<italic>P</italic> = 1.0), and after 10-mm resection, it was 11.31 ± 2.86 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .39). Sectioning of the complete AC capsule led to significantly greater amounts of posterior translation (12.31 ± 3.12 mm; <italic>P</italic> = .043).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Ten millimeters of resection increased anterior translation of the distal clavicle with both the superior and posterior AC capsules as well as the CC ligaments intact. Both anterior and posterior translations increased after 10-mm resection and complete AC capsule sectioning.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance</bold>: These results suggest that resection of the distal clavicle leads to increased horizontal translation despite an intact superior and posterior AC capsule. Only sparing resection of the distal clavicle should be performed and only if strictly indicated. Violation of the AC capsule further increases horizontal translation and should therefore be avoided, or if indicated in AC joint dislocations, a reconstruction of the AC capsule should be considered.</p>

<body>
<p>There are several operative approaches described for high-grade acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations. Many of these approaches incorporate isolated reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament in an open or arthroscopically assisted procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511428880">14</xref></sup> Traditionally, these procedures involve resection of the distal clavicle to prevent possible future osteoarthritic degenerations of the AC joint.</p>
<p>The importance of the AC ligaments (capsule) for horizontal stability of the AC joint has been demonstrated in numerous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428880">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428880">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428880">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428880">12</xref></sup> Considering the importance of these ligaments, simultaneous resection of the distal clavicle may increase horizontal translation in surgically reconstructed AC joints and contribute to increased horizontal translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511428880">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> Previous investigators have reported a resection of 10 mm of the distal clavicle only marginally increased posterior in situ graft forces compared to intact AC ligaments; however, this study did not evaluate horizontal translation of the clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428880">13</xref></sup> Conversely, one other group of investigators has demonstrated larger increases in posterior translation with resection of the distal clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511428880">4</xref></sup> Common to both studies was that only a 10-mm resection was evaluated.</p>
<p>While preservation of the distal clavicle may be intended, the AC joint may have significant degeneration at the time of surgery. In these situations, simultaneous resection of the distal clavicle may be required to alleviate and prevent pain at the AC joint. Edwards et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428880">9</xref></sup> examined clavicle resection in cadaveric specimens and found resection of 5 mm in a stable AC joint to be sufficient to prevent further contact of the clavicle and acromion. Resection of less than 5 mm was deemed to be insufficient because of the irregular bony surface of the distal clavicle.</p>
<p>To precisely estimate the amount of increased horizontal translation resulting from resection of the lateral clavicle, reliable biomechanical data comparing differing amounts of distal clavicle resection are needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of clinically relevant, subsequent (5 and 10 mm) resections of the distal clavicle on horizontal translation of the AC joint in a cadaveric model and compare it to the translation observed in the intact joint. The authors hypothesized that there will be increased horizontal AC joint translation with 5 and 10 mm of distal clavicle resection.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511428880" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Specimens were harvested from 12 fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities (mean age, 82.0 ± 5 years). All donors had died from causes unrelated to the musculoskeletal system. Bone density measurements were obtained in all specimens (DPI XQ DEXA scan, Lunar, Madison, Wisconsin) before testing to ensure physiological bone density of the specimen.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511428880">
<title>Specimen Preparation</title>
<p>Before the day of testing, each shoulder specimen was thawed overnight at room temperature. Each shoulder was disarticulated at the glenohumeral joint, and the clavicle and scapula were dissected free of all soft tissue except the AC joint capsule, the CC ligaments, and the coracoacromial ligament.</p>
<p>The scapula was potted with plaster of Paris in a custom block from the inferior angle to the edge of the glenoid. The clavicle was also potted using bone cement in a custom block mold to 5 mm medial to the insertion of the conoid ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> Anterior and posterior testing were performed by fixing the clavicle to the actuator in a manner such that the anterior direction was in line with actuation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> The clavicle was first fixed in a nonrigid fashion to allow for calibration of the load cell. The load was zeroed, and the clavicle was rigidly attached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> The scapula was allowed to float on a fixture base while the displacement of the actuator was adjusted to a zero load position, thus indicating anatomic origin of the clavicle relative to the scapula. A custom guide was used to drill a 3/8 inch hole in the potting of the scapula to mate with a permanently mounted bolt on the fixture base into the prescribed anatomic position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> Additionally, the entire experiment was performed while the clavicle-scapula complex was “set” in the servohydraulic testing system (MTS Systems Corp, Eden Prairie, Minnesota) actuator, and the specimen was not removed for the further steps of the experiment to ensure reliability and reproducibility of the zero position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511428880">
<title>Biomechanical Testing</title>
<p>The method of biomechanical evaluation was performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> The specimens were then tested using an MTS servohydraulic testing system. Each specimen was preconditioned at the AC joint with 10 N in the anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior directions for 10 cycles to eliminate creep phenomenon. Based on previous studies, a 70-N force was then applied in either the anterior, posterior, and superior directions, and the translations were quantified in each direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511428880">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428880">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref></sup> A 70-N load was chosen for this study, as it had proven its utility in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428880">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428880">16</xref></sup> and Klimkiewicz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428880">12</xref></sup> demonstrated a lack of plastic deformation in control specimens exposed to a load of this magnitude under similar conditions. This amount of force is also seen to represent physiological loads produced during activities of daily living and rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511428880">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511428880">16</xref></sup> To prevent any fatigue effects on the stabilizing structures within the subsequent stages of testing, cyclic loading was not performed after the preconditioning cycles. Anterior and posterior displacements were defined as the primary outcome parameter. Evaluating both directions (anterior and posterior) enabled an estimate of the entire range of horizontal displacement of the distal clavicle.</p>
<p>After native specimen testing was completed, sequential resection of the distal clavicle at 5 and 10 mm was performed with an oscillating saw after incising the inferior capsule, and the anterior-posterior loads were retested. A 5-mm resection was chosen, as this is the minimal amount of bone that requires removal for a complete resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428880">9</xref></sup> The clavicle-scapula complex was not removed or remounted throughout the entire process of subsequently resecting the capsule and distal clavicle. This allowed for reliable reproduction of the original “zero” position for subsequent testing without any changes in rotation. The inferior aspect of the AC joint could be accessed in all specimens because the clavicle-scapula complex was positioned in line with the actuator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511428880">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, great care was taken to carefully resect only the inferior capsule and not to damage the anterior, posterior, or superior capsules for its contribution to stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511428880">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511428880">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428880">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428880">12</xref></sup> Digital calipers with an accuracy of 0.01 mm (Mitutoyo USA, Aurora, Illinois) were used, and photographs were taken of each specimen to confirm an appropriate resection and that no additional damage occurred to the rest of the capsule. Finally, the AC ligaments were incised, and repeat testing was performed as above. Superior translation was only measured in the intact specimens as well as at the end after the AC ligaments were incised and 10 mm of bone was resected. This was done because repositioning of the cadaveric specimen may have altered the consecutive measurements. Saline was constantly applied during testing to maintain tissue pliability. For this final superior testing, the complex had to be remounted.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Tests of significance for anterior and posterior translations in the specimens were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA), and if significant differences were found, the Bonferroni post hoc analysis was added to determine which pair-wise comparisons were significant. Comparison of the superior translation only involved 2 groups (intact AC vs complete resection); therefore, the Student <italic>t</italic> test was performed. An α level of .05 was set for all tests for determination of significance. A priori power analysis using a 3-mm difference to detect and a standard deviation of 2.5 mm established a sample size of 7 specimens per group with α = .05 and β = .8.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of progressive amounts of resection of the distal clavicle on horizontal translation of the clavicle. The results are partially in agreement with our hypothesis, as anterior translation increased significantly with 10 mm of distal clavicle resection, and both anterior and posterior translations increased after 10-mm resection and complete AC capsule sectioning.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no study has evaluated horizontal translation after subsequent resection of the distal clavicle with intact posterior and superior AC joint capsules. The Current literature has demonstrated significant increases in posterior translation and graft forces with 10 mm of distal clavicle resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428880">13</xref></sup> Our results suggest that should a distal clavicle excision be indicated (eg, degenerative joint), resection should not exceed 5 mm of the distal clavicle, and both the superior and posterior AC capsules should be preserved in an effort to minimize the amount of horizontal translation. This amount has been shown by Edwards et al to be sufficient to avoid bony abutment of the acromion and distal clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428880">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428880">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although no consensus exists regarding the amount of increased horizontal instability that may be clinically significant, the aim of surgical procedures in AC joint repair should focus on increasing the stability of the clavicle-scapular complex. The authors believe that even small amounts of persisting increased translation may have negative effects. While 5 mm of resection did not meet the threshold for statistical significance, the data suggest that increasing amounts of displacement may occur when the bony structure of the distal clavicle is surgically manipulated.</p>
<p>We utilized a biomechanical model that involved testing of 5- and 10-mm amounts of distal clavicle resection with intact superior and posterior portions of the AC joint capsule. This model aids in isolating the contribution of the distal clavicle bone to AC joint stability. The capsule’s contribution to stability is reflected in current surgical techniques for AC joint resection, which advocate for preservation of the posterior and superior AC capsules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428880">12</xref></sup> After complete resection of the capsule with 10 mm of bony resection, posterior translation of the clavicle significantly increased. Considering our model left the superior and posterior AC capsules intact until the last stage of testing, even higher translations than those observed can be expected when the capsule is disrupted, as is the case in high-grade AC separations. Surgeons should be mindful of the potential for excessive translation when combining an AC reconstruction with a distal clavicle excision. On the other hand, results of this study emphasize the previously demonstrated importance of the superior and posterior AC ligaments in distal clavicle resection. If a resection is performed using an open surgical approach, care should be taken to adequately repair these structures without compromising their function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428880">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511428880">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511428880">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several weaknesses of this study. Intact CC ligaments were used as a model for an anatomically optimized reconstruction of the CC ligaments (best-case scenario). However, it is the authors’ opinion that this setup allowed comparison of sequential distal clavicle resection, thereby removing variables that would affect reproducibility such as tunnel width, tunnel placement, graft strength, and so on. It should be noted that nonanatomic techniques for CC reconstruction (single graft, etc) would result in even more horizontal translation, which should be subject to future biomechanical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511428880">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511428880">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511428880">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511428880">19</xref></sup> The study was powered based on the assumption that an increase of 3 mm would be of clinical significance; however, no overall agreement exists regarding the minimal amount of displacement needed to become clinically symptomatic. With regard to the previously reported physiological translation of a native AC joint of approximately 5 to 9 mm, 3 mm seemed appropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511428880">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511428880">7</xref></sup> In addition, 12 cadaveric specimens were tested, which was more than the a priori calculated minimum of 7 specimens needed to detect a 3-mm difference. Consequently, results of the 5-mm resection may still not have reached statistical significance because of the overall number of tested specimens, as the difference in anterior and posterior translations between the intact specimens and the 5-mm resected state was less than 3 mm.</p>
<p>The authors believe that an amount of 5 mm has to be resected from the distal clavicle to ensure overall bony resection because of the complex 3-dimensional structure of the distal end of the clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511428880">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511428880">9</xref></sup> Thus, the authors are aware of the fact that surgeons may perform a resection of the distal clavicle until a gap of 5 mm has been produced within the joint without finally having resected 5 mm of bone. Other surgeons may perform a simultaneous resection of the acromion and the distal clavicle. To ensure a standardized experimental setup, the examined amounts of resection (5 and 10 mm) have been chosen to be representative and reproducible. The in vitro nature of biomechanical evaluation can be a limiting factor in the application of the findings to the in vivo conditions of the shoulder complex. This is particularly true in the AC joint with its specific 3-dimensional forces and complex contributions to multiple shoulder motions. Accurate replication of these forces in a cadaveric study might be difficult. However, the intention of this study was to specifically evaluate horizontal translation. The mean age of the cadaveric specimens was &gt;80 years. This has to be regarded in the interpretation of the results; however, bone mineral density of each cadaveric specimen was measured to ensure that the specimens’ bone density was within physiological ranges. Additionally, biomechanical testing with cadaveric specimens does not allow for the effects of biological healing to be measured, and therefore, we are only able to draw conclusions for the primary stability of the joint at a time point immediately following surgical reconstruction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ten millimeters of resection increased anterior translation of the distal clavicle with the superior and posterior AC capsules as well as with the CC ligaments intact. Both anterior and posterior translations increased after 10-mm resection and complete AC capsule sectioning. This may compromise the capability of CC ligament reconstructions to withstand clinical stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511428880">13</xref></sup> Because a correlation of resected bone and increased translation exists, only small amounts of bone (5 mm) should be resected. Violation of the AC capsule further increases the horizontal translation and should therefore be avoided, or if needed, a reconstruction of the AC capsule should be considered.</p>
