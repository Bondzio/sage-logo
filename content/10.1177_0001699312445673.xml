<p>The women’s movement is not what it used to be. In a country like Norway, a movement of several thousand members during the 1970s has been reduced to half a dozen organizations with a few hundred members. Add to this the mantra that ideologies – feminism and other isms – are dead, and polls showing that many people think gender equality has been achieved or gone too far. What then is left of feminism? A lot, if we are to believe British sociology professor Sylvia Walby in her recent book <italic>The Future of Feminism.</italic> Having authored a range of influential books on related topics since the 1980s, Walby delivers an impressive synthesis of her engagement with sociological research, social theory, gender studies and feminism in the past thirty years, and a thought-provoking statement of what feminism is today and where it will go – and should go – in the future.   </p>
<p>In her introductory chapter,Walby distinguishes between self-definitions of feminism (feminist are those who ‘say they are feminist’) and definitions that connect feminism to particular goals, such as ‘reducing gender inequality’ or ‘advancing the interests of women’. Further distinctions are made between feminist civil society projects, feminist governmental programmes, and gendered social formations or gender regimes that may be domestic or public, depending on the extent of women’s participation in public life, or neo-liberal or social-democratic, depending on the extent of market regulation.</p>
<p>In chapter 2,Walby argues that feminism is ‘alive and vibrant’, despite some backlash tendencies of biological determinism and religious fundamentalism, and tendencies within feminism itself to replace equality standards and persistent critique of gender hierarchy with relativist talk of ‘diversity’ and post-feminist dismissals of standard emancipatory approaches. No doubt feminism has become less visible, Walby admits – it has entered institutions of power and joined coalitions with broader agendas. However, visibility, of course, is not a particularly good indicator of the actual level of activity and influence. Chapter 3 identifies the different activities of contemporary feminism. Chapter 4 goes on to examine feminism’s new organizational forms, in particular its engagement with the state, the EU and the UN, new civil society coalitions, and new alliances with and reliance on expertise, and offers plausible explanations of why feminism has changed its ways. </p>
<p>Chapter 5 presents a discussion of ‘gender-mainstreaming’: to promote gender equality by means of engaging systematically and constructively with power, not least the state and its ‘mainline policies’. Chapter 6 explores the relationships between feminism and capitalism, class and gender, gives more flesh to the distinction between neo-liberal and social-democratic gender regimes, and takes up the gendered implications of globalization, the financial crisis and the environmental crisis. The final two chapters focus on what happens when feminism interacts – as feminism often does – with other more or less mainstream projects, such as economic growth, environmentalism, human rights and social democracy, and expose some challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>Although an important contribution, <italic>The Future of Feminism</italic> sweeps some genuine conflicts and dilemmas under the carpet. Consider for example how feminism is defined. Walby’s intuition that feminism should be defined in terms of its goals, is certainly sound, but which goals? Walby states that the goal of feminism is not simply that of ‘reducing gender inequality’, since this definition would exclude all ‘women’s organizations that pursue the interest of women as they see them’. In the end, however, when Walby operationalizes contemporary feminism the agenda is reduced to promoting gender equality in the sense of increasing ‘gender balance’. On the one hand, Walby seems well aware that such simple quantitative measures do not capture the deeper critique of the hegemonic male-dominated culture articulated by difference-oriented feminists. On the other, she tends to claim that such conflicts are only apparent and ‘in theory’, and of a kind that is most often resolved ‘in practice’. Is this really the case? And where does it leave theory in feminism? </p>
<p>A third question is whether what takes place ‘in practice’ is a real and fair integration of claims and aims or whether 50/50 feminism gets the upper hand for other reasons. The success of this branch of feminism reflects power relations within the women’s movement, and some of its aims can be mainstreamed rather smoothly. When Angela Merkel’s government recently launched a proposal of at least 30 per cent women in the boards of German enterprises, the fact that this and similar reforms, spurring women’s professional careers, may improve competitiveness, or at least is believed to do so, was a central motivation. </p>
<p>Fourthly, it is questionable whether the equality/difference debate as Walby presents it captures the full normative horizon of feminism. For one thing, there are significant debates going on among feminists with regard to what equality means. Is the adequate standard equal group-level outcomes, or rather equal opportunites or capabilities, as suggested for example by Martha Nussbaum? Add to this the charges from queer feminists, multiculturalist feminists and masculinity scholars and activists who argue that contemporary feminism is illegitimately heterosexist, imperialist and maternalist. I admire the way in which Walby departs from the mainstream of academic feminist theory and focuses stringently on gender equality (and not ‘diversity’), socio-economic redistribution (and not ‘recognition’ and identity politics), and the undue burdens carried by so many women world-wide. Still, the contemporary emphasis on ‘diversity’, ‘recognition’ and ‘new masculinities’ contains ideas worth taking seriously.</p>
<p>Finally, there is more to say about the relationship between feminism and expertise. <italic>The Future of Feminism </italic>gives an excellent overview of the ‘technocratization’ of feminism during recent decades. Feminist legislation and policies are increasingly proposed, prepared, implemented and evaluated by ‘gender experts’ inside and outside government. The outcomes of such cooperation between state machineries, transnational and global agencies and courts, expertise-based lobby groups and academics may indeed be impressive from the perspective of promoting women’s rights and interests. However, all this feminism-from-above is questionable from a democratic point of view. Walby admits that ‘expertise and democracy have been seen as rival sources of legitimacy in governance’, but goes on to dismiss this view as inadequate. We should instead, she says, ‘reconsider the nature of democracy’, so that the increased power of gender experts in political decision-making is regarded as an expansion of democracy, and not as a democratic problem. Maybe we should, but for what reason? The argument that educated and knowledgeable people know best may or may not be sound in some version, but it is certainly not a new argument, and it needs more substantial backing than Walby provides.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, Walby’s account of feminism and its possible futures is multi-layered, theoretically informed and authoritative, while at the same time extraordinarily accessible. Her recent study should be obligatory reading for everyone with a stake in feminism, academics and non-academics, whether they consider themselves ‘feminists’ or not.</p>
