      <p>One of the critical obstacles to women’s well-being is the pervasive and often socially accepted violence perpetrated against them across the lifespan. <italic>Trauma-Centered Group Psychotherapy for Women</italic> provides an important resource for clinicians seeking to provide support and guidance for women in the trauma recovery process. This text is informative, concise, and highly readable. Based on years of group psychotherapy experience with a total of 272 women (primarily Caucasian and relatively educated), the authors provide their group psychotherapy manual to clinicians who are sure to find it useful.</p>
      <p>The authors, Lubin and Johnson, have included several components that result in a clear contribution to the fields of trauma therapy. At the beginning of the manual, they provide a clear and thoughtful reflection on the trauma theories guiding their treatment approach. They outline the value of their group psychotherapy approach, including a public closing ceremony that is open to those invited to bear witness to the women’s recovery. Lubin and Johnson note that as a result of interpersonal trauma being a social violation with socially isolating consequences, it is critical that women are given an opportunity to break their silence and give their testimony. Recognizing that the perpetrator intends for them to stay silent and ashamed, it is critical for women to have a safe place to discover they can shatter the shame and reconnect with society. One key goal is for the women to recognize that although the trauma affected them, it does not define them.</p>
      <p>Lubin and Johnson also provide information on trauma recovery from a developmental perspective, both in terms of the development of post-trauma symptoms over time and the unique impact of trauma, given the developmental stage of the survivor. The 16-week group psychotherapy model addresses primary symptoms such as affect dysregulation, faulty cognitions, and interpersonal impairments; secondary effects of maladaptive protective behaviors; and tertiary effects of hopelessness. The group structure, which provides both time for mini lectures and open discussion, is developed for persons who have experienced diverse traumas as well as chronic and severe symptoms. During the discussion portion of the group, the facilitator’s role is to identify the manner in which traumatic experiences are affecting the way participants currently think, feel, and interact with others. The manual provides clear scripts for the facilitator, handouts for participants, visual figures to demonstrate the psychoeducation component, brief case studies, and solutions for potential challenges.</p>
      <p>The primary feminist components of this manual are fourfold. First, it encourages a strengths-based approach to empower and understand the experience of survivors. Second, it is one of a few trauma psychotherapy manuals that directly address the impact trauma has on survivors’ understanding of their womanhood. Third, the manual makes use of alternative therapeutic strategies that can empower women such as social support and the expressive arts. Finally, the book describes the collective responsibility society has in addressing interpersonal violence by noting that there ought to be societal level outrage that leads to direct action.</p>
      <p>There are a few areas in which the authors could strengthen future adaptations of their treatment manual. The first is adding language to acknowledge and address the way cultural diversity may affect women’s experiences of trauma and the recovery process. Over recent decades, more attention has been given to the influence of cultural context (ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, etc.) on the trauma recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312464577">Briere &amp; Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312464577">Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464577">Bryant-Davis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312464577">Harvey &amp; Tummala-Narra, 2007</xref>). By attending more to the survivors’ cultural realities, the authors can address some of the currently unacknowledged challenges created by for example (a) perpetrators being referred to as “he”, which may silence women who have been violated by other women and (b) use of the phrase “God knows that you know” which may raise issues for atheist or agnostic survivors. For a text to embody the tenants of feminist therapy, it needs to address the multiple cultural identities of women and the various forms of oppression affecting their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312464577">Enns, 2004</xref>). This text fails to acknowledge or discuss the impact of racism, classism, heterosexism, or other forms of societal trauma that could affect both the women’s trauma history and experience within the therapeutic process. It is important that feminist trauma-focused therapy acknowledge both the potential impact of marginalization and the resistance strategies available to women as they seek to heal and become empowered.</p>
      <p>Another growth area for the authors to expand upon in forthcoming editions of their manual is the minimal level of detail in the “potential challenges” sections. The brevity of the responses provided to potential challenges could lead to misinterpretation by participants. For example, encouraging survivors to forgive themselves may reinforce the belief that they are responsible for the abuse, although in other places throughout the manual this misconception is countered. Another example is responding to a participant who says, “Maybe it’s too late for me,” with the response, “Yes, maybe it is too late for you.” The sentences that follow this statement could benefit from a fuller response to ensure participants’ cognitive distortions are not reinforced.</p>
      <p>Although there are areas that can be strengthened in this text, the manual provides important therapeutic insights for conducting group psychotherapy for women. By testifying and bearing witness, women can carve out safe places to heal and grow. Lubin and Johnson add to the much needed tools for women’s recovery and empowerment.</p>
