<abstract>
<p>Mandatory reporting is the method by which most states deal with the problem of elder abuse. However, the effectiveness of this approach has been the topic of little research. In this study, we report on a series of qualitative interviews with workers involved in the mandatory reporting process in the State of Michigan. The workers were involved either as mandated reporters or as representatives of the state who receive the reports (Adult Protective Services workers). Numerous problems were identified, including inadequate staffing in the state agency responsible for receiving reports of elderly abuse, lack of a standardized mechanism for submitting reports, poor training in a variety of areas for both reporters and APS workers, inadequate communication and coordination among agencies involved in the process, confidentiality concerns at all levels, inability of agencies to identify persons responsible for previous abuse of the elderly, and lack of involvement of knowledgeable workers in the establishment and administration of the law. Workers were also concerned that the needs of the elderly received little attention from officials at all levels (courts, prosecutors, and state government), most of whom were perceived to consider the needs of the children to be primary. On the positive side, workers in both types of agencies appeared highly committed to their clients and went considerably out of their way to be of assistance.</p>

<p>Elder maltreatment disproportionately affects members of the elderly population who are more vulnerable, and often has serious health and welfare consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724412462340">Baker 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1936724412462340">Fulmer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1936724412462340">Sengstock et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1936724412462340">Strasser and Fulmer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1936724412462340">Teaster and Roberto 2004</xref>). It is also an intractable problem, for which many known remedies are ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724412462340">Ramsey-Klawsnik 2000</xref>). One approach makes use of mandatory reporting laws to identify victims and possibly trigger intervention. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412462340">Brandl (2004)</xref>, mandatory reporting of elder maltreatment by professionals who work with the elderly is in effect in all but 7 of the 51 states (including District of Columbia).</p>
<p>Program theory was the basis for the evaluation, relating the analysis to the theory on which the program was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724412462340">Klein-Haarhuis and Leeuw 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1936724412462340">Leeuw 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1936724412462340">Owen and Rogers 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1936724412462340">Pressman and Wildavsky 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1936724412462340">Van der Knaap 2004</xref>). From its inception, the mandatory reporting approach was borrowed from strategies with child abuse. It assumed that mandated professionals would have sufficient knowledge to identify such cases, willingness to comply with the state requirement, and appropriate services available to assist the victims identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412462340">Faulkner 1982</xref>). However, some mandated reporters lack the knowledge and/or the willingness to make these reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1936724412462340">Rinker 2009</xref>). For example, physicians, who constitute a major category of mandatory reporters, often have little experience with elder maltreatment and are unwilling to conform to reporting requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724412462340">Kennedy 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1936724412462340">Rodriguez et al. 2006</xref>). This pattern is likely true of other professions as well. Furthermore, critics have long decried the fact that needed services are inadequate at best, and often totally absent; in the absence of such resources, mandatory reporting is largely ineffective and may even be dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412462340">Faulkner 1982</xref>). Consequently, many highly ethical professionals distrust the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412462340">Daniels et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>These problems have led to numerous suggestions for changes in the mandatory reporting process, such as improving leadership, training, and service resources available to reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412462340">Daniels et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1936724412462340">Hawes et al. 2007</xref>). Others suggest the development of new mechanisms, such as scales or measures to identify maltreated elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412462340">Cohen et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724412462340">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1936724412462340">Neale et al. 1991</xref>), or the introduction of entirely different models for dealing with maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1936724412462340">Nerenberg 2008</xref>). However, efforts to improve the process have rarely considered the views of workers responsible for implementing the mandatory reporting system. In an attempt to remedy this lack, a project funded by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation undertook an examination of the views of mandated reporters and Adult Protective Services (APS) workers in the State of Michigan. These are the workers responsible for reporting as well as receiving, analyzing, investigating, and managing the mandatory reporting system for elders in the state. Hence, this work contributes to the broader national review of the effectiveness of mandatory reporting.</p>
<p>Michigan’s APS law aims to protect “vulnerable adults” from abuse, neglect, or exploitation. A vulnerable adult is defined as a person above the age of 18, “Who . . . is unable to protect himself or herself from abuse, neglect or exploitation because of a mental or physical impairment or because of advanced age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>:5). According to Michigan’s APS law, a person is identified as a “vulnerable adult” if four conditions are met: The individual is 18 years of age or older, is “vulnerable” as defined above, is at risk of “harm (abuse, neglect, exploitation),” and there is a “reasonable belief that the individual is a vulnerable adult in need of protection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>:9). Four types of maltreatment are included in the law: abuse, neglect, self-neglect, and exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>:6).</p>
<p>As indicated above, the major component of the law is its requirement of “mandatory reporting.” That is, it requires that certain professionals report to the designated state agency (i.e., the APS Department) any cases in which abuse, neglect, self-neglect, or exploitation of vulnerable adults is suspected. The law defines “Mandated Reporters” as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Those employed, licensed, registered or certified to provide or who are employees of an agency licensed to provide: a. Health Care; b. Education Services; c. Social Welfare Services; d. Mental Health Services; e. Other Human Services; Law Enforcement Officers; Employees of the County Medical Examiner; Physicians. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>:7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The APS Department has undergone several structural changes at the state and local levels. At times, it has been managed at the city level; presently, it is centralized at the county level, except in rural areas, where several counties may be combined. Michigan’s APS system has undergone evaluation from many perspectives since its inception in 1984 (Public Act 519; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1936724412462340">Richards and Farrell 2010</xref>). In 2006, a Task Force appointed by the governor, issued its report evaluating the status of mandatory reporting of elder maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724412462340">Michigan Office of Services to the Aging 2006</xref>). The Task Force made numerous recommendations, including the development of a more proactive approach, increased training for reporters, more coordination among agencies, and greater attention to the types of maltreatment, which were substantiated most frequently by APS workers (self-neglect, neglect, and financial abuse; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724412462340">Michigan Office of Services to the Aging 2006</xref>, Section 5-2). They also suggested that more types of reporters should be involved, particularly financial and law enforcement institutions; that some laws required change; and that barriers to reporting should be removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724412462340">Michigan Office of Services to the Aging 2006</xref>, Section 2-4).</p>
<sec id="section1-1936724412462340" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Data collection and analysis for the project were based on the inductive approach recommended by grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412462340">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1936724412462340">Lacey and Luff 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1936724412462340">Strauss and Corbin 1998</xref>). The project aimed to collect data from both mandated reporters in private agencies responsible for making the reports to APS, and workers in divisions of the state APS agency who receive and investigate the reports. This was done by conducting focus group interviews in the agencies in which they were employed. Approval of the project was sought and obtained from the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Appropriate agencies were identified; each agency was recruited by calling the head of the agency, who was informed of the nature of the study, and asked to arrange to interview workers. Workers were subsequently informed by supervisors that a meeting would occur, and they were invited to attend. On the day of the discussions, each agency provided a setting for the meeting, mainly in a staff conference room. Professionals were assured that participation in the discussions was voluntary, and they could opt out whenever they desired. Data for the study were collected only from workers in the tri-county Detroit Metropolitan Area (Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties). As a result, these results apply mainly in the urban environment and may have limited applications to rural areas or small towns. However, this area constitutes the most populous area of the state. Hence, it probably has a broader application than the limited geographic area would suggest. Although both quantitative and qualitative data were collected, this analysis focuses only on a segment of the qualitative data from the focus group interviews.</p>
<p>In total, 14 focus group interviews were conducted in eight different agencies during two waves. In the first wave (January through May 2007), 6 focus groups were conducted with a total of 25 participants interviewed. In the second wave (January through April 2008), the data were updated; 28 participants were interviewed in 6 focus groups. In most instances, the same respondents participated in both waves; however, in a few cases, new respondents participated in the second wave, due to changes in staffing or the unavailability of some agencies to continue their participation. The agencies were categorized into three types: “APS agencies” were divisions of the state APS agency that receives the mandated reports; “Health Care agencies” included hospitals, home nursing services, and case managers involved in oversight of patients in long-term care; and “Senior centers” were community agencies providing a variety of services and including professionals in a wide variety of professions, such as religious leaders, public safety, or other community workers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1936724412462340">Table 1</xref> for a summary).</p>

<p>After data were collected, the principal investigator and other project workers each coded the data, using grounded theory to develop meanings and themes. Following the steps outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1936724412462340">Lacey and Luff (2001)</xref>, open coding was done to recognize themes, patterns, and commonalities of the data (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724412462340">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1936724412462340">Strauss and Corbin 1998</xref>). Subsequent to this, these themes were collapsed based on sameness, using a more focused coding procedure. Experts in the area of elder abuse assisted in collecting the data and in checking the interpretation of the interviews. Diagrams, maps, and other visual techniques were used to assist in these analyses. The aim was to arrive at a common understanding of the data and foster collaboration of findings. Data have been summarized to ensure the required confidentiality of the agencies and respondents. Finally, the project also drew on written documents that provided information on the requirements of the mandatory law as well as previous evaluations of its effectiveness. A description of the State of Michigan’s APS law and its operation was analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1936724412462340">Richards 2006</xref>), as were recommendations from the Governor’s Task Force, mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724412462340">Michigan Office of Services to the Aging 2006</xref>). These documents provided bases on which to evaluate both the quantitative and qualitative data gathered for this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1936724412462340">
<title>Presentation of Findings</title>
<p>As indicated by respondents, mandated reports are made by telephone and received by an intake worker, who screens each case to determine whether the client is eligible under APS regulations. As noted earlier, there are four criteria that must be met. Technically, Michigan does not have an <italic>elder</italic> maltreatment law, because some categories of younger persons, such as the developmentally disabled, who are also vulnerable, at risk of harm, and in need of protection, are also included. When a report is received, the intake worker makes a decision as to whether the case fits the criteria. If it does, an investigation is initiated. In such cases, a contact must be initiated, at least by telephone, within 24 hours. This contact must be with the alleged victim or a collateral information source; it may not be with the referral source. Direct, face-to-face contact with the client must occur within 72 hours, unless the reported information suggests that a more immediate contact is necessary. A decision related to the issue of urgency is made by the APS supervisor (APS-A).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1936724412462340">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although child abuse provides an automatic justification for state intervention, the same is not true in cases involving adult maltreatment. The state cannot intervene unless the adult is incapable of defending himself or herself from harm due to age or disability (i.e., is “vulnerable”). Often a physician’s judgment is needed to determine whether the alleged victim is indeed mentally incompetent or physically unable to care for himself or herself. Criteria exist for all of these procedures; however, APS policies are more ambiguous than Child Protective Services (CPS) policies, because other factors, such as competence and vulnerability, must be determined. Adults also have the right to refuse services if they so choose. APS workers are very protective of adult clients’ right to refuse services (APS-E). This provision, however, frustrates mandated reporters, who are anxious to see the problem resolved, and become annoyed when state workers do not intervene (APS-B). It was also clear that these ambiguities created confusion with workers in some of the reporting agencies.</p>
<p>State workers report that the information provided by reporters usually includes “medical information, hospitals, police reports . . . other support services” the alleged victim receives (APS-B). Hopefully, they also receive names and telephone numbers of relatives or emergency contact information. They would like to receive any “information they [agencies] could share” (APS-B). Particularly helpful would be information on whether someone in the family had a criminal background, but this is rarely provided (APS-B). Many state workers expressed frustration that mandated workers are often confused about their legal responsibility to report, and even such vital information as the address where the client can be reached is often missing (APS-A).</p>
<p>However, the need to obtain such information raises another issue critical to the reporting process: confidentiality requirements of all the agencies involved (APS-D). This issue is particularly troublesome in medical institutions, which are covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) passed by Congress in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724412462340">Health and Human Services Department 2008</xref>). This Act has made the medical professions particularly wary about the appropriateness of sharing information with any other agency, and has made the reporting process more difficult. Several reporting agencies mentioned their hesitancy to share internal client information with other agencies (Health B), and APS workers noted that they had often been told this was a problem (APS-A, APS-B). This was the case even though the law mandates reporting and includes protections for reporters providing information.</p>
<p>In return, APS workers were also reluctant to share the results of their investigation with the reporting agencies. This confidentiality problem complicates the sharing of knowledge that could be of assistance to the victim. Although confidentiality is clearly important, a resolution of this dilemma could improve the effectiveness of the APS process. Failure to provide adequate data to meet legal criteria means that the case must be rejected without an investigation. APS workers expressed frustration concerning the limited information reporters provide, often resulting in rejected cases (APS-D). Approximately, 20 to 25 cases are rejected each month, based on the absence of adequate evidence (APS-A). Workers spend considerable effort to investigate, but “we don’t always have that [information]” (APS-B). APS workers also recognize that “a lot of people [i.e., mandated reporters] don’t have the information either . . . [or] that they are mandated . . . I really don’t think these agencies really know” (APS-A). Hence, lack of knowledge of legal requirements is clearly a problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1936724412462340">
<title>Problems with Policies and Regulations</title>
<p>APS workers were frustrated that professionals in other agencies lacked information about their responsibilities as mandated reporters or the types of information they needed to provide. Most were unaware of updates in APS rules (APS-E). Greater problems occurred when agencies developed internal polices in conflict with APS regulations. For example, some agencies have developed policies that require employees to report suspected incidents to an internal screening agent, such as a supervisor or a designated department, rather than reporting directly to APS (the required legal procedure; APS-E). As APS workers at all levels understand the law, the mandate requires the specific worker observing the alleged incident to report directly to APS. In the APS view, prior screening of suspicions with a supervisor does not conform to the law (APS-E). However, some agencies reportedly obtained legal counsel advising them that this was in conformity with professional requirements (APS-E). APS workers see this approach as a major stumbling block to the performance of their responsibilities (APS-E).</p>
<p>Michigan regulations do not require the use of any particular scales or instruments in the identification of elder maltreatment. Some experts believe that identification of abuse is more effective if specific scales are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412462340">Cohen et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724412462340">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1936724412462340">Neale et al. 1991</xref>). The Michigan CPS Department employs a form for use by mandated reporters of child abuse. Mandated reporters sometimes request such a form for adult victims, which APS workers thought would be useful (APS-B, APS-D). As one worker said, “I think a more focused protocol like CPS would definitely help” (APS-A). However, respondents also report that different information is required for adults, so the CPS form would not be appropriate, and a new form would have to be developed (APS-B). The administration of Michigan’s protective services process also makes use of different procedures, depending on where the incident occurs (APS-B). Each county has jurisdiction over abuse cases occurring within its boundaries. It also provides for a different agency to receive reports regarding cases that involve incidents occurring in state-licensed institutions, such as nursing homes; in such cases, reports are to be made to the Department of Community Health (DCH) rather than APS (APS-B).</p>
<p>These differing procedures complicate the reporting process for all reporters, who must be aware of the varying procedures for each case. Different counties and divisions also have different administrative procedures for reporting abuse (APS-B). Respondents in the APS focus groups clearly indicate that the three counties covered in the project all have central intake of cases of elder maltreatment, and all use a single-intake telephone process for both children and adults. They also note, however, that other counties may not have central intake, or may use different intake procedures for children and adults (APS-B). Consequently, this situation presents problems for reporting agencies, and their workers must be aware which county has jurisdiction in a particular client’s case. Many agencies, particularly hospitals, have clients from several counties, each with a different reporting process. Incidents in nursing homes also require different procedures, depending on whether the alleged abuser is an employee or a visitor (APS-B). Seasoned professionals who observe adult maltreatment on a regular basis are aware of these varying requirements. However, this variation makes reporting difficult for workers who observe only an occasional instance of adult maltreatment. It is frustrating, for example, for a professional to make a report to APS, only to be told this report must be directed to the community health department instead.</p>
<p>Respondents in the APS focus groups also reported that workers in many agencies do not understand the APS role, and expect a great more than APS has authority to do. Some APS workers commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>We are not a placement agency. We are not discharge planners. . . . there’s a lot of things . . . that people look to us for. . . . we [must] come to court to get guardianship, to get the authority to go into the home to protect [the clients]. (APS-A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other agencies also complain when APS action does not fulfill their own agency expectations. A respondent in APS-A commented, “[the other worker] looked right at me and said, ‘Well what good is APS then?’” Clearly, the APS role and limitations on its authority are not understood by many other agencies.</p>
<p>This lack of knowledge about the APS role is shared by other government agencies as well, including the Michigan DCH, police, and courts. Several APS workers reported having difficulty with other government agencies whose input is required to serve the clients effectively (APS-A). Guardianships were a particularly vexing problem. These are critical because they are often needed for dependent older adults, and only a court can make guardianship decisions. However, APS workers felt that court officials often made their lives difficult by not performing the simplest of tasks, such as monitoring the guardian’s effectiveness and requiring regular reports (APS-A); they also complained that courts often refer all problematic issues to APS.</p>
<p>APS workers were particularly critical of state-appointed guardians or conservators who neglect their responsibilities or perform them in a perfunctory fashion, leaving dependent elders at risk. Efforts to exhort court officials to replace noncompliant guardians were largely unproductive (APS-A). Constant changes in assigning a date for court appearances also cause time-consuming delays in APS work. One APS agency reported having had extensive negotiations with the chief judge in the local court to establish a more efficient procedure for assignment of cases. However, when workers tried to implement these procedures, lower level court personnel informed them they knew of no such agreement (APS-A). Either the altered procedures had not been communicated to line personnel, or line workers had not bothered to implement them. In general, APS workers perceived “a sort of, a lack of respect for the workers sometimes, and their ability and knowledge, from the court” (APS-A). Hence, APS work is less effective than it could be due to actions of agencies outside of APS workers’ control.</p>

<title>Differential Treatment Given to Adults</title>
<p>The differential manner in which adult and child cases were handled by all types of agencies was a major frustration for APS workers (APS-E). Indeed, this issue was mentioned by nearly every public and private agency interviewed. All perceived that adult needs were considered of lesser importance than those of children at nearly every level of government. One worker said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s sort of like children’s things get in the newspaper more, and there’s more ombudsmen, and child advocates, and there’s more oversight and we’re always answering to people about those cases. But I noticed with APS, it just kind of, is off in the background. Even the person at central, who the [APS] program is under . . . she’ll say to me, “I don’t have any time for APS. I never do.” (APS-A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A particularly serious concern is the need to identify persons who have abused or neglected older adults in the past, so as to prevent their continuing in positions with access to vulnerable adults. An obvious answer to this problem is the development of a central registry of previous offenders, similar to that which exists for persons who have abused children. Some APS workers indicated that such a registry is one of their long-standing objectives (APS-A). It is especially critical for doing background checks for elder care workers. One worker said, “There’d better be some sort of central registry, too. That would be a huge thing” (APS-A). However, a colleague immediately commented, “Well, there won’t be, because it is very expensive to maintain” (APS-A).</p>
<p>In general, APS workers at every level complained that worker input regarding the needs of elderly victims or needed improvements in agency policy or procedures were rarely even requested. The absence of a state registry was another symptom of the lower priority assigned to adult cases. Such patterns appeared at every turn, even when they believed they had achieved an objective. One worker described an extended effort of his or her agency to obtain assistance from a legal agency for APS cases. The agency finally assigned an attorney to work with APS. The worker describes the attorney’s first meeting with the staff as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess we have like a gentlemen’s agreement that they are going to be backing us up, but when he came in to talk with us, he told us and I believed him, “My first love is children. Adults is way down here.” So, they don’t have the knowledge base. They don’t really know the population. They don’t know about vulnerability, risk, what’s going on out there. And basically, said, “Children come before adults. We are going to deal with the children.” That’s where the love is. (APS-A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>APS relations with hospitals were particularly troublesome. APS workers viewed some hospitals as using APS as a mechanism for avoiding annoying dimensions of case management. Guardianship was one such issue. Some hospitals were thought to be referring patients who needed guardians to APS, allowing the hospital to avoid the time involved in going to court, as well as transferring the court application fee to APS (APS-A). They also complained that discharge planners sometimes called APS late in the patient’s stay to avoid the problem of returning a patient to an unsafe environment (APS-A). However, many of these cases were not appropriate APS referrals, and those that were appropriate were referred too late (APS-A). Even more annoying was the fact that the hospitals had extensive patient information, but the referrals often lacked the information necessary to determine whether it was an appropriate APS case. When APS rejected such cases, the referring agency would complain that APS was not doing its job (APS-A). APS workers viewed such agencies as “dumping” their difficult cases on APS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1936724412462340">
<title>Insufficient Training for a Changing Clientele</title>
<p>Training for their jobs was another issue that APS workers found problematic. APS worker training was described as “very minimal” (APS-A). Cases that involve determinations of mental competency are particularly vexing, but APS training provides little background in this issue (APS-A). APS workers depend on mental health personnel or physicians to provide this input. However, many physicians are reluctant to testify in court regarding mental competency cases, and collaboration with mental health workers has been problematic as well (APS-A). Workers also felt they needed more training on financial exploitation and various legal questions. They foresaw even more serious problems as the older adult population increases. In particular, they are beginning to see a different type of aged population. One worker described the problem well,
<disp-quote>
<p>[Before it was] cute, little, old ladies. Now, I’m like, God! You’re getting drug addicts. You’re getting the chronic intoxication. You’re getting mental illness . . . again, we don’t have training in those areas. . . . many more legal areas. . . . who do we call if we have legal questions? . . . it is going to get worse as the baby boomers start aging out more. It is gonna get worse and we do not have the support. It is going to be a mess out there! (APS-A)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, APS workers on the line see many flaws in the process. Increased consistency in the process through a standardized form specifically geared to adults would be beneficial. Also helpful would be more APS workers to handle the workload, and additional training, both for mandated agencies concerning the reporting process, and for APS workers to provide them with skills in specialized areas, such as mental competency criteria.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, decisions to standardize or alter the process in any manner are policy decisions, as are any decisions concerning additional training programs. This is true both for APS workers and for personnel in mandated reporting agencies. All policy decisions are made “through legislation really in Lansing [the State capital]. Our job really is dictated by law and so we really have no discretion to change policy. It’s the legislators” (APS-B). Furthermore, APS workers made it clear that workers at the local level are not involved in the development of policy, which is “ all done through the central office in Lansing” (APS-B). At the same time, implementation of policies and procedures occurs on the local level. Hence, there will be considerable variation in the amount and types of training provided, the degree of collaboration achieved, and so on, for the various county APS units. This will also affect the degree of cooperation they are able to develop with local private and public agencies (APS-D). Clearly, more cooperation is needed between state policy makers and local officials for effective implementation.</p>

<title>Insufficient Number of Employees</title>
<p>Staffing is a critical issue to consider regarding the effective conduct of protective services for vulnerable adults. Identifying and assisting victims of maltreatment is an extremely work-intensive process. As one agency worker commented, “Nothing makes up for staff, nothing like machines, [for] combing your [i.e., a patient’s] hair and wiping your butt” (Health D). All APS work involves a considerable amount of time on the part of highly skilled workers in a variety of agencies and at several levels. Reporting agencies invest considerable time and effort into observing symptoms and making reports. Once a report is received, APS workers must invest a great deal of time in examining the reports presented, evaluating the information presented, determining whether maltreatment has occurred, and recommending further action.</p>
<p>However, staffing levels for adult services in Michigan had diminished by nearly half in the previous 11 years from a total of 649 workers in 1998 to 328 in 2006. It remained at that level in 2008, with little indication this would change in the near future (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1936724412462340">Table 2</xref>). Note that these numbers include <italic>all</italic> adult services workers, not just those dedicated to APS work; hence, APS workers represent only a portion of those 328 workers. In 2011, there was an increase to 384 adult workers; however, none of the added workers were assigned to APS (Cynthia Farrell, Michigan Department of Human Services, pers. comm.). As a result, adult services workers are extremely overburdened. One county APS director estimated her unit investigated approximately 50 to 60 cases per month or 800 to 900 incidents each year (APS-A). Another county APS unit estimated that its workers each handled approximately 25 active cases at any given time, a high load for demanding cases such as these (APS-D).</p>

<p>One APS worker commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>You say you want to keep 100 workers doing APS . . . statewide, that’s statewide. So that’s 100 workers for those 16,000 referrals we’re getting in a year. That’s not enough staff to cover those referrals. (APS-E)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When presenting these data in a pubic setting, the senior author was confronted by a questioner who believed that computerization was the answer to this problem. As indicated above, the view that identification and assistance to aged victims of maltreatment can be reduced to a computerized process makes as much sense as allowing an unguided robot to perform brain surgery. Management of APS cases is a labor-intensive process requiring sophisticated professional judgment. It cannot be computerized or relegated to unskilled workers. Nor can the amount of time devoted to a case be diminished by much. As has been noted for some time, periods of economic austerity usually result in decreased service availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412462340">Daniels et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412462340">Faulkner 1982</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1936724412462340">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>As our respondents showed, a number of problems arise with implementation of the state’s program for the management of adult maltreatment. These issues made an already difficult task of assisting elderly victims even more trying, including inadequate responses from mandated reporting agencies and other government agencies, APS’s own policies and procedures, and the changing characteristics of the aging population as a whole. They also dealt with inadequately trained and insufficient staff, and a disconnect between the staff and APS workers and legal professionals. Government funds were insufficient, policy regulations unclear, and state agency rules vacillating. Finally, there was an absence of specific scales or instruments for identifying elder maltreatment, and a lack of information on updated APS regulations.</p>
<p>With regard to the reports they received, mandated agencies did not provide APS with sufficient information to determine whether some cases could be accepted. In others, the information provided was insufficient to conduct an effective investigation. APS workers complained that many mandated reporters were not aware of updates in APS regulations, and many agencies developed their own reporting procedures, some of them in conflict with state legal requirements. APS workers also perceived some agencies as using APS as a “dumping ground” for cases that the agencies themselves did not want to handle.</p>
<p>Workers were also frustrated by problems within APS itself as well as with other units of state and local governments that failed to provide the resources they felt they needed to perform their jobs more effectively. Local courts and legal authorities did not respond to the needs of vulnerable adults in a timely manner. Court-appointed guardians continued to be paid for their work while doing little or nothing for their wards, and the court did nothing. Workers believed that certain procedural changes, such as the development of a standardized form and a registry of persons with a record of maltreatment, might improve APS effectiveness. They were aware that there were areas in which they needed additional training, particularly in the areas of mental diagnoses, financial abuse, or legal issues. They knew their caseloads were exceptionally high, and were likely to get worse, with the predicted increase in size and character of the elderly population.</p>
<p>Finally, APS workers perceived officials at the state level to be unresponsive to their concerns. They felt that many changes were needed in the system, but were aware that these could only be accomplished through legislative action and administrative policy implementation. Finally, they had no hope that these concerns would even be recognized, much less enacted, particularly as many officials had made it clear that the needs of older adults fell far below those of children in the priority list. What was striking, however, was the high degree of commitment that characterized all workers interviewed in the state agencies. As one worker said, “Yeah we get cynical, but . . . I think every single one of your APS workers, we love what we do” (APS-A).</p>
<sec id="section8-1936724412462340">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The preceding report focused on the problems encountered by workers implementing the state mandatory reporting system for adult maltreatment in a major metropolitan area of one state. It is unclear that the specific problems they mentioned can be generalized to other cities or states, or to smaller communities and rural areas. However, for some time, other studies have indicated that neither the use of mandatory reporting as an approach to the problem of elder maltreatment, nor the problems associated with it, are unique to any particular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724412462340">Bergeron and Gray 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412462340">Brandl 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412462340">Daniels et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Concern for the elderly, lack of funding, and inadequate supportive resources have long been mentioned as major flaws in the effectiveness of mandatory reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412462340">Brandl 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724412462340">Faulkner 1982</xref>). The need for specific techniques to assist the identification process is also mentioned as a necessary aspect of mandatory reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724412462340">Cohen et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724412462340">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1936724412462340">Neale et al. 1991</xref>). Cooperation among the many agencies involved in the process is necessary if it is to lead to successful outcomes for victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724412462340">Bergeron and Gray 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724412462340">Daniels et al. 1999</xref>). This, of course, requires that agencies communicate effectively with each other; in that regard, they must also have assurance that client and agency confidentiality will not be breached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724412462340">Brandl 2004</xref>). Consequently, it is likely that any recommendations derived from respondents in the Michigan study are likely to be beneficial elsewhere. Among these are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1936724412462340" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Increase financial support and awareness for adult services at all levels and in several segments of the public and private services sector to assist elderly victims and their families and improve the effectiveness of APS interventions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide enhanced training for workers in both public and private agencies to ensure that all involved in the mandatory reporting process are aware of the laws and updates, and public agency workers can be aware of critical factors in elder victims’ environments. This should include such agencies as courts and law enforcement, not commonly included in the process at present.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Institute a standardized form, similar to that used for child protection, to clarify the legal requirements for reporting and ensure that needed information is obtained.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Establish a registry of known offenders (similar to that for child abusers and sex offenders) to ensure that the adult services system is aware of individuals known to have maltreated dependent adults in the past and to ensure that they would not be hired in similar positions in the future. This may be highly controversial, however, in light of the perceived opposition to such a registry in administrative levels of state government.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide adequate staffing levels for the state agencies charged with implementing mandatory reporting. No mechanized system can substitute for well-trained workers dedicated to their jobs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promote increased communication, training, and coordination among workers in all agencies to ensure that all have the necessary information about all cases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To assist this communication objective, the confidentiality concerns of both mandated reporters and state workers should be resolved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Officials developing laws and policies about elder maltreatment and mandatory reporting should take care to obtain input from those line workers most knowledgeable about the system and its operation. Greater involvement of knowledgeable workers would go far to remedying the inadequacies of the system.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the suggested recommendations may assist in alleviating the problem, some barriers to implementation exist, including lack of cooperation with reporting, insufficient finances, and difficulty in developing models. First, some major debates may involve funding of these programs especially in this period of economic hardship. Second, there might be reluctance on the part of some mandated reporters to accept responsibility for such reporting of suspected or confirmed incidents of elder maltreatment. Finally, there may be some difficulty in developing a model to suit the diversity of professionals who work in the agencies. Developing a one-fit-all model might prove to be too much of a daunting task.</p>
