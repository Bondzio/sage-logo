<abstract>
<p>Labyrinthine sequestrum, a rare form of labyrinthitis, is highly distinct from the more commonly encountered labyrinthitis ossificans based on its unique clinical, radiologic, and histologic characteristics. The study included 4 such patients who had undergone clinical and laboratory investigations, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments followed by surgical procedures and pathological evaluation. Their major symptoms were otorrhea, otalgia, tinnitus, and profound hearing loss. Imaging studies showed an osteolytic soft mass with calcified debris in the inner ear, and the bony labyrinth was eroded partly or completely by granulation mass, with loss of bony morphology. Further pathological examination was coincident with inflammatory granulation tissue with some calcification or osseous tissue. The disease process is attributed to chronic osteomyelitis due to the presence of osteonecrosis. Prompt CT and MRI examinations and optimal therapeutic management facilitate definitive diagnosis and protect against fatal complications.</p>

<body>
<p>Labyrinthitis is an infectious disease of the inner ear and may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens. Previous studies have mainly focused on labyrinthitis ossiﬁcans, which is a well-recognized entity that involves the formation of novel bone that fills the normally patent cochlear and vestibular lumina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812443491">1</xref></sup> However, the present 4 cases of labyrinthitis with widespread bony labyrinth destruction are extremely rare, which is worth being illustrated.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812443491" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study, approved by the committee on the Clinic Ethic Board of Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, China, involved a retrospective case analysis of 4 patients with labyrinthine sequestrum between 2008 and 2011. The 4 cases all routinely underwent necessary otorhinolaryngologic examinations and laboratory explorations. In addition, all underwent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast. All subsequently accepted and underwent labyrinthectomy with the removal of destructive granulation tissue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812443491" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The 4 patients were 26 to 43 years old, with a median age of 38 years and a male-female ratio of 3:1. All complained of otorrhea and profound hearing loss and experienced meningitis. Clinical manifestations also included otalgia, headache and tinnitus (3 cases), dizziness and fever (2 cases), and facial numbness (1 case). Otoscopy of 3 patients showed a macerated tympanic membrane and otorrhea, and 1 even demonstrated a polypoid mass filling in the deep external auditory canal. All laboratory tests were not consistent with tuberculosis or syphilis. Laboratory values from a lumbar puncture of 1 case revealed bacterial infection of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis.</italic></p>
<p>CT images of the temporal bone all showed mastoiditis and an osteolytic soft mass in the inner ear with partial or complete devastation of the bony labyrinth. The cochlear, vestibular, and 3 semicircular canals were completely eroded in 2 cases, while the other 2 patients presented with focal corrosion of either cochlear or vestibular and semicircular canals. The soft mass may also enter the middle ear (2 cases) and protrude through the fundus of the internal auditory canal indicated by enlargement of the bony canal (2 cases). On MRI, the T1-weighted sequences of the abnormality demonstrated a heterogeneous isointense signal in the region of the labyrinth. The mass appeared as a heterogeneous isointense to hyperintense signal on T2WI and was apparently enhanced following infiltration of the meninges after gadolinium injection. Three of them clearly presented irregular calcified debris within the lesion on CT imaging, which manifested as an ill-defined dark signal on MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812443491"><bold>Figures 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812443491"><bold>2</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>All 4 patients were administered cefatrizine (Rocephin) 2 g intravenously twice daily for 2 weeks preoperatively to control the infectious process and were treated with the same dose for 1 week after the operation routinely. Examination of the biopsy specimens after surgery demonstrated that all of the cases were consistent with inflammatory granulation tissue with some calcification or osseous tissue. All 4 patients recovered smoothly: all otologic symptoms disappeared, but the hearing loss was not recovered. None of the cases have shown indications of recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period of 2 to 36 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812443491" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aforementioned 4 cases of labyrinthitis showed totally different pathological progression from the more commonly labyrinthitis ossiﬁcans: the inner ear was replaced by inflammatory granulation tissue locally or entirely, and the bony labyrinth was diffusely destroyed even with the labyrinth completely losing its original morphology. The irregular calcified fragment within the lesion is denoted as bony sequestrum, which indicates the possibility of osteonecrosis.</p>
<p>Based on these cases, we speculate that the 4 patients may develop chronic osteomyelitis, suggested by the presence of osteonecrosis, and the course of the lesion develops gradually: the granulation tissue could first erode a certain part of the labyrinth; as the disease process proceeds, the bound of osseous demolition can continually extend until the entire labyrinth is eventually supplanted by the soft mass. Sequestrum is also gradually engendered during the progression. The CT image of 1 patient in our report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812443491"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>) may characteristically illustrate the development of such an entity: the obscure bone of the lateral semicircular canal indicates that it was being destroyed by granulation, with sequestrum formation soon to be followed. The speed and the degree of encroachment may depend on the invasion and toxicity of the pathogen, the patient’s power of resistance, and the management of anti-inflammation.</p>
<p>Forty-seven percent of osteomyelitis was secondary to a contiguous focus of infection, and both <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> are frequently encountered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443491">2</xref></sup> Bacterial infection of the labyrinth may occur via a tympanogenic (most common), meningogenic, or hematogenic route.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812443491">1</xref></sup> In our report, the fact that all of the patients simultaneously exhibited mastoiditis and meningitis or a history of cranial infection indicates that both the tympanogenic and meningogenic paths are significant routes for the transmission of labyrinthitis.</p>
<p>Adequate antibiotics should be administered promptly to control the infection in the case of potentially fatal intracranial complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812443491">3</xref></sup> The disease will not be resolved until the inflamed tissue is surgically removed, and incomplete surgical debridement of necrotic bone often leads to recurrence. Surgeons should carefully protect the meninges, facial nerve, and internal carotid artery intraoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812443491" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The diagnosis of this rare condition requires a high clinical suspicion in patients with the following: otitis media, meningitis and loss of labyrinth function simultaneously, osteolytic granulation causing extensive labyrinth destruction with calcified debris on CT and MRI, and histological findings of inflammatory granulation tissue and sequestrum. Biopsy and surgical exploration are recommended when necessary to remove the lesion, make a definite diagnosis, and avoid any further fatal encephalic complications.</p>
