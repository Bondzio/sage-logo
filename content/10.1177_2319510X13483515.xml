<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to identify the various intrinsic and extrinsic factors which effect the consumer’s buying behaviour online. The intrinsic factors are the inner motivations or drives of the consumers and the extrinsic factors are the marketer generated Internet marketing activities. The article aims at identifying these factors and their relative importance on the consumer’s purchase behaviour. The theoretical framework of this article is based on a vast Internet marketing literature. The hypothesised model was created that took into account the dependent and independent variables which were extracted using an exploratory factor analysis and these variables were used to construct hypotheses which were empirically tested through techniques such as independent <italic>t</italic>-tests and ANOVA. A structured questionnaire was used for this purpose and a survey was conducted on a sample of 200 through judgemental sampling. Questionnaires were filled by respondents in person as well as a pre-defined list of respondents based on their demographic profile was selected and questionnaires were mailed and posted online. The Exploratory Factor Analysis identified seven major intrinsic and extrinsic factors which govern the consumer’s buying behaviour. These seven factors were: Need for Recreation, Convenience, Website Attributes, Online Advertising, Social Communication, Information Search and Security and privacy concerns. The importance of these seven factors differ across different demographic variables such as age, income group of consumers and gender. The article presents a simple approach towards identifying the most effective Internet marketing tools that companies should employ and also helps in better understanding the online consumer behaviour which differs from the traditional consumer behaviour across various dimensions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Today it is not sufficient for any large enterprise to maintain a stronghold in the market by just sticking to the traditional medium of marketing, that is the Brick and Mortar system. Organisations need to have an online presence to keep with the fast paced growth of technology and changing consumer preferences.</p>
<p>The consumer is changing as well as the market place. Marketing is taking a new shape and a shift from the traditional 4P’s is inevitable. A McKinsey survey of marketing executives from around the world shows that in marketing, things are starting to change and companies are moving online across the spectrum of marketing activities, from building awareness to after-sales service and they see online tools as an important and effective component of their marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Companies have different options to reach the prospective customers but Internet has become the main medium for reaching potential clients anywhere across the globe. Internet has changed the way people used to do things. It brings the global audience closer and introduces a new medium of advertising which is quite unique compared to other advertising media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483515">Spilker, 2010</xref>). Similarly search engines like Google, Yahoo, make the searching of products and services very easy and have become an excellent source of obtaining new clients as well as a medium of Brand Building.</p>
<p>The online behaviours of consumers are subtlety different in nature from traditional consumer behaviour due to the unique characteristics and interplay of technology and culture (Chau. M, Cole. C et al., 2009). Although commercial use of the Web has been increasing at an exponential rate, how the multidimensional aspects inherent in traditional consumer behaviour change in the context of e-commerce is sparsely researched, despite its importance.</p>

<title>Internet Marketing Redefined</title>
<p>Shifting from the traditional 4P’s, marketers are now using the Internet as a new medium of reaching to the customer and this is evident from the increased share of revenues being invested in developing the Internet as a marketing tool.</p>
<p>Internet marketing encompasses a whole spectrum of activities which generally include:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Communication Strategy:</bold> Online advertising, sales promotions online and spreading consumer awareness through different online channels including social media, viral information etc. Liu and Xiao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483515">2008</xref>) stated that people opt for online shopping due to a variety of utilitarian and hedonic needs out of which discounts and special deals is one of the most important which makes advertising and sales promotions online an integral part of any company’s Internet marketing strategy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Distribution Strategy:</bold> According to many researchers one of the main purposes of online shopping for consumers is the convenience associated with ordering and receiving products at the door step. Companies are looking to strengthen their distribution channels by eliminating the middlemen thereby creating a win-win situation by cutting down middlemen margins and a speedy doorstep delivery to its consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483515">Darrel, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Website Designing:</bold> Another key attribute which has to be taken into account when developing a full-fledged Internet marketing strategy is to design your website in such a way that it is user friendly, informative, attractive and becomes a tool for differentiation from its competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483515">Thomas, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>An average customer has to be considered as a non-technical and non-computer friendly individual and the website should be designed accordingly also keeping in mind the type of audience or the demographic profile of the prospective website visitors. For example, A company dealing with toys or baby products will be targeting the age group 0–15 which will require a website which is user friendly as well as colourful and vibrant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Payment Options and Security:</bold> For an orthodox consumer the Internet itself poses a threat to his purchase intentions due to a variety of security and privacy concerns. Consumers generally prefer ‘Cash on Delivery’ due to the convenience and safety associated with it, but as all websites do not provide this option it becomes a major influence on consumer’s buying intentions online which makes wide availability of payment options and secure browsing a vital component of the Internet marketing strategy of any company.</p></list-item>

<title>Understanding the Internet Consumer</title>
<p>The consumer psyche is dynamic in nature so is the marketplace in today’s scenario. Companies before developing any strategies for its prospective consumers have to understand the consumer decision making process. Fishbein and Ajzen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483515">1975</xref>) proposed the theory of reasoned action according to which consumers rely on intrinsic cues more as compared to external stimuli. An individual’s inner drives which arise due to his needs propel him to take purchase decisions.</p>
<p>The commercial evolution of the World Wide Web has resulted in an environment where consumers engage directly with businesses in a variety of ways right from the regular Brick and Mortar establishments to social networking websites and micro-blogging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2319510X13483515">Reppel and Szmigin, 2010</xref>). This calls for a holistic marketing effort on part of the marketer to engage the consumers in the best possible manner and develop a favourable image about the company and its offerings in the minds of the consumers.</p>
<p>Behind the visible act of making a purchase lies a decision process that must be investigated.</p>
<p>According to J. Scott Armstrong (1991) the purchase decision process is the stages a buyer passes through in making choices about which products and services to buy. The stages are:
<list id="list2-2319510X13483515" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Problem Recognition</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Information Search</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evaluation of alternatives</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Purchase Decision</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Post purchase Behaviour</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Marketing stimuli act at each stage of the decision making process and become a major factor in consumer buying behaviour and satisfaction. The initial problem recognition stage of the decision making process is a result of consumer’s black box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483515">Loudon, 1988</xref>) which includes the individuals Attitudes, Motivation, Perceptions, Personality, Lifestyle and Knowledge. Once the consumer recognises his needs he looks for information from various resources a concept named as the Zero moment of truth.</p>
<p>According to L.G. Schiffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483515">1993</xref>) apart from the internal factors consumer behaviour can also be affected by external influences, such as culture, sub-culture, locality, royalty, ethnicity, family, social class, past experience reference groups, lifestyle, market mix factors. Some of these factors can be controlled by the marketers such as the marketing mix and some of the online reference groups.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Smith and Chaffey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483515">2005</xref>) give a short and basic definition of Internet marketing as ‘Achieving marketing objectives through use of electronic communication technology’. According to Hoge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483515">1993</xref>), Internet marketing—is the transfer of goods or services from seller to buyer that involves one or more electronic methods or media. Reppel and Szmigin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2319510X13483515">2010</xref>) focused on the commercial evolution of the World Wide Web which has resulted in an environment where consumers engage directly with businesses in a variety of ways. The Internet has become an indispensable tool for today’s businesses. Every business organisation is using it in some way or another these days. Marketing managers who fail to use the Internet in formulating their companies’ marketing strategy will be at a disadvantage. Yannopoulos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2319510X13483515">2011</xref>) discusses how the Internet is impacting the conduct of a firm’s marketing strategy. The discussion includes the impact of the Internet on product and brand strategy, pricing strategy, distribution and promotion strategy.</p>
<p>Hoge’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483515">1993</xref>) idea of Internet marketing is simple but it does not touch the important aspect of customer relationship. Strauss and Ansary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2319510X13483515">2006</xref>) defined Internet marketing in their latest book as the use of information technology in the process of creating, communicating and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organisation and its stake holders. This explanation tells that e-marketing is not only about selling products or providing services through IT but it is lot more than that. It is not just traditional marketing using the information technology tools but it’s a strategic model to achieve brand value and provide customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Thomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483515">2008</xref>) identified the different approaches to B2B and B2C Internet marketing across cultures. Most of the studies included determined that the use of Internet marketing has a positive impact on the firm’s marketing performance. The findings also suggest that the Internet experience and perceived risk play an important role in consumer’s purchase likelihood.</p>
<p>To understand the consumer behaviour of online consumers it is important to first understand the relationship between the consumer behaviour and consumer satisfaction of online consumers. Liu and Xiao (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483515">2008</xref>) developed a hypothesised relation model between consumer satisfaction and the consumer behaviour of online consumers. They created this model based on the theory of reasoned action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483515">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>). Technology acceptance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483515">David, 1988</xref>) and the Innovation diffusion model to formulate their hypothesis and test them empirically using techniques such as factor analysis, relation analysis and hypothesis testing. The study indicated that all the hypothesised variables were positively related with consumer satisfaction apart from convenience to shop and customer service quality does greatest effect on the consumer satisfaction among all the nine factors which they had identified.</p>
<p>Several well-known models such as the AIDA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483515">Strong, 1925</xref>) or the frequently cited hierarchy-of-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483515">Lavidge &amp; Steiner, 1961</xref>) have been developed that try to explain the consumers’ persuasion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483515">Graham &amp; Havlena, 2007</xref>; Vakratsas &amp; Ambler, 1999). The AIDA model is one of the first formal advertising models, attributed to E. St. Elmo Lewis in 1898 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483515">Strong, 1925</xref>). AIDA is an acronym for Attention, Interest, Desire and Action. Lewis theorised in his model that salespeople have to attract attention, maintain interest and create desire and the resulting action in order to be successful. Some studies show the way in which advertising messages have an effect on consumers’ perception <italic>(</italic>for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483515">Baumgartner &amp; Sujan, 1997</xref>) or the brand. Numerous studies focus on which advertising effort works when, for which consumer and under what circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483515">Ansari &amp; Mela, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2319510X13483515">van Heerde, Helsen, &amp; Dekimpe, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>According to Schiffman, L.G. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483515">1993</xref>) apart from the internal factors consumer behaviour can also be affected by external influences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483515">Acar &amp; Polonsky, 2007</xref>) examined the impact of personality factors such as extraversion, self-esteem, opinion seeking and opinion leadership on brand communication and online social behaviours. The results show that gender and extroversion predict online social network size and time spent online; that opinion seekers spend more time online and have larger networks relative to opinion leaders; and that opinion leaders are more likely to communicate their brand use online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483515">Chen, Fay &amp; Wang, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand need for recreation as an important dimension of online shopping. Filo, K, Funk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483515">2005</xref>) advocates a more consumer-oriented approach to Internet marketing. The main focus is given to sports organisation. Internet marketing allows sport organisations to coordinate venue-based consumer experience with virtual content provided on Internet websites. It also allows them to capitalise on features of the product that consumers find attractive.</p>
<p>Hairong Li, Cheng Kuo, Maratha G. Rusell (2006) have found out in their study that recreational buyers are those who are frequent and occasional Web buyers. They are indeed not more price-sensitive than non-Web buyers. They have also emphasised that recent advances in the shopping environment includes use of surround video, 3-D images and VR technology, which are likely to be the main characteristics of the second generation of online stores. These ‘experience-oriented’ features give the consumers a shopping experience in which they can take full advantage of rich information, easy access and convenience of the Internet.</p>
<p>Convenience is another important dimension in online shopping. Kuan-Pin Chiang, Ruby Roy Dholakia (2003) examine three essential variables of consumer’s intention to shop online (<italic>a</italic>) convenience characteristic of shopping channels, (<italic>b</italic>) product type characteristics and (<italic>c</italic>) perceived price of the product. Results indicate that convenience and product type influences consumer intention to engage in online shopping. When consumers perceive offline shopping as inconvenient, their intention to shop online is greater. Also, online shopping intention is higher when consumers perceive the product to be search goods than experience goods.</p>
<p>Andrew J. Rohm and Vanitha Swaminathan (2004) developed a typology based upon motivations for shopping online. An analysis of these motives, including online convenience, physical store orientation (for example, immediate possession and social contact), information use in planning and shopping and variety seeking in the online shopping context suggests the existence of four shopping types. These four types are labelled as convenience shoppers, variety seekers, balanced buyers and store-oriented shoppers. The convenience shopper is more motivated by convenience. The variety seeker is substantially more motivated by variety seeking across retail alternatives and product types and brands than any other shopping type. Balanced buyers are moderately motivated by convenience and variety seeking. The store-oriented shoppers are more motivated by physical store orientation.</p>
<p>To study the role of website attributes in online shopping, Ming Hui Huang (2003) identifies Web attributes, their direct impacts on experiential flow and their direct and indirect impacts on the utilitarian and hedonic aspects of Web performance. The results presented supported the proposal that, as an information-laden medium, a successful website must be able to use its attributes to satisfy both the information and entertainment needs of users.</p>
<p>Online advertising helps in creating Word of Mouth. Bronner and De Hoog (2010) analysed the impact of e-WOM (electronic word of mouth) in consumer decision making process. They coined a term e-fluentials for the opinion leaders and experts who give expert advice regarding different products and services online. The research concluded that e-WOM reinforces the consumer decision making process and e-WOM in consumer generated websites deal with the more positive aspects of products and services rather than the negative ones, this result was however contrary to the one hypothesised.</p>
<p>To understand social networks which is another dimension of Internet marketing. Doyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483515">2007</xref>) presented a social network analyses which focused on identifying the most important factors which makes consumers confident to make a purchase decision. The results of the study were based on case studies from fashion retail and online surveys. The study indicates that companies should focus on identifying opinion leaders in social networks and these opinion leaders will act as advocates of companies’ product offerings and reinforce positive word of mouth in the future.</p>
<p>Another external dimension in consumer decision making process is information search Rutz &amp; Bucklin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2319510X13483515">2011</xref>) emphasised that in Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are generic (for example, ‘hotels’) or branded (for example, ‘Hilton Hotels’). The authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric. The findings have implications for understanding search behaviour on the Internet and the management of paid search advertising. Taylor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483515">2011</xref>) presents research on Internet advertising, which examines consumer attitudes towards advertising presented on social media by users of those media. It was found that consumers reacted most favourably to advertising which was perceived as offering entertainment or information value. According to Edelman, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2319510X13483515">2010</xref>) Digital marketers think of themselves as publishers of online content, recognise digital marketing as a means to acquire advocates for their brands and invest in ways such as monitoring consumers to gain knowledge about them in order to provide them with a satisfying sales experience.</p>
<p>To study security and privacy concerns is another dimension of Internet marketing. Anthony D. Miyazaki and Ana Fernandez (2001) identify risk perceptions regarding Internet privacy and security for both new and experienced users of Internet technology. They explored risk perceptions among consumers of varying levels of Internet experience and how these perceptions relate to online shopping activity.</p>
<p>Patrick &amp; Massey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483515">2002</xref>) analysed the impact of different cultures and ethnic origins of people on the online buying behaviour. They conducted a survey in Hong Kong and U.S and identified four major factors (Social communication, E-commerce, Hobby, Information search) related to the use of Internet among people of Hong Kong and the US. The results showed that people in Hong Kong are more inclined towards Social communication and the US population was more inclined towards information search as the main purpose of Internet usage. Hence this study showed that different cultures have different attitudes towards the Internet and these implications can be used by marketers to design websites according to different ethnic groups and countries as the different purposes of use may lead to different impressions of the same websites.</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>From the literature supporting Internet as a tool for marketing for companies worldwide and the impact on consumer’s decision making and buying behaviour it was evident that further research is required in this field to better analyse the effect of Internet marketing which is a growing phenomenon in both B2B and B2C businesses. Although the users of Internet are growing day by day and companies are turning to the non-traditional medium of marketing through the Internet rather than completely relying on the ‘Brick and Mortar’ business model, the impact of Internet marketing varies from industry to industry and there is a lack of proper research in terms of consumers belonging to different demographics. The research work especially in the Indian context is not very intense which opens a huge opportunity to further do research on this subject from the context of Indian consumers.</p>

<p>From the reviewed literature a model was developed to better understand the independent and dependent variables and how they interact. The figure below was derived after a detailed literature review and will be used as a basis for the exploratory study. The model identifies Internet marketing as the independent variable and consumer buying behaviour as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>According to the figure the buying behaviour of consumers depend upon various intrinsic factors and extrinsic cues. The intrinsic factors include the different motivations consumers have to shop online which also depends upon the type of product or service they want to purchase, the varying demographic profiles of consumers also impact the purchase pattern of different products and services in the web environment. An individual’s need, motivations, personality, lifestyle and attitude also influences his buying behaviour and decision making.</p>
<p>Apart from the intrinsic factors the buying behaviour is often governed by many extrinsic cues which are usually marketer generated and include the various marketing strategies and tools which they employ. The research aims at identifying these intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence a consumer’s purchase behaviour online and sometimes also reciprocated while shopping at brick and mortar establishments.</p>

<title>Sampling Design</title>
<p>Keeping in mind the time and resource constraints the sample size estimated taking into account the samples used in various researches of small (similar) magnitude, the sample size is estimated to be 200 respondents. A structured questionnaire was prepared and validated by various professors and academicians. A pilot survey was conducted on a small sample of 20 respondents to ensure the feasibility of the questionnaire. After making certain adjustments the final research instrument was formed.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consists of 19 statements on a 5-point Likert scale and also a set of dichotomous and multiple choice questions. The data was collected using judgmental sampling approach wherein 220 questionnaires were mailed to a pre decided list of respondents based on different demographic variables such as age, income and gender to get a better representation from each group. The questionnaires were validated for redundancies and an effective sample of 200 respondents was selected after rejecting 20 questionnaires.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The primary research focused on certain factors which were derived after an in-depth review of literature. A factor analysis was performed for the purpose of dimension reduction which reduces the number of factors by clubbing them together to further refine the results and give us a better understanding of the most important factors in the research.</p>

<title>Reliability</title>
<p>The <bold>Cronbach’s Alpha</bold> model was applied to know the reliability of the data collected through the Likert scale. A score of 0.6 and above is considered to be reliable. A score of 0.702 shows that the data collected through the Likert scale is reliable, that is, data is consistent and worthy of reliance or trust. A reliability of .0702 means that about more than half of the variance of the observed score is attributable to truth and less than half is attributable to error. It can also be said that a reliability of .702 means the variability is about 70 per cent true ability and 30 per cent error. Hence the research can be carried out on this data set.</p>

<sec id="section10-2319510X13483515">
<title>Sample Adequacy</title>
<p>The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy is an index used to examine the appropriateness of factor analysis. High values (between 0.5 and 1.0) indicate factor analysis is appropriate. Values below 0.5 imply that factor analysis may not be appropriate. A set of 19 statements describe various factors which were considered to be important in influencing consumer buying behaviour. These were subjected to principal component analysis using <bold>Varimax</bold> rotation method with Kaiser normalisation in order to reduce the multiplicity of variables into selected factors. But before the factor analysis it is important to consider the values of KMO measure of sample adequacy. The research sample showed a score of 0.741, which is greater than 0.5 which suggests that the data is adequate for factor analysis.</p>

<p>The above table indicates that 19 statements were reduced to 7 factors which explained 71.091 per cent of cumulative variance. The variance reflects considerable contribution of these factors on influencing consumer buying behaviour online. In other words 71.091 per cent of the behaviour of consumers in choosing products online is due to these 7 intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The first factor has an Eigen value of 2.339 and since it is greater than 1.0 it explains more variance than a single factor. The percentage of variance explained by this factor is 12.312 per cent. The second factor has Eigen value of 2.232 and it explains 11.748 per cent of variance. The third factor has an Eigen value of 2.069 and it explains 10.889 per cent of the variance. The fourth factor has Eigen value of 1.964 and it explains 10.339 per cent of variance. The fifth factor has Eigen value of 1.786 and it explains 9.398 per cent of variance. The sixth factor has Eigen value of 1.538 and it explains 8.329 per cent of variance. The seventh factor has Eigen value of 1.535 and it explains 8.080 per cent of variance.</p>

<p>The above table shows the factor loadings of different factors according to which they were clubbed together. A total of 19 statements were reduced into 7 factors:</p>
<p>The above table shows the loading of factor C1. Three factors with positive loadings were chosen which indicate that these variables share most of their variances between them and thereby co-vary with each other. The factor identified is ‘Need for Stimulation’ which means that respondents feel that shopping outside caters to their recreational needs and online shopping is not a means to satisfy their recreational needs. This means that consumer buying behaviour online is also influenced by inner motivation of individuals. An individual whose recreational needs are higher will not enjoy shopping online as convenience takes a back seat in their case whereas if a person feels that convenience and time is more important for him then they will be more inclined towards online shopping. For these individuals, the sales personnel play a driving force to shop. They tend to communicate more with these sales personnel to clear their doubts before purchasing. They are highly dependent on feeling the product by touching it or seeing it before buying. Since these elements are missing in online shopping, so these shopper depend on outside shopping to meet their recreational needs.</p>

<p>The second factor combines two statements which can together be put into the category of ‘Security Concerns’ which is another intrinsic variable. According to this factor online payments and personal information are the prime security concerns of the customers which dictate their online shopping motivations. Identity theft is still a concern for consumers when hackers break into a merchant’s web site and steal names, addresses and credit card numbers. Phishing is another danger, where consumers are fooled into thinking they are dealing with a reputable retailer, when they have actually been manipulated into feeding private information to a system operated by a malicious party. People with an orthodox mindset may hesitate while online shopping due to their privacy and security concerns whereas more techno-savvy people may find it a routine thing to shop online without any hesitations.</p>
<p>The above factor signifies that people usually search for a lot of information before making any purchase online if a product is high involvement. The relevant internal psychological process that is associated with information search is perception. Perception is defined as ‘the process by which an individual receives, selects, organizes, and interprets information to create a meaningful picture of the world’. Consumers’ tendency to search for information on goods and services makes it possible for researchers to forecast the purchasing plans of consumers using brief descriptions of the products of interest. After information search the consumer compares the brands and products that are in their evoked set. They read online reviews and seek expert opinion before making a purchase. Once the alternatives have been evaluated, the consumer is ready to make a purchase decision. This can be predicated to the fact that during online shopping people cannot actually see the products in person so they have to rely on opinions and information available from various sources such as online reviews and blogs written by experts.</p>
<p>The abovementioned factors can be clubbed into the factor ‘Online Advertising’ which primarily include online banner ads, pop-up ads and marketing through e-mail. These factors also impact the consumers buying behaviour. The online consumer’s attention is grabbed with the help of these online advertising tools. It is considered as a good source of information and helps them in their purchasing decision. E-mail marketing also includes sales promotion schemes such as discounts and coupons which are also an important aspect which influences the consumers to use the online medium for shopping. Most of the companies are doing direct marketing via emails. Personalised emails are sent by companies to its online consumer in order to coax them to shop online. The results however showed that people are not very open to receiving emails which can be seen through the low factor loading score in case of e-mail marketing.</p>
<p>The below factors can be clubbed into a factor ‘convenience’ which implies that Internet makes comparisons easier of different brands and also it saves time and effort. ‘Click and Shop’ provides the online shoppers a wide variety merchandise of different brands which help them to compare. Also the door to door delivery saves time and efforts of these shoppers. Peer pressure plays a significant role for online shoppers. A positive word of mouth spread by the peer helps in buying decision. Consumers also find it more convenient to depend on family and friends’ opinions and consider them more important than industry experts and family judgments are given more priority than others.</p>

<p>The factor C6 talks about the company’s website and its interface which also has an impact on consumers buying behaviour. A website which does not have ease of navigation and is not informative or attractive will result in lower traffic on the website thereby reducing the number of prospective customers. Consumers while shopping online usually visit the company’s website if they want to purchase a product offered by their company and it becomes very important to have an informative website with price comparisons and specifications of the products which makes it easier for consumers to decide whether to purchase that particular product or not. Also the website must be interactive enough so that the consumer is persuaded to make the purchase.</p>
<p>The last factor extracted can be termed as ‘Social Networking’. It helps in spreading the information about the product by creating awareness about the brand. Consumers are heavily influenced by social networking websites and the information posted on them. Company fan-pages and information shared by people on these websites also influence consumer perception about the company and its products and also the people associated with the company. E-wom (Electronic word of mouth) is also a very important factor which means that people get highly influenced by the opinions posted by people online which in-turn influences their buying behaviour.</p>

<p>The below table shows a one-way ANOVA to test the hypothesis, ‘<italic>There is no significant difference in the importance assigned to various dimensions influencing consumer buying behaviour between people belonging to different income groups’</italic>. A mean score tending towards 1 implies that the dimension holds high importance in consumer’s buying behaviour or purchase decisions. For people with annual income below 4 Lac per annum, need for recreation is the most influential factor in governing their buying behaviour. This implies that people with income less than 4 Lac consider shopping as a means of recreation and they prefer shopping at stores rather than online. For the respondents with income more than 4 Lac per annum, Convenience is the most influential factor in shaping their buying behaviour.</p>
<p>At a significance level of 95 per cent (.05) a sig score of greater than .05 implies that we cannot reject the null hypothesis. The above table shows that for the dimensions (need for recreation, security concerns, information search and convenience) the significance value is less than 0.05 which implies that we cannot accept the null hypothesis and there is a significant different in the importance assigned to these 4 dimensions in the buying behaviour of people belonging to different income groups. For all the remaining factors (Advertising and promotions, website attributes and social networking) the significance value is greater than 0.05 which means that there is no significant difference in the importance of these factors in the buying behaviour of people belonging to different income groups.</p>

<p>The below table shows a one-way ANOVA to test the hypothesis ‘<italic>There is no significant difference in the importance assigned to various dimensions influencing consumer buying behaviour between people belonging to different age groups</italic>’. For people below the age of 20, need for recreation is the most influential factor in governing their buying behaviour. This age group comprises mainly of the school going students or teenagers who consider shopping to be a recreational activity and hence prefer shopping at stores rather than online. For the respondents between the age of 20 to 25, information search is the most influential factors in shaping their buying behaviour. This implies that for these consumers information available from various sources such as blogs and websites is the most important factor while deciding upon purchasing a product. They search for a lot of information and the availability of information influences their buying behaviour online. The information on blogs, company webpages and online reviews are the most influential in their purchase decisions. For the age group 25–30 years, convenience is the most important dimension and the possible reason behind this could be the initial work pressure when the individual has started off his professional career. The lack of time makes convenience a very important factor for this age group. People belonging to this age group are most likely to shop online on a regular basis.</p>
<p>At a significance level of 95 per cent (.05) a sig score of greater than .05 implies that we cannot reject the null hypothesis. The above table shows apart from the dimension (Website attributes) the significance value is less than 0.05 which implies that we cannot accept the null hypothesis and there is a significant difference in the importance assigned to these six dimensions in the buying behaviour of people belonging to different age groups. For the factors (Website Attributes) the significance value is greater than 0.05 which means that there is no significant difference in the importance of these factors in the buying behaviour of people belonging to different age groups.</p>
<p>The below table shows independent samples T-Test to test the first hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the mean of the seven factors in influencing the buying behaviour of males and females. If the significance value is greater than .05 (95 per cent confidence level) we cannot reject the null hypothesis which implies that there is no significant difference among the mean scores of the factors influencing buying behaviour of males and females. According to the mean values convenience is the most important factor for males and need for recreation is the most influential with respect to the female consumer buying behaviour.</p>

<p>From the above table we can conclude that in case of ‘need for recreation, convenience, social networking and online advertising and promotions’ there is a significant difference among the mean scores of these factors which influence the buying behaviour of males and females, whereas for all other dimensions ‘security concerns, information searching and website attributes’(sig &lt; 0.5) there is no significant difference among the mean scores of males and females for these factors.</p>

<title>Results and Discussions</title>
<p>The above analysis shows that a total of seven factors were extracted after conducting a factor analysis and each of these seven factors impact the consumer’s buying behaviour to a different extent.</p>
<p>The factors identified were: Need for Recreation, Information Search, Security and Privacy concerns, Convenience, Online Advertising, Website attributes and Social Media.</p>
<p>The new refined model was developed based on the analysis to understand the factors which influence consumer’s buying behaviour.</p>
<list id="list3-2319510X13483515" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The refined model shows that consumer’s buying behaviour is more internally driven and extrinsic factors have lesser impact than the intrinsic factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intrinsic factors like convenience influences consumers to purchase online.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Need for recreation is another factor which signifies the hedonic needs of the consumers. If a consumer has high level of hedonic needs and likes going out for shopping will most likely avoid shopping online.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Security concerns also have an impact on consumer’s purchase behaviour but from the analysis it was shown that from the mean value scores which was closer to 3 which correspond to a neutral value on the Likert scale. This implies that even-though security concerns impact consumer’s behaviour online but it does not become a predominant reason of not purchasing products online.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Convenience is one of the major factors which govern the consumer’s behaviour in purchasing online. The age group of above 25 years showed a greater affinity toward convenience which may be due to the fact that working people get very less time to their disposal as compared to college going students which had a greater need for recreation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Social Networking and information searching also plays an important role in buying behaviour. Social networking leads to electronic word of mouth and dissemination of information which influences the purchase intentions of consumers who look for such information. Males show more information searching behaviour and females are more prone to be influenced by electronic word of mouth on social networking websites.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Online advertising and promotions have higher impact on females as compared to males and also the age group below 25 years is more influenced by online banner ads and promotional offers than people above 25 years of age.</p></list-item>

<p>It can be concluded that these seven factors are the major influencers of consumer’s buying behaviour online but the impact of each varies from one another and also people having different demographic profiles are influenced differently by these seven factors. Companies should focus more on social network marketing and improving their website attributes as compared to online banner ads and pop-ups which grab attention of consumers but do influence consumer’s buying behaviour to a large extent. Marketers should disseminate more information through non-traditional mediums such as consumer testimonials or find brand advocates among the consumers and encourage them in spreading positive word of mouth specially targeted towards females.</p>
<p>Information about the products should be regularly sent to prospective customers. This can be done through identifying consumers who are interested in products offered by the company by content analysis of social groups and interest groups on various websites.</p>
<p>Convenience was a major factor in consumer’s buying behaviour so companies should aim at making Internet shopping more convenient by allowing facilities like COD (Cash on delivery) and product customisation and video demos online so that consumers can judge the product attributes better without seeing them in person. The need for recreation also influences consumers to shop via brick and mortar channel. Companies can design their websites in such a way that it becomes a shopping experience rather than merely a business transaction. For example, Design the website like an actual store with shelves of products and animated sales personnel to guide the consumers.</p>
<p>Taking these insights from the research companies can look at marketing from a different perspective and realise that the consumer is more informed and educated and a relationship with the consumers does not end at a mere business transaction.</p>
