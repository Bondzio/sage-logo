In an evidence- based crime policy model, the source of scientific evidence is empirical research in the form of evaluations of programs, practices, and policies. Randomized experiments and high-quality quasi-experimental research designs provide the strongest test of the effectiveness of crime and justice programs and policy interventions. For this special issue of Evaluation Review, we will be seeking papers that advance cutting-edge experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation techniques in criminology and criminal justice. We are particularly interested in papers focused on improving the measurement of outcomes in randomized experiments, applying statistical matching techniques and regression discontinuity designs in quasi-experimental evaluations, and developing other advances in controlled evaluation methodology and statistical modeling.</p><p>To be considered, submissions must be received no later than June 15, 2013.  Papers can be submitted at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/erx</p><p>Submissions will be peer-reviewed and appear in print in early 2014.</p></body></article>
