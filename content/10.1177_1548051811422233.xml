<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of leader–member exchange (LMX) quality on in-role job performance and the moderating effect of learning organization culture in a Korean conglomerate. The results indicate that LMX quality had a significant impact on employees’ job performance as rated by their supervisors. In addition, although no direct relationship was found to be significant, the moderating effects of the two dimensions of learning organization culture on the relationship between LMX quality and in-role job performance were significant. With regards to the demographic variables, male employees received higher ratings on their job performance reviews as assessed by their supervisors. Finally, implications, limitations, and research recommendations are discussed.</p>

<p>Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051811422233">Drucker (1988)</xref> predicted the growth of a knowledge economy and the importance of knowledge workers and foresaw that tomorrow’s organizations would be flatter, information based, and organized around teams in response to competitive challenges. After two decades, his argument has become reality. The resulting flat organizations and employee empowerment, however, might decrease interaction opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811422233">Erdogan, Liden, &amp; Kraimer, 2006</xref>). Organizations need supportive leadership, including coaching and mentoring rather than directive leadership. Nevertheless, the type of leadership style that creates caring and trust may differ across organizations since leadership is contingent on culture (Yukl, 1989), and organizations and societies are characterized by different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811422233">Erdogan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The major influential factors related to job performance can be found in the aspects of social and organizational cultural contexts, but leadership is one of the most critical factors affecting individual job performance. In particular, the relationship between employees and supervisors plays an important role in individual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811422233">Elkins &amp; Keller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811422233">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811422233">Maslyn &amp; Uhl-Bien, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811422233">Wayne, Shore, &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated that leader–member exchange (LMX) quality is positively related to support and creates a sense of obligation in individuals, who then reciprocate through higher levels of performance.</p>
<p>The foundational context to transfer learning to performance is learning organization culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051811422233">Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1997</xref>) because a desirable learning culture may affect diverse organizational issues, such as leaders’ behaviors as well as job characteristics to produce positive organizational outcomes. All these factors are critical for improving employees’ job performance, so there is a need for greater focus on understanding the mechanisms through which social and organizational contexts influence employees’ job performance.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051811422233">
<title>Problem Statement</title>
<p>In the fields of human resources (HR) and organization development (OD), in-role job performance is one of the most frequently used variables along with satisfaction, performance, change, and innovation. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the quality of LMX and culture for learning organization on employee job performance. Although these constructs are important in the fields of HR and OD, more research is needed to explore their relationship. Although numerous studies have explored LMX quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811422233">Liden, Sparrowe, &amp; Wayne, 1997</xref>) and learning organization culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811422233">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051811422233">Yang, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051811422233">2005</xref>), little research has identified the influence of LMX quality as it relates to individual characteristics and the influence on in-role job performance of learning organization culture as it relates to organizational factors.</p>
<p>Another constraint is that few researchers have examined the moderating role of learning organization culture on the relationships between LMX quality and in-role job performance. Although the concept of learning organization culture has received increasing attention in the fields of HR and OD, one of the most critical issues has been the lack of practical and validated measurement tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051811422233">Holton, Bates, &amp; Ruona, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811422233">Lim &amp; Morris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051811422233">Song, Joo, &amp; Chermack, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051811422233">Yang, Watkins, &amp; Marsick, 2004</xref>). Until <italic>the</italic> Dimensions of Learning Organization Questionnaire (DLOQ) was developed, there had been little knowledge about how to adequately measure the learning organization culture as a supportive system for the organizational learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051811422233">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). This study fills this research gap, focusing on the role of LMX quality as an antecedent of in-role job performance and the moderating effect of learning organization culture.</p>

<title>Research Purpose and Questions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of LMX quality on in-role job performance and the moderating effect of learning organization culture on the relationship. This study provides a theoretical contribution by linking job performance research with learning organization and LMX research. The research questions for this study are (a) What is the relationship between LMX quality and in-role job performance? and (b) What is the role of the seven dimensions of learning organization culture (i.e., continuous learning, embedded system, system connection, strategic leadership, dialogue and inquiry, team learning, and empowerment) on the relationship between LMX quality and in-role job performance?</p>
<p>The following sections describe the theoretical framework and hypotheses and research methods, including data collection and measures. Next, research findings are summarized based on a hierarchical multiple regression. Finally, the implications, limitations, and future research areas are discussed.</p>
<sec id="section3-1548051811422233">
<title>The Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The concept of in-role job performance is based on activities related to formal tasks, duties, and responsibilities, which are outlined in a job description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051811422233">Williams &amp; Anderson, 1991</xref>). In contrast, extra-role performance refers to behaviors that are also critical for achieving performance but are discretionary in nature, such as politely relating to coworkers, helping others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051811422233">Moorman, Niehoff, &amp; Organ, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051811422233">Organ, 1988</xref>), or generating a new idea. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051811422233">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the research model of this study. The set of antecedents for this research model includes LMX quality in the social context and learning organization culture in the organizational context. These constructs influence in-role job performance.</p>

<title>Leader–Member Exchange Quality</title>
<p>LMX quality refers to the quality of the interpersonal exchange relationship between an employee and his or her supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>). LMX theory focuses on the social exchange processes embedded in the leader–subordinate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051811422233">Dansereau, Cashman, &amp; Graen, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051811422233">Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811422233">Graen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Cashman, 1975</xref>) and conceptualizes the process that is centered on the interactions between leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811422233">Northouse, 2004</xref>). Unique working relationships are formed between leaders and each of their subordinates. These social exchanges can be further described in terms of three stages: (a) initial testing, including evaluation of motive, attitudes, resources, and role expectations; (b) development of mutual trust, loyalty, and respect; and (c) development of mutual commitment to organizational or unit goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>According to LMX theory, the quality of exchange relationships between leaders and subordinates influences a number of important organizational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>). LMX quality determines the amount of physical or mental effort, material resources, information, and social support exchanged between the leader and the follower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811422233">Liden et al., 1997</xref>). For example, leaders in high-quality LMX relationships rely heavily on subordinates to act in their stead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051811422233">Dunegan, Duchon, &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1992</xref>) and encourage the subordinates to undertake more responsible activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811422233">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>). Thus, subordinates in such relationships interact frequently with their leaders and have their leaders’ support, confidence, encouragement, and consideration. They also take on added duties or expend extra effort to achieve work group goals beyond contractual or transactional expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811422233">Sparrowe &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811422233">Wayne et al., 1997</xref>). In a meta-analysis of LMX quality in many different contexts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811422233">Gerstner and Day (1997)</xref> found that LMX quality is related to subordinates’ satisfaction with their supervisors, including overall satisfaction, performance (supervisors’ ratings and objective measures), commitment, role conflict, role clarity, member competence, and turnover intentions.</p>

<title>Leader–Member Exchange Quality and In-Role Job Performance</title>
<p>LMX quality plays an important role in individual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811422233">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). Previous research has demonstrated that LMX is positively related to support and give individuals a sense of obligation to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811422233">Maslyn &amp; Uhl-Bien, 2001</xref>), which leads to higher levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811422233">Wayne et al., 1997</xref>). Some researchers have argued that one of the most important initial aspects of the exchange relationship is subordinates’ performance based on supervisors’ requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811422233">Elkins &amp; Keller, 2003</xref>). Subordinates’ reactions to those requests can influence perceptions of trustworthiness and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811422233">House &amp; Aditya, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies of supervisory encouragement have pointed to the role of project managers or direct supervisors, particularly in the areas of goal clarity, open interaction between the supervisor and subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051811422233">Kimberly &amp; Evanisko, 1981</xref>), and supervisor support of a team’s work and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811422233">Organ, 1990</xref>). It is likely that open supervisory interactions and perceived supervisor support are related to performance through the same mechanisms that are associated with fair, supportive evaluation. Therefore, it is likely that the higher the quality of LMX, the higher the employees’ performance will be.</p>

<sec id="section6-1548051811422233">
<title>Learning Organization Culture</title>
<p>Interest in learning organizations as the source of organizational success and competitive advantage has been a strong focus in the fields of HR and OD in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811422233">Ellinger, Ellinger, Yang, &amp; Howton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051811422233">Leonard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051811422233">Tsang, 1997</xref>). Previous studies have found that having a learning organization culture is a key contextual component for enhancing positive organizational outcomes. Learning organization culture is defined as an organization that is skilled at creating, collecting, and connecting knowledge, and at changing its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051811422233">Garvin, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811422233">Marsick and Watkins (2003)</xref> argued that climate and cultural aspects involve complicated components, including leadership, a learning process, and other supportive systematic factors. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051811422233">Watkins and Marsick’s (1997)</xref> integrative dimensions of learning organizations, there are seven action imperatives for a learning organization: (a) create continuous learning opportunities, (b) promote inquiry and dialogue, (c) encourage collaboration and team learning, (d) establish systems to capture and share learning, (e) empower people to have a collective vision, (f) connect the organization to the environment, and (g) use strategic leaders who model and support learning at the individual, team, and organization levels.</p>
<p>Despite considerable discussion about the close link between LMX quality and in-role job performance, few researchers have examined the moderating role of a learning organization culture. In his recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811422233">Joo (2010)</xref> found that employees exhibited the highest organizational commitment when they perceived a higher learning culture and when they were supervised in a supportive fashion. In his study, 43% of the variance in organizational commitment was explained by learning organization culture and LMX quality. Thus, a perceived learning organization culture and LMX quality affected organizational commitment, which, in turn, contributed positively to employees’ turnover intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811422233">Joo, 2010</xref>). As a distal antecedent, therefore, learning organization culture is likely to positively influence the relationship between LMX and job performance, such that the more employees who perceive an organization as providing continuous learning opportunities, empowerment, system connection, and strategic leadership, the more likely they will be to exhibit higher in-role job performance.</p>
<list id="list2-1548051811422233" list-type="simple">

<title>Method</title>
<p>In this section, the sample and data collection procedures are described along with information about the four measures. Finally, the analytical strategy will be briefly discussed.</p>
<sec id="section8-1548051811422233">
<title>Sample and Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Five companies in one of the largest Korean conglomerates, including two <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 500 companies, participated in this study. As conglomerates, they represent diverse industries: manufacturing (oil and gas and chemical), construction, trading, and telecommunications. The HR managers in each company selected participants following the provided guidelines, and sent them an e-mail request for participation. A self-administered online survey was used to obtain individual perceptions. Approximately 13,400 employees were employed in these five companies. The number sampled from each company ranged from 50 to 200 dyads, depending on the number of full-time employees. More specifically, for example, companies with more than 2,000 employees were assigned 200 dyads for the sample. We suggested a general guideline for sampling, focused on two criteria: job type and hierarchical-position level. HR managers in each company distributed questionnaires to 900 dyads through e-mail base on the guideline. Whereas 51% (463) of employees responded, the supervisors’ response rate was 38% (340). And the response rate of the matched dyadic data was only 19% (164). Having supervisors rate, the job performance of their employees is most commonly used in field studies to eliminate single-source bias and to increase validity. Thus, this study was based on the supervisors’ ratings of job performance. The small sample (<italic>N</italic> &lt; 200) and the low response rate (RR &lt; 20%) are not unusual for the studies using dyadic data, including many LMX studies.</p>
<p>The demographic variables included (a) gender, (b) age, (c) education level, (d) hierarchical level, (e) type of job, and (f) length of a leader–follower relationship. Among the respondents, 147 were male (90%), and 17 were female (10%). With regard to age, 34% of the participants were 29 years or younger; 52% were between 30 and 39 years old; 13% were between 40 and 49 years old; and only 1% were 50 years or older. In terms of educational level, 77% of the respondents held 4-year college degrees and 17% held graduate degrees. About 29% of the respondents were in marketing/sales, 32% in support functions (e.g., planning, finance, HR, etc.), and 26% were in engineering, production, research, and development jobs. The length of the relationship with the current supervisor was as follows: less than 1 year, 42%; between 1 and 2 years, 28%; between 2 and 3 years, 11%; between 3 and 5 years, 12%; and more than 5 years, 8%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1548051811422233">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The instruments were prepared for use in Korea using appropriate translation–back-translation procedures. To ensure validity in the process of translation, the researcher had a bilingual expert translate the survey questions into Korean, and another bilingual expert translated it back into English in order to establish an accurate translation of the questionnaire. Differences were reviewed and inappropriate Korean words and translations were revised. The survey questionnaire used a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1548051811422233">
<title>In-role job performance</title>
<p>In-role job performance was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051811422233">Podsakoff and MacKenzie’s (1989)</xref> five-item scale. In their study, the immediate supervisor of the respondent indicated the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with five statements about the quality and quantity of the respondents’ in-role activities. The reliability coefficient was .85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811422233">Janssen &amp; Van Yperen, 2004</xref>). The reliability in the present study was .88. A sample item was, “This employee always completes the duties specified in the job description.”</p>

<sec id="section11-1548051811422233">
<title>LMX quality</title>
<p>LMX quality was measured using a seven-item LMX scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051811422233">Scandura and Graen (1984)</xref>. It assessed the degree to which supervisors and subordinates have mutual respect for each other’s capabilities, feel a deepening sense of reciprocal trust, and have a strong sense of obligation to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051811422233">Scandura &amp; Graen, 1984</xref>). Scandura and Graen reported reliability coefficient alphas of .86 and .84 at two different times in the same study. The internal consistency reliability was .87 in this study. A sample item was “My supervisor understands my job problems and needs very well.”</p>

<sec id="section12-1548051811422233">
<title>Learning organization culture</title>
<p>To measure the learning organization culture, this study used the DLOQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051811422233">Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1997</xref>). Instead of the original 42-item model, the 21-item shortened version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051811422233">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) was used in this study. Although the overall reliability was .95 in this study, the reliabilities of each dimension ranged from .68 to .80.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the study are reported in four parts. First, the construct validity of each measurement model was examined using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) followed by the descriptive statistics, correlations, and reliabilities of the reduced measurement model analyses. Next, the hierarchical multiple regression model was tested, and the results of the hypothesis testing were addressed. The CFA was based on the covariance matrix and used maximum likelihood estimation as implemented in LISREL 8.8. Descriptive statistics, correlations, reliabilities, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were conducted, using SPSS 17.0.</p>
<sec id="section14-1548051811422233">
<title>Measurement Model Assessment</title>
<p>An overall CFA was conducted to estimate the quality of the factor structure and designated factor loadings by statistically testing the fit between a proposed measurement model and the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051811422233">Yang, 2005</xref>). The CFA was used to estimate the convergent and discriminate validity of the indicators of the three constructs: in-role job performance, LMX quality, and learning organization culture. The goodness-of-fit indices used in this study include chi-square(χ<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), nonnormed fit index (NNFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).</p>
<p>As a result of the CFA, the overall measurement model indicated a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(149) = 441.81; <italic>p</italic> = .00; RMSEA = .01; NNFI = .93; CFI = .94; SRMR = .06. The relatively high RMSEA is because of the small sample size since the RMSEA is best suited when samples are larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051811422233">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548051811422233">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the factor loadings of the measurement model.

<title>Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses of this study, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051811422233">Table 2</xref> illustrates the results of hierarchical multiple regression. In Step 1, the demographic variables, including gender, age, education, hierarchical level, and the length of the leader–follower relationship were controlled. Among the demographic variables, gender was found to be significant. More specifically, male employees had significantly higher in-role job performance. In Step 2, the main effect of LMX quality explained an additional 6% of the variance in in-role job performance. In Step 3, as a result of entering a second main effect, the seven dimensions of learning organization culture, the adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was decreased by 1%. None of these dimensions were significant. Finally, in Step 4, the moderation effects of the dimensions of learning organization culture on the relationship between LMX quality and in-role job performance were examined. The results indicated that the two learning culture dimensions significantly moderated the relationship, explaining an additional 4% of the variance in in-role job performance. More specifically, having an embedded system and strategic leadership significantly moderated the relationship between LMX quality and in-role job performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548051811422233">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548051811422233">4</xref>).</p>

<p>The findings of this study are discussed and compared with previous research. Then, the implications of this study for research and practice in the fields of HR and OD are mentioned. Next, the limitations of this study and recommendations for future research are discussed. Finally, some concluding remarks follow.</p>
<sec id="section18-1548051811422233">
<title>Key Findings of this Study</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that LMX quality and learning organization culture have a modest but positive and significant relationship with in-role job performance. Additionally, the moderation effects of learning organization culture were significant. More detailed findings are discussed below.</p>
<p>The first finding is that employees exhibited higher in-role job performance when they had higher LMX quality and learning organization culture. Overall, 17% of the variance in in-role job performance was explained by the above factors. Thus, as supported by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811422233">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811422233">Maslyn &amp; Uhl-Bien, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811422233">Wayne et al., 1997</xref>), LMX quality was found to play an important role in individual performance in the Korean cultural setting. In terms of effect size, LMX quality (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .06) was stronger than learning organization culture (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = −.01).</p>
<p>Another finding is that although no dimensions of learning organizational culture turned out to be directly related to in-role job performance, two of them (i.e., an embedded system and strategic leadership) had significant moderation effects on the relationship between the level of LMX quality and the level of in-role job performance. With regard to the first moderation effect, when employees perceived higher LMX, they tended to have higher ratings in job performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548051811422233">Figure 3</xref>). The low LMX group exhibited low in-role job performance, regardless of the level of embedded system; however, the impact of LMX was stronger for the high embedded system group. Thus, this finding implies that embedded system can play a catalytic role in increasing in-role job performance. It is noted that when an organization lacks appropriate systems that support learning, job performance can hardly be enhanced in spite of the leader’s support.</p>
<p>As for the moderation effect of strategic leadership on the relationship between LMX and in-role job performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548051811422233">Figure 4</xref>), employees with a higher LMX demonstrated higher in-role job performance. Employees in the high strategic leadership group tended to perceive high in-role job performance, even if they perceived a low level of LMX. For those with low strategic leadership, the effect of LMX was greater. To help employees who perceive themselves as lacking LMX dramatically increase their level of in-role job performance, firms should establish systems that capture and share learning and use strategic leaders who model and support learning at the individual, team, and organization levels.</p>
<p>In this study, the effect size of the moderation effects was relatively large (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .04). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811422233">Evans (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811422233">Mellor (1992)</xref> have argued, even a 1% increase in Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is not trivial, especially when researchers create a directional hypothesis to anticipate the moderation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811422233">Mellor, 1992</xref>). As such, the results of this study indicate the importance of considering the moderation effect when investigating the hypothesized relationship.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>With regard to the theoretical contributions, this study links leadership, learning organization, and job performance research. As previous research has demonstrated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811422233">Elkins &amp; Keller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811422233">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811422233">House &amp; Aditya, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051811422233">Kimberly &amp; Evanisko, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811422233">Maslyn &amp; Uhl-Bien, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811422233">Organ, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051811422233">Wayne et al., 1997</xref>), we also found that LMX quality plays an important role in individual performance. Although numerous studies have investigated the relationship between LMX and job performance, few researchers have explored the moderating role of learning organization culture. This study reinforces the critical catalytic role of learning organization culture (i.e., embedded system and strategic leadership) on the relationship between LMX and in-role job performance.</p>
<p>It is difficult to create a learning organization without supportive leadership in the organization. Managers can encourage their subordinates to increase job performance by establishing a learning organization system and by providing supportive strategic leadership. In particular, HR and OD professionals can help managers by building better learning organization cultures and by developing effective managerial skills. The practical implications for HR and OD professionals who develop relevant practices for the purpose of enhancing in-role job performance are suggested below.</p>
<p>First, leaders can help people create a collective vision toward which the entire organization can work in a learning organization (Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1993). Leaders can model, champion, and support learning; leadership uses learning strategically for business results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811422233">Marsick &amp; Watkins, 2003</xref>). As an important role of HR and OD professionals is to develop managers and supervisors, HR and OD professionals could establish environments that increase supportive leadership to improve in-role job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051811422233">McLean, 2006</xref>). For instance, HR and OD professionals can help managers adopt new roles as coaches, mentors, and facilitators by providing relevant training programs and supporting developmental relationships. <italic>Manager-as-coach</italic> refers to a process for improving problematic work performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051811422233">Fournies, 1987</xref>), helping employees recognize opportunities to improve their performance and capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051811422233">Orth, Wilkinson, &amp; Benfari, 1987</xref>), empowering employees to exceed prior levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051811422233">Burdett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811422233">Hargrove, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811422233">Joo &amp; Shim, 2010</xref>), and giving guidance, encouragement, and support to the learner.</p>
<p>Another key suggestion is that the systems for learning organization can significantly influence employees’ in-role job performance. That is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051811422233">Yang et al. (2004)</xref> suggested, HR and OD practitioners can play an important role in building a learning culture. For example, they can help organizations build an organizational culture with open communication that allows people to express their opinions, listen to others’ viewpoints, and support questioning and feedback. In turn, this culture helps foster in-role job performance. More specifically, HR and OD practitioners can help enhance embedded systems. As Watkins and Marsick (1993) argued, this dimension focused on the ability of an organization to preserve what is learned so that the learning will remain during ongoing changes. Learning organizations should save the learning gained by systematically capturing and preserving what is learned (Watkins &amp; Marsick, 1993).</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>In terms of methodology, this study has several potential limitations. First, it relied on self-reported and reflective recollections of the indicators of the constructs in this study by employees who voluntarily participated; however, this type of bias does not threaten the relationships, because the outcome variables were assessed by managers to eliminate single-source bias. Second, this empirical study confines itself to a cross-sectional survey method, which leaves room for speculation with regard to causality among the variables. Third, the sample size was relatively small and the response rate was low. The sample used for this study was 164 dyadic relationships (dyad response rate: 19%). Based on CFA, however, the data indicated an appropriate fit. Although this response rate is consistent with previous dyadic relationship studies, a potential concern exists that the lack of power somehow compromised the findings. In addition, the sample for this study, consisting mostly of younger male college graduates, is likely restricted to males of relatively high cognitive ability. This might create a potential issue of range restriction. Last, the organizations that participated in this study were confined to organizations in a conglomerate that shares similar corporate cultures.</p>
<p>To resolve the limitations above, further research needs to be based on multiple sources because a cross-sectional survey method restricts research to the chosen target group. In addition, to increase the generalizability of the present study, more data collection from various locations is needed. To include more diverse demographic backgrounds, more research in different countries and different organizational cultures is recommended. The impacts of social and organizational factors on in-role job performance were explored in this study, but the findings of this study could be incomplete because of the low effect size (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .17) and the possibility of other moderating and mediating variables in the relationships between the suggested constructs. For instance, organizational commitment, which is affected by LMX quality and a learning organizational culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811422233">Joo &amp; Lim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811422233">Joo &amp; Shim, 2010</xref>), could be another mediator for job performance. Future research should continue to examine other contextual factors of the work environment besides LMX quality.</p>

<sec id="section21-1548051811422233">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a knowledge-based economy, attraction, motivation, and retention of talented employees are critical concerns in many organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811422233">Joo &amp; Shim, 2010</xref>). Fierce global competition and rapid technological advancements have made organizations flatter and more team based and jobs more complex and demanding. Thus, employees need greater empowerment and support from their leaders and organizations. The purpose of this research was to investigate the impact of LMX quality on in-role job performance and the moderating role of learning organization culture. LMX was found to be important for in-role job performance, and a learning culture in organizations played a role as a moderator, indirectly influencing job performance. HR and OD professionals could and should help employees improve their job performance by developing supportive leaders and establishing a positive learning organization culture.</p>
