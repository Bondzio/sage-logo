<p>In her significant and impressive new book, <italic>Artistic impressions: Figure skating, masculinity, and the limits of sport</italic>, Mary Louise Adams analyses the historical development of figure skating. She traces the intriguing history to reveal that figure skating was once an exclusively male practice to understand how its image has been ‘feminized’ over time. Many gender scholars operate from the assumed position that gender is a socio-<italic>historic</italic> construction yet often neglect to illustrate the complex workings of this assumption. This text is important as it provides empirical evidence of this actual construction process. In this manner, as the historic evidence is forensically revealed, the reader gains a clear appreciation that dominant understandings of gender and gendered sporting activities do not stem from essential truths buried within bodies but have been shaped by the complex workings of power over time. This text, accordingly, is a powerful anti-essentialist reminder that we do not have to perform gender or sexuality in the ways that are currently dominant: as such, it works to challenge problematic gender and sexuality binaries.</p>
<p>Adams’ socio-historic study of figure skating examines several crucial questions: ‘What made possible the transformation of skating from a gentlemanly art to the so-called girls’ sport we are familiar with today?’ (p. 5); ‘How did the gendered meanings of skating come to shift so dramatically?’ (p. 5); ‘What makes men’s figure skating seem so incompatible with popular definitions of manliness?’ (p. 4). In answering these questions, via intersectional analysis, she disrupts the notion that gender and sexual identities are stable and fixed. Her intentions in disrupting these identity categories are overtly political.</p>

<p>The point of the exercise is not simply to learn about skating, which even skaters would have to admit is not terribly important in the grand scheme of things, but to learn about the assumed tight conflation of male bodies, masculine gender, and heterosexuality that limits the ways that men and boys can experience, move, and display their bodies and, more important, the ways they can see themselves and their place in the world around them. (p. 20).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Adams’ focus on masculinities draws on feminist and queer theories to promote her belief that an increased cultural acceptance of ‘effeminacy’ would be beneficial: the prime benefit, she assumes, is that masculinity would not be privileged over femininity and that masculinity and femininity would not be viewed ‘as resources to be parceled out to two distinctly different types of creatures’ (p. 25).</p>
<p>The text is structured into eight chapters. The introductory chapter draws the reader in with the significance of the topic and its reflexive style so that those who know a lot <italic>or</italic> (like me) very little about figure skating desire to read on. The second chapter details the contemporary issue that sparked Adams’ initial interest in researching figure skating. The issue was the short-lived ‘macho-turn’ in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which witnessed a challenge to the feminine reputation of skating via the strategic promotion of a hypermasculine image. Adams’ critical concern was ‘the almost cartoonish way that manliness was emphasized on the ice and in the press’ (p. 31) but, more importantly, how skating now promoted the ‘resoluteness of heteronormative ideas about gender’ (p. 31). She charts the rise of this macho-turn as a product of its times, in relation to homophobic concerns about HIV, the rise of neo-liberalism and the backlash against feminist achievements.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 Adams examines the questions: why is figure skating currently considered as a girl’s sport and ‘What does it allegedly say about a man or boy who chooses to participate’ in skating? (p. 46). In exploring these complex questions she draws on a wealth of sport and gender scholarship in relation to a contemporary analysis of the mediated representations of male figure skaters. Her analysis reveals skating as a hybrid of sport, art and entertainment and as a seemingly contradictory mix of strength, skill, grace and display. Adams suggests that one of the prime reasons why skating is currently considered as ‘feminine’ is that the sport invites the gaze on the performing body as an object of beauty and desire. The potential, accordingly, arises for a homoerotic gaze to exist between the male viewer and skater: this possibility was deemed important in limiting male interest in figure skating. The fact that a physical activity that demands stamina, speed, courage, strength and tolerance of pain (the worn-out traits of masculinity) is deemed feminine as it <italic>also</italic> involves displays of grace, highlights the somewhat absurd and tenuous nature of our gendered world. Adams concludes that figure skating has a contemporary ‘image problem’ and in the following chapters she examines how this problem developed.</p>
<p>Chapters 4, 5 and 6 provide the historical examination to understand how in the space of only two centuries, skating was transformed from an exclusive male pastime to a so-called feminine sport. Adams’ historical analysis excavates a wide range of historical data drawing from textbooks on how to skate, biographies, photographs, newspaper accounts, film clips and paintings. Her analysis reveals the intricate links between issues of gender, class, nationality and race in the gendered transformation of skating. The analysis, from chapter 4, reveals that displays of elegance and grace were highly respected for male figure skaters throughout the late 1700s and 1800s. And that the flaunting of bravado and feats involving leaping and excessive speed, were frowned upon. This rather surprising evidence is better understood through the revelation that figure skating was undertaken almost exclusively by bourgeois gentlemen. The development of skating, as such, can be understood as a reflection of class-specific interests and cultural values.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 examines the institutional changes that allowed skating to be transformed from a male specific ‘art’ form to a competitive international sport that also, somewhat uniquely, legitimated and encouraged the growth of female skating. Adams asserts that the class boundaries that produced skating as an exclusive pastime, was a significant factor that allowed privileged women to skate in significant numbers from the 1860s. The hetero-sociability of skating was also cited as a key factor in this growth. Adams reports that by the end of the 19th century, skating had become a sport like no other: ‘it confounded definitions of sports as rational, easily measurable activities; with its large number of female participants it defied the notion that sports were the makers of men’ (p. 133). Moreover, male and female skaters competed, together and apart, ‘to see who looked the most beautiful, who performed the most gracefully, who drew the best tracings on the ice’ (p. 133). The values reflected in these coed performances were the ‘remnants of an elegant upper-class physicality’ (p. 133).</p>
<p>Chapter 6 traces the social conditions that produced the significant shifts in skating from the early 1900s to the 1930s: a time period that witnessed the feminization of skating and the decline of male skaters. Within this era, there was a short-lived period within which males and females competed together without risk of being masculinized or feminized. More importantly, evidence suggests that males did not feel humiliated when beaten by females. Yet by the end of the 1920s separate competitions developed and male interest in skating was quickly curtailed. Adams suggests several factors to account for these changes, including the challenge to upper class values by the growth of the middle class, the increased technical dominance of female skaters and the celebrity status and feminine image of Sonja Henie. The subsequent construction of skating as a hybrid of art and athletics underpinned the appeal to skate fans but also produced its effeminate or sissy image.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 examines the discursive influence of gender and class in the long-standing debate about the ‘prominence given to skating’s artistic and sporting elements’ (p. 27). These debates, Adams convincingly argues, ‘are debates about men, and they tend to draw on simplistic discourses of athleticism and masculinity’ (p. 195). Yet these debates concerning the art/sport binary have also been used to construct, legitimate and constrain differences between male and female skaters. This recognition leads in to chapter 8, which examines how the tensions concerning skating’s effeminate reputation limits male and female performances on the ice. Of greater significance, Adams argues is that the unbending notions of masculinity and femininity do not allow figure skating to operate in the production of potentially transformative understandings of what it means to be a man or woman.</p>
<p>Adams’ exceptional answer to this complex issue is that figure skating now needs to ‘come out’. In other words, she argues that skating should embrace its uniqueness, celebrate its blend of art and athleticism, stop worrying about its effeminate image, let it be known that many male skaters are gay, and ‘stop trying to enforce gendered versions of skating, a feminine one for women and a masculine one for men’ (p. 239). She concludes: ‘Figure skating has more potential than many sports do to help us think differently about the relationships between sports, gender, bodies, and styles of movement. It’s a waste not use it’ (p. 239).</p>
<p>In summarizing major findings from <italic>Artistic Impressions</italic> I do not do justice to Adams’ complex arguments. Indeed, I stress that she presents her interpretations of the existing, but somewhat limited, historic evidence in a cautious and reflexive manner. For example, in discussing the influence of Jackson Haines, who was influential in the birth of modern figure skating from the 1860s, Adams states:
<disp-quote>
<p>American and Continental sources routinely say that he was given a frosty reception in England, although not a single English source gives any specific information about him skating there. Whether this means he was completely discounted in that country or that, in fact, he never went there, it is impossible to know. (p. 97)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More importantly, her erudite history provides a key contrast to the now dominant belief that ‘sport’ developed in Victorian England in relation to the games ethic and associated notions of manliness. Adams, correspondingly, states:
<disp-quote>
<p>the majority of research on Victorian sport in England has investigated only a handful of athletic and team activities, with most attention being devoted to cricket and the various forms of football. We need more research on a greater variety of sports to learn whether sporting masculinities are as coherent as they can seem to be in literature, where they are often lumped together under the undifferentiated category of dominant or hegemonic masculinity. While these can be useful concepts, their boundaries need to be determined by empirical research. (p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, this text is a tour-de-force of critical gender scholarship. Its socio-historic perspective answers Foucault’s urging to undertake histories of the present. The text is a delight to read. Adams has the knack of expressing complex ideas in an easy to understand manner, which makes the text accessible to both fans of skating and academic scholars. Moreover, as someone who has had little interest previously in figure skating (or opportunity to view it in New Zealand), she has allowed me to understand the passion of skate fans. On the downside, Adams’ argument begins to feel a little repetitive by chapters 7 and 8, more discussion on her historical method and theoretical tools was warranted, and a concluding section could have pulled her prime arguments together. Overall, however, this impressive and erudite text is a significant contribution to the sociology of sport and, as such, is a must-read for gender scholars and students.</p>
