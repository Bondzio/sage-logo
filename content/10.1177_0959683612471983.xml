<abstract>
<p>Reconstructed Holocene lake-level curves from two saline, hydrologically closed maar crater lakes in southwestern Victoria, Australia, show near synchronous lake-level changes throughout the Holocene. We show that lake levels, reconstructed from sediment particle size and ostracod valve chemistry (δ<sup>18</sup>O and Sr/Ca) have undergone rapid (&lt;100 yr), large (&gt;10 m) fluctuations throughout the Holocene. Finer sampling resolution shows a more sensitive response to Holocene climate than was previously presented for Lake Keilambete. Both maar crater lakes show a short-lived maximum in Holocene lake levels around 7.2 ka. The period of lake filling leading to peak lake levels matches the phase of most effective precipitation (7.4–7.0 ka) reconstructed from a high-resolution speleothem record from northern Tasmania. Water levels declined in both lakes during the mid Holocene, with a more substantive decline after ~5 ka which coincides with the end of the Southern Hemisphere hypsithermal. Water levels continued to oscillate with a periodicity of around 300–700 years, before reaching a late-Holocene nadir around 1.8 ka (Keilambete) and 1.3 ka (Gnotuk). The trend and periodicity of oscillations in the maar water levels show commonalities to δD in the Dome C ice core, and suggest that temperature may be a significant component in influencing the Precipitation/Evaporation (P/E) ratio in southeastern Australia during the Holocene.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the fundamental goals of palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate research is to establish pre-anthropogenic data sets with which to compare the impacts of recent (post-industrial revolution) environmental change. In order to accomplish this, robustly dated, high-resolution records are required to gain an understanding of past environmental conditions. This has been achieved in many regions of the world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612471983">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007</xref>), however, in southeastern Australia, high-resolution, multiproxy records with good chronological control are lacking. The importance of understanding palaeoenvironmental changes in southeastern Australia is of fundamental importance to future surface and groundwater water resource management (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612471983">Kirono et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683612471983">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683612471983">Yihdego and Webb, 2012</xref>) and environmental condition assessments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471983">Gell et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The Holocene lake-level curve derived from laminated sediments from the Lake Keilambete maar by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471983">Bowler (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">1981</xref>) is a keystone record in the understanding of Holocene climate in southeastern Australia (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612471983">Williams et al., 1998</xref>). Other temperate southeastern Australian lakes with high-resolution dating are rare, and often only have a single proxy (e.g. the aeolian quartz record from Blue Lake, NSW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612471983">Stanley and De Deckker, 2002</xref>)). Lake Keilambete provides a rare continuous record of varying precipitation/evaporation (P/E) throughout the Holocene, and has provided a wealth of multiproxy reconstructions, from lake level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>), ostracods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471983">Chivas et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612471983">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612471983">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612471983">De Deckker, 1982</xref>), and pollen and charcoal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471983">Dodson, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612471983">Mooney, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler’s (1981)</xref> smoothed lake-level curve, constructed using grain size data from 40 sediment samples, shows a broad and high plateau in lake levels between ~7.8 and 6.2 ka<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959683612471983">1</xref></sup> followed by a gradual decline in water level, with low but rapidly oscillating levels from ~ 3.3 to 2.3 ka, followed by a late-Holocene rise and a rapid decline in the post-European period.</p>
<p>Given the arguable importance of Lake Keilambete to our understanding of Holocene climate in southeastern Australia, this paper provides a long overdue, higher-resolution reconstruction of Holocene lake level using independent techniques (sediment texture and ostracod valve chemistry combined with an ostracod transfer function to reconstruct water salinities), dated with two independent methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471983">Wilkins et al., 2012</xref>), and validated by reference to a second maar lake (Lake Gnotuk). Advancements in dating since the time of Bowler’s research has enabled a revision of past bulk <sup>14</sup>C dating chronologies for Lake Keilambete and Lake Gnotuk, which shows that Lake Keilambete is affected by a radiocarbon reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471983">Wilkins et al., 2012</xref>), whereas Lake Gnotuk is not.</p>
<p>The Lake Keilambete water-level reconstruction presented here more than doubles the temporal resolution of the original reconstruction of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler (1981)</xref> from one sample every 250 years to one per 100 years for Lake Keilambete. The temporal resolution for Lake Gnotuk is approximately one sample every 150 years, but the lake-level reconstruction still shows excellent agreement with that of Lake Keilambete.</p>
<p>As summarised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612471983">Shulmeister (1999)</xref>, the mid-Holocene decline in lake levels has since been interpreted as reflecting either a (1) reduction in summer (monsoonal) rainfall (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683612471983">Singh and Luly, 1991</xref>), or (2) reduction in winter (westerly) rainfall due to a southerly shift of the subtropical high pressure belt (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612471983">Harrison, 1993</xref>). Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that Southern Hemisphere climate was far more variable than previously thought (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612471983">Mayewski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612471983">Moros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683612471983">Moy et al., 2002</xref>), yet because of the poor resolution and smoothed nature of the published Keilambete lake-level curve, it is impossible to resolve variability seen elsewhere. Two recently published palaeosalinity records from the southeast of South Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471983">Gouramanis et al., 2010</xref>) and the semi-arid Wimmera region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612471983">Kemp et al., 2012</xref>) confirm significant centennial-scale Holocene hydrologic variability for southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>The rapid changes in water level, ostracod valve chemistry, and lamination formation seen in Lake Keilambete and Lake Gnotuk during the Holocene indicate that their sediment records are sensitive palaeoclimatic archives which have recorded rapid and frequent variations in environmental conditions. Lake level reaches a Holocene maximum at 7.2 ± 0.2 ka, contemporaneous with a precipitation maximum recorded in northern Tasmania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471983">Xia et al., 2001</xref>). Lake levels drop towards modern levels from about 5.0 ka onwards, which coincides with an abrupt increase in sea-ice expansion in the Southern Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471983">Hodell et al., 2001</xref>), a sharp drop in δ<sup>18</sup>O in Taylor Dome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471983">Steig et al., 2000</xref>), and as a decline in discharge from the Murray-Darling River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683612471983">Gingele et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Regional setting</title>
<p>The two studied lakes occur in the western district of Victoria, in southeastern Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612471983">Figure 1</xref>). Modern-day climate affecting the lakes is temperate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Precipitation has varied dramatically over the last 50 years from 600 to 1000 mm/yr. The annual balance between P/E strongly influences lake water levels and water salinity, with the historical lake decline caused by a shift in P/E from 0.96–0.94 to about 0.79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612471983">Kirono et al. (2009)</xref> estimate that for Lake Keilambete, the P/E ratio decreased even further to 0.69 for the 10 years from 1998 to 2008.</p>

<p>Lake Keilambete is a flat-bottomed maar crater lake, as first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471983">Bowler (1970)</xref>. At the time of coring, it was a relatively shallow (~9 m) lake with prominent old shorelines circling the lake at various heights below the crater rim and a salinity of ~ 102 g/l. As an isolated crater with a lake surface area of 2.7 km<sup>2</sup> and a catchment of 4.2 km<sup>2</sup>, lake level is primarily controlled by the P/E ratio, but also receives a small component of groundwater inflow from the Port Campbell Limestone aquifer (estimated at ~10% compared with rainfall) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 1998</xref>). Analysis of boron isotopes in the lake further confirms that groundwater is a relatively minor contributor to the lake hydrology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471983">Vengosh et al., 1991</xref>). Accelerator Mass Spectrometry <sup>14</sup>C dating of the groundwater discharging into Lake Keilambete showed a reservoir age of almost 2000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471983">Wilkins et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Lake Gnotuk is a flat bottomed maar crater lake located only 18 km east of Lake Keilambete, and has been shown to have very similar water chemistry, ecology, and sediment properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612471983">Barton and Barbetti, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612471983">De Deckker, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471983">Dodson, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612471983">Timms, 1976</xref>). At the time of coring, it was a ~ 17 m deep lake with a surface area of 2.2 km<sup>2</sup> and a catchment of 7.2 km<sup>2</sup>. The maar crater is a closed catchment, although at high lake levels, water flows into the lake from the adjacent Lake Bullenmerri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612471983">Figure 2</xref>). Lake Gnotuk also displays past shorelines around the crater wall, but not as prominently as at Lake Keilambete. Salinity is currently ~ 80 g/l, and has been increasing since 1841, at which time Lake Bullenmerri overflowed into Gnotuk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612471983">Currey, 1970</xref>). The earliest reliable estimate of the maximum lake depth was 35 m in 1903, resulting in a lake-level decline of 16.5 m in 73 years (23 m/century) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612471983">Gregory, 1903</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612471983">Timms, 1976</xref>). Between 1841 and 1966, adjacent Lake Bullenmerri receded at the same rate (23 m/century).</p>

<p>A combination of historical records and modelling has shown that recent decreases in P/E have resulted in lake water levels declining by ~20 m in the past 167 years (Keilambete) and by ~17 m in the past 125 years (Gnotuk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612471983">Kirono et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al. (2001)</xref> confirmed that the water-level decline was climatically driven. That both lakes responded to known changes in the P/E ratio over the period covered by instrumental rainfall records has been demonstrated via modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). On the basis of the similarities in basin morphology, sediment accumulation rates and magnetic resonance, it has also been suggested that water level in Lake Gnotuk responded similarly to Lake Keilambete over the Holocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612471983">Barton and Barbetti, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612471983">Barton and Polach, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471983">Dodson (1974a)</xref> identified the Lake Keilambete freshwater phase (based upon the presence of the alga <italic>Pediastrum</italic>) as occurring somewhat later in the Holocene, between about 7.3 and 5.6 ka, with the most saline phase around 3.6 ka, although his dating was not as extensive as Bowler’s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612471983">Dodson (1974b)</xref> observed conditions which led to the precipitation of aragonite in association with the alga <italic>Enteromorpha nana</italic> in Lake Gnotuk. From this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471983">Dodson (1974a)</xref> postulated that algal growth/blooms in the open water of Lake Keilambete engenders change in lake water CaCO<sub>3</sub> saturation levels, precipitating aragonite which is then deposited as fine laminae in the lake sediment. We suggest that aragonite laminae in the Lake Gnotuk core were formed in a similar manner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612471983">De Deckker (1982)</xref> inferred Holocene salinity changes in Lake Keilambete based on microscopic fossil remains, principally of ostracods, and also showed similar results for Lake Gnotuk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471983">Chivas et al. (1985)</xref> applied Sr/Ca ratios of ostracod carapaces to derive a palaeo-salinity curve for Lake Keilambete. Their curve, based on 34 analysed intervals, is similar in trend and magnitude to Bowler’s lake-level curve, although it is notable that the majority of the salinity excursions occurred 400 to 800 years prior to lake-level changes reconstructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler (1981)</xref>, despite using the same chronology. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471983">Chivas et al. (1985)</xref> detected four salinity peaks (and associated troughs) in the mid to late Holocene, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler’s (1981)</xref> smoothed curve only shows three. On the basis of a shift from aragonite to dolomite deposition, and the Sr/Ca results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471983">Chivas et al. (1985)</xref> postulated that salinity increased rapidly from ~ 30 to 90 g/l around 4.7 ka, with the consequent inference that there was a dramatic decrease in the P/E ratio at this time.</p>
<p>In a more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612471983">Chivas et al.

<p>The reliability of Lake Keilambete as a ‘lacustrine pluviometer’ was re-assessed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al. (2001)</xref>, who suggested that at higher lake levels, Lake Keilambete was influenced by a perched water-table associated with a nearby swamp. Consequently, at high water levels, the lake level does not respond to changes in P/E in a linear manner, making the lake less suitable as a palaeo-rain gauge at these times. Because Lake Gnotuk is higher in the landscape, it is not affected by a local water-table, making it a potentially better indicator of P/E during wetter climate phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, caution is still required, as adjacent Lake Bullenmerri can overflow into Lake Gnotuk during periods of very high lake levels.</p>

<title>Particle size analysis</title>
<p>The use of sediment particle size as a lake depth proxy requires a site-specific knowledge of the relationship between sediment texture and lake depth, and the relative errors involved with calculating the latter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471983">Bowler (1970)</xref> measured the proportion of coarse-grained material (&gt; 40 µm) from the modern sediment–water interface at various depths in Lake Keilambete.

<p>Samples representing 1 cm of core sedimentation (7–8 cm<sup>3</sup> of sediment) were removed at 3–4 cm intervals down-core, and disaggregated in 10% v/v hydrogen peroxide for 3–5 weeks. Samples were wet sieved, with the &lt; 63 µm fraction captured in 1 l settling flasks. The &gt; 63µm fraction was oven dried at 100°C overnight and weighed. The &lt; 63 µm fraction was left to settle in 1 l containers for 24–72 h, the clear supernatant was aspirated off, and the resultant fine sediment fraction was oven dried at 100°C overnight and weighed to calculate the proportion of material &gt;63 µm. Measurements were made on 94 samples for Lake Keilambete and 78 samples for Lake Gnotuk. Owing to irregular spacing of sample intervals and varying sedimentation rates, sampling frequency varies from every 20 to 260 years in Lake Keilambete and 30 to 450 years in Lake Gnotuk.</p>

<title>Dating</title>
<p>Fourteen Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) <sup>14</sup>C dates and 14 quartz Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from a 3.89 m sediment core from Lake Keilambete (core Keil02), and 15 AMS <sup>14</sup>C and 16 OSL dates from a 3.75 m sediment core from Lake Gnotuk (core Gn01). Supplementary AMS <sup>14</sup>C dating of lake and spring water at Keilambete showed that <sup>14</sup>C depleted water (a reservoir age of 1940 ± 30 yr) affected the <sup>14</sup>C activity of Keilambete lake water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471983">Wilkins et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>OSL dates measured on single-grains and very small aliquots of sand-sized quartz recovered from the sediment cores, indicate the presence of a radiocarbon reservoir in Lake Keilambete consistent with that measured on modern ostracods, and demonstrate that there is no <sup>14</sup>C reservoir in Lake Gnotuk during the Holocene. Most of the AMS <sup>14</sup>C dating was conducted on ostracods and foraminifera, in an effort to answer whether large observed age differences (past bulk carbonate dates of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471983">Bowler (1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">1981)</xref> overestimated their coeval organic dates by between 1700 and 2800 calendar years) was primarily due to a lake-water <sup>14</sup>C reservoir, or to the incorporation of reworked carbonates.</p>
<p>A systematic offset between the <sup>14</sup>C and optical ages in Lake Keilambete justifies the use of a lacustrine reservoir correction, although the optical dating was insufficiently precise to define changes in the reservoir magnitude with time.

One sigma age errors on calibrated <sup>14</sup>C dates are typically ± 200 years for Lake Gnotuk, and ± 400 years for Lake Keilambete (owing to uncertainty from the lake radiocarbon reservoir).

The lower part of the core (293 to 389 cm) consists of coarsely laminated to unlaminated grey sediments with gradational colour changes, with the exception of the section between 316 and 354 cm, which consists of unlaminated, porous grey sediment with abundant brown mottling.

<p>It must be noted that at deeper lake levels, the relationship between lake depth and sediment particle size is very sensitive to relatively small variations in the proportion of sand-sized material. For instance, in Lake Gnotuk, 50 m and 70 m lake depths are equivalent to 97.0% and 99.5% of sediment &lt;63 µm, respectively. Stochastic variation in the influx of storm transported or wind-blown coarse particles (e.g. clastic grains, vegetation, insect chitin, gastropods) can potentially result in significant variations in the percentage of coarse material. Given this, isolated variations in the shape of the lake level curve should not be overinterpreted.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, the finest textured sediment assumed to be representative of crater-full depth, occurs at 238 cm in core Gn01 (99.5% &lt;63 µm), and 296 cm in core Keil02 (99.9% &lt;63 µm). An AMS <sup>14</sup>C date from charcoal fragments at 295 cm in core Keil02 dates to 7.33 ± 0.18 ka, and the age models place peak lake level at 7.23 ka in Lake Keilambete and 7.17 ka in Lake Gnotuk, synchronous considering the dating errors of several hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471983">Wilkins et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Lake-level reconstructions</title>
<p>The timing of the reconstructed high and low lake-level phases from Lake Gnotuk matches well with those reconstructed from Lake Keilambete, given the dating errors associated with the age models and the difference in sampling intervals between the two lake records (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471983">Figure 6</xref>). Lake Gnotuk has higher amplitude changes in lake level than Lake Keilambete, which may be partially explained by the modulating effect of the perched water-table in Lake Keilambete, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al. (2001)</xref>. During wet phases, flow of water over the sill from Lake Bullenmerri would also act to boost levels in Lake Gnotuk. This paper demonstrates that both Keilambete and Gnotuk show a clear lake-level maximum at 7.2 ± 0.2 ka (weighted mean age). The time of maximum lake depth matches the phase of most effective precipitation (7.4–7.0 ka) reconstructed from a northern Tasmanian speleothem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471983">Xia et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471983">Figure 6d</xref>).</p>

<p>The observed increase in effective precipitation could be associated with increased sea-surface evaporation due to high sea-surface temperatures (peaking at 7.5 ± 0.1 ka) observed in Murray Canyons core MD03-2611, which is located in a precipitation source area 500 km to the west of the crater lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612471983">Calvo et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612471983">Moros et al. (2009)</xref> also identified a cold phase around 7.3 ka in the adjacent Murray Canyon core (MD03-2607) that was preceded by a phase of strong westerlies between 10 and 7 ka. The timing of the subsequent decline in lake levels is consistent with the proposed re-organisation of the southern westerlies which has been observed in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612471983">Shulmeister, 1999</xref>), South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683612471983">Lamy et al., 2001</xref>), and Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471983">Hodell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Lake levels drop towards modern levels in Lake Gnotuk and Lake Keilambete from about 5.0 ka onwards, which is accompanied by a sharp increase in the rate of carbonate deposition, and an increase in laminae formation in Lake Keilambete. This period of change coincides with the end of the ‘hypsithermal’, visible as an abrupt increase in sea-ice expansion in the Southern Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471983">Hodell et al., 2001</xref>), as a sharp drop in Deuterium in Taylor Dome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471983">Steig et al., 2000</xref>), the commencement of sea surface cooling in the Murray Canyons region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612471983">Calvo et al., 2007</xref>), and increased variability in other southeastern Australian lacustrine records, such as Blue Lake, South Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471983">Gouramanis et al., 2010</xref>) and Blue Lake, New South Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612471983">Stanley and De Deckker, 2002</xref>).</p>

The lake depth reconstruction from Lake Gnotuk, which is of low resolution at this time, shows a more gradual increase in lake levels after 8.8 ka.

Both lakes reach their maximum depth at the same time (mean age = 7.2 ± 0.2 ka). The lake-level maxima coincide with an effective precipitation maximum between 7.4 and 7.0 ka recorded in a Tasmanian speleothem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471983">Xia et al., 2001</xref>), which implies that the regional Holocene P/E maximum was briefer than previously thought from the old Lake Keilambete lake-level reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471983">Bowler and Hamada, 1971</xref>).

<p>The particle size reconstruction indicates that lake levels are higher than modern, but there is a progressive trend of declining water levels in both lakes.

<p>The particle size reconstruction indicates a further decline in lake levels in both lakes.

Lake Gnotuk shows three more protracted lake-level minima at ~3.6, 3.2 and 2.1 ka.

<p>The particle size reconstructions show that Keilambete and Gnotuk reach a late-Holocene lake-level minimum during this phase. The minimum is not synchronous (~1.8 ka in Keilambete and ~ 1.3 ka in Gnotuk). In Keilambete, the Sr/Ca<sub>water</sub> shows saline conditions peaking at 1.9 and 1.6 ka, with the 1.9 ka phase more saline (0.067 compared with 0.040). This is consistent with the Keilambete MAT TDS, which shows a substantial saline phase from 1.9 to 1.2 ka. The exposed shoreline trees at Keilambete date to this low lake-level period (1.78 ± 0.27 ka) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471983">Bowler, 1970</xref>). The Sr/Ca<sub>water</sub> in Lake Keilambete shows a decreasing trend from 1.6 to 1.2 ka, at which point ostracods are no longer preserved in the sediment.

<sec id="section33-0959683612471983">
<title>~1.2–0.8 ka</title>
<p>The particle size reconstruction indicates a rapid increase in lake depth in Lake Gnotuk, although not quite as high as the 7.4 ka peak, which may be accentuated by water inflow from Lake Bullenmerri. Lake Keilambete shows a slower rise in water depth.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The technique of using sediment grain size to model past lake depth in the maar craters of Lake Gnotuk and Lake Keilambete demonstrates a robust agreement in lake levels and P/E trends during the Holocene. The Lake Keilambete reconstruction presented here more than doubles the sampling density of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471983">Bowler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471983">Chivas et al., 1985</xref>) and, importantly, has now been validated by reference to Lake Gnotuk. For those times when ostracods were preserved in the lake sediment, the use of valve Sr/Ca ratios and the ostracod MAT TDS as a supplementary technique provides an independent check on lake level (salinity being inversely proportional to lake depth owing to the closed nature of the basin). Whilst the differing sensitivities of the two methods cause disagreement in the magnitude of lake-level shifts, they generally agree well when it comes to the timing of the initiation and speed of those changes.</p>
<p>Rapid changes in lake level, ostracod valve chemistry, and lamination formation indicate that Lake Keilambete and Gnotuk records are sensitive palaeoclimatic archives that reflect rapid and frequent variations in environmental conditions during the Holocene. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that lake levels in Keilambete and Gnotuk have been shown to reflect the regional P/E ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471983">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, similarities in the pattern and timing of these lake-level changes presented here to ice core δ<sup>18</sup>O (EPICA Dome C, Antarctica) may indicate a strong temperature component to the P/E ratio, which could potentially be resolved to provide a continuous Holocene precipitation record for southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>Reconstructed lake levels in Keilambete and Gnotuk record a maximum at 7.2 ± 0.2 ka which is contemporaneous with the precipitation maximum recorded in a speleothem in northern Tasmania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471983">Xia et al., 2001</xref>), and a cooling of sea-surface temperatures offshore South Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612471983">Moros et al., 2009</xref>). Lake levels drop towards modern levels from about 5.0 ka onwards, which coincides with the end of the ‘hypsithermal’, visible as an abrupt increase in sea-ice expansion in the Southern Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471983">Hodell et al., 2001</xref>), as a sharp drop in δ<sup>18</sup>O in Taylor Dome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471983">Steig et al., 2000</xref>), and as a decline in discharge from the Murray-Darling River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683612471983">Gingele et al., 2007</xref>). Persistent recurrent periods of lower water levels in Keilambete and Gnotuk in the mid to late Holocene (between 4.0 and 1.2 ka) indicate multicentennial periods of less effective rainfall, which should be a cautionary lesson for contemporary land managers in southern Australia, especially in the context of observed recent warming and rainfall decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683612471983">CSIRO, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683612471983">Kirono et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
