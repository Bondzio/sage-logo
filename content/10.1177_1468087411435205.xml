<abstract>
<p>In this paper, the motivation behind the development of an active control turbocharger is presented, along with the initial thinking that led to the basic concept of applying active flow control at the inlet to a turbocharger turbine. In addition, the concept of active control for turbochargers is analysed in depth with the purpose of presenting a theoretical basis for any subsequent application of this type of control of exhaust gas flow into a turbocharger turbine by providing the fundamental thermo-fluids background. Secondly, the aim was not only to merely present a theory summarising the behaviour of the exhaust gas flow occurring during turbocharger turbine inlet geometrical changes, but to also present the implications from the periodic nature of these geometric changes, in particular with respect to cycle performance results both for the turbocharger and for the engine. The effects of the application of active control turbochargers were demonstrated through testing of the first prototype active control turbocharger built and tested at the aerodynamic test facility at Imperial College and through the experimental data collected. In this first attempt, at the most favourable amplitudes tested, the power recovered reached a maximum value of 7.5% increase over the equivalent variable geometry turbocharger performance, although this depended on the phasing of the turbine inlet area variation in relation to the energy content variation of the incoming exhaust pulse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Turbocharging (much like supercharging, which draws power from the mechanical power of the engine instead of the latter’s wasted heat energy) is defined as the introduction of air (or air/fuel mixtures in gasoline engines) into an engine cylinder at a density greater than ambient. This allows a proportional increase in the fuel that can be burned and hence raises the potential power output. The principal objective of supercharging is to increase power output, not to improve efficiency, although efficiency may benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411435205">1</xref></sup> This latter point is key in the development of any turbocharger with means to vary the geometry and hence the flow quantity through its turbine (particularly so of an active control turbocharger (ACT)), as shall be analysed in the following sections.</p>
<p>Modern (i.e. pulse as opposed to constant pressure) turbochargers have seen three principal development steps in their evolution. The first is still the predominant type of turbocharger in use today: the fixed geometry turbocharger (FGT) equipped with a wastegate. This has been the type of turbocharger to dominate all commercial and private use of turbochargers since their expansion in worldwide markets 50 years ago. The variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) is an idea dating several decades back, which has undergone a serious development process only during the last 30 years, with the first commercial examples only entering the market 20 years ago. A third, and by far the latest development in turbocharging, is the electrically assisted turbocharger, which is heavily under development by most major turbocharger manufacturers today and which, at the time of writing, is still to enter widespread commercial use.</p>
<p>The development steps described above are targeted at alleviating some of the limitations of turbocharging, but it will become apparent that the highly dynamic nature of the exhaust gases lends itself to further exploitation.</p>
<p>This paper introduces for the first time in theoretical terms an innovative new concept in turbochargers – that of using active control at the turbine inlet with the aim of harnessing the highly dynamic exhaust gas pulse energy emanating at high frequency from an internal combustion engine, in order to increase the engine power output and reduce its exhaust emissions. In addition, the ACT prototype, experimental setup and pertinent test results are all presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1468087411435205">
<title>The ACT concept</title>
<p>There were two main reasons that motivated this research towards the provision of turbine (inlet) area regulation throughout each exhaust gas cycle of the internal combustion engine. Firstly, the internal combustion engine and turbocharger turbine operating characteristics are relatively incompatible from an efficiency point of view and, therefore, from the point of view of having any benefit at all from the installation of a turbocharger in the first place. A look at any turbocharger compressor map will attest to the small region of high efficiency flow existent as a narrow contour, which only corresponds to a relatively narrow margin of engine load–speed combination. Secondly, the fluctuation of the exhaust flow quantity as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435205">Figure 1</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411435205">2</xref></sup> undergoes substantial fluctuations.</p>

</fig>
<p>No current turbocharger system in commercial use or under development, such as those mentioned in the introduction to this paper, is able to effect any improvement in the flow entering the turbocharger. The need for improvement is evident by the wild fluctuations in the efficiency traces and the large drop in pressure in the last two-thirds of the pulse period.</p>
<p>The generic concept of turbocharging is based on the loss of an approximate 35% of the energy that is released by the combustion of the fuel during the internal combustion engine exhaust process. Turbochargers exist as the devices that capitalise upon this 35% of energy loss by helping to recover as much of this amount of energy as possible. Generally, it may be stated that the proportion recovered out of this 35% of energy lost during one cycle of combustion in an engine in a typical efficient turbocharger of today does not exceed 40%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411435205">3</xref></sup> although variations are significant between engine types. This means that a maximum 40% of the expansion energy present in the exhaust gas stream is recovered. At certain operating conditions around the turbine design point, the efficiency is much higher, but the average turbocharger value mentioned above is obtained as a result of the trade-off between this higher efficiency and the very low efficiency during (low exhaust energy) off-design turbine operating conditions. The workable idea behind the exhaust turbocharger (as first laid down by Alfred Büchi in his 1915 patent) was that of boost pressure exceeding the pressure before the turbine (at full load) and a valve overlap characterised by keeping the intake and exhaust valves open simultaneously. This overlap, along with the effected pressure gradient between compressor and turbocharger, lead to the scavenging of the remaining exhaust gas inside the engine cylinders. However, if there is only a small such pressure gradient, scavenging becomes difficult and if the efficiency of the turbine is insufficient, the desired positive gradient may not be obtained at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411435205">4</xref></sup> Efficiency effects as a result of operation of the ACT are, therefore, critical if the ACT is to achieve its principal aim of increasing turbine power recovered out of the exhaust gases. None of these turbocharging systems currently in use tap into this fundamental potential energy source in the form of the highly dynamic energy form encapsulated in individual energy fluctuations during each individual engine exhaust cycle. The concept of active control in turbocharging was developed with a view of harnessing this potential energy source.</p>
<p>Since a lot of the turbocharger development work over the past couple of decades in particular, has evolved around efforts for more effective and flexible types of control of the exhaust flow, a brief review of available flow control systems is relevant, in order to understand the options and benefits available in such an undertaking.</p>
<p>By way of introduction, it may be stated that active flow control is a fast growing multi-disciplinary science and a technology thrust aimed at altering a natural flow state or development path into a more desired state (or path).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087411435205">5</xref></sup> Active flow control is increasingly becoming a more viable tool for modifying flows for many practical applications, with a significant amount of research interest and published work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411435205">6</xref></sup> As already explained, the term ‘active’ refers to techniques in which energy is expended to modify the flow according to the definition of Donovan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411435205">7</xref></sup> The main methods of flow control today are divided into three categories: passive, active and reactive flow control. Passive control involves any non-dynamic form of flow control that is created to manipulate the flow (such as aircraft wing strakes or surface dimples). The term non-dynamic does include variable systems, however, where there is no attempt at manipulating severe periodic disturbances in a flow and there is no attempt, therefore, to operate at the high frequencies associated with this type of flow. Passive systems require no auxiliary power and no control loop. Active control on the other hand attempts to control such flow features. Reactive control in its latest forms can involve a colossal number of microsensors and microactuators communicating with each other via parallel computers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087411435205">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reactive control is, in fact, a specific form of active control based on advanced forms of closed-loop control. From past demonstrations of active flow control, it appears that the success of active control strategies is greatest when hydrodynamic instability mechanisms of the underlying base flow can be exploited. This project attempts to manipulate the inherent ‘instability’ in the flow emanating from an internal combustion engine during its exhaust process. For accuracy purposes, it may be noted that an ACT is by necessity a reactive control system as, in any eventuality, it requires a closed-loop control with feedback or a feedforward open loop control system to work.</p>
<p>A simple schematic form of the concept can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411435205">Figure 2</xref>. In this illustration, a simple single cylinder exhaust process is shown, and the corresponding turbocharger turbine inlet area adjustment afforded by the (in this case) ring sleeve-type (as per the definition of Flaxington and Szczupak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411435205">9</xref></sup>) flow restrictor (which from now on will be referred to simply as ‘flow restrictor’). The engine exhaust cycle is indicated on the right (lasting 240° of the crankshaft angle rotation). In the first (top) case, the exhaust process has just started and the exhaust valve has started to open. The pressure of the gas stream entering the turbocharger is barely above ambient at this stage; therefore, the flow restrictor provides maximum area restriction (A) at the turbine inlet (throat) in order to recover as much energy from this low-pressure region. In the second case, the cylinder exhaust valves are fully open, and the gas stream pressure entering the turbine has reached its peak value. At this stage, the flow restrictor is recessed back into its slot (area B) in order to avoid increasing the pressure drop across the turbine to a dangerously high level. In the final case, the exhaust process is nearing its end, the valve starts closing, and most of the exhaust gas has escaped the cylinder. The pressure of the gas stream has dropped back down to ambient levels, and the flow restrictor again assumes the same area as in the first case (area A=area C) in order to increase the pressure drop across the turbine.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468087411435205-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The method of application of the concept of active control above highlights the initial concept, in a somewhat arbitrary manner. The principal idea, however, stems from the need to continuously adjust the turbine inlet area in order to (a) take advantage of the energy levels existent in a pulse and (b) to match the turbine inlet area in a more efficient way to the engine exhaust flow characteristics at each instant. The first statement (a) means that the engine boost pressure developed by the turbocharger compressor throughout any given exhaust gas cycle is the amount of pressure produced as a result of the power output of the turbine, after deducting mechanical losses, as calculated in the turbocharger energy balance equation</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>It needs to be noted that the values of interest above such as compressor pressure ratio (PR) and turbine expansion ratio (ER) are cycle-averaged values. In other words, the engine boost pressure developed throughout a given engine exhaust cycle is a function of the cycle-average pressure drop in the turbine. By increasing the pressure levels throughout the exhaust pulse (and specifically in the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411435205">Figure 2</xref>, at the start and end of the exhaust process), the cycle-averaged pressure drop will increase and given no counterbalancing drop in efficiency, the end result will be a corresponding increase in boost.</p>
<p>The second statement (b), relates that in theory, at least, the ACT, through actuation of its flow restrictor in a suitable manner, can provide a suitable (or idealised) turbine inlet area at each instant in time throughout each engine exhaust cycle. The effect of this action will be an enhanced exhaust energy recovery by comparison to any of the turbocharging systems already described.</p>
<p>This effect of improving the turbine match to the characteristics of the incoming flow may be further explained by the use of the Euler turbomachinery equation and the velocity triangles of the flow at the inlet, where the study is of interest in the case of an ACT application (since the exit geometry of the turbine remains unaffected). The Euler turbomachinery equation is provided below<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411435205">10</xref></sup></p>

<p>The option of adjusting the turbine inlet characteristic throughout the pulse period as per point (b), discussed previously, effectively reduces to the problem of increasing the absolute flow velocity, <italic>C</italic>, since the rotor tip velocity <italic>U</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>/ U</italic><sub>3</sub> for a rotor of a given geometry has a constant value, and <italic>W</italic> is a function of the other two vectors. For the pulse period indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411435205">Figure 2</xref>, the requirement for an actively controlled turbine inlet then becomes a question of increasing the absolute flow velocity, <italic>C</italic>, to its maximum, which would be followed by an increase in turbine speed (manifested as rotor tip velocity, <italic>U</italic>, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411435205">Figure 3</xref>) so as to keep the incidence angle at an acceptable degree for efficient operation.

<p>The incidence angle (at the turbine rotor inlet) is defined by the angle difference between the absolute flow angle, β<sub>3</sub>, and the inlet blade angle <italic>β<sub>B</sub></italic>. From the Euler turbomachinery equation for a given mass flow rate, the end result due to regulation of the turbine inlet area in an active manner would be an increase in the available power, thus increasing turbine specific work. This implies that the rotor tip velocity does not stay at a constant level, but will eventually increase as a result of the increase in kinetic energy of the flow entering the turbine (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>θ</italic></sub>), i.e. due to momentum rise as a result of the increase of the tangential component of the velocity vector acting upon the turbine blades. By actively controlling the turbine inlet geometry throughout the period of an exhaust gas pulse, therefore, provides the option to either keep the incidence angle within the range stipulated previously (to the extent possible) or to increase momentum to the highest possible degree at the expense of efficiency (i.e. by moving outside the ideal incidence angle). In the first instance, better use is made of the available exhaust power, whereas in the second instance, more power is produced at the expense of having the engine providing more exhaust flow in the first place.</p>
<p>The effect of area restriction on power recovery through increase of the absolute flow velocity component described earlier is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087411435205">Figure 4</xref>.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411435205">Figure 5</xref>, the energy (enthalpy–entropy, <italic>h</italic>−<italic>s</italic>) evolution is provided, where it may be observed that the kinetic energy is small, initially, (at ‘a’), but increases substantially by point ‘b’. Between ‘b’ and ‘c’, isentropic expansion of the exhaust gases inside the cylinder continues to take place but by now, the piston has started to move up the cylinder and pumping (expulsion) work is also being applied on the exhaust gas by the piston. This process ends at point ‘c’. The remainder of the exhaust gases at that instant is being pumped out of the cylinder without any further free expansion taking place. Up to point ‘b’ (an arbitrary point usually coinciding with the pressure peak or just before it), the flow is sonic, while for the remainder of the pulse, the flow becomes subsonic. Another point to note in this exhaust process (cylinder/exhaust, manifold/turbine) interaction, is the level of kinetic energy availability variation through the pulse at different instants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411435205">Figure 5(b)</xref>). As soon as the valve opens, flow velocity is small and rapidly accelerating. The maximum velocity is attained at point ‘b’ (<italic>C</italic><sub>3b</sub><sup>2</sup>/2) and then drops to low levels by point ‘c’. The enthalpy drop (heat energy) availability or available work potential drops steadily as the exhaust process continues from point ‘a’, through ‘b’ to ‘c’ (Δ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>cyl</italic></sub>,<sub>a</sub> &gt; Δ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>cyl</italic></sub>,<sub>b</sub> &gt; Δ<italic>h</italic><sub><italic>cyl</italic></sub>,<sub>c</sub>).

<p>The VGT control system that provides this turbine inlet area adjustment does so according to engine demand, primarily, while taking into account engine and turbocharger limitations; however, the exhaust energy level flowing through the turbine is treated as a cycle-averaged quantity relating to an equivalent boost pressure. The highly dynamic nature of the exhaust gases in the periodic micro level (i.e. the maximum pressure difference between maximum and minimum pressure instants during the pulse, Δ<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>pulse,max</italic></sub> = P<italic><sub>pulse</sub></italic>,<italic><sub>max</sub></italic> − P<italic><sub>pulse</sub></italic>, <italic><sub>min</sub></italic>) is comparable in magnitude to the exhaust gas energy levels of transient engine operating changes. This energy source lends itself to the following definition of the active type of control for turbochargers and of the ACT as a system:</p>
<p><italic>Active control of an exhaust gas flow into a turbocharger turbine is defined as a <bold>method of operation</bold> of a turbine inlet mechanism in which a periodic turbine inlet area regulation can be provided by the mechanism at the exact rate, if so required, at which the exhaust gas is emitted – in the form of periodic flow – by an internal combustion engine and at a geometrical amplitude <bold>proportional</bold> to the amount of emitted exhaust energy, with the intent to raise the cycle-averaged energy content flowing through a turbocharger turbine, thereby increasing the power output of the turbine</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>An active control turbocharger is defined as a <bold>turbocharger system</bold> that is equipped with a turbine inlet area-regulating mechanism <bold>capable</bold> of applying an active method of control of the exhaust flow entering the turbine</italic>.</p>
<p>The ACT raises, by continuous turbine inlet area regulation throughout each exhaust cycle, the mean exhaust energy level, thus allowing, for a reasonably efficient machine, a higher power output than any comparable VGT. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411435205">Figure 2</xref>, it may be appreciated that keeping the same turbine inlet area at the peak of the upstream exhaust flow pressure, as in a typical VGT control scheme, while raising the pressure everywhere else in the cycle results in a ‘smoothing’ of the average exhaust cycle energy content upwards, towards its peak value, regardless of whether the peak value is ever achieved throughout the pulse period.</p>
<p>The choice of the term ‘active control turbocharger’ may seem odd in view of the fact that variable geometry mechanisms have been developed for the compressor side of the turbocharger as well as the turbine, whereas this project is concerned with providing active control to the turbine only. Instead of using the term ‘turbocharger’, it would seem that the term ‘turbine’ would be more appropriate. However, given that the method of active control, as defined earlier, concerns a high frequency, highly fluctuating, <italic>upstream</italic> flow; it becomes obvious that any reference to an ACT by definition means an active control turbine. However, the former term was selected as being far more descriptive of the specific application for which active control was intended (turbocharging) rather than using a broader term (turbine).</p>
<p>The ACT mechanism may claim additional novelty in its operating philosophy to an extent limited only by the possibilities of using an array of control strategies to more efficiently extract heat energy. VGTs have come a long way in terms of employment of efficient control strategies, but the scope of their improvement is different to ACTs. ACTs may involve different strategies to account for control input waveform, amplitude of operation and phasing.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, three areas in which ACT may be considered novel: method of operation, hardware (mechanism) and control strategy. Hardware issues and control strategies fall outside the scope of this paper. The method of operation, however, is analysed in the following sections that deal with all of the important ACT operational parameters and the way in which they shape and affect the method of operation.</p>

<title>ACT experimental testing</title>
<p>The prototype born out of the idea for ACT described above, was built and tested at the Imperial College turbocharger aerodynamic test facility. The test facility is a simulated reciprocating engine test bed for turbocharger testing. In this test facility, three screw compressors supply air at room temperature up to a maximum mass flow rate of 1.2 kg/s. A 76 kW heater stack is used to bring the air to the required test condition. The pulsations are generated by a pair of counter rotating plates situated upstream of the measurement inlet plane. The unsteady flow generated replicates an engine exhaust manifold, albeit operating in cold flow; the non-dimensional mass flow rate and speed parameters are correctly matched.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411435205">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main ACT components can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411435205">Figure 6</xref>. A nozzleless turbocharger turbine was modified to accept a flow restrictor for VGT testing. The flow restrictor was of carbon fibre reinforced plastic construction, providing adequate strength for ultra low weight against the high-pressure air flow used during testing – low flow restrictor weight being critical for the ACT in achieving good force performance. An electrodynamic shaker was used to drive the flow restrictor in ACT mode. The shaker was chosen so as to be able to provide the required force for the limiting frequencies and amplitudes expected during testing (60 Hz and up to 21.5 mm, respectively).</p>

<title>Operation</title>
<p>An electrodynamic shaker was connected to the lower part of the yoke through an adjustable lever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087411435205">Figure 6</xref>) used to set the flow restrictor position (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>VGT</italic></sub>) in VGT mode or the null point (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>null</italic></sub>) in ACT mode. For VGT testing once <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>VGT</italic></sub> was set, its value did not change through either steady or unsteady testing, while for ACT testing, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>null</italic></sub> was set at the midpoint of the flow restrictor oscillation amplitude, between the maximum intended open flow restrictor area point (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>VGT</italic></sub> = <italic>θ</italic><sub>max</sub>) and the minimum area available.</p>
<p>The amplitude, frequency and form of the controlling signal were controlled by a function waveform generator, which commanded a control input in the form of a selected waveform to a 100 W amplifier, as well as to the controlling computer. From the amplifier, the signal was routed to the shaker and transformed into motion of the flow restrictor. The shaker was always in phase with the inlet pressure signal by manually comparing and adjusting the two waveforms.</p>
<p>For VGT testing, <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>VGT</italic></sub> was set by adjusting the lever only.

<p>The definition of ACT given in the previous section in addition to the implications of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087411435205">Figure 2</xref> point out to a number of minimum parameters required to effect active control of the exhaust gas flow.

<title>Waveform type</title>
<p>In so far as the ACT type of motion that is required is concerned, this is generic, regardless of the eventual choice of flow restrictor mechanism; the type of motion carried out by the mechanism in either angular or linear displacement terms is a sinusoidal function of time (linear or rotational harmonic oscillation). A sinusoidal waveform (sinewave in the text) was preferred even though it does not offer the best possible match between itself and a typical exhaust pressure profile. A flow restrictor mechanism actuated according to a sinusoidal waveform input undergoes harmonic motion, which means that the maximum and minimum displacements in its periodic motion are reached at the same time from the point of rest.

<p>The amplitude, α, is equal to Δθ/2 or half the amplitude difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative displacement of the mechanism about its point of rest (called the null point). At this point of rest the phase, <italic>φ</italic>, is equal to zero (or multiples of 2π when considering a phase more than one cycle away from the start of the oscillation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411435205">Figure 8</xref> shows a typical pressure profile over one exhaust pulse period (from exhaust valve opening (EVO) to exhaust valve closing (EVC)) and the main parameters discussed here and previously are presented again. In addition, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411435205">Figure 8(a)</xref>, the original conception of the ACT (sinusoidal area regulation) is presented superimposed on the pressure profile (all areas of the ACT, VGT and FGT traces are plotted on the right-hand <italic>y</italic>-axis). From this illustration, it may be appreciated that the constant VGT area for a single steady-state pulse coincides with the ACT area at its maximum. The peak of the sinewave in ACT operation coincides with the equivalent area schedule in the VGT mode of operation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411435205">Figure 8(a)</xref>, the dashed line denotes an equivalent triangular waveform of the same phasing as the sinusoidal waveform for comparison. It is obvious that no other waveforms provide the dynamic capability of the sinewave due to their non-harmonic behaviour. The demands on acceleration and deceleration from the actuator–flow restrictor mechanism are far greater in the triangular waveform case. Other waveform choices are even more demanding. The sinewave seems, therefore, to be a reasonable compromise between exhaust energy recovery benefit and space and cost of installation of an adequately capable actuator.</p>

This value coincides of course to the area obtained had the mechanism been at rest at its null position (point).</p>
<p>The main reason pressure is primarily used in ACT nomenclature (and in the figures so far) instead (but not in exclusion) of other thermodynamic parameters is that it constitutes the bulk of the energy transported to the turbine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411435205">1</xref></sup> The turbine, being primarily a momentum transfer device, is affected by both pressure and mass flow rate levels and to a much smaller extent by temperature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411435205">2</xref></sup> showing that by far the largest component of the first two is pressure.</p>

<p>The frequency of operation of the ACT should be the same as engine frequency, although, as will become apparent below and according to its definition, this is not a prerequisite.

<title>Amplitude</title>
<p>Amplitude, α, refers to the measure of the turbine inlet area restricting mechanism’s magnitude of oscillation, i.e. magnitude of the maximum displacement of the mechanism from its point of rest during one cycle. The term ‘amplitude’ as applied in this project is used as a simplification of the total traversed distance covered by the turbine inlet area restricting mechanism oscillating between the maximum and minimum values of its sinusoidal motion. This term is denoted by Δθ, which is equal to <italic>2α</italic>, or twice the amplitude, α (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1468087411435205">equation (6)</xref>).</p>
<p>The very significance of the concept of ACT was pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411435205">Figure 7</xref>; if it was a case of providing an extra large area restriction (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411435205">Figure 7(b)</xref>), then it could have been considered as a VGT, which can provide additional area restriction for a given engine operating condition. However, the characteristics of the flow are very dynamic and when comparing a generic VGT case (or FGT case, for that instance), it must be assumed that the VGT line in dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411435205">Figure 7</xref> already indicates an optimum scenario (and this was indeed the initial conception on which the ACT was developed); the constant turbine inlet area provision that the VGT provides is the most beneficial for the theoretical engine operating point under consideration. Any further constant area restriction would, already, move beyond this optimum VGT point and is certain to create losses through excessive backpressure and turbine efficiency drop. The alternation between a minimum and a maximum area in ACT serves the purpose of alternatively taking advantage of the lower energy levels during an exhaust pulse period by minimising the area before increasing the available turbine inlet area when the energy is increased during the same pulse so as not to create engine backpressure and overboost problems and vice versa. However, this approach is limiting in scope since the operating philosophy of the two turbocharger types is substantially different. For an ACT to be beneficial, it needs to provide varying turbine inlet area regulation in a periodic way, even if the area restriction occurs in phase with the peak parts of the pulse (i.e. unlike the initial conception with which this project started). This is because of the complex and dominant nature of pressure wave dynamics and differing effect of different exhaust manifold lengths and shapes, which make the investigation into recovering energy from any part of the pulse rather worthwhile.</p>

<title>Phase</title>
<p>Phase, <italic>φ</italic>, is one of the two principal parameters – the other being amplitude – upon which ACT performance largely depends. The goal of applying active control should be flexible enough to consider either <italic>smoothing</italic> of the pulsating exhaust pressure profile or <italic>exciting the</italic> oscillations <italic>in the exhaust pressure profile even further</italic>; the goal in this case can be broadly differentiated as either performance increase or emissions reduction depending on the purpose for which an engine is designed.</p>
<p>In this project, the initial conception of ACT, apart from having a maximum inlet area limitation at peak oscillation equal to the VGT constant area also included a phase limitation in that the maximum amplitude (in terms of the maximum area in the oscillation) should, concurrently, occur at the phase (degrees of crankshaft angle rotation) after EVO at which the typical pressure pulse peak occurred. Peak pressure typically is taken to occur 60° after EVO, and this value was used as a starting reference point to develop the idea further, even though the phase at which peak pressure occurs can vary quite substantially depending on the engine operating point and exhaust manifold characteristics under consideration, which determine the exhaust pressure pulse characteristics. In order to take full advantage of the flexibility offered by active control, it is important to consider other phase settings where the minimum inlet area during ACT flow restrictor fluctuation occurs at very different phase settings from the 240° phase already mentioned. Four different out-of-phase (<italic>φ</italic>) values of the sine wave minimum area in relation to the EVO time are presented as reference points in the pulse with significant features: 30°, 60°, 90° and 240°. The selection was targeted at covering all possible areas of available energy in an exhaust pulse, from the instant where energy content peaked (60°), to the instant where it has already started to significantly dissipate (240°).</p>
<p>The 30° case was selected to represent the blowdown part of the exhaust process where pressure difference between cylinder content and turbine is very large, and therefore there is a large area for improvement. The 60° case was selected since the cylinder and turbine pressures have not yet equalised (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087411435205">Figure 5</xref>), and there is still a good margin for pressure increase and because being the phase setting, where the pressure pulse peaks, it offers the broadest chance for maximum energy recovery. The 90° case is similar to the 30° case with the minimum area occurring at a point where there is still a fairly substantial amount of energy to recover, but in an opposite way to the 30° case, the exhaust process is rapidly reducing its exhaust energy levels. The 240° case is the most conservative of all since the ACT in this operating setting is attempting to recover energy from a part of the pulse where it is least available.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1468087411435205">equation (6)</xref>, the position of the mechanism at any instant in its sinusoidal motion was described. For the purposes of illustration, the out-of-phase settings as described above are referred to simply as the ‘240’ or ‘ACT240’ case, the ‘90’ or ‘ACT90’ case and so on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087411435205">Figure 10</xref> illustrates the four out-of-phase settings in relation to EVO as used in this project.</p>

The FGT case is represented by a constant line of value 1 (100%), while the VGT case is represented by the constant 0.384 line, which is also the maximum amplitude attained by the flow restrictor during its sinusoidal motion, with the minimum being 0.173. The minimum amplitudes of the two ACT cases, as may be observed, correspond with the 90° and 240° instants of the pulse period.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087411435205">Figure 11(b)</xref> illustrates the rise in ER as the throat area is restricted from fully open (FGT) to a maximum achieved by the ACT90 case. The ACT240 and the VGT cases appear very similar, and the ACT240 case exceeds the VGT levels slightly (up to a maximum of 0.1) in the second half of the pulse period. The ERs start at the same level for the first 30° crank angle. The effect of the ACT90 case is evident in that it is able to tap into the considerable energy levels of the second half of the pulse period (from 60° to 120°). The reason it is able to extract significant energy levels (observed by the ER rise of the ACT case between 60° and 240°) is that significant throat restriction is still present throughout this high energy availability region. Maximum energy recovery occurred at ACT60 and reached 7.51%, while ACT240, as was expected yielded the least result at 2.56% of power increase.</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087411435205">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087411435205">Figure 12</xref> illustrates a similar trend in the actual power recovered as a result of the ER increase resulting from the area variation throughout the pulse period studied. The relative inefficiency of the sliding wall mechanism resulted in less pronounced yet important increases in the power recovered, as discussed in the previous paragraph. The increases in power were achieved despite the fact that the sliding wall mechanism resulted in drops in efficiency in the range of anything up to 30% depending on the PR at the most effective phase setting (ACT60). In addition, the power absorption, of the ACT actuator was usually lower than 100 W and generally increased with engine frequency depending on the required amplitude of nozzle motion. Given that for some cases, the increase in power was less than 100 W, the ACT was beneficial for those cases where the available isentropic work upstream of the nozzle was above 4.4 kW. Below that level of available power, any increase in power was more than counteracted by the power absorption requirement of the actuator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411435205">12</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The relative inefficiency of the sliding wall mechanism resulted in less pronounced yet important increases in the power recovered, as discussed in the previous paragraph. The least pronounced effect was, unsurprisingly, the ACT240 case where a small increase in power was in fact achieved (above); the conclusion from this being that the original concept of recovering energy while the pulse is well into the blowdown period of exhaust valve open time forces the nozzle to try and raise available energy from a period in the pulse where the availability of such energy is too low (at or very near ambient levels).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The aim of this paper was to present the concept of ACT. It presented the motivation behind its development, which involved both an ever-increasing demand for increased power output out of a given size of engine and the continuously stringent emissions legislation, which demands new solutions, and showed the potential of active control as a theoretical idea by giving the fundamental physical background before identifying the implications of its use as a unique engine boosting device. In addition, relevant experimental data were presented, where appropriate, to enhance understanding of the effect of ACT operation.</p>
<p>Active control of an exhaust gas flow into a turbocharger turbine was defined as a <bold>method of operation</bold> of a turbine inlet mechanism in which a periodic turbine inlet area regulation can be provided by the mechanism at the rate at which the exhaust gas is emitted by an internal combustion engine and at a geometrical amplitude <bold>proportional</bold> to the amount of emitted exhaust energy, with the intent to raise the cycle-averaged energy content flowing through a turbocharger turbine thereby increasing the power output of the turbine.</p>
<p>There are three areas in which ACT may be considered novel: method of operation (heat energy extraction throughout each emitted exhaust pulse), hardware (mechanisms able to support the novel method of operation) and control strategy.</p>
<p>The three areas of novelty are manifested in the flexibility the ACT provides the engine with, by virtue of five principal parameters that constitute further ‘degrees of freedom’ in the regulation of turbine inlet area over more conventional designs such as the VGT. These parameters include the type of waveform control input ‘followed’ by the turbine inlet area flow restrictor during its motion, the amplitude and phase of this motion, the ability to oscillate the restrictor at the frequency of the pumped exhaust pulses and, finally, the ability to adjust a null area setting to respond to transient engine changes, much like a VGT.</p>
<p>Experimental data showed an increase in energy recovered at different phase settings of between 2.5% and 7.5%. The effect of amplitude was also important, with Δ<italic>θ<sub>ACT</sub></italic> providing higher power recovery as its value increased since the efficiency achieved was inversely proportional to an increase in turbine inlet area restriction.</p>
