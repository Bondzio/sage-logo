<p><italic>Background</italic>: Older patients require more protein than younger patients to achieve anabolism, but age-associated renal dysfunction may limit the amount of protein that can be safely provided. This study examined whether older, critically ill trauma patients with obesity can safely achieve nitrogen equilibrium and have positive clinical outcomes similar to younger obese patients during hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy. <italic>Methods</italic>: Adult patients with traumatic injury and obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), admitted to the Presley Trauma Center from January 2009 to April 2011, were evaluated.

Patients were stratified as older (≥60 years) or younger (18–59 years). <italic>Results</italic>: Seventy-four patients (33 older, 41 younger) were studied. Older and younger patients were similar in BMI and injury severity. When given isonitrogenous regimens (2.3 ± 0.2 g/kg IBW/d), nitrogen balance was similar between older and younger patients (−3.2 ± 5.7 g/d vs −4.9 ± 9.0 g/d; <italic>P</italic> = .363). Older patients experienced a greater mean serum urea nitrogen concentration than younger patients (30 ± 14 mg/dL vs 20 ± 9 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> = .001) during nutrition therapy.

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>There is concern among clinicians regarding the safety and efficacy of hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy for older patients with obesity. The findings of this study indicate that critically ill older patients with traumatic injury and obesity experience an equivalent net protein response and similar clinical outcomes when given hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy analogous to younger patients. Although older patients experienced greater daily serum urea nitrogen concentrations than younger patients, none of the patients developed uremia or required protein restriction or hemodialysis. These data document the safety and efficacy of hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy for critically ill older patients with obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The obesity epidemic in the United States has transcended into an expanding global epidemic. The International Obesity Taskforce estimates that currently 1 billion adults are overweight and 475 million are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112466894">1</xref></sup> Approximately one-third of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112466894">2</xref></sup> Obesity complicates nutrition therapy for the critically ill patient as it compounds the metabolic response to severe illness and potentially augments the consequences of overfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112466894">3</xref></sup> Resultantly, hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112466894">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112466894"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112466894"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112466894"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112466894">8</xref></sup> is emerging as the standard of practice for the critically ill patient with obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112466894">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concern is often expressed by clinicians regarding the use of high-protein intakes for older patients since the glomerular filtration rate progressively declines with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112466894">10</xref></sup> Paradoxically, nitrogen balance (NBAL) studies have shown that older adults require at least the same if not greater protein intake than young adults to achieve nitrogen equilibrium or a positive NBAL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112466894">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112466894">12</xref></sup> Substantial evidence to support or refute the efficacy and safety for hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy for older critically ill patients with obesity is limited. One small study in surgical patients with obesity suggested that older patients appeared to have reduced efficacy from hypocaloric parenteral nutrition (PN), as evidenced by a trend toward a less positive NBAL than younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112466894">13</xref></sup> The intent of this study was to examine if differences in nutrition response and clinical outcomes exist between older and younger critically ill patients with obesity and traumatic injury given hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112466894" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Critically ill adult patients, 18 years or older, who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries and were admitted to the ICUs of the Presley Trauma Center of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, Tennessee, from April 2009 to April 2011 were retrospectively identified for potential inclusion into the study. Patients were referred to the Nutrition Support Service for continuous PN or enteral nutrition (EN) therapy. Other entry criteria included the presence of obesity as defined by a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. All patients were prescribed a hypocaloric, high-protein (21–25 kcal/kg ideal body weight [IBW]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112466894">14</xref></sup>/d and ≥2 g/kg IBW/d of protein) regimen for at least 10 days and had an NBAL determination. Patients excluded from study entry were those with liver dysfunction (cirrhosis or hepatitis), gastrointestinal malabsorptive disorders, pregnancy, thermal injury, acute kidney injury according to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease) criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112466894">15</xref></sup> chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, an ad libitum oral intake, or those who received corticosteroid or pentobarbital pharmacotherapy. Blood glucose concentrations were maintained between 70 and 150 mg/dL by omission of nonnutrition intravenous (IV) dextrose sources, provision of a low-carbohydrate feeding regimen, and insulin therapy when necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112466894">16</xref></sup> Patients were stratified into 2 age-dependent groups: 60 years and older or 18–59 years.</p>
<p>If the patient’s estimated Injury Severity Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112466894">17</xref></sup> (ISS) was &gt;20, an enteral formula (1.3 kcal/mL, 78 g protein/L) containing glutamine, arginine, dietary nucleotides, and ω-3 fatty acids was initiated and given for 10 days before changing to a conventional polymeric or diabetic formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112466894">18</xref></sup> Patients with an estimated ISS ≤20 received a conventional polymeric (1 kcal/mL, 62 g protein/L) or diabetic formula (1.2 kcal/mL, 60 g protein/L). Liquid protein supplements were also given in 30- to 45-g increments to meet protein goals. A liquid multivitamin preparation was given daily if the goal enteral feeding infusion rate did not provide the dietary reference intake for vitamins. Calories were further decreased and protein intake maintained for those who received a propofol infusion containing 10% lipid emulsion for &gt;2 days while receiving nutrition therapy. Enteral feeding was begun at 20–30 mL/h and advanced by 20- to 30-mL/h increments daily as tolerated until the desired goal rate was achieved. For patients fed into the stomach, gastric residuals were checked every 6 hours. If the gastric residual volume was &gt;200 mL, the EN was stopped, and the residual volume was placed back into the stomach and rechecked 4 hours later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112466894">19</xref></sup> For patients with persistent elevated gastric residual volumes with abdominal distension or vomiting, prokinetic therapy with either metoclopramide or combination metoclopramide-erythromycin therapy was employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112466894">19</xref></sup> The patient’s abdomen was assessed and the patient was interviewed regarding any gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms at least once daily by a member of the Nutrition Support Service.</p>
<p>PN was given if the patient was unable to tolerate EN despite prokinetic pharmacotherapy and postpyloric feeding was not possible, was hemodynamically unstable receiving vasopressor agents, or had a contraindication to the provision of EN. The PN regimen was designed to be low in both glucose and lipid content and enriched with amino acids. The PN regimen provided at least 200 g of dextrose daily. The amount of IV lipid emulsion given was primarily dependent on the difficulty of glycemic control, whereby glucose calories were substituted with lipid calories and based on the patient’s ability to effectively clear the exogenous triglycerides.</p>
<p>Serum laboratories were obtained from each patient on a daily basis. The blood was obtained at approximately 0200 hours via an indwelling venous catheter while the patient lay supine in bed. Laboratory tests were ordered by the patient’s primary service or the Nutrition Support Service and performed by the hospital laboratory as part of the patient’s routine clinical care. Demographic, clinical outcomes, and nutrition data were collected. Clinical outcome data were collected, including duration of hospital stay, ICU stay, and days of mechanical ventilation. The number of days patients received antibiotic therapy was monitored; no effort was made to ascertain whether the therapy was empiric or therapeutic. Infectious events such as sepsis or pneumonia were recorded. Pneumonia was evident by clinical signs and symptoms and confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage with the presence of ≥10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units/mL. Patients experiencing sepsis were identified according to the American College of Chest Physicians consensus definitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112466894">20</xref></sup> The ISS was obtained from the Trauma Registry at the Regional Medical Center at Memphis.</p>
<p>A 24-hour urine collection for determination of nitrogen balance and creatinine clearance was conducted during the observation period. Urine samples were assayed for urea nitrogen and creatinine by the hospital laboratory. The urine collection was considered reliable if the measured creatinine clearance was ≥90% of predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112466894">21</xref></sup> and the laboratory volume measurement and nursing record of urine output were within approximately 10% of each other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112466894">22</xref></sup> NBAL was calculated according to the following formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112466894">23</xref></sup>:</p>

<p>Two grams of nitrogen was an assumption of integumental and insensible nitrogen losses. If a change in serum urea nitrogen concentration (SUN) &gt;3 mg/dL occurred during the balance study, body urea nitrogen appearance was included in the nitrogen loss as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112466894">24</xref></sup> Nitrogen equilibrium was defined as an NBAL within −4 g/d to +4 g/d. Positive NBAL was defined as greater than +4 g/d. A negative NBAL was indicated by less than −4 g/d.</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot for Windows version 11.2 (Systat Software, Inc, Chicago, IL). Data were evaluated for normality of distribution by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Independent variables were compared by applying the <italic>t</italic> test for unpaired variables if the data were normally distributed or the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test if not normally distributed. Differences between groups for nominal data were analyzed by either χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112466894">2</xref></sup> analysis or Fisher exact test. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for assessing serial data among groups with post hoc, pairwise multiple comparison procedures conducted by the Holm-Sidak method. Goodness of fit of the linear model between 2 variables was assessed by Pearson product moment correlation analysis. Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All statistical analyses were 2-tailed. A probability value (<italic>P</italic>) of .05 or less indicated statistical significance.</p>
<p>The study was approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Research Office of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Because all measurements were performed as part of the routine clinical care of the patient and because confidentiality procedures for the patient were maintained, the requirement for informed consent was waived.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>Seventy-four patients with critical illness, traumatic injuries, and obesity, admitted to the ICUs of the trauma center and who received nutrition therapy, were enrolled into the study. Most of the patients were male and admitted to the hospital as a result of injuries from a motor vehicle collision. Thirty-three patients were older than 59 years, and 41 patients were aged 18–59 years. The older age group comprised 22 patients who were aged 60–69 years, 9 were 70–79 years, and 2 were 81 and 82 years. The severity of injuries, assessed by the ISS, was similar for both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112466894">Table 1</xref>). Admission serum albumin concentration was significantly lower for the older patients (2.9 ± 0.8 g/dL vs 3.4 ± 0.8 g/dL; <italic>P</italic> = .013). Although there were no significant differences in BMI between age groups, the older patients had more obesity-associated comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (33% vs 12%; <italic>P</italic> = .045) and hyperlipidemia (30% vs 7%; <italic>P</italic> = .014). Measured creatinine clearance was 20–25 mL/min greater than predicted for both groups, presumably as a result of the hyperdynamic milieu of critical illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112466894">22</xref></sup> Measured creatinine clearance was decreased by 56 mL/min for older patients compared with younger patients (<italic>P</italic> = .001) despite similar serum creatinine concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112466894">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Nutrition Therapy</title>
<p>The majority of patients (81%) received EN. The remaining patients received PN and were ultimately transitioned to EN except for 1 patient who continued to receive PN. Twenty-six patients (43% of those who were initially fed by the enteral route) were given the specialized glutamine, arginine, dietary nucleotides, and ω-3 fatty acid–enriched formula, whereas 15 (25%) and 12 (20%) patients were given the “diabetic” and conventional high-protein, polymeric formula, respectively. One patient (2%) was given a concentrated 2-kcal/mL formulation. All enterally fed patients required liquid protein supplements, given in 30- or 45-g increments, usually 2 or 3 times daily per the feeding tube. Nutrition therapy was started soon after hospital admission and continued for a mean duration of 30 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref>). Average caloric intake during the observation period was 18 kcal/kg IBW/d (range, 11–25 kcal/kg IBW/d) for younger patients compared with 21 kcal/kg IBW/d (range, 11–33 kcal/kg IBW/d) for the older patient group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .002). Average protein intake was also significantly less (<italic>P</italic> = .016) for the younger patient group at 1.9 g/kg IBW/d (range, 1.2–2.4 g/kg IBW/d) vs 2.1 g/kg IBW/d (range, 1.4–2.6 g/kg IBW/d) for the older group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref>). Average intakes were often less than what was initially prescribed but not unexpected given the frequent interruptions of intragastric enteral feeding due to orthopedic and other surgical procedures for the critically ill patient with multiple traumatic injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112466894">25</xref></sup> Three patients received 4.9 ± 0.5 kcal/kg IBW/d of IV lipid emulsion from propofol therapy for longer than 2 days (range, 3–7 days) during nutrition therapy, necessitating a temporary reduction in caloric intake by decreasing the enteral feeding rate while maintaining protein intake with additional liquid protein supplementation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metabolic management of critically ill patients with obesity is challenging. The presence of obesity-associated comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypercapnia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease further confounds nutrition therapy, which is already complicated by the metabolic response to critical illness. In an effort to reduce the risk of exacerbating comorbidities of obesity by overfeeding, to facilitate optimal glycemic control, and to promote net protein anabolism, some clinicians have employed hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112466894">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112466894"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112466894"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112466894"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112466894">8</xref></sup> This technique has recently been recommended in a national summit conference on nutrition therapy for the severely obese, critically ill patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112466894">9</xref></sup> Despite its emerging acceptance into clinical practice, there is a paucity of data to support this therapy. This lack of supporting literature is particularly evident for the older, critically ill patient with obesity.</p>
<p>Our data indicated that nutrition and clinical responses to hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy were similar between older and younger patients. Mean NBAL was not significantly different between the older and younger age groups while receiving an isonitrogenous nutrition regimen of 2.3 g/kg IBW/d. Nitrogen equilibrium or a positive NBAL was achieved in about half of the patients for both age groups. Changes in serum prealbumin concentration for each group paralleled each other. Older patients had a significantly greater daily SUN concentration than younger patients during the observation period, but none of the patients exhibited signs or symptoms of uremia or required protein or electrolyte restriction or hemodialysis. Clinical outcomes, including ICU and hospital length of stay, days of mechanical ventilation, presence of sepsis, and episodes of pneumonia, were not significantly different between age groups.</p>
<p>Older age poses some unique challenges as well as potential limitations for the use of hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy. The efficiency of protein utilization differs between older and younger patients. Muscle protein synthesis rate is increased following protein supplementation in older patients, but at a lower rate than in younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112466894">26</xref></sup> Provision of an IV amino acid–glucose mixture demonstrated a blunted protein synthetic response to hyperaminoacidemia and hyperinsulinemia in older patients when compared with younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112466894">27</xref></sup> In a retrospective study by Liu and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112466894">13</xref></sup> older surgical patients were found to have a lower mean NBAL than younger patients (3.4 ± 3.9 vs 0.2 ± 5.0 g/d; <italic>P</italic> = .06) during isonitrogenous hypocaloric nutrition therapy. However, it was possible that insufficient protein intake (eg, ~1.9 g/kg IBW/d vs ~1.8 g/kg IBW/d for the younger patients) was provided. The study’s interpretation was also limited by the small number of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112466894">13</xref></sup> These data warranted this investigation concerning the use of hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy for critically ill, older patients with obesity.</p>
<p>Our data indicated that when patients are given adequate protein intake (eg, 2.3 ± 0.2 g/kg IBW/d), equivalent nitrogen balances were achieved during hypocaloric nutrition therapy among older and younger critically ill patients with traumatic injuries and obesity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112466894">Figure 2</xref>). About half (55% and 56%) of the patients in each age group achieved nitrogen equilibrium or a positive NBAL. Mean nitrogen balances in our study (−3.2 g/d and −4.9 g/d for the older and younger age groups, respectively) were similar to our previous findings regarding protein requirements of nonobese patients with critical illness and trauma given 28 ± 5 kcal/kg/d and 2.2 ± 0.1 g/kg/d of protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112466894">22</xref></sup> Taken together, these data reinforce the importance of providing an appropriate protein intake for obese and nonobese critically ill patients with traumatic injuries.</p>
<p>Concern is often expressed by clinicians about prescribing aggressive protein intakes to older patients as they are at risk for having reduced kidney function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112466894">28</xref></sup> Despite similar serum creatinine concentrations between age groups in our study, older patients had a significantly lower measured creatinine clearance by about 50 mL/min than the younger patients (<italic>P</italic> = .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112466894">Table 1</xref>). There is concern that the renal vasodilatory response to an amino acid load or renal functional reserve is blunted in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112466894">29</xref></sup> It has been documented that preservation of renal functional reserve occurs until age 80 years in both men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112466894">29</xref></sup> Only 2 of the older patients in our study were older than 80 years (81 and 82 years, respectively). Measured creatinine clearance was 20 mL/min greater than predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112466894">21</xref></sup> for each age group (<italic>P</italic> = .01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112466894">Table 1</xref>) and was likely reflective of the patients’ renal functional reserve responsiveness to the combined effects of the hyperdynamic-hypercatabolic condition associated with critical illness and a high protein intake.</p>
<p>Although the decrease in glomerular filtration rate that occurs with aging is much less than necessary to elicit symptoms of renal failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112466894">28</xref></sup> a significantly greater SUN concentration for each day was observed for the older patient group despite receiving similar amounts of protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112466894">Figure 3</xref>). SUN concentration is dependent on multiple renal and nonrenal factors that influence its production, metabolism, and excretion. A substantial increase in urea nitrogen body pool by the older group may be due to achievement of maximal net protein efficiency with excess protein contributing to urea production, increased ureagenesis secondary to protein catabolism associated with critical illness, an inability by the kidneys to completely compensate for excessive urea production, decreased renal perfusion from hypovolemia (eg, prerenal azotemia due to sepsis, reduced cardiac output, excessive diuresis, or increased insensible fluid losses), or a combination of these metabolic aberrations. None of the patients had clinical or laboratory evidence of renal failure requiring hemodialysis or implementation of a nutrition regimen designed for patients with significant renal impairment (eg, fluid, electrolyte, and protein restriction).</p>
<p>With increased age, the prevalence of insulin resistance, decreased glucose oxidation, and diabetes mellitus increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112466894">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112466894"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112466894">32</xref></sup> Older patients had a clinically irrelevant but significantly greater average serum glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref>). In addition, more patients with a history of diabetes mellitus were older, and more patients in the older group also required a continuous IV insulin infusion. Resultantly, the older group received more insulin than the younger group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .003; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112466894">Table 2</xref>). Because insulin resistance has been associated with traumatic injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112466894">33</xref></sup> aging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112466894">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112466894">32</xref></sup> and traumatic injuries in older patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112466894">31</xref></sup> the difference in exogenous insulin dose between age groups likely did not have an appreciable anabolic effect on the promotion of improvement in nitrogen accretion. The implementation of hypocaloric, high-protein PN has been previously shown to improve glycemic control in obese hospitalized patients when compared with those who received eucaloric feeding with greater amounts of nonprotein calories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112466894">5</xref></sup> We hypothesize that similar findings would occur for older critically ill patients with obesity when provided hypoenergetic therapy compared with eucaloric intakes; however, further investigation is warranted.</p>
<p>Historical data indicated that when hospitalized obese surgical patients are given isonitrogenous nutrition therapy, those who received fewer calories had similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112466894">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112466894">5</xref></sup> or improved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112466894">8</xref></sup> clinical outcomes compared with those who received more nonprotein calories. The mortality rate for the older patients tended to be higher than that for the younger patients in our study (15% vs 5%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112466894">Table 3</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .231); however, this trend was not unexpected given the impact of advanced age on survivability following severe traumatic injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112466894">34</xref></sup> Other clinical outcomes such as duration of ICU and hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and prevalence of sepsis and pneumonia were not significantly different between age groups even when adjusted for differing trends in mortality rates between age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112466894">Table 3</xref>). These data indicate a lack of any detrimental effects on clinical outcomes for older patients who received hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy.</p>
<p>Evaluating demographic, nutrition, and laboratory variables according to survivability, those who died were significantly older than those who lived (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112466894">Table 4</xref>). There was no difference in energy or protein intakes or in receiving PN vs EN between those who survived and died. However, those who survived were more likely to achieve nitrogen equilibrium (NBAL −4 g/d or better) than those with a negative NBAL worse than −4 g/d (<italic>P</italic> = .040; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112466894">Table 4</xref>) while receiving similar mean protein intakes of 2.3 g/kg IBW/d. These data suggest that those who died experienced a higher level of protein catabolism in response to critical illness that was not detected by conventional markers. It is unclear whether providing additional protein intake to those in negative NBAL would have significantly improved NBAL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112466894">22</xref></sup> during hypocaloric, high- protein therapy or altered survival or influenced other clinical outcomes. In addition, none of the patients who died received a specialized EN formulation containing glutamine, arginine, dietary nucleotides, and ω-3 fatty acids. It has been suggested that obesity may be an arginine-depleted condition due to observed increases in plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine relative to L-arginine concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112466894">35</xref></sup> Despite a greater ISS score for those who received the specialized formulation compared with those who received the conventional polymeric formulas (34 vs 24, respectively), clinical longitudinal outcomes such as hospital and ICU length of stay between both EN formula groups were not significantly different. It is unclear whether this effect was due to a specialized EN formulation supplemented with arginine, the impact of the specialized formula in general as observed in other trauma patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112466894">18</xref></sup> or a coincidental finding due to the low number of patients who died in this study. Further study regarding the impact of nitrogen intake and the influence of a specialized enteral nutrition formulation for obese, critically ill patients upon survival is warranted.</p>
<p>This study has its limitations. It is still not entirely clear when hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy is indicated for older patients with critical illness and obesity. In contrast to younger adults, the relative risk for mortality associated with increases in BMI declines in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112466894">36</xref></sup> One-year survival for elderly nursing home patients demonstrated an inverse relationship between BMI and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112466894">37</xref></sup> Thus, it has been suggested that the “optimal” body weight may be higher in older populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112466894">38</xref></sup> and weight loss may not be desirable in older patients who are overweight or mildly obese unless they are experiencing medical complications associated with their obesity. The retrospective study design, as well as the heterogeneity in nutrition therapy (eg, PN vs EN) or EN formulation (eg, diets containing glutamine, arginine, ω-3 fatty acids, or conventional polymeric formulations) given to patients in each age group, is also a limitation as it cannot be ascertained whether a specific type of enteral formula may be advantageous for this population. NBAL studies have inherent limitations. NBAL determinations are generally fraught with error in overestimating nitrogen intake and underestimating losses, thereby leading to an erroneously greater net balance than actually experienced. In addition, NBAL reflects only the net difference between intake and output. It does not reveal information regarding nitrogen distribution, synthesis, and catabolism among tissues and organs. Despite these shortcomings, the NBAL technique continues to serve as the basis for the determination of protein requirements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112466894">39</xref></sup> and is commonly employed in clinical practice. Finally, it would be useful to know how hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy influences measured body composition changes for both younger and older populations with obesity during critical illness.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Older patients with traumatic injuries, critical illness, and obesity responded favorably to hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy analogous to younger patients. When given adequate isonitrogenous intakes, both age groups experienced an equivalent NBAL with about half of the patients from each age group achieving nitrogen equilibrium. Both age groups demonstrated parallel changes in serum prealbumin concentrations and similar clinical outcomes in response to hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy. Older patients experienced greater daily SUN concentrations than younger patients and are at greater risk for developing azotemia. Close monitoring of older patients who receive hypocaloric, high-protein nutrition therapy is warranted.</p>
