<p>This article focuses on two revelatory moments I experienced during hospital-based fieldwork.

<p>One evening when I was about nine my father, a suburban doctor, brought out a mysterious, upright, polished wooden box. After he placed it carefully on the kitchen table he reached inside and drew out a strange black object. ‘It’s a microscope’, he explained. Plucking a hair from my head, he placed it upon a glass ledge, gesturing me to look. I was shocked. Those weird, knobby trunks looked alive, and certainly nothing like the hairs I knew. Fascination and excitement swept over me. That night the microscope revealed worlds within a world, sights normally out of sight.</p>
<p>A few short years later my father was a corpse. It was past midnight at home and all seven of us children were asleep. My mother woke my older brother and me to tell us he had died and to come and say goodbye. My father lay in bed, dressed in his pyjamas, seemingly asleep. The bedclothes were still rumpled from my mother’s frantic efforts to press him back into life. I stood frozen for a long moment, then was ushered from the room. We sat waiting for dawn, a shocked grief reverberating through the house. A few days later, the face I gazed upon was too pale to be my father. I knew it, but somehow it wasn’t him at all.</p>
<p>Some decades later I found myself behind the closed doors of the Department of Anatomical Pathology (AP) of a large public hospital, ‘Hillside’, in Melbourne, Australia. Behind its walls, microscopes, portions of human tissue, and dead bodies abounded, for these are the basic working tools of anatomical pathology. I was there as an anthropologist seeking to uncover the mystery of the disappearing autopsy. During 18 months of fieldwork, the microscopic sphere of the human body, the ambivalent status of the human corpse, and the mysteries of death were at the forefront. As I engaged with the scientific wonders and social challenges of this research, those childhood memories were to become an echo in more contemporary, revelatory moments. I came to more fully understand the interrelationship between the life worlds of the anthropologist and her connections with others in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468794112447723">Unnithan-Kumar and De Neve, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article I focus on two fieldwork moments. The first, involving a microscope, was relatively minor. But it offered me a glimpse into the sensory intellectuality that attracts some doctors to the specialty of anatomical pathology. The second moment proved more profound. In presenting a more complex sensorial experience, it offered me a gestalt-shift of insight into the capacity of pathologists to work with human remains, to practise their unique craft. Both events were exciting. Each opened a doorway to the sequestered science of death – the <italic>macroscopy</italic> and the <italic>microscopy</italic> upon which anatomical pathology is built – and the enervating emotions that support practitioners who do this work.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468794112447723">
<title>Following the corpse</title>
<p>What attracted me to the topic of hospital autopsies? As evident in public life, dead bodies are in vogue. Dissected corpses litter our television screens, book shelves and websites as sources of popular entertainment. Public exhibitions of plastinated corpses tour relentlessly across Europe, America, the UK and South East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468794112447723">Stephens, 2011</xref>). Amidst this seeming plethora of public corpses, I was intrigued to learn that real-life autopsies had slipped into critical decline. Until the mid-1970s, most people who died in public hospitals in Australia underwent an autopsy before they left hospital mortuaries. Now, both here and in most of the western world, the national average is reduced to less than one in 20 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468794112447723">The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, 2004</xref>). As a result of this decline, autopsy rooms around Australia are being closed, pathologists are busy elsewhere, and trainee pathologists struggle to get enough bodies on which to practice the relevant skills. Despite clear evidence that the autopsy still offers the supreme scientific diagnosis of biological death, a small minority of doctors remain to collectively mourn lost opportunities for ‘the dead to teach the living’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468794112447723">Roulsen et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>How can this be? Why has this historic, foundational knowledge base for western medicine become so unpopular? Does it still have a role to play in scrutinizing death? These questions inspired my ethnographic journey and inevitably led me into broader realms of social inquiry. How do we understand death? How do we view the dead? How do different relationships – as daughter, researcher, clinician, pathologist – affect our engagement with a corpse? What roles do temporality and place have in these constructions? What is it like to handle corpses, to cut up dead people for a living? And how do substantive western cultural values, such as notions of ‘respecting the dead’, play out in an autopsy room as opposed to a hospital bed or a gravesite?</p>
<p>My fieldwork was not confined to Hillside’s Department of Anatomical Pathology (AP) and its mortuary (or indeed to the hospital itself). It involved many interactions with other hospital staff who deal with the dead and the grieving families – clinical doctors, nurses, patient services assistants, medical students, chaplains, and mortuary staff – as well as many relatives who had witnessed the death of a loved one at Hillside. However, the revelatory moments discussed in this article involve the specific practice of anatomical pathology.</p>

<title>Fieldwork, reflexivity and revelation</title>
<p>Anthropology is a method of inquiry, a visualizing tool, a form of social microscopy that offers ‘situated knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794112447723">Harraway, 1991</xref>). Its broad vision, as ethno-historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794112447723">Dening (1996</xref>: 62) put it, is built on ‘the dialectic between distance and familiarity’. The power of the discipline, the in/sights revealed about human life in specific contexts, stem, in part, from the ‘sensibility’ or disposition crafted by long-term, intensive fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112447723">Malkki, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468794112447723">Rabinow (1977)</xref> warns, the raw data of fieldwork can not be picked from the surface, ‘like rocks’. It emerges via collaborative relationships of trust that grow over time between the ethnographer and the community she studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112447723">Hume and Mulcock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468794112447723">Robinson, 2004</xref>). Through these connections, the ethnographer fumbles towards some understanding of the place, the people, and the culture of life within her site of study, as well as the social and historical context in which her observations occur.</p>
<p>My social and locational engagement rendered the complex world of biomedicine, in particular the science of death, more intrinsically knowable. This process was greatly assisted by my opening to the sensory, affective world of anatomical pathology. In western culture, ‘the emotions’ and ‘the senses’ are deeply linked as phenomena by which we experience, ‘make sense’ of ourselves and ‘feel’ we understand something better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112447723">Brenneis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794112447723">Classen and Howes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794112447723">Coffey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794112447723">Pink, 2009</xref>). Recent anthropology more commonly acknowledges some of the ways that emotions are inextricably tied up in the work of research and writing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112447723">Malkki (2007</xref>: 175), for instance, suggests the ethnographic process of knowledge production is not necessarily ‘a matter of the gradual accumulation of “data” into a stable structure, but of moments of puzzlement and sudden realization, of making and unmaking’. Howland points to instances where ‘our excitement when we are “struck” by something in our fieldwork’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794112447723">Hovland, 2007</xref>: 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468794112447723">Tassi (2007)</xref> proffers a ‘methodology of affect’, a vitalizing engagement with things that demand to be ‘felt’.</p>
<p>However, to be clear, this article is not a reflexive treatise on the various emotional states experienced by an ethnographer during fieldwork. Such discussion, where it exists, tends to focus upon a range of debilitating emotional reactions experienced during qualitative research – anxiety, sadness, fear, grief (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794112447723">Dickson-Swift et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468794112447723">Rosaldo, 1989</xref>). Rather it seeks to disclose the ways in which some strongly embodied sensory/emotion responses – primarily fascination and excitement – prompted profound insights. These proved to be revelatory tools in understanding the ways in which people who work in the stigmatized field of anatomical pathology can perform, and enjoy, their work.</p>

<title>Stains, stigma, status: doctors who work with the dead</title>
<p>Pathology is the scientific study of the processes that underlie human disease and abnormalities – the causes, developments and consequences. It plays a critical role in more than 70 per cent of clinical diagnoses and many of the decisions around the optimal treatment for patients. In Australasia, there are eight sub-disciplinary pathways for medical graduates to follow: haematology, immunology, microbiology, forensic pathology, genetics, chemical pathology, general pathology, and anatomical pathology. Anatomical pathologists are by far the largest group: in 2006 they comprised around 680 of the 1549 practising pathologists group in the Australian and New Zealand pathology workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468794112447723">Mitchell, 2007</xref>). Historically, the bulk of their daily routine has involved corpse work; now the majority of their work lies with specimens from living patients.</p>
<p>Anatomical pathologists are trained to expertly employ the twin skills of <italic>macroscopy</italic> and <italic>microscopy</italic>: they look at the big picture of human tissues, including whole organs, to help with diagnosis, and then employ microscopic techniques to discern a clearer picture or confirmation of diagnosis at the cellular level. An anatomical pathologist, for instance, might examine an amputated leg, an excised kidney or ovary, a shed placenta, or a slice of brain with the naked eye (macroscopy), and then pore over a series of specially stained laboratory slides made from that tissue (microscopy).</p>
<p>To many people, the concept of pathology is vaguely familiar but unspecific: it conjures vague images of white lab coats, microscopes and test tubes. Its own professional body acknowledges that pathology is ‘the backroom’ of medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794112447723">Nogrady, 2006</xref>). Contrast that with the public recognition and status accorded surgeons and emergency room doctors. In the glut of popular medical dramas that fill our television screens, it is these doctors who attract attention, prestige, awe, who are exalted for their stamina, ego, and the sheer grit and beauty of their work. In the academy, surgeons have long attracted acclaimed researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794112447723">Bosk, 2003 [1979]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794112447723">Cassell, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794112447723">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, anatomical pathologists occupy a far lower rung on medicine’s status ladder: university pathology departments are being down-graded and young doctors are increasingly shunning the specialty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794112447723">Horsley, 2010</xref>). On occasion, the caricature of anatomical pathologists as ‘failed doctors’ who ‘simply didn’t have what it took to communicate with real, live people’ has been publicly voiced by health experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468794112447723"><italic>The Age</italic>, 2006</xref>). My fieldwork convinced me that the common stereotype of these doctors as gloomy, introverted and misanthropic people was still prevalent. In Hillside’s corridors some people described them as ‘weirdos’ or ‘creepy critters’.</p>
<p>In part, the reputation of such doctors can be attributed to the long history of pathology’s responsibility for autopsies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794112447723">Hughes (1962)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468794112447723">Star (1995)</xref> have identified the ways that certain work devalues or despoils the identity of the worker when it is perceived to be ‘dirty work’. Such work is often invisible or hidden, and not commonly acknowledged or discussed. Corpse dissection and autopsy, closed to public eyes during the last century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468794112447723">Stephens, 2011</xref>), is considered soiling, stigmatizing labour. The stain of place contributes: mortuaries are locked, highly regulated places, largely shrouded from the views of hospital workers, as well as the public. Thus, an aura of mystery, of grisly fascination and intrigue, of taboo and pollution, has attached itself to these work spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794112447723">Douglas, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794112447723">Horsley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The infamous ‘organ retention scandals’ that engulfed the UK’s Alder Hey and Bristol Hospitals have not helped the cause of anatomical pathology. The revelations emanating from the respective inquiries rocketed around the world during 1999–2001, spreading throughout Australia and New Zealand and prompting political intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794112447723">Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, 2002</xref>). The subsequent inquiries exposed the habitual retention of tissue and organs removed during hospital autopsies, a common practice, world wide, for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794112447723">Campbell and Willis, 2005</xref>). The practice was well known in medical circles and, although legal, was usually done without the knowledge or consent of relatives. Many people – lay and medical – regarded this practice as gruesome and scandalous. It is perhaps unsurprising that a mere few years later, during my fieldwork, the disclosure of this practice remained prominent in the minds of hospital staff and relatives I spoke to and was linked to the decline in relatives consent to autopsies in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468794112447723">Ward et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>‘A scientific thing’</title>
<p>Understandably, I was intrigued as to the attraction the discipline held for the doctors at Hillside’s Department of Anatomical Pathology. Clearly, it was neither status nor popularity. All strongly refuted the idea that they had been poor clinicians or lacked empathy for their patients; indeed, some said they had left clinical work because they were ‘too sensitive’ to patients’ pain. Ultimately, it was the intellectual demands – the mysteries and mechanisms of disease – that intrigued, challenged and enthused them. Keith, for instance, explained that, while all medicine has elements of problem solving based on patients’ stories, <italic>‘</italic>Pathology is different in that you are picking up the clues from the specimens and from the body, so it’s kind of a twist on the concept<italic>’</italic>. Lisa concurred:
<disp-quote>
<p>What is it I like? Um, it’s like a little mini detective story I suppose . . . It is problem solving at its most pure. You are given a problem and you have to solve it. It is just very cut and dried. I mean, obviously, not completely cut and dried. But ‘pure’, I suppose, is the word I am trying to use. It’s a scientific thing.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Not every AP doctor I spoke to embraced autopsy work; even its enthusiasts acknowledged it was alien territory for some. But there was no disguising the heart-felt passion some felt about this aspect of their work. One practitioner self-consciously described it as ‘fun’. Lisa explained it this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>You are doing something manual; you do something with your hands, which is kind of like surgery, except you don’t have to worry about keeping the patient alive [<italic>laughs</italic>] . . . So you feel like you are actually doing something, performing something . . . And a lot of [autopsies] are very routine, but probably about one autopsy in five, you just get one that is really exciting. And you just go, ‘Wow! I have never seen that before!’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Those I met who loved their work were drawn to the gross anatomy of the body, the aesthetics of cellular design, and seduced by the mysteries of disease. For them, the vital clues lay in the complex microscopic visuals requiring extensive skills in pattern recognition, and also in the sight, smell and touch of dead flesh. In the following incident involving slides drawn from autopsy work, I grasped something of its lure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468794112447723">
<title>Microscopic revelations</title>
<p>I am sitting in front of a hefty teaching microscope belonging to the Department of Anatomical Pathology at Hillside. Extruding from its main body are multiple, binocular eyepieces to accommodate other viewers. Alex, the Director of AP, sits opposite, hunched over one eyepiece. We are to look at a slide of tissue from the cortex from the brain of a man whose autopsy I had witnessed some weeks before. As I sit there, about to gaze at dead human cells, I flash back to memories of those moments around the kitchen table with my father. I lean forward with anticipation:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alex fiddles with knobs, refining our shared view.</p>
<p>‘Exquisite’, he remarks.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes’, I agree, marvelling at the sight.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Courtesy of laboratory staining techniques, I can see an assortment of finely drawn shapes, purple, mauve and pink, an impressive artistic tableau. Alex points out capillaries, cells and neurons, the ghostly outlines of layers beneath. To me, everything looks neat, beatific. The preserved brain is indeed a remarkable sight. Yet to Alex’s trained eyes there are clear signs of chaos, disorder, invasion.</p>
<p>We work through other slides in the box beside us, Alex carefully identifying the visual evidence of the pathology that killed this patient. As he does so he sketches a crude map on a piece of paper for me, indicating the areas of the brain from which the samples were retrieved, tracking the death. I am quickly learning why the microscope, like the scalpel, is such a vital tool in modern pathology.</p>
<p>I am not alone in discovering the joys of the microscopic world as a child. Legendary American writer Annie Dillard was also lucky enough to ‘hit pay dirt’ as a child, as she vividly recounts in her acclaimed memoir, <italic>An American Childhood</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112447723">Dillard, 1987</xref>). After leaving school, most of us rarely venture back into this micro-world. As renowned pathologist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794112447723">Gonzalez-Crussi (2006</xref>: 213) remarks, ‘[i]t is much to be regretted that growing up erodes the capacity to marvel at the views revealed by an optical microscope’. Alex was clearly one grown-up still in thrall to the marvels of this instrumental work. Looking down the microscope with Alex, memories were re-awoken in me. But I was also launched into a greater appreciation of the intellectual challenges that the science of pathology holds for its converts in pursuit of the causes of death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468794112447723">
<title>Macroscopic revelations: conceiving the corpse</title>
<p>There are many ways of conceiving the corpse. Dead bodies are ‘placeholders for the living’: they carry beliefs and memories; they embody relationships; they harbour knowledge. They also provoke actions and reactions and, although silent, they express or ‘voice’ what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112447723">Bronfen and Goodwin (1993)</xref> term the ‘agency of the dead’. Each conception features ideas, feelings – even schemas – associated with the dead body. These affect the way we handle dead bodies as societies: the places we put them, the ways we dispose of them, our expectations of them. Ultimately, they affect the decisions grieving relatives make about consenting to autopsy, or to organ donation. And they determine the policies and practices applied to Necropsy (autopsy) Rooms and Cold Rooms (refrigerators) of hospital mortuaries that compel workers to treat bodies ‘with respect’.</p>
<p>Anatomical dissection and autopsy have been fundamental to the epistemology of medicine. Its practices have rendered the corpse a ‘cadaver’, an object.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794112447723">1</xref></sup> However, even in the secluded dissecting rooms of universities, and the mortuaries of western hospitals, dead bodies have remained ambiguous entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794112447723">Campbell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468794112447723">Hafferty, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794112447723">Jones, 2000</xref>). The idea that a corpse can be fixed within a singular meaning or interpretation remains illusory: people ‘become dead’ in different, and sometimes disruptive, ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468794112447723">Straight, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468794112447723">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>My father’s death occasioned an unfashioned glimpse of death. Subsequent employment in disability and HIV/AIDS had further exposed me to its material realities; but before embarking on my fieldwork I had never been so extensively and purposefully exposed to corpses. Certainly I had not witnessed an evisceration. Frankly, I was not entirely sure how I would handle the experience. Ultimately I was to attend 13 autopsies (nine adult and four perinatal cases) at Hillside. I arrived at the hospital with some basic understanding of anatomy. I left the following year having gleaned considerably more, though in-depth knowledge of autopsy practice was never my aim. As hospital ethnographer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794112447723">Cassell (2005</xref>: 179), argues, it is enough to pick up ‘the gist’ of what is happening; like her, I was not so much ‘focussing on <italic>medicine</italic> but on the <italic>people practising medicine</italic>’ (original emphasis).</p>
<p>Performing autopsies, I came to understand, was messy, demanding work; it challenged workers physically and intellectually, and provoked them emotionally. As one practitioner quietly observed, ‘It’s not a natural behaviour for humans to cut other humans into pieces . . . it’s an unusual thing to do’. The task compelled a range of feelings: it could be fascinating, disgusting and satisfying; it could be profoundly boring, and sometimes exciting, even enjoyable. However, there was one moment when I truly grasped the concept of ‘dead dead’. It is a deeply embodied knowledge, one which gives autopsy workers the capacity to do – even enjoy – their ‘unusual’ work. As it did for me.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1468794112447723">
<title>In sight</title>
<p>Within Hillside’s mortuary I have just watched as a naked stranger, an older woman called ‘Flora’ was cleaved open in front of me. Exposed to my curious, searching eyes was a tableau of bright yellow fatty tissue and purple-red-brown viscera, now removed. Sharp blades have separated scalp from skull, causing the face to fall forward off the skull like a discarded glove. The deafening noise of the technician’s saw has ceased, though the strong smell of ground bone and hot motor still permeates the air. The skull has been prised open with an almighty CRACK; the brain mass coaxed out onto a gloved hand.</p>
<p>Now behind me at the sink, two registrars bend over viscera, mulling through their clinical findings. Despite the pungent smell I move ever closer to the emptied body. The skin sags all over, the body is deflated. I lean over the abdominal cavity. At the bottom of this large, empty space lies the bloody, yellow trail of the spine. Ribs bow each side like ship remnants arching through beach sand – a remarkable sight. The head pulls at me. I move to stand behind, peering inside the skull. Bony edges form ragged, asymmetrical compartments. I see eye connections; blood pooling in the doorway to the spine.</p>
<p>‘Wow’, I silently exclaim. Fascination and excitement sweep over me. Revealed are sights normally out of sight. Vacant space, dead space. Space emptied of the soft, wobbly, gelatinous mass that somehow makes us ‘tick’. I step back to view the whole corpse. How to describe this sense of absence, this vista that says ‘all gone’? A phrase from the acclaimed Australian poet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468794112447723">Dorothy Porter (2007)</xref>, immediately springs to mind:
<disp-quote>
<p>how dead dead</p>
<p>the dead are.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468794112447723">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>Later, I watch as Flora’s body is washed, re-filled, stitched and thus re-formed. She is wheeled out looking more ‘alive’ than she had in some hours.</p>

<title>Witnessing the corpse</title>
<p>Autopsy practitioners I spoke to had tried to account for their everyday capacity to ‘mutilate’ the dead, yet also treat the corpse as ‘a person’, and ‘give respect’ to his or her grieving family. In those first two months of fieldwork, I could ‘hear’ – even trust – the explanations they gave. But I could not ‘know’ how they managed it.</p>
<p>In gazing onto and into Flora’s body, I grasped the gestalt-shift embodied in their professional disposition: here we have a dead person; here we have some-thing which is a scientific puzzle. I could feel this shift of perception happening in me, akin to that described by other ethnographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794112447723">Coffey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468794112447723">Tassi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468794112447723">Unnithan-Kumar and De Neve, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Witnessing subsequent autopsies continued to illuminate the paradox of the corpse. On the one hand, ‘The body’ as anatomist Gareth Jones puts it, ‘is always <italic>some</italic> body, it is <italic>somebody’s</italic> body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794112447723">Jones, 2000</xref>: 4, original emphasis). He is alluding to the web of social and emotional relationships that enfold a corpse. Autopsy practice is governed by social as well as medical rituals. Good pathologists care for the families by caring about the quality of their corpse work.</p>
<p>But the corpse is also a lifeless object. It is rendered so by the nature of dissection practice: the tools that are utilized, the places it is undertaken, and the epistemological gaze employed by autopsy practitioners as they negotiate the physical geography of death. During an autopsy, the nature of this object is also made real in material ways – a tableau of viscera and blood, an empty skull. And so it was for me that day in the autopsy room when I contemplated a profound sense of absence. The frisson of excitement pulled me past the confronting vision of torn, malodorous flesh and bone, yet I was captured by the sense of death.</p>
<p>Indeed, every corpse I witnessed in the Necropsy Room retained something of a mobile hybridity and agency. For a time at least, it was neither person nor object, yet temporally and temporarily one or both. Different kinds of identity lay upon and beneath its physical surface, cajoling the feelings of workers, directing their gestures, de-stabilizing as well as consolidating their work habits, enacting some form of active intercommunication between the living and the dead.</p>

<title>Science, emotion and making sense of the corpse</title>
<p>Ethnographers acknowledge that fumbling about doing fieldwork is an experience of immersion in another world. Once observations are completed, we retire from the field to review data and write our texts. As others have noted, field notes can ‘take us back <italic>to</italic> the moment’, but ‘only distance can give perspective <italic>about</italic> that moment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468794112447723">Tourigney, 2004</xref>: 122). During my writing period, I reflected deeply on the two revelatory moments described. Two interconnected notions coalesced for me: the idea of <italic>emotions at work</italic> and the <italic>role of the senses</italic>, most specifically sight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468794112447723">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Emotions have long been deemed antithetical to the practice of science, and indeed to the presence of reason. But, in the trail of theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794112447723">Barbalet (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468794112447723">Nussbaum (2001)</xref>, I came to acknowledge emotion as a form of evaluative thought, a way of seeing things. In this I rejected dominant theoretical notions of emotion as antagonistic to, or separate from reason – a view predominant in the medical world. Instead, I came to view emotion as an essential, ever-present, constituent of reasoning (as well as acting). Feelings were conceptualized as ‘lines of force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468794112447723">Thrift, 2004</xref>): energetic encounters between people, between people and things (institutions, corpses), between people and places.</p>
<p>The notion of medical detachment has largely been unchallenged in academic and medical fields. A state of ‘emotional aloofness’ or ‘insensibility’ is assumed to pervade good medical practice. Through observations of autopsy practice, I came to understand that, while feelings may be fore-grounded or back-grounded in medical practice, they are ever-present as intrinsic forms of evaluative thought and clinical instinct. If we broaden myopic constraints on what constitutes ‘emotion’, it is obvious that boredom, confidence and enthusiasm are emotions common in medical contexts, as are sadness, disgust and excitement. Indeed, I observed that emotions were not only present in the autopsy room, but <italic>essential</italic> evaluative tools.</p>
<p>The senses, together with feelings, help us ‘make sense’ of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794112447723">Feld and Brenneis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468794112447723">Telle, 2002</xref>). During autopsy, trained sensory perceptions – sight, smell, touch – are integral components of diagnosis. Such senses were also implicated in workers’ recognition of a corpse’s personhood (absent or present). The interpretation of these experiences, of course, is not secure. In hospital beds for instance, still-living bodies can decay in unbounded, extreme ways and ‘fall out’ of the category of personhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468794112447723">5</xref></sup> Conversely, corpses can also cling to life. Some corpses looked more ‘asleep’ than others; they felt less rigid, they smelt less rotten when opened. This disconcerting, sensorial experience was well-described by Leslie:
<disp-quote>
<p>When we do post mortems on bodies that have not been dead for very long, for a few hours, and they usually still have warmth, that . . . that sort of has that eerie feeling about it. But because they’re not . . . they haven’t been in the fridge . . . they’re not cold. There’s still an element of ‘livingness’ if you like, about them. And they also bleed a little bit which doesn’t happen if a body has been dead for a long time. And so there is a little . . . there is probably a little bit of a sense of that when they’re very, very fresh. And particularly when they’re warm inside, I find that a bit eerie. It is almost like there is a little bit of them [the patient] left. But they still don’t look like the person they were, they still look like they’ve gone . . . I still treat them like a human and I still treat them with respect but the person that was has gone. When you <italic>see</italic> that person dead, you can understand what I mean.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This embodied knowledge enhances the professional capacities of anatomical pathologists to ‘cut people into pieces’, as one practitioner described his work. A young pathologist, Lisa, put it this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>You only have to see a couple [of autopsies] to know that you look at the body and it is ‘remains’. I’m not religious, but you can see that whatever that spirit of life is, it’s not there. You know, it makes a massive difference. You can see somebody – their body, their dead naked body – in front of you, and you wouldn’t recognize them on the street if you met them two days earlier when they were alive, because they just look so different. Their eyes are sunken and there’s . . . I mean, people go ‘how can you do it? How can you just cut into a person?’ And you go, ‘Well, they are really so dead’.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794112447723">Law (2004</xref>: 83)argues, ‘[w]hat is being made present always depends on what is also being made absent’. The presence of absence can still speak of ‘person’. However, perceptions grounded in experienced – and experiencing – workers can also provide autopsy staff with stark and compelling evidence of death, and steady their hands while exciting their minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112447723">Csordas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468794112447723">Merleau-Ponty, 1962</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I began fieldwork at Hillside having spent decades as a health activist and patient advocate. Memories of deaths I had encountered had hewn a healthy scepticism about medical epistemologies and practices. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794112447723">Forsey (2004</xref>: 66) has observed, anthropological critiques risk privileging ‘subaltern’ perspectives while employing ‘highly critical upward glances’, and the possibility of my doing just that was tempting. However, one of the rewards of fieldwork includes the heightened capacity to grasp multiple perspectives, to become more sensitized to the common humanity that underpins the complex roles that people assume, or have thrust upon them.</p>
<p>After fieldwork I spent a year writing my ethnography while living in an isolated bush shack some hours from Melbourne. I was there during the horrific Victorian bushfires of February 2009, and the day now known nationally as ‘Black Saturday’. In its aftermath, I carried a far greater sense of my vulnerability and an enhanced awareness of collective grief.</p>
<p>Four weeks after the fires, I sat typing as the voice of the Victorian Coroner seeped through the radio into my consciousness. At this point the loss of life was still an estimated 300 men, women and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794112447723">Kissane and Johnston, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468794112447723">6</xref></sup> The Coroner was defending the official protocol whereby families of the dead were still being denied information and access to their relatives’ bodies. Many of the recovered dead were truly, grievously <italic>dead</italic> in the eyes of their families. However, they were still officially listed only as ‘missing’ until the formal autopsy and coronial identification process had been concluded. Families were told the process of body release might take months.</p>
<p>Public anger was rising. Several bereaved women had rung the radio station, complaining in tremulous, yet controlled, voices. One desperately wanted to ‘plan a funeral, not a memorial service’. Others repeated themes common to western death cultures: ‘Without the body we can’t move on’, ‘We need to bring her home to us’. For me, the value of the dead body to the living was profound, inescapable, wrenching; it connected strongly with the values and emotions of relatives and staff I had met through fieldwork.</p>
<p>Yet I listened to the radio with mixed emotions. At one point the Coroner alluded to the distressing nature of the work for her mortuary team. The sheer mass of incinerated, suffocated, contorted bodies would have been confronting – even shocking. The sights and the smells would challenge even the most experienced pathologist. I found myself empathizing with the stress the team would be experiencing. I had now met and spent time with the professionals who did this kind of dirty work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468794112447723">7</xref></sup> Many now had names, personalities and families of their own. They were no longer anonymous parts of a faceless system that operated behind tightly closed doors. Perhaps unlike some of Black Saturday’s bereaved, I knew their humanity, I could understand their passion, and I could applaud the difficult work they did in mutilating the dead.</p>
<p>‘Ethnography’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794112447723">Pink (2009</xref>: 8) observes, ‘is a reflexive and experiential process’ that generates particular ways of understanding and knowing. While sitting at my desk that day, I reflected again upon the value of this method. Necropsy Room observations had granted me an opportunity to see and smell death – to ‘feel’ its presence – from an exceptional perspective. Similarly, viewing microscopic slices of human brain tissue had revealed remarkable insights into the art – as well as the science – of human dissection, and the passions that motivate anatomical pathologists. Ethnographic fieldwork is not simply a research technique; it is a form of social microscopy that can produce revelatory insights into human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794112447723">Behar, 1996</xref>). I can only concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794112447723">Fernandez (2010)</xref>: ‘What a story we anthropologists have to tell’.</p>

<p>I prefer to refer to the ‘corpse’ or the ‘dead body’ rather than the medical term, ‘cadaver’. The latter situates the corpse solely as the property of medicine and is unnecessarily de-personalizing. Also, the term ‘cadaver’ was not obviously used by AP staff at Hillside Hospital.</p>

<p>In Victoria and most of Australia, unlike the UK and America, forensic autopsies are not conducted in hospital mortuaries but in specially built forensic facilities, in this case the world-renowned Victorian Institute of Forensic Pathology where medico-legal investigations are undertaken on behalf of the State Coroner.
