The lymph nodes of cow No. 2 were infiltrated by a similar population of leukocytes, as was a nodule in the liver. Occasional aggregates of plasma cells and scattered eosinophils accompanied the macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Numerous irregularly round to ovoid organisms (sporangia), 4- to 15-μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812450722">Fig. 2</xref>), were in the cytoplasm of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Extracellular sporangia were also observed. The organisms had a lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm that was often retracted from the cell wall. In most organisms, cell walls were uniformly thin without ornamentation, but the outer cell wall of some organisms had bulges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812450722">Fig. 2</xref>, inset). The cytoplasm often appeared refractile or finely vacuolated in HE-stained sections; under polarized light, each algal cell contained brightly birefringent crystals, each with a centrally located cruciate shadow (starch granules in chloroplasts). The algal cells had numerous PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules. Many sporangia had undergone endosporulation with the formation of 2 to 8 wedge-shaped sporangiospores. Some organisms were necrotic; adjacent macrophages contained crescentic (collapsed) sporangia with fragmented cell walls.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0300985812450722"><title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title><p>One-millimeter cubes were removed from a paraffin block (cow No. 2) and de-paraffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and then fixed by immersion in a solution of 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid in a cacodylate buffer. These tissues were routinely processed and embedded in Epon; ultrathin sections were placed on coated grids, contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined in a transmission electron microscope.
