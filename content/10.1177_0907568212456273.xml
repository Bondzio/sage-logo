<p>Anna Holzscheiter is to be congratulated on turning her doctoral dissertation into a scholarly monograph about how the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) came into being. Her book successfully highlights the Convention’s groundbreaking impacts on international political discourses of children’s human rights. The text of <italic>Children’s Rights in International Politics: The Transformative Power of Discourse</italic> is dense and closely argued from the disciplinary perspective of International Relations (IR), and offers new insights into the negotiations resulting in the UNCRC. Those interested in the messy realities of treaty writing will find interesting the detail presented on how it took 10 years to draft the UNCRC before its adoption in 1989, the International Year of the Child. As the author frequently emphasizes, the UNCRC is a groundbreaking document worthy of study, being both a highly innovative and highly problematic treaty, yet the most comprehensive and important international convention relating to children, that in 1989 offered a radical new image of childhood. Situated within the late literary turn within IR, Anna Holzscheiter adopts critical discourse analysis as a research framework to show both the operation of power in discourse and the power of discourse in the making of the UNCRC.</p>
<p>The UNCRC is often critiqued as reflecting a Eurocentric version of childhood – this book traces how that bias came to be by detailed examination of the actors and voices of influence in the politics of inclusion and exclusion during the tortuous decade of treaty drafting. Eager to avoid criticism of being an armchair analyst of discourse, the author not only trawled through mountains of secondary material comprised of UN texts, NGO and UNICEF publications, conference reports, notes, records and minutes of innumerable meetings, earlier treaties and related documents; but also interviewed a few (just three) of the key players involved in writing the UNCRC to reveal the social dynamics and discursive practices of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Although turned into a scholarly monograph published in the Palgrave Macmillan Transformations of the State series, the traces of doctoral thesis still remain in this book with many pages devoted to justifying why scrutinizing the drafting of the UNCRC is a worthy subject of research and a valid route to exploring the international politics of childhood. The first three chapters wade heavily through reviews of discourse theories and rehearse approaches to international politics in painstakingly thorough ground-laying, but with just a few enticing hints towards the empirical analysis in later chapters of the genesis of the UNCRC. Chapter 4 is devoted to the importance and significance of the UNCRC for childhood within international politics, as both a dominant and contested text. Chapter 5 is an interesting review of the history of the construction of childhood during the past 200 years. Here Anna Holzscheiter argues that there is very little of study of childhood in Africa. While agreeing with the sentiments that compared with the concentration of studies of children in the American–European axis, African childhoods are understudied, there is actually not quite the absolute dearth of literature she suggests.</p>
<p>Only after five (at times tedious) scene-setting chapters do we get to the heart of the book in Chapter 6, which details the nitty-gritty of who, how and where the UNCRC was drafted. We learn that the UNCRC was drafted by consensus, which is one of the reasons it took a decade to reach completion. But at times frustratingly little is revealed. Although it is reported that 43 members met every year for six weeks at the UN in Geneva to work on drafting the treaty; that only three out of 18 NGOs made statements and that NGO lobbying really took place in the corridors, cafeterias and even toilets rather than the conference room, we are left curious for more detail about the human messiness of the drafting process. Chapter 7 details some of the contentious areas (such as consent for medical/scientific research on children, female genital mutilation, child marriage, children’s sexuality) which were eventually left out of the Convention because consensus could not be reached. Interestingly we learn that the innovative notions introduced into the Convention, like the evolving capacities of the child and discourse on children’s rights, were not based on factual evidence or research data, rather on common sense assertions and general statements which became uncontested truths in the creation of discourse.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 details the ways in which what was intended as an inclusive and democratic drafting process, was actually a process of exclusion and silencing whereby representatives from African, Asian and Muslim nations lacked means to travel to Switzerland to participate in drafting the UNCRC. Some states, such as the Caribbean states, were not represented at all. East and West European nations dominated the drafting delegates. Even when delegates from poorer countries were present they often had to cover many different UN meetings so were less able to contribute actively to the UNCRC negotiations and frequently lacked the legal training and expertise needed to make effective interventions. NGOs could have had greater input and paradoxically children, the very subject of the treaty which eventually came to stress children as active subjects with rights to speak and be heard, were not active participants in the drafting.</p>
<p>On a pragmatic note, Holzscheiter’s book is enhanced by a helpful single combined reference list; but having endnotes instead of footnotes is most certainly not helpful – endnotes may be convenient to publishers, but they are very inconvenient for readers. Useful additions would have been the text (or at least a summary) of the UNCRC in an appendix, a list of signatories, as well as a timeline of the Convention’s evolution, adoption and additions. Both author and publisher are to be credited with the remarkably small number of typographic errors – just four spotted by this reviewer.</p>
<p>Overall this book is not aimed at students, but will appeal to researchers interested in the UNCRC, the international construction of childhood, IR, international politics and children’s rights.</p>
