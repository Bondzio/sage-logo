<p>Evidence-based practice requires identifying a specific clinical question, finding the evidence, conducting a critical review of the research literature, appraising the evidence, and then applying the evidence to a clinical patient situation. The concept of evidence-based practice is most frequently linked to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477140">Cochrane (1972)</xref>, whereas the term <italic>evidence-based</italic> emerged from a research group led by Guyatt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477140">Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477140">Sackett, Rosenberg, Haynes, and Richardson (1996)</xref> defined evidence-based medicine as the “conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients” (p. 71). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477140">Ingersoll (2000)</xref> proposed that evidence-based nursing is the “conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of theory-derived, research-based information in making decisions about care delivery to individuals or groups of patients reflective of individual needs and preferences” (p. 152). This definition of evidence-based nursing emerged from various perspectives and a rich tradition of using research findings for conducting research utilization activities in nursing.</p>
<p>Nursing research utilization focused on approaches to apply knowledge derived from research studies in clinical practice. In contrast to evidence-based practice, research utilization focused more on translating the extant research to practice instead of systematically determining the worthiness of the research findings prior to implementing it in practice. Starting in the 1970s, various models for research utilization in nursing were proposed and applied in various clinical situations. These models focused on the adoption or dissemination of new knowledge and integrating it in clinical practice. Early efforts included the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, the Conduct and Utilization of Research in Nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477140">Krueger, 1978</xref>), and the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477140">King, Barnard, &amp; Hoehn, 1981</xref>). These initiatives focused on retrieving and reviewing research findings, disseminating results, and evaluating any changes in practice.</p>
<p>Other research utilization approaches included the University of North Carolina model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477140">Funk, Tornquist, &amp; Champagne, 1989</xref>), which placed an emphasis on the dissemination of research findings. This model provided a series of annual research conferences and thus supported research-based nursing practice as an approach to improve patient care outcomes. The Stetler model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318413477140">Stetler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318413477140">Stetler &amp; Marram, 1976</xref>) provided an organizing framework and approach to assist clinicians make decisions about using research findings. This model consists of six steps: a) preparation, b) validation, c) evaluation of comparative findings, d) decision-making, e) translating the findings to practice, and f) evaluation. Stetler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318413477140">Stetler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318413477140">Stetler &amp; Marram, 1976</xref>) advanced this model, published extensively, first describing models of research utilization in nursing practice, subsequently evidence-based practice, and most recently the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477140">Helfrich et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Stetler model shared similar processes and outcomes to other approaches, such as the Iowa model of research in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318413477140">Titler et al., 1994</xref>), the Goode research utilization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477140">Goode, Lovett, Hayes, &amp; Butcher, 1987</xref>), and the research utilization frameworks adopted by various nursing specialty practices (such as the American Association of Critical Care Nurses). Most of these models focused on changing nursing practice within organizations, such as healthcare institutions or professional nursing organizations. Staff nurses often joined nursing research committees. Through a systematic and organization-wide process they critiqued nursing research specific to a topic. Using pre-established criteria, the committee members determined whether the research was adequate to make a practice change and then they monitored the outcomes.</p>
<p>The success of these efforts was limited in part due to the scope and dissemination of the research utilization initiatives, the number and quality of the published research papers on a specific topic, and the ongoing challenge of closing research and practice gaps. Despite highly successful projects and promising results, clinicians at the bedside were often simply unaware of the findings. A gap also existed between research utilization efforts and the nursing textbooks used to educate the next generation of clinicians. Faculty members and administrators did not recognize the value of nursing research or research utilization. Other barriers included the fact that many practicing nurses had not had formal research or statistics courses, and research utilization was not a performance expectation. It was not until the late 1970s that most baccalaureate nursing programs included a formal research course or at least integrated research concepts in curricular materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318413477140">Funk, Tornquist, &amp; Champagne, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite various barriers related to research utilization and subsequently evidence-based practice, a number of factors began to create more interest in evidence-based nursing care. During this period, schools of nursing focused additional attention on advanced education in nursing at both the master’s and doctoral level. Advanced education programs in nursing incorporated research education and addressed nursing knowledge development. Increasingly, nurses engaged in efforts to improve the quality of care through research findings. Additionally, the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) began to publish practice guidelines starting in 1992 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cpgonline.htm">http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cpgonline.htm</ext-link>) that specifically addressed phenomena of interest to nurses.</p>
<p>One of the first of these practice guidelines offered guidance on strategies to prevent pressure ulcer formation. This guideline relied on Level 3 evidence (lacking direct patient outcome data), expert opinion, and the consensus of an interdisciplinary expert committee. This and similar documents placed ever-increasing attention on evidence-based healthcare and improving healthcare outcomes and services. These guideline publications provided a national model for disseminating research findings and establishing interdisciplinary care standards. Guidelines of interest to nurses included acute pain management, management of cancer pain, pressure ulcer treatment, and urinary incontinence in adults (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cpgarchv.htm">http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/cpgarchv.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In nursing, research utilization evolved into evidence-based practice during a time when nursing research utilization efforts were well established within healthcare organizations and specialty organizations. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477140">American Association of Critical Care Nurses (1993)</xref> launched its now renowned, <italic>Thunder Projects</italic>, involving organizations and nurses from across the country in nursing research efforts. This project examined the effects of heparinized and non-heparinized flush solutions on the patency of arterial pressure monitoring lines. Projects such as this provided clinical nurses with an opportunity to participate in nursing research and then utilize the findings in practice. This resulted in a growing interest in practice-focused nursing research and an increasing focus on evidence-based practice in nursing.</p>
<p>The shift from a focus on research utilization to evidence-based practice in nursing could be described as an increasing focus on achieving high-quality health outcomes by using research findings. Journals and articles pertinent to clinical nursing research expanded in number, and the Internet provided additional access to the published literature and research. Concurrently, researchers no longer used paper-based indexes and could easily search and access published articles using personal computers. This occurred at a time when there was increased value for evidence-based practice within the disciplines of medicine.</p>
<p>Increasingly, healthcare insurers and regulators have placed an emphasis on providing evidence-based care that is cost-effective. This approach intended to improve care, decrease costs, and promote high quality care. Payers do not want to provide costly, ineffective treatments that do not provide a return on investment. Furthermore, healthcare systems have focused more on engaging frontline clinicians in performing evidence-based interventions, such as hand washing, that reduces the risk of infections and protects patients from unnecessary harm.</p>
<p>As the importance of evidence-based care has emerged, some clinicians have resisted this approach suggesting that the system would be tyrannized by the evidence and somehow result in <italic>cookbook medicine</italic>. Other clinicians were unaware that much of medicine and nursing were either opinion-based or evidence-free due to a lack of high quality research on various topics. Others were unclear about how to engage the patient as an active participant in the decision-making process and how clinical expertise played a critical role in the process. But during the past decade, there has been growing support for and movement toward implementing a wide variety of evidence-based practices in a more systematic manner. Initiatives such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s efforts to embed evidence-based safety practices in acute care settings have increased the awareness of the relationship between evidence-based practices and patient outcomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.IHI.org">www.IHI.org</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0894318413477140">
<title>Current Perspectives and the Role of Qualitative Research</title>
<p>The currently accepted definition of evidence-based practice requires the inclusion of the perspective and values of the patient. The goal is to integrate the “best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318413477140">Sackett, Strauss, Richardson, Rosenberg, &amp; Haynes, 2000</xref>). Qualitative researchers are in the unique role of identifying patients’ experiences with healthcare conditions and treatments. Scientifically sound individual qualitative studies, as well as qualitative metasynthesis can provide patients with a voice in evidence-based healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477140">Beck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318413477140">Thorne, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Regardless of the research methods, findings must be trustworthy and systematically evaluated for use in clinical practice. Then, the evidence must be presented in an unbiased manner to the patient and family fully recognizing that each situation is unique. An ideal framework for evidence-based practice consists of a clinician’s expertise, the best evidence in context of the patient’s values and preferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0894318413477140">
<title>Resources for Evidence-based Practice</title>
<p>Many resources exist to assist nurses in finding and evaluating research for evidence-based practice. Several web-based search engines are available for rapid and comprehensive literature searching. Numerous evidence-based guidelines are published by professional specialty organizations and collected in the National Guideline Clearinghouse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ngc.gov">www.ngc.gov</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Various groups, including the AHRQ, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, rate research findings according to their strength and stability and then assign a level of evidence using a consistent framework. Some are intended for use with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapies or interventions. Although many of these have been developed for quantitative findings, rating scales have been identified for use with findings from qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318413477140">Treadwell, Tregear, Reston, &amp; Turkelson, 2006</xref>). In addition, another helpful tool for use with metasynthesis is the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (QARI), which is available through the Joanna Briggs Institute at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.joannabriggs.edu.au">http://www.joannabriggs.edu.au</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477140">Beck, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence-based practice provides a framework by which clinicians and patients can participate in a shared decision-making process about care decisions. Evidence-based practice supports a decision-making process that is based on research findings instead of just expert opinion. An evidence-based approach integrates valid and reliable findings from both qualitative and quantitative research findings. It requires that the evidence is applied in the context of patients’ specific situations and consistent with patients’ unique values and preferences.</p>
