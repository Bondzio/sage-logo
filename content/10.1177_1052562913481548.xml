<p>We invite you to attend the annual OBTC Teaching Conference for Management Educators, the world’s premier management education conference, in the offbeat, beautiful, and wonderful city of Asheville, North Carolina. The theme for 2013 is “Dare to be Different”. Our society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://obts.org/">http://obts.org/</ext-link>) prides itself on innovation and exploration through the prestigious <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> and through the OBTC conference. The conference has a strong tradition of inquisitive and daring dialogue that encourages attendees to discover and try different philosophies and methods for teaching and learning. Expect around 300 attendees in an informal, supportive, and welcoming atmosphere—part of what makes OBTC different. The OBTC culture will be fully celebrated at this, our 40th anniversary conference.</p>
<p>Asheville, nestled in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina, is renowned for its eclectic and thriving arts community, and is consistently noted by artists, musicians, foodies, and beer enthusiasts as a rich mecca for those seeking an array of tastes and sounds, including an organic weekly drum circle and a thriving farmers’ market. As the only designated liberal arts institution in the University of North Carolina system, UNC Asheville has created an environment for exploring the world. It is a modern campus with state of the art facilities, high-tech classrooms, and recreation spaces. With amazing views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and easy accessible to local shops, restaurants, hotels, and many tourist attractions, the campus is a perfect location to host management educators from around the world. UNC Asheville provides attendees with a beautiful environment in which to learn and grow together. A walk through the city or campus reveals a community who proudly embraces their difference.</p>
<p>Viva la difference!</p>
