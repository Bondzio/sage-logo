<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate nurses’ knowledge of infection prevention procedures, the degree to which they were applied correctly, and whether length of service affected either knowledge or application. Nurses with over five years of experience had significantly increased understanding of infection prevention (<italic>p</italic>=0.009) and significantly increased application of knowledge to practice (<italic>p</italic>=0.001), compared to nurses with five years or less experience. In particular, understanding of hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) was poor although application was compliant, while knowledge of care of patients with meticillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> was poor, which was reflected by substandard application of knowledge to practice. The results of this study suggest that focusing infection prevention education around patients with specific infections, such as MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic>, rather than on individual standard precautions may more effectively increase knowledge and therefore application of infection prevention practices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAI) is top of National Health Service (NHS) and Department of Health (DH) agendas in England because the rates of HCAI have grown to unacceptable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412446855">DH, 2003</xref>). The increasing incidence of MRSA bacteraemia during the 1990s to reach a peak of 7,700 reported cases in England in 2003–04 was the trigger for the first ever infection reduction target for the NHS to reduce MRSA bacteraemia by 50% by 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412446855">Durden, 2008</xref>). This was essential as approximately 8% of patients developed an HCAI in 2005, causing 5000 deaths annually and costing the NHS £180m each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757177412446855">World Health Organization (WHO), 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One fundamental issue in the reduction of HCAIs is the application of standard infection prevention precautions, which underpin routine practice and protect both staff and patients from infection. Standard precautions aim to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne and other pathogens from both recognised and unrecognised sources. They are the basic level of infection control precautions, which are to be used as a minimum in the care of all patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757177412446855">WHO, 2007</xref>). Standard precautions include hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe handling and disposal of waste, linen and sharps and safe management of blood spillages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757177412446855">RCN, 2005</xref>). The results of several studies have demonstrated that compliance with infection prevention standard precautions remains poor, with an average of 40% compliance reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412446855">Pittet et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412446855">Scott et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412446855">Flores and Pevalin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177412446855">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412446855">Gould et al, 2008</xref>). Reduced compliance has been found to be reflected by nurses’ poor knowledge of standard precautions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757177412446855">Pittet et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177412446855">Trim et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412446855">Marshall et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757177412446855">Trigg et al, 2008</xref>). Factors that affect compliance include insufficient time and heavy workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757177412446855">Ward, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177412446855">Madan et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177412446855">Sax et al, 2005</xref>), poor role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412446855">Scott et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177412446855">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>), lack of availability of protective equipment or hand wash facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757177412446855">Sax et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412446855">Ferguson et al, 2004</xref>) and lack of effective infection prevention education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177412446855">Stein et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1757177412446855">Wu et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757177412446855">Trigg et al, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177412446855">Stein et al (2003)</xref> suggest that experience or length of service is indirectly related to infection prevention compliance, with more experienced healthcare workers appearing to be less compliant, but Stein’s study did not explore this further. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent of nurses’ knowledge of infection prevention procedures, the degree to which knowledge of standard precautions was applied correctly, and whether experience was a factor in either nurses’ knowledge or application of infection prevention practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757177412446855" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey was distributed in March to June 2009 to determine nurses’ knowledge and understanding of infection prevention practices, from a population that comprised two district general hospitals and a university in one region. A stratified random sample was selected from 1,373 qualified nursing staff and 628 student nurses to ensure that the sample population was fairly represented. The eight strata were divided into the following two groups for data analysis: least experienced (year 1 pre-registration nurses, year 2 pre-registration nurses, year 3 pre-registration nurses and 0–5 years post-registration nurses) and most experienced (6–10 years, 11–15 years, 16–20 years and over 20 years post-registration nurses).</p>
<p>In total, 1,060 postal questionnaires were distributed with a return rate of 39.1% (<italic>n</italic>=414), and there was a minimum of 44 returns from each strata. The questionnaire was adapted from two existing tools used in similar studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412446855">Gould and Chamberlain 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412446855">Mann and Wood, 2006</xref>). Permission was sought from the original authors to use the questionnaires, ethical approval was obtained and a pilot study was conducted. The questionnaire incorporated six questions to assess participants’ self-reported confidence of their understanding of infection prevention procedures, 20 questions to determine their knowledge, and ten questions to measure application of knowledge to infection prevention practices. Data were non-parametric and were analysed by a Mann-Whitney test using SPSS (version 14.0) with significance set at <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177412446855" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 414 returns, 168 (40.6%) of participants were pre-registration nurses and 246 (59.4%) were post-registration, of which 233 (53.8%) comprised the least experienced group and 191 (46.2%) represented the most experienced group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177412446855">Figure 1</xref>). Nearly three quarters (73%) of those responding had received education in infection prevention and control less than a year previously, and 90% of the sessions had taken place in a traditional classroom setting. For the knowledge element of the questionnaire, the most experienced group had statistically significantly higher scores compared with the least experienced group (<italic>p</italic>=0.009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177412446855">Figure 2</xref>). The most experienced group also had significantly higher scores for the application of correct practice questions than the least experienced group (<italic>p</italic>=0.001). Additionally, there were no significant improvements in scores between the pre-registration nurses and those who had been qualified for five years or less (<italic>p</italic>=0.975, 0.618 and 0.106, respectively). These results suggest that nurses’ knowledge and application of infection prevention practice was significantly increased when they had a longer length of service.</p>

</fig>
<p>This finding was analysed further to determine trends in the data between the two groups. This was split into three aspects: the self-reported confidence that participants had in their own knowledge of infection prevention standard precautions and practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412446855">Figure 3</xref>), the correct knowledge demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1757177412446855">Figure 4</xref>) and the correct application of practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177412446855">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that for all aspects of infection prevention practices, the most experienced group were more confident in their understanding of the practice, had increased knowledge and a greater application of that knowledge to practice, compared with the least experienced group. However, the extent of this varied for the different standard infection prevention precautions, and the most experienced group demonstrated only an average knowledge and application to practice (11.16 for the 20 knowledge questions and 7.01 for the ten application questions).</p>

</fig>
<p>With regard to hand hygiene and use of PPE, both the least and the most experienced groups reported high self-confidence in their understanding of these practices (96% and 98%, respectively for hand hygiene and 87% and 94%, respectively for use of PPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412446855">Figure 3</xref>). However, both the least experienced and most experienced groups demonstrated particularly low scores for the knowledge questions for hand hygiene (4% and 8%, respectively) and use of PPE (19% and 31%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1757177412446855">Figure 4</xref>). Despite this for both the least experienced and most experienced groups, the application to practice was reasonable for hand hygiene (69% and 77%, respectively) and use of PPE (76% and 81%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177412446855">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, for these infection prevention practices, although nurses in both groups did not understand the underpinning theory, they did adhere to practice.</p>
<p>Yet for the disposing of waste and linen and caring for a patient with MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic> elements, findings suggest that poor knowledge led to poor application. For example, 61% of the least experienced and 83% of the most experienced group were confident in their understanding of caring for a patient with MRSA, yet only 56% of the least experienced and 68% of the most experienced group demonstrated accurate knowledge of MRSA, which was reflected by only 36% of the least experienced and 59% of the most experienced group adhering to practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1757177412446855">Figures 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1757177412446855">5</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757177412446855" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that nurses with six or more years of experience have significantly increased understanding of infection prevention and significantly increased application of knowledge to practice compared to nurses with five years or less experience. Although this result may in itself be considered unsurprising, the findings of this study provide a new insight into how infection prevention knowledge affects application for the different elements of infection prevention practice. In particular, findings illustrate that understanding of hand hygiene and use of PPE was poor yet application of this knowledge to practice was complaint, while knowledge of the care of patients with MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic> was limited, which was reflected by substandard application of knowledge to practice.</p>
<p>For safe disposal of waste and linen and caring for patients with MRSA or <italic>C. difficile</italic>, findings suggest that poor knowledge led to poor application of practice. This finding is supported by similar studies which found that healthcare workers were not aware of basic infection prevention measures required to care for patients with MRSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757177412446855">Trim et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177412446855">Marshall et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412446855">Easton et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177412446855">Lugg and Ahmed, 2008</xref>) or <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757177412446855">Vaughan et al, 2006</xref>), and suggests that this has not changed with time and a raising awareness strategy within the NHS.</p>
<p>Infection prevention training is now mandatory training annually for all healthcare staff in England to improve knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412446855">DH, 2008</xref>), but large classes or lectures are often used in order to teach the workforce basic infection prevention policy. Yet infection prevention education delivered through lectures can lead to a lack of engagement and concentration and often fails to achieve effective interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412446855">Billings, 2010</xref>). It could be suggested that this approach can lead to theory overload and can actually therefore enhance the theory–practice gap that it aims to close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412446855">Cole, 2005</xref>). Similarly for other areas of mandatory training it has also been reported that a ‘one size fits all’ approach does not meet the learning needs of healthcare professionals attending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757177412446855">Turner et al, 2011</xref>) and that practical skills and knowledge decline after three to six months following training delivered by lectures (Hamilton, 2005). This is often because overuse of lecture-based teaching resources can lead to lack of concentration and engagement and often fail to encourage interaction, usually because of the large audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412446855">Billings, 2010</xref>). This raises concerns that the content and delivery of infection prevention education in current pre-registration and post-registration nurse education curricula may not be adequate or effective.</p>
<p>It is thought that adult learners are also more motivated to learn to cope with real-life situations and identify their own learning needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412446855">Knowles, 1978</xref>). Current infection prevention educators should perhaps take into consideration adult learning styles in order to successfully meet the needs of nurses and therefore facilitate effective learning. Problem-based learning is emerging from andragogy as a teaching method that enables adult learners to not only find out about a subject but also how to think about it critically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412446855">Cole, 2005</xref>). Problem-based learning is beneficial as it facilitates the learner to develop problem-solving, critical thinking, team working and reflective skills that are essential in the practice setting. This method could be very appropriate for infection prevention education as there are many circumstances to which it could be applied in order to convey the same information as an educator would through the more frequently used pedagogical method, yet to date little has been documented as to the effectiveness of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412446855">Billings, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757177412446855">Ward, 2011</xref>). If infection prevention education therefore focuses less on basic standard precautions and more on problem-based scenarios of patients with specific infections, particularly MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic>, improved understanding may well be achieved and reflected by improved application of knowledge to practice.</p>
<p>With regards to hand hygiene and use of PPE, findings of this study suggest that although knowledge of these practices was poor, application of these skills was good. Previous studies that have evaluated knowledge and application of standard precautions found that poor knowledge of this element of infection prevention led to poor practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757177412446855">Stein et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757177412446855">Scott et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177412446855">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1757177412446855">Wu et al, 2006</xref>). It is possible that recent national and international campaigns such as the <italic>CleanYourHandsCampaign</italic>, the WHO’s 5 Moments of Hand Hygiene, Bare Below the Elbows and monthly hand hygiene audits in local hospitals has embedded good practice for hand hygiene and use of PPE even though the rationale may be poorly understood.</p>
<p>Alternatively it could be suggested that nurses perceive their practice to be applied more consistently than it actually is. It is acknowledged that nurses can believe their compliance may be better than it genuinely is when observed, audited and quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412446855">Cole, 2008</xref>). Although it is suggested that ineffective teaching methods may affect compliance for MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic>, it may also be inferred that infection prevention compliance is far more complex, with determinants such as attitudes, beliefs, habits and organisational culture affecting behaviour and therefore practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177412446855">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412446855">Cole, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412446855">Hanna et al, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412446855">Hanna et al (2009)</xref> found that nurses’ perceived importance of hand hygiene was directly related to their beliefs regarding the transmission of infections. Other studies have suggested that a change in attitude and behaviour by healthcare workers are required if compliance with infection prevention practice, particularly hand hygiene, is to be sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177412446855">Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757177412446855">Whitby et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412446855">Lee et al, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore it might be suggested that it is not acceptable to have good practice but poor knowledge of skills such as hand hygiene and use of PPE. While nurses may practise such skills correctly in a routine circumstance, the application of such practices or problem solving in a novel situation may require a sound knowledge base. It is therefore recognised that interactive education that fosters critical thinking and a questioning approach is essential to facilitate the development of positive attitudes to change towards infection prevention practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412446855">Billings, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of this study make recommendations for improvement in NHS organisations and universities where infection prevention education is delivered by infection prevention nurses. As such, these findings may have limited generalisability to organisations in which this education is provided by other means. However it could be suggested that regardless of how such education is delivered, the finding that poor knowledge of HCAIs is reflected by substandard practice, while poor knowledge of hand hygiene and use of PPE is not, may be used to inform improvements to infection prevention education in both the clinical and the academic setting.</p>
<p>The reliability and validity of studies that use self-reporting measures should be treated with some caution as respondents may report what they believe the researcher expects to see rather that what they actually do, or may report higher self-confidence than they actually have. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177412446855">Nichols and Badger (2008)</xref> report a disparity between espoused infection prevention knowledge and actual compliance in practice. Yet in this study poor responses to the knowledge questions were generally reflected by low self-reported application to practice, suggesting that self-reporting is unlikely to limit the reliability of the findings. Furthermore, the tool used in this study was amalgamated from two previous tools that were developed from the literature in collaboration with a microbiologist, and one was sent to an expert panel to obtain content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412446855">Gould and Chamberlain 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177412446855">Mann and Wood, 2006</xref>). However, although the tool had a confidence question and an application question for isolation nursing, it did not contain any knowledge questions surrounding this topic, which may have provided further insight into the relationship between infection prevention theory and practice.</p>
<p>The fact that many of the participants had attended infection prevention education less than a year previously raises the question of the effectiveness of the training provided. It may be that the content or delivery of the training was not sufficient, or that the classroom environment in which the majority were taught does not enable nurses to effectively learn these skills, which are very practical by nature in that they are applied during episodes of patient care. Similarly for the least experienced nurses, findings raise concerns with current pre-registration infection prevention education. For this sample population it is the hospital infection prevention nurses who provide education to the pre-registration nurses at the university, generally utilising the same education package that is used to provide annual post-registration training at the hospital. It is therefore suggested that nurse educators need to explore more innovative approaches to learning, which better suit the needs of individual learners in order to improve nurses’ fitness to practise, as good quality education is more likely to contribute towards compliant nurses and therefore to improve practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412446855">Cole, 2008</xref>). These findings have implications for both pre-and post-registration infection prevention education and suggest that centring education around HCAIs such as MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic> rather than on individual standard precautions may more effectively enhance knowledge and therefore application to practice.</p>
<p>There is little published information on nurses’ experience of pre- or post-registration infection prevention education, yet this may provide further understanding of how education affects knowledge and application of practice, or insight into what issues exist with regards to current infection prevention education. Lastly, further exploration of the role that adult learning theory and behavioural theory can play on improving knowledge and application to practice may provide more permanent adherence to infection prevention practices by influencing change in attitudes, beliefs and self-efficacy of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177412446855">Lee et al, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that experience enhances infection prevention knowledge and application to practice. Furthermore, knowledge of HCAIs is limited and is reflected by poor practice, while poor theoretical understanding of hand hygiene and use of PPE is not. Therefore, focusing infection prevention education on care of patients with specific infections, such as MRSA and <italic>C. difficile</italic>, rather than on individual standard precautions may more effectively increase knowledge and therefore application of infection prevention practices related to reducing these HCAIs. This is timely as the new <italic>Standards for Pre-registration Nursing Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177412446855">Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council, 2010</xref>) have continued to require a focus on infection prevention and control as an essential skills cluster throughout the pre-registration curriculum, which emphasises the importance of effective infection prevention and control education to underpin good practice.</p>
