<abstract>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to explore the prior educational and employment experiences of staff members in urban Aboriginal human services agencies. A total of 44 individuals employed by one of three community sites within one Canadian inner city generated 85 unique responses to the question: “What were your employment and education experiences before you got this job?” Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis of independent grouping of the responses by 16 participants revealed five underlying themes: formal education, helping others, holder of cultural knowledge, life experiences, and on-the-job training. These results were compared and contrasted with the available literature.</p>

<body>
<p>In Canada, Aboriginal peoples include the First Nations, Metis, and Inuit. The assimilation efforts undertaken by the European settlers who came to North America left a legacy of traumatic experiences with effects across generations to the present day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713611418357">Wesley-Esquimaux &amp; Smolewski, 2004</xref>). Although the Canadian population ranks 8th in the world on the United Nations Social Development Index, the Aboriginal population in Canada ranks 32nd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713611418357">Cooke, Mitrou, Lawrence, Guimond, &amp; Beavon, 2007</xref>). Poverty is a significant problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713611418357">Waldram, Herring, &amp; Young, 2006</xref>). Education and employment have been identified as crucial issues for a growing population that lags behind non-Aboriginal peoples in educational achievement and workforce income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713611418357">Mendelson, 2006</xref>). Employment is a way for individuals, families, and communities to emerge from poverty. Among an increasingly urbanized population, promising results have been found in neighborhood development efforts that are responsive to local need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713611418357">Silver, Hay, &amp; Klyne, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Community development is a capacity-building approach to addressing poverty through adult education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713611418357">Ramirez, 1990</xref>). Grassroots culture-based agencies have emerged to provide responsive and appropriate human services in high-poverty neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713611418357">Kirmayer, Simpson, &amp; Cargo, 2006</xref>). Employees of these agencies receive learning opportunities in organization building, program planning and development, budgeting and administration as well as frontline service delivery. Although they start with small budgets, agencies that grow in size and scope over time by providing services that are useful and used in the community achieve a rare balance of high credibility internally, with residents, and externally, with funders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713611418357">J. Brown &amp; Hannis, in press</xref>). This balance requires effective service based on local expertise.</p>
<p>To maintain their responsiveness agencies hire extensively, if not exclusively, from the local community. Therefore, by definition, they hire individuals who have struggled against historical trauma, systemic racism, and family poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713611418357">Chansonneuve, 2005</xref>). However, little is known about the qualifications that staff members hired by successful culture-based human services agencies bring to their role. The purpose of the present study was to explore the prior educational and employment experiences of staff members in culture-based human services agencies, from their perspective. Much has been written about barriers to employment, but little about assets among residents of high-poverty urban neighborhoods and none, that could be located in the current literature, from the perspective of Aboriginal staff themselves.</p>
<p>The significance of locally staffed human services agencies lies in their presence and role to help Aboriginal families in respectful and meaningful ways. It is crucial for culture-based Aboriginal family services to challenge the colonizing influence of Eurocentric approaches to family welfare that have done great damage to Aboriginal communities historically by severing relationships between children and their communities through residential schools and large-scale apprehensions of children from their homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713611418357">Dickason, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713611418357">Dockstator, 1993</xref>). Ownership by the Aboriginal community for the Aboriginal community offers new opportunities for individuals who would otherwise have considerable difficulty finding employment by recognizing their cultural gifts and giving them a chance. Indeed, the bulk of research on Aboriginal families has measured the depth and extent of deficits and pathology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713611418357">Koss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713611418357">O’Connell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713611418357">Saylors &amp; Daliparthy, 2006</xref>), and very little has focused on personal strengths and collective contributions. The lack of research on inner-city Aboriginal family services agencies delivering culturally based services reinforces the silence on their efforts within the mainstream and fuels misunderstanding and criticism when they do not organize or operate in the same way that non-Aboriginal agencies do.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741713611418357">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>In this section, we review factors identified in the literature as barriers to employment among Aboriginal peoples before turning to a summary of research on qualifications of potential employees of human services agencies in high-poverty urban communities.</p>
<p>There are multiple barriers to employment experienced among Aboriginal peoples living in high-poverty urban communities. The North American emphasis on individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713611418357">D. Brown, Horsman, &amp; Musleh, 2002</xref>) is in contrast to the ways of life for many Aboriginal peoples who operate from a collectivist perspective, based on what is best for the community. Racism and Eurocentrism continue to dominate mainstream discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713611418357">Battiste, 2010</xref>) leading to the negative presentation of Aboriginal peoples in the popular media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713611418357">Belanger, 2002</xref>). Non-Aboriginal business and labor leaders in general do not see the importance of hiring Aboriginal peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713611418357">Canadian Labour and Business Centre, 2004</xref>). The all-too-common experience of family poverty among Aboriginal peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713611418357">Iwasaki, Bartlett, &amp; O’Neil, 2003</xref>) is associated with food insecurity, inadequate housing, social service involvement, and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713611418357">Clarke &amp; van Amerom, 2008</xref>) as well as health challenges such as high rates of heart disease and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713611418357">Anand et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A lack of adult education policy and programs for Aboriginal peoples is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611418357">Gabriel, 2006</xref>). To be relevant and useful education must explicitly recognize Aboriginal cultures, realities, histories and traditions, as well as incorporate Western skills and knowledge to the extent desired by each community to promote meaningful social participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713611418357">Laughlin &amp; Leman, 2010</xref>). Some governments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713611418357">Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, 2000</xref>) have identified the need for recruitment of Aboriginal peoples into leadership positions within the public services, but these measures have not produced the intended results.</p>
<p>Although secondary education levels are increasing, Aboriginal peoples are relatively underpaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713611418357">Kunz, Milan, &amp; Schetagne, 2000</xref>). Earnings parity between Aboriginal peoples with equivalent education to non-Aboriginal peoples has not been achieved and the gap is most pronounced in urban communities with the highest proportions of Aboriginal peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713611418357">Pendakur &amp; Pendakur, 2008</xref>). It has been noted that there are not enough economic development efforts in place in these communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713611418357">Fraser, 2002</xref>) and there is a shortage of local Aboriginal-owned businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713611418357">D. Brown, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There is some literature on employment qualifications among staff who have been service recipients and subsequently hired by human services agencies in high-poverty urban communities. Although formal education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713611418357">Chapin, 2004</xref>) and postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713611418357">Hart, Zimbrich, &amp; Ghiloni, 2001</xref>) are helpful qualifications any previous work experience, supported or independent, is also considered important preparation for employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713611418357">Stephens, Collins, &amp; Dodder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713611418357">Weston, 2002</xref>). In particular, previous employment experience in a similar type of service delivery (e.g., family services) by an agency in the same geographic area (e.g., inner city) or with a similar mission and values (e.g., culture based) was highly valued by employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713611418357">Beimers &amp; Fischer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713611418357">Gao, Waynor, &amp; O’Donnell, 2009</xref>). In addition, relevant life experience such as dealings with government income support or family support services are seen positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713611418357">Haley-Lock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713611418357">Wade &amp; Dixon, 2006</xref>). Family connections to the cultural, geographic, or service community of the agency are seen as assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713611418357">Gold, Meisler, DuRoss, &amp; Bailey, 2004</xref>). Finally, the ability to solve problems and make good decisions quickly are also viewed as positive qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713611418357">Gibb &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>). Although this literature identifies a range of qualifications that staff may bring to their employment, the variety of skills, strengths, and experience that Aboriginal staff members identify in themselves is not discussed. The purpose of this study was to explore the prior educational and employment experiences of staff members in urban Aboriginal human services agencies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The researchers together had a professional background and direct service experience with human services and community development in Aboriginal communities. They were acutely aware of the misrepresentation of Aboriginal peoples in the popular media and the economic struggles faced in inner-city communities. Most important, however, they were cognizant of the highly positive local reputation of culture-based organizations, and the lack of visibility and recognition outside the community for what they were doing well.</p>
<p>Participants were all staff members from one of three participating inner-city Aboriginal agencies serving residents in a large Canadian city. Following discussions between the researchers and agency representatives, a decision about the most appropriate methodology for the study was made. A purely quantitative approach was judged to have the advantages of specificity and breadth. A purely qualitative approach was judged to have the advantages of flexibility and depth. Another important consideration was how to involve participants in the interpretation of results. A blend of qualitative and quantitative methods called concept mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713611418357">Trochim, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713611418357">1989b</xref>) was a trade-off offering breadth and flexibility at the expense of specificity and depth but was selected primarily because it offered the opportunity for individuals to participate in an interview as well as giving each equal influence on how the data from interviews were grouped together and represented conceptually.</p>
<p>After the researchers obtained agency board permission and university ethical approval, advertisements were placed within each agency inviting interested individuals to contact the researchers directly for further information and to arrange a private in-person individual interview. Data collection and analysis was consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713611418357">Trochim’s (1989)</xref> approach that included five steps: (a) selection of participants, (b) collection of responses to the research question, (c) grouping of responses to the question by participants, (d) analysis of grouping data, and (e) construction of a concept map.</p>
<sec id="section3-0741713611418357">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were contacted via poster advertisements placed within three Aboriginal nonmandated human services agencies in the downtown core of a large Canadian city. The participating agencies had community-based boards of directors, were relatively large (annual operating budgets of more than $1,000,000), had been in operation for at least 10 years, and were known for culturally appropriate as well as innovative and responsive service delivery. Each had a policy to hire locally.</p>
<p>Those who contacted the researchers for more information about the study and what participation would involve were asked if they would be interested in arranging an interview. All who contacted the researchers agreed to be interviewed and signed consent was obtained at the face-to-face meeting. Interviews included several questions. One question asked was, “What were your employment and education experiences before you got this job?”</p>
<p>One interview was conducted with each participant. Data collection continued until there were no new responses across five interviews. This happened after 44 individuals participated. The average length of employment at the time of interview was approximately 5 years. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 67 years and approximately three quarters were female. Collectively, their work experience included more than 100 different positions with the agencies ranging from janitorial and maintenance to program delivery and administration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741713611418357">
<title>Responses</title>
<p>Responses to the interview question were recorded verbatim in writing by the researchers. The 44 participants made a total of 131 responses to the question. The authors and a research assistant reviewed the responses independently and identified any that were unclear or redundant. Following this procedure, 85 unique responses remained for the grouping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741713611418357">
<title>Grouping</title>
<p>At the time of the interview, each participant was asked if she or he was interested in participating in the grouping task. All participants expressed interest at the time, and were later informed of the time, date, and location for four meetings that would be held for the grouping task. These meetings were held within the local community and were facilitated by the researchers. At these meetings participants were given a list of the 85 responses and asked to group them together in whatever way made sense to them. A total of 16 individuals grouped responses to the question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741713611418357">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Two analyses were used to analyze the grouping data. Multidimensional scaling organized the data with a similarity matrix and represented the results visually on a point map. Cluster analysis of the multidimensional scaling data organized the points into clusters, representing the underlying concepts. The concept system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713611418357">Trochim, 1987</xref>) was used to perform the analyses and construct the concept map.</p>
<p>Multidimensional scaling represented the frequencies with which each response was grouped with each other response as distances between the responses on a point map. The point map was a visual representation of the frequency with which participants grouped each response with other responses. A bridging index was calculated for each response. The index, ranging in value from .00 to 1.00 indicated the degree to which each response was grouped exclusively with those near to it on the point map. Low item bridging indices (between .00 and .25) indicated that the response was grouped together only with those close to it on the map, whereas a high bridging index (between .75 and 1.00) indicated that the response was grouped together with responses in all other areas of the map.</p>
<p>The underlying conceptual structure of the point map was calculated using cluster analysis. Cluster analysis used the multidimensional scaling values for responses on the point map. At each step of the analysis, each response was treated as its own cluster. Clusters were combined until all ended up in one cluster.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741713611418357">
<title>Concept Map</title>
<p>Researchers made the decision about the best number of concepts for the final map. This decision was based on both quantitative and qualitative data. The average bridging index value for each concept indicated the degree to which responses within it were grouped with responses outside the concept. A low average bridging index indicated that the responses in the grouping were conceptually similar. Based on a review of the content of the responses in a cluster, researchers made a decision about conceptual similarity of contents. Solutions of 10, 8, 6, 5, and 4 were examined before concluding that the five-concept solution fit the data best. The researchers, based on the contents of each, applied concept labels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this section, results of the study are described and compared with the literature.</p>
<sec id="section10-0741713611418357">
<title>Formal Education</title>
<p>Responses in this concept referred to experiences in formal education. Formal education occurred in secondary and postsecondary settings, as well as in community-based adult education centers and within the agencies participants were employed by. The content of the education varied from specific skill development offerings to complete programs in a focused area of study. Participants also indicated that they had experience “attending residential school.”</p>
<p>Participants described their level of secondary education and upgrading taken to obtain higher levels of grade completion. These experiences included “completed Grade 12” as a young adult as well as completing “Grade 12 as mature student.” Participants undertook “upgrading for Grade 11” as adult learners and “finished Grade 8 on reserve” as youth. University education included taking courses leading to a degree such as a “master’s degree” or a “bachelor’s degree” as well as those teaching courses as a “sessional instructor at university” and being a special guest speaker (e.g., “volunteer keynote speaker”). Participants also took “some college and university courses” to obtain a “diploma at community college.”</p>
<p>Local offerings for adult learners were taken by participants through the “local adult education center” including upgrading as well as complete training programs (“school for training program”) that led to “get a certificate through continuing education.” It should also be noted that formal education was offered by the agencies employing participants including training specific to the position (“agency trained me for the position”). The content of these programs and courses varied considerably from a “two-year typing course” with “computer skills training,” to “child and family worker training” with “courses on drug and alcohol effects” and a “course on fetal alcohol syndrome.” In a “business learning opportunity program,” there was special attention to “report writing.” Those who “completed a conflict resolution program” had a “practicum” to develop and practice their skills under supervision. In order to teach basic life skills to others, some took practical training such as a “cooking course” for people who were diabetic.</p>
<p>There has been some literature on access points and pathways through formal education for residents in high-poverty urban communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713611418357">Chapin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713611418357">Hart et al., 2001</xref>). In the current study, participants identified local schools, which included Aboriginal culture-based schools, as well as “mainstream” schools including those that were academic or vocationally oriented. In addition, adult learning centers run by the public school board and Aboriginal culture-based adult learning centers in the local community were available. Finally, professional university programs and community college programs were offered through satellite campuses in the local area.</p>
<p>The qualifications obtained by Aboriginal peoples through formal education have not yet met with the same level of employment or income that non-Aboriginal peoples with the same education achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713611418357">Mendelson, 2006</xref>). The availability of culturally based Aboriginal primary and secondary schools as well as adult learning centers, ranging from upgrading to postsecondary programs and courses are great community assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713611418357">Battiste, 2004</xref>). However, according to the latest census data, there continues to be a gap in employment rate and earnings despite improvements in educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713611418357">Wilson &amp; Macdonald, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0741713611418357">
<title>Helping Others</title>
<p>In this concept, the responses emphasized the education and experience that participants had in a helping role informally or formally for pay, or both. For example, participants indicated that they had helped caregivers who needed a break, by being a “babysitter,” and had served as a role model for healthy activity and diet, by being an “athlete.” Formal activities for pay include previous experience “worked for Aboriginal agencies” and “worked as a protection worker on my reserve,” including “respite work.” Others noted that they combined their personal and professional roles by having “worked in the community,” and in that community had “always been a counselor.”</p>
<p>There is some literature on responsibilities that residents have to one another by virtue of being a member of a cultural community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713611418357">Clarkson, Morrissette, &amp; Regallet, 1992</xref>). The recognition of qualifications through the experience of “helping others,” whether they were paid or were volunteers, or simply part of one’s role and duty to others in that community, has received little attention in the literature on qualifications of staff hired in high-poverty settings. Formal status as an “employee” or “volunteer” has become the “currency” described in the literature used to recognize and validate experience relevant to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713611418357">Stephens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713611418357">Weston, 2002</xref>). The cultural context of role and responsibility to others which legitimized one’s activities, experiences, and accomplishments in Aboriginal communities, has not been attended to in the literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0741713611418357">
<title>Holder of Cultural Knowledge</title>
<p>Responses in this concept focused on participants experience as holders of cultural knowledge. This knowledge was expressed in various ways of “teaching culture to own people.”</p>
<p>Participants “helped coordinate local Pow Wow” and were involved as a “Pow Wow dancer.” Some had experience “leading ceremonies” and had “run sweat lodges.” They maintained the ties to traditional indigenous ways even after “was sent to farms of relatives of the nuns and priest” in an attempt to assimilate them into European cultures.</p>
<p>They also had served “on the council of a national Aboriginal organization.” Participants had “years of experience with residential kids,” working in “residential group homes” and had “raised 8 kids” themselves. They had “traveled across Canada to detention centers for youth” and had experience with “family group conferencing.” They were trained in “cross-cultural awareness” and had offered “counseling training workshops through reserve” that used traditional knowledge to work in different areas, such as an “addictions counselor.”</p>
<p>Participants identified the need to have a cultural basis for their work experience for employment in Aboriginal human services agencies. It was also noted in the literature that connections to the geographic community in which the employment was situated were important in securing employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713611418357">Gold et al., 2004</xref>). As well the literature did include the benefit of previous employment in relation to the type of work, clientele, and values of the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713611418357">Beimers &amp; Fischer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713611418357">Gao et al., 2009</xref>). However, we could find no literature on the combination of these different sources and types of knowledge–traditional and professional–that helped individuals secure employment by human services agencies in high-poverty urban communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0741713611418357">
<title>Life Experiences</title>
<p>Participants also brought with them a great deal of life experience. Some had struggled and overcome additions themselves, such as having been an “alcoholic” who became “sober for 12 years.” Some noted that they had been involved in “illegal activities” and had “no work experience.” Participants also had experience as caregivers, for example, a “son was born with FASD.” Because of their family and community responsibilities “woman had lots of work to do.” Having made positive changes, they had a natural role as helpers, even noting that “as a kid, friends always asked me for advice” and as they became older, “got a lot of responsibility because of what I had done with my life.”</p>
<p>Relevant life experiences have been described in the literature as preparatory for employment. It is important to note that progress had to be made to resolve personal issues before this experience would be considered an asset for helping others working on similar issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713611418357">Haley-Lock, 2007</xref>). For example, previous experience with government support agencies, such as income-related or family-related services could be seen positively among those hired to work with other families who were navigating their way through those systems and dealing with the agents of those systems (e.g., income support worker, child protection worker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713611418357">Wade &amp; Dixon, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741713611418357">
<title>On-the-Job Training</title>
<p>Previous job experience contributed to the knowledge and training held by participants for their current positions. Some had “worked at nonprofits” and “worked at non-Aboriginal for-profit organization” or had worked as an “inner-city community center staff” before. Various human services employment such as having “worked for senior citizens” or having “worked at a health facility” where had “worked as nurses’ aid,” were complemented by other experiences such as “working since I was a youth” as a “camp coordinator” and “employment counselor.” Administrative work was also noted by experience as an “executive director.”</p>
<p>Participants had previous experience being “hired by a government agency” or had “volunteered with government.” Some had “worked with provincial programs” or had “worked with the city” in different departments, such as having “worked with the police.” Some had “joined the armed forces.”</p>
<p>There was a great deal of experience held among participants who had worked in industrial or hospitality areas. Some “worked in forestry” or as a “construction worker” doing different “manual labor jobs” with supervision responsibilities, for example, to “supervise night shift.” Participants had experience as a “hotel supervisor” or “hotel cleaning” as well as other jobs within the “hospitality industry” such as a “waitress” who “worked at a deli.” Others had experience in retail sales, such as having “worked at drug store” or taking calls for a company that “cleaned homes.” They also had experiences in culture, news, and research roles having “worked at a museum,” “worked at a news center,” and “worked as an interviewer for a research project,” respectively.</p>
<p>Consistent with the literature about previous employment experience as a contributor to future employment participants brought various employment experiences to their current positions. Experiences most closely related to the position sought are most relevant and credible, but evidence of ability to work well with people and to make sound decisions or seek advice when necessary are also important and available from a wide range of previous employment experiences (e.g., retail; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713611418357">Gibb &amp; Taylor, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There were several similarities between the existing literature and the experiences of participants in the present study lending credibility to the results of previous research and extending its applicability to some of the issues facing Aboriginal peoples providing human services in inner-city communities. However, there were also some points of differences that suggest possibilities for future research on adult learning experiences and needs.</p>
<p>There were similarities between the participants in the present study and the literature on qualifications associated with formal education, previous work experience, and related life experience. Although there were several references regarding the importance of formal education to secure employment among adult learners in high-poverty urban communities, the fact that the earning power of formal education differed significantly depending on whether or not one was Aboriginal was also discussed in the literature. The influence of discrimination at the broadest societal and systemic levels should not be overlooked. The role of previous work experience was also consistent with the literature on employment of local residents in high-poverty urban communities. Although experience that was directly related to the position sought was valued highly, any employment experience that showed an ability to work with others and make good decisions was useful. Finally, the life experience individuals had obtained by working through their own challenges was considered an asset by both participants in the present study and in previous research.</p>
<p>A significant difference between the participants in the current study and the existing literature concerned the role of traditional cultural knowledge and preparation for employment. The community, which collectively holds knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation, defines what “cultural knowledge” is. Oral traditions transmit knowledge from the old to the young, and include both the sacred and the public. Sacred knowledge, such as that which is shared in ceremony, is shared very carefully and only with those who have been prepared to know it to protect its integrity and guard against its misuse. Public knowledge, such as values and customs, may be shared more widely, but still held close to the community and owned by the community to be shared at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Determining qualifications for employment among applicants to culture-based human services agencies includes not only an appreciation and understanding of formal education but also a highly sophisticated understanding of what cultural knowledge is, whose cultural knowledge it is, how it meshes with the requirements of the position, and how it is validated. In the case of employment, a record of employment such as a written reference is typically used. Formal education typically leads to the generation of a certificate that can be shared with a prospective employer. However, cultural knowledge is not typically documented in written form. It comes from the community. Based on collective responsibility, the community determines what position an individual occupies and with that, the role she or he plays. These activities are not engaged in “for credit” (volunteer or paid) that would lead to employment but rather out of a sense of responsibility to the community. Cultural knowledge can nevertheless be a valuable asset for employment, as described by participants in the present study and has not been explored in the existing literature.</p>
<p>To what extent cultural knowledge is a qualification for employment within culture-based human services agencies in high-poverty urban neighborhoods depends on the judgment of the community, the agency, and the applicant. Participants in the present study described their cultural knowledge as an important qualification and asset or compliment to the knowledge obtained through formal professional training in their roles as helpers. In their agencies, cultural and professional knowledge were interrelated and the combination held made them a particularly good fit as staff of those agencies.</p>
<p>Additional research is needed on the relationship of cultural knowledge to professional knowledge as not only a qualification for employment but also as a potential contributor to job satisfaction, performance, and service outcomes in Aboriginal human services agencies operating within different contexts ranging in size and across geographic locations. Although it is apparent from the perspectives of staff in large, longstanding, and well-respected agencies in the urban core of a Canadian city that such knowledge is essential to their ability to do their jobs, perspectives of agency administrators, program funders, service recipients, and cultural leaders and community residents should also be sought. The potential for bringing cultural and professional knowledge together formally may also be explored for its appropriateness in different communities and on different topics as well as appropriate content and delivery methods.</p>
