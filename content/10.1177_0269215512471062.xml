<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Falls in older adults are a major health problem. Approximately 30% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older fall at least once a years and 6% of these falls result in fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512471062">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512471062">2</xref></sup> Recent meta-analyses of fall prevention programs convincingly showed that exercise interventions are effective at reducing the risk of falls and fall injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512471062">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512471062">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Walking ability was significantly associated with a history of falls in healthy, elderly people living in the community,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512471062">5</xref></sup> and many falls in the elderly occurred during walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512471062">6</xref></sup> Current studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to prevent falls include power training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512471062">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512471062">8</xref></sup> balance training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512471062">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512471062">10</xref></sup> and aquatic training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512471062">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512471062">12</xref></sup> These training methods focused on human physical function. On the other hand, training focused on human cognitive function has also been reported. Morioka and Yagi reported that the center-of-gravity sway and functional reach test of healthy adults improved significantly in a RCT after a plantar perceptual learning task with hardness discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471062">13</xref></sup> They also showed that the center-of-gravity sway and functional reach test of hemiplegic stroke patients, as well as elderly and very old individuals, improved significantly following this task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512471062">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512471062">16</xref></sup> Moreover, we reported that the task significantly improved the center-of-gravity sway of healthy adults standing on one leg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471062">17</xref></sup> These studies demonstrated that postural control improves through the plantar perceptual learning task.</p>
<p>However, the efficiency of the plantar perceptual learning task was verified for postural control only in the standing position but not during walking. Recent studies reported that measuring acceleration during walking with an accelerometer was an effective evaluation of walking ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512471062">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512471062">22</xref></sup> Therefore, we performed a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of the plantar perceptual learning task on postural control during walking in healthy, community-dwelling, elderly persons.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We recruited study subjects from an elder day-care center, which agreed to explain the protocol of the experiments to participants and to acquire informed consent from them. Of the participants, 145 wished to be considered as potential study subjects. None of these had participated in earlier studies by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471062">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471062">17</xref></sup> Individuals were selected according to the following inclusion criteria: age 65 years or older, community dwelling, had not visited a primary care physician within the previous 12 months, ability to walk independently, and a Mini-Mental State Examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512471062">23</xref></sup> score of 24 or greater. We also used an interview to exclude participants based on the following exclusion criteria: severe cardiac, pulmonary, or musculoskeletal disorder; pathologies associated with increased risk of falls, such as Parkinson’s disease or stroke; osteoporosis; the use of psychotropic drugs; and peripheral neuropathy.</p>
<p>As a result, 86 subjects were chosen to participate in the experiments. As they were recruited, subjects were assigned random numbers generated by excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). They were then assigned to one of the two groups according to size of the random numbers. Those with the higher numbers were assigned to one group and those with the lower numbers were assigned to the other group. This assignment operation was conducted by a third party totally unaware of the study content, and those collecting the outcome data and making the outcome assessments were also blind to the group membership.</p>
<p>The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were told at the start of the study that they could discontinue their participation at any time during the experiments. We explained details of the experiments, and before participation the subjects provided written informed consent. Experiments were conducted under the supervision of physical therapists to prevent falls. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee for Research of Setsunan General Hospital, Japan.</p>
<p>The intervention group was trained to discriminate different hardness levels of sponge mats with foot sole perception for a total of 10 days over a period of 4 weeks. Procedures described below were in accordance with those in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471062">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471062">17</xref></sup> We used squares of sponge mat (INOAC, Aichi, Japan) with five different levels of hardness (58.8, 78.5, 107.9, 200, 308 N/100 πcm<sup>2</sup>), as measured by an automatic hardness tester (type JIS K6400, Asker JA). All were made of the same material and were of the same size (30 cm × 30 cm<sup>2</sup> × 40 mm thick).</p>
<p>Physiotherapists, unaware of the content of the study, conducted the experiments. Subjects in the intervention group were requested to discriminate, with their eyes closed, the various hardness levels when the mats were placed beneath their feet while maintaining a standing posture. They sat on a platform sufficiently high so that their soles could not touch the floor and were blindfolded. They were then instructed by a physiotherapist to stand up and to determine the various hardness levels of sponge mat squares according to sensation of the bilateral foot soles. The physiotherapist first asked the subject to memorize the different hardness levels by reciting these in the increasing order of hardness from 58.8 to 308 N and then in reverse order once for each subject. After this memorization step, the therapist gave the subject the task of discriminating the hardness of the five different sponge mat squares presented in a random order. During this process, the subject was told immediately whether the answer was correct. The memorization step was repeated once more. After a 30 s break, the subject performed 10 sets of exercises with hardness levels determined by a random table, formulated so that each of the five hardness-graded mats was included twice in each of the 10 sets. The number of incorrect answers was designated as the score of the training exercise.</p>
<p>During these 10 sets of randomly imposed training exercises, the subject was not told whether the answers were correct. Subjects could select their own posture, but were instructed not to allow the soles of the feet to move off or above the sponge mat square. For instance, running on the spot was prohibited.</p>
<p>Subjects in the control group were requested to stand on squares of sponge mat that were randomly presented based on the random table, but were not asked to discriminate their hardness levels. This task was conducted for a total of 10 days as in the intervention group. Accordingly, the intervention group and the control group were exposed to exactly the same dosage of training with the only difference being the discrimination awareness of surface hardness. The purpose of the task was to test the hypothesis that an improvement in posture balance during walking was effected exclusively by the hardness discrimination training, and not by enhancement of stability through standing on sponge mat squares.</p>
<p>Walking speed and trunk acceleration during walking were measured in every subject both on a day before the initial training day and on the day after the last training day. Acceleration was measured using a wireless tri-axial accelerometer (MVP-RF8, size: 45 mm × 45 mm<sup>2</sup> × 18.5 mm deep, weight: 60 g, Microstone, Nagano, Japan) fixed to a belt at the level of the L3 spinous process, where the opposing rotations of the pelvis and thorax are most effectively neutralized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512471062">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512471062">25</xref></sup> The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The subjects were instructed to walk on a 15-m smooth, horizontal walkway, including a 2.5-m space at the beginning and end of the walkway for acceleration and deceleration, respectively. Therefore, measurements were performed over a 10-m distance. Subjects were instructed to walk at a self-selected, comfortable walking speed. Based on the obtained acceleration data, the root mean square (RMS) of the medio–lateral (ML), vertical (VT), and anterio–posterior (AP) accelerations were calculated. Menz et al. reported that increases in acceleration RMS increases walking speed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512471062">26</xref></sup> therefore, normalized RMS was also calculated. In the present study, we normalized acceleration RMS by dividing it by the square of the walking speed. This parameter is indicative of the magnitude of trunk fluctuation without an effect of gait velocity during the walk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512471062">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>To validate the group assignments, we compared the age, height, body weight, and Mini-Mental State Examination of the two groups with the Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test. We employed a chi-square test to compare numbers of subjects by gender. To analyze the number of incorrect answers made during the 10-day hardness discrimination task, we used one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The repeated measure ANOVA was followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test for comparison of significant differences between each day. The acceleration RMS (ML, VT, AP) and walking speed values of the pre- and postintervention were analyzed using two-way repeated measure ANOVA. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS ver17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Level of significance was set at less than 5%.</p>

<p>Each group was composed of 43 subjects, one group serving as the intervention group and the other as the control group. During the training, two participants in the intervention group dropped out because of family problems. In the control group, three participants dropped out because of family problems and one for social reasons. The intervention was completed by 41 participants (23 females and 18 males, mean age of 73.59 SD 6.23 years) in the intervention group and 39 participants (19 females and 20 males, mean age of 74.10 SD 5.78 years) in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512471062">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The RMS values of acceleration during walking were significantly more reduced in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the walking speeds. The RMS of the acceleration, an indicator of acceleration dispersion, is the most commonly used parameter for assessing upper-body dynamic stability during walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512471062">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512471062">33</xref></sup> Our results suggest that the planter perceptual learning task improves upper-body dynamic stability during walking of elderly subjects, but does not contribute to their walking speed.</p>
<p>Centripetal information from the visual, somatosensory, and vestibular labyrinth pathways plays a crucial role in posture control during walking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512471062">34</xref></sup> Plantar perception in the elderly was reported to be significantly decreased compared with that in young people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512471062">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215512471062">36</xref></sup> It has also been reported that postural balance declines as plantar perception decreases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215512471062">37</xref></sup> A prospective study of risk factors for falling in elderly people found reduced plantar perception among those who fell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215512471062">38</xref></sup> These findings suggest that somatosensory information from the plantar surface is important for postural balance during walking by elderly people. In this study, the number of incorrect responses made the first time the plantar perceptual learning task was performed was greater than that for healthy adults obtained in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471062">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471062">17</xref></sup> As training proceeded, the number of incorrect responses decreased significantly. This suggests that the perceptual capacity of the plantar surface improved as a result of the plantar perceptual learning task, enabling errors in postural balance during walking to be corrected and improving upper-body dynamic stability during walking.</p>
<p>Moreover, we showed previously, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, that oxyhemoglobin increased significantly in the premotor and supplemental motor areas during the plantar perceptual learning task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215512471062">39</xref></sup> Naito et al. also indicated that the error correction of somatosensory information was processed in the premotor and supplemental motor areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215512471062">40</xref></sup> Therefore, our present findings suggest that those brain areas that processed error correction were activated during the plantar perceptual learning task, and may have contributed to improved postural control during walking with the decrement of plantar perceptual error.</p>
<p>The current study indicated that the plantar perceptual learning task was effective for stabilizing postural control during walking in addition to in the standing position. Postural control is categorized as static and dynamic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512471062">41</xref></sup> Static, or in-place, postural control while standing relies on a stationary base of support that must be maintained within the center of gravity; such control was involved in the center-of-gravity sway and functional reach test in the standing position examined in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512471062">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512471062"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512471062"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512471062">17</xref></sup> On the other hand, in dynamic postural control during walking, both the base of support and the center of gravity are moving; such postural control was involved in the walking examined in the current study. Centripetal information from the visual, somatosensory, and vestibular labyrinth pathways plays a crucial role in both static and dynamic postural control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512471062">34</xref></sup> Therefore, the current study suggests that the plantar perceptual learning task was effective for improving both static and dynamic postural control.</p>
<p>This study had a few limitations. First, we did not directly demonstrate whether the plantar perceptual learning task improved walking stability, because the trunk acceleration measured in this study is not directly indicative of walking stability. Second, the effect of foot placement during walking was not normalized. Therefore, it is possible that trunk acceleration may differ according to foot placement during walking. Third, the tasks we imposed could not be used to determine whether their performance would reduce the risk of falling. It remains to be clarified whether subjects with improved postural control during walking could maintain this improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to follow-up the study participants over a long period. In addition, the results cannot be generalized to patients undergoing rehabilitation, as our subjects were healthy adults. Accordingly, we need to examine a variety of subjects with deteriorated postural control during walking, including those with poor activities of daily living owing to various physical factors, and those with serious underlying diseases.</p>
