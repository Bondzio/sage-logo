<p>The aim of this work is to characterize the compaction behavior of jute woven fabric preforms. The maximum compaction pressure, permanent deformation, and stress relaxation of the preforms were found to be dependent on the final fiber volume fraction and the compaction speed. Higher compaction speeds led to higher compaction pressures, stress relaxation, and permanent deformation. On the other hand, as the fiber content was raised, the maximum compaction pressure and the permanent deformation increased, while the stress relaxation decreased. In addition, it was found that the structure of natural fibers affected the compaction behavior of the preforms. Each fiber is composed of several hollow elementary fibers, which collapsed due to the compressive loading. Furthermore it was found that fluid absorption reduced the compaction pressure in natural fiber preforms due to fiber softening.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410484" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growing interest in reducing the environmental impact of materials is leading to the development of newer materials or composites, based on natural resources. Glass, carbon, and aramid fibers have better mechanical properties than natural fibers, but they are much more expensive. Other advantages of using natural fibers in composite materials are low densities, less abrasiveness (less wear on tooling, ease of handling), good specific properties, easy recyclability, good thermal and sound insulation properties, wide variety of fibers available throughout the world, rural jobs generation in non-food agricultural/farm based economy, and low energy consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410484">1</xref></sup> On the other hand, natural fibers have some limitations, such as water absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410484">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410484">2</xref></sup> that can result in swelling of the fibers, which can reduce the dimensional stability of the agro-fiber composites, and also deteriorates their mechanical properties as it weakens the matrix–fiber interface. Other drawback of these fibers is their lower thermal stability, because they suffer lignocellulosic degradation at low temperatures (about 200°C), limiting their use in some applications and also the processing temperatures. This is a very important issue in most thermoplastics processing techniques. Therefore liquid composite molding (LCM) techniques, such as resin transfer molding (RTM) or vacuum infusion (VI) seems to be a better choice for processing these materials. In addition to the LCM low processing temperatures, fibers do not suffer thermo-mechanical degradation as in the extrusion process.</p>
<p>Basically, in LCM techniques a catalyzed resin is forced to flow through a dry reinforcement placed inside a mold. The reinforcement is impregnated by the resin and after curing, the part can be removed from the mold. To fully understand the process variables and optimize the product quality, it is important to have knowledge on the different phenomena occurring during the processing of the part: the compaction and impregnation of the preform are some of the key phenomena. Many authors have studied the impregnation process of different reinforcements, which can bedescribed in terms of fabric permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410484">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410484">9</xref></sup> and capillary effects developed during saturation of the fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410484">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410484">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preform compaction and permeability are closely related, because the compaction of the fabrics changes the geometry and size of the channels through which the impregnating liquid flows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410484">13</xref></sup> This also means that the final microstructure of the reinforcement depends to some extent on its compaction behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref></sup> and therefore has a direct impact on the mechanical properties of the composite.</p>
<p>Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410484">15</xref></sup> have studied the main factors contributing to the compaction of preforms. They identified five different mechanisms: yarn cross section deformation, yarn flattening, yarn bending deformation, void/gap condensation, and nesting. Also, they related these mechanisms with the architecture of the reinforcement. Yarn cross section deformation, flattening, and bending deformation, as well as nesting, are the main factors that affect the compaction of woven fabrics. Random mats main compaction mechanisms are yarn flattening and void/gap condensation. Therefore the compaction of woven fabrics is a more complex process than the compaction of random mats. In addition, the contact pressure distribution for woven fabrics is not uniform. The ‘hills’ and ‘valleys’ of the woven fabric produce high and low pressure spots, and pressure gradients exist between these spots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410484">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many authors have demonstrated that the response of fibrous materials to compressive loads is time dependent, so it is said that preforms made of a stack of several fabric layers have a viscoelastic behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410484">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410484">16</xref></sup> They observed that the load required to maintain a fixed thickness in a preform decreases with time, so stress relaxation occurs. In the same way, if a constant load is applied to a preform as it happens in VI technique, its thickness will decrease with time. This phenomenon is known as fiber settling. The rate of loading affects the compaction response, as in all the viscoelastic processes. Somashekar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref></sup> studied the influence of the compaction speed on the elastic spring-back, viscoelastic recovery, and permanent deformation of glass fiber reinforcements. Basically, they observed that for woven fabrics the elastic spring-back and the viscoelastic recovery increase with the compaction speed, while the permanent deformation does not change significantly.</p>
<p>The compressive forces applied to the stack of fabrics lead to permanent deformation of the preform. As a result, if subsequent loading and unloading cycles are performed, the unstressed thickness of the specimens decreases after each cycle, reaching a steady value after several tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410484">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, the load–displacement behavior changes from cycle to cycle, and the compaction stress needed to achieve a desired fiber volume fraction decrease as the number of cycles increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref></sup> This behavior is attributed to the irreversible nesting of fiber yarns (geometric shifts between adjacent yarns) and to permanent fiber deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410484">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The presence of a fluid affects the compaction properties of fibrous materials, as was demonstrated by several authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410484">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410484">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311410484">19</xref></sup> In processes such as RTM where the preform is compressed between two rigid mold faces, the presence of a liquid creates a lubrication effect that decreases the clamping forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410484">18</xref></sup> or in other words, a higher fiber volume fraction can be obtained with the available load capacity.</p>
<p>In order to process natural fiber composites by LCM techniques, it is crucial to have knowledge on the differences in structure and chemical composition between commercial synthetic fibers and natural fibers, and to know how these differences affect the processing variables. Due to the polar character of this kind of reinforcements, they absorb fluid and, as a consequence, swell during the infiltration process, leading to a decrease in both saturated and unsaturated permeabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410484">2</xref></sup> The absorption of polar water-based fluids is significant, but also some fluid absorption was observed in tests performed with phenolic and vinyl ester resins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410484">2</xref></sup> The compaction behavior of natural fiber reinforcements was studied by several authors. Its compactibility was found to be generally lower than that of glass fiber preforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410484">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311410484">20</xref></sup> Bo Madsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311410484">21</xref></sup> related this difference to the fibers structure, stating that glass fiber assemblies are essentially unidirectional since it is made of rovings with continuous and parallel fibers, while plant fiber assemblies are made of yarns with discontinuous and twisted fibers, which reduce the degree of fiber alignment, decreasing the compactibility. Madsen and Lilholt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311410484">20</xref></sup> found that the compaction response of plant fiber preforms is affected by the type of fiber. In addition, they observed a considerable change in compaction behavior at the second loading cycle, reducing the necessary compaction stress for obtaining maximum compaction. This effect was more pronounced for plant fiber assemblies with lower compactibility. Umer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410484">18</xref></sup> found that, due to the hydrophilic character of natural fibers, the impregnation with polar liquids reduced the compaction forces due to the fluid absorption and softening of wood fibers, while non-polar liquids had no effect on the compaction stress. Lundquist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311410484">22</xref></sup> showed that due to the hollow nature of the pulp fibers, they exhibit localized collapse at contact points.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to characterize the deformation response of jute fiber preforms to transverse compressive forces. An exhaustive analysis of the compaction behavior of jute woven fabrics was done. To our knowledge, the compaction behavior of jute woven fabrics, which is a suitable reinforcement for natural fiber based composite materials, has not been studied in literature.</p>

<p>Biaxial plain weave jute fabric (Castanhal Textil, Brasil; surface density = 0.0300 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used in this study. The fabrics were thoroughly washed with a 2% V/V detergent and distilled water solution, to remove contaminants and normalize the fabrics conditions for all the tests. After 2 h of immersion in the solution, the fabrics were rinsed with water and air dried. Circular samples consisting of six fabric layers of 130 mm diameter each were used in the compaction tests.

<sec id="sec4-0021998311410484"><title>Observation of compaction mechanism – micro structural analysis</title>
<p>Natural fiber structure was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, model JEOL JSM 6460 LV). Also, jute/unsaturated polyester composite plates were manufactured by the compression molding technique. Fiber volume fractions of 0.24, 0.30, 0.37, and 0.42 were achieved by stacking 4, 5, 6, and 7 layers of reinforcements respectively while keeping the mold cavity thickness fixed (0.315 cm). The composites plates were sectioned and polished, and the microstructure of the preform was observed using an optical microscope (Olympus PMG 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410484"><title>Compaction experiments</title>
<p>An Instron 4467 Universal Testing Machine with a 30 kN load cell was used to carry out the compression tests. Preform samples were compressed at constant compaction rate, until the desired thickness or fiber volume fraction was achieved. Compaction rates used were 0.5, 5, and 50 mm/min, and the final thicknesses were chosen in order to obtain fiber volume fractions of 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55. The machine was programmed to hold the final thickness for 10 min while the load was recorded in order to analyze the stress relaxation in the preform. After the relaxation step, the test was repeated two more times. Thus, three loading cycles were obtained. In order to fix some variables like architecture of the preform and chemical nature of the fibers, all the experiments were conducted with a single type of preform: the jute fabric. The stacking sequence used was always 0/90º. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410484">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows a sketch of the experimental set up. The wet compaction tests were carried out by compressing the preforms that had been placed inside a container filled with the test fluid: a 20% V/V water in glycerin (technical grade, Biopack, Argentina) solution. Such test fluid was chosen because its viscosity is close to that of the infusion resin viscosity (0.2–0.5 Pa.s).</p>

<p>Natural fibers can be classified into several categories, such as wood fibers, vegetable fibers, animal fibers, and mineral fibers. Jute fibers belong to the group of vegetable fibers and are extracted from the bast of the jute plants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311410484">23</xref></sup> The technical fiber is a bundle (50–100 µm) of elementary fibers (10–20 µm) called macrofibrils glued together with a matrix of lignin and hemicellulose. These macrofibrils are composite materials made of several layers of cellulose microfibrils (which are the mainly responsible for the mechanical properties of the fiber) embedded in a matrix of lignin and hemicellulose. The elementary fibers are like hollow tubes, and the open channel on the center of the macrofibril is called lumen. Due to its chemical composition rich in cellulose and hemicelluloses, natural fibers are highly hydrophilic. Aschematic view of a natural fiber structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410484">Figure 2</xref>. Scanning electron Micrographs of jute fibers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410484">Figure 3</xref>.

The pictures correspond to specimens with fiber volume fractions of 0.24, 0.30, 0.37 and 0.42. It was found, as expected, that the gap between yarns and fibers was greatly reduced as the fiber content was increased. In addition, the compaction mechanisms described by Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410484">15</xref></sup> for woven fabrics, such as yarn cross section deformation, flattening, and nesting, were more visible as the fiber volume fraction increased.

This transverse deformation is increased with the increase in fiber content.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311410484">Table 1</xref> shows the differences in the maximum compaction pressure reached in every test. As a general trend, the compaction pressure needed to achieve the desired fiber volume fraction increased with the compaction speed. A more significant increment was observed when raising the speed from 0.5 to 5 mm/min than from 5 to 50 mm/min. It seems that very low compaction speeds led to an easier fiber and yarn movement and rearrangement while the compaction plate descended compressing the preform, and thus less fiber and yarn deformation occurred. Consequently the compaction pressure decreased, because fiber and yarn reorganization required lower compressive forces than fiber and yarn deformation.

<p>It can be seen that, with the exception of the experiment conducted at 50 mm/min for 55% of fiber, the compaction pressure without the hydrodynamic effect is independent of the compaction speed. In the dry tests, higher compaction speeds generate higher compaction forces because as the speed is raised fiber rearrangement is avoided. But the lubrication of the fluid makes this mechanism possible. That is why the ‘corrected maximum compaction pressure’ is always lower than the dry compaction pressure.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410484">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the permanent deformation suffered by the jute preforms after the initial loading cycle, for the different testing conditions. It is clear that there was significant permanent deformation in every test, caused by the irreversible yarn cross section deformation, flattening, and nesting of the yarns, as proposed by Robitaille and Gauvin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410484">17</xref></sup> In addition, some percentage of the permanent deformation of the preform was caused by the irreversible deformation of the fibers, due to cell wall collapse and lumen closure in the macro fibrils, as shown in the micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410484">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="fig7-0021998311410484" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Permanent deformation suffered by the jute preforms. (a) Dry tests – after the initial loading cycle.

(d) Wet tests – after the second loading cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410484-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The trend observed for the dry tests is that the permanent deformation increased when the compaction speed and the fiber volume fraction were raised. As the preforms were compressed to higher fiber volume fractions the compaction pressure increased while the same number of fabric layers was squeezed to a smaller thickness. Therefore the compaction mechanisms such as yarn cross section deformation, yarn flattening, and nesting were more significant as the fiber content was increased. Also, more elementary fibers could break and suffer lumen collapse, even at the low pressure spots on the ‘valleys’ of the woven fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410484">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was found that permanent deformation increased as the compaction speed was raised. On the other hand, Somashekar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref></sup> observed an opposite trend for glass plain woven fabrics. In the case of glass fiber reinforcements (used by those authors), slower compaction speeds facilitate tow nesting, thus increasing permanent deformation of the preform. However, when natural fiber fabrics are used, breakage of elementary fibers and lumen collapse are two important mechanisms responsible for the permanent deformation of preforms, and this occurs mostly when fiber rearrangement and tow movements are limited. This explains why the permanent deformation of jute preforms was larger at higher compaction speeds. Glass fiber strength varies depending on the type of fiber, but it is above 2400 MPa for E-glass fibers (the weakest type).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311410484">26</xref></sup> On the other hand, reported data of jute fibers strength are within the range of 393–773 MPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311410484">23</xref></sup> Therefore, there is a higher tendency for fiber breakage in natural fiber reinforcements. Even when the compaction pressures measured in the tests were lower than 2 MPa, it is possible that at the ‘hills’ of the woven fabric preforms the pressure reached a much larger value.</p>
<p>The permanent deformation decreased substantially in preforms that had been impregnated with the test fluid before performing the test. In these tests, the same tendency observed in the dry tests was found for the fiber content, while the compaction speed had little effect on the amount of permanent deformation. Probably, the lubrication effect facilitated fiber rearrangement and tow movement, reducing the permanent deformation for all the compaction speeds used.</p>
<p>The same observations can be made regarding the amount of permanent deformation achieved after the second loading cycle. It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410484">Figure 7(c)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410484">d</xref>) that permanent deformation increased slightly after the second loading cycle.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410484">Figure 8</xref> shows the plots of Normalized Compaction Pressure vs. Time, obtained in different testing conditions for the initial loading cycle. In the tests performed on dry preforms, it was found that the compaction pressure reached a steady value within the period of time studied. Thus all the stress relaxation processes happened in less than 10 min. Furthermore, it was found that the compaction speed had an important effect on the stress relaxation behavior of the preforms as expected. Somashekar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410484">14</xref></sup> proposed that viscoelastic deformation and recovery were dependent on three factors over time: realignment of the fibers in the tows, reorientation of the tows themselves, and interaction between consecutive layers of fabric. Therefore, as the compaction speed decreased, all these mechanisms could take place while the compaction plate was still moving down compressing the perform; thus less stress relaxation occurred when the compaction plate is stopped. On the other hand, high compaction speeds do not let those mechanisms to happen at the compression stage, and they occur slowly with time after the compaction plate was stopped at the final thickness. In addition it can be clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410484">Figure 7</xref> that stress relaxation increased as the final fiber volume fraction was decreased, probably because the voids and gaps between fibers and yarns increased and the relaxation mechanisms mentioned above could happen easier and faster.

<p>The analysis of the stress relaxation of preforms which were compressed saturated with the test fluid is more complex. While the compaction plate descended and preforms thickness was decreased, the test fluid was forced to flow through the stack of fabric layers. Therefore an internal fluid pressure is developed during the compaction step, in addition to the increase in pressure related to the compaction of the preform. This internal pressure increased as the compaction plate moved down because the permeability of the preform decreased as the fiber content was increased. Moreover, higher compaction speeds led to higher fluid pressures, according to Darcy’s Law. Once the desired thickness was achieved, the compaction plate was stopped and nofurther fluid flow occurred at relaxation stage. Consequently the fluid pressure drops to zero at the beginning of the stress relaxation stage. This effect can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410484">Figure 8</xref>, where the results for the wet tests showed a larger initial pressure drop than the dry tests. Despite this pressure drop caused by the cease inthe fluid flow, impregnated preforms experimented higher stress relaxation than dry preforms. In addition it was found that the curves did not reach a steady value at the end of the relaxation step (10 min), which means that the load would still have dropped if the relaxation step had been longer. These results were not as expected, because the lubrication effect should have made realignment and reorientation of fibers and tows easier during the compression of the preform, and less relaxation was expected to take place. Therefore, natural fibers fluid absorption and softening were responsible, to some extent, for the drop in compaction pressure during the relaxation step. These experiments were conducted with a polar test fluid (water–glycerin solution), but the same behavior is expected for the compaction behavior of natural fibers impregnated with resins like polyesters, vinylesters, or phenolics due to their relative hydrophilic character.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311410484">Table 4</xref> summarizes the results of the final stress relaxation for all the test conditions. In addition to the previous analysis, it was found that in general, the stress relaxation decreased as the number of loading cycles increased, because some relaxation mechanisms took place in previous cycles in an irreversible manner; so there were less fibers and yarns to suffer relaxation, as the number of cycles increased.

<sec id="sec13-0021998311410484"><title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>When studying the compaction stage of a LCM process to manufacture composite materials based on jute woven fabric reinforcements, it should be taken into account that the compaction speed affects the maximum compaction pressures, permanent deformation, and stress relaxation. All these properties increased, as the compaction speed was increased. By raising the fiber volume fraction the relative amount of stress relaxation decreased, while the maximum compaction pressure and the permanent deformation increased.</p>
<p>The presence of the test fluid while performing the compaction tests produced a lubrication effect that decreased the maximum compaction pressure and the permanent deformation. This lubrication effect should decrease the stress relaxation of the preforms because realignment and reorientation of fiber and tows is easier during the compression of the preform. However, the opposite results were found in this work, suggesting that the fluid absorption and softening that take place in natural fibers could be responsible for the compaction pressure drop during the relaxation step.</p>
<p>One important conclusion of this work was that natural fibers structure affected the compaction behavior of the preforms. Each fiber is composed of several hollow elementary fibers which broke, collapsed, and experienced lumen closure due to the compressive loading. Therefore the permanent deformation of natural fiber preforms after subsequent loading cycles is expected to be higher than that for synthetic fiber preforms.</p>
