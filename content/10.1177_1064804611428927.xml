<p>A combination of scaling methods enables a multidisciplinary team to identify the optimal medical transport vehicle seat.</p>
<p><bold>The critically important product</bold> redesign phase requires a selection method that incorporates customer needs, functional requirements, and design specifications. Various scaling methods enable researchers to quantitatively manipulate variables and therefore serve as valuable tools in ergonomics research. These methods traditionally include scaling by paired comparisons, ranking, sorting, rating, and fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804611428927">Meister, 1985</xref>). Traditional methods are effective when used by experts in one field, but no single method satisfies the needs of a cross-functional, multidisciplinary selection team.</p>
<p>In this case study, we created a new method to compare alternative design concepts that involved a combination of traditional scaling methods. This example illustrates how individual expert ratings, prioritized specifications, and forced team rankings can be combined in the selection of a design with the best overall usability.</p>

<title>Problem Description</title>
<p>The development of a low-cost, lightweight transport vehicle provided an opportunity to treat rural patients in developing nations who otherwise cannot access critical health services. The research team recognized that areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Central America would benefit from a motorized transport that could go beyond the bicycle, moped-pulled trailers, and motorcycle sidecars currently used in some rural areas.</p>
<p>Following a 3-year development process that included marketing and cost analysis, engineering analysis, and medical professional analysis, the research team designed, prototyped, and tested the 150-cc AmbiCycle™ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804611428927">Figure 1</xref>, next page) in limited, controlled simulations with professional emergency services (EMS) personnel and mock patients. The EMS simulations with the prototype vehicle provided feedback that it would be necessary to modify the driver seat before the team’s recommendation for advanced prototype development and testing could be implemented. The original retracting seat designed for the AmbiCycle Generation 1 prototype was found to be unsatisfactory; it was difficult to use and protruded into the patient loading area. Patient loading, patient comfort, driver stability, and storage capacity were also compromised by the mechanism.</p>

<sec id="section2-1064804611428927">
<title>Design Concepts</title>
<p>A multidisciplinary design team of biomedical engineers, ergonomists, emergency physicians, and engineering technology student volunteers was charged with creating a next-generation driver’s seat for the AmbiCycle. Customer and user needs and requirements and goals designed by the research team were gathered in earlier development and used as the design foundation. Nine distinct concepts evolved from these development efforts.</p>
<sec id="section3-1064804611428927">
<title>Functional requirements</title>
<p>Customer (stakeholder) needs and requirements for the seat mechanism included requirements related to patient weight, width, and height for structural support and comfort. The team interviewed emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to gain input from the ultimate end user about models for both the Third World and developed nations. Considerations included the operating environment, EMT gear space, patient loading, patient type, and target cost. The research team also provided the design team with information related to operational environments, vehicle mission, strategic goals, and tactical goals. All these inputs were combined to develop functional requirements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1064804611428927">
<title>Concept development</title>
<p>The design team considered all possible solutions by generating many seat mechanism concepts. These concepts addressed all options regarding robust mounting points on the bike and all ranges of motion. The concepts were sketched and then mocked up on surrogate frames to enable the design team to clearly understand and consider each one. The nine designs were mocked up for simulations and first had to pass engineering tests for structural and safety issues through finite-element analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1064804611428927">Table 1</xref> (next page), illustrates the nine preliminary seat design concepts.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>A critical component of developing the concepts was hands-on experience with the AmbiCycle prototype (Generation 1) and the concept mock-ups. Although the use of 3-D drawings, animations with 3-D human models, and various other digital and paper models were helpful during concept development, the team found the hands-on aspect to be the most beneficial for gathering consensus and making breakthroughs. The design team was able to experience what the driver goes through to drive to an accident scene; load, transport, and unload a patient; and resupply the vehicle. They then played the role of the patient, experiencing the loading, transporting, and unloading phases. These simulations allowed the selection team to understand the factors that would be affected by all aspects of the design options. The process was repeated many times throughout the seat development process with all nine concept mock-ups.</p>

<title>Selecting a Design</title>
<p>Typically, a combination of team-selected specifications and functional design requirements drives the decision-making efforts during product development. The following case study depicts a scenario in which multiple designs met or exceeded many of the requirements but not necessarily the same ones or to the same extent. In this way, the specifications and requirements did not designate a clear frontrunner. A new method was necessary to compare alternative design concepts using multiple expert opinions from a multidisciplinary team. The design change outlined in this article was an ergonomics-based usability review and is intended to serve as an example of simultaneous, multidisciplinary design and ergonomics review for other applications. The methodology outlined in this article is not presented as a new scaling technique but, rather, is one example of how a research team can develop and use a design selection method unique to its project.</p>
<p>Selection methods are continuously being developed to address specific industry needs. Complex methods include <italic>quality function deployment for environment, analytic hierarchy process</italic>, and <italic>voice of customer</italic>. These methods incorporate best decision support methodology concepts that include quantitative and qualitative decision factors simultaneously. Similar to these methods, in the following case study, we integrated traditional methods into the decision-making process. (See “Traditional Design Selection Methods” sidebar on page 14.) We combined the strengths of these methods using a selection matrix that weighted prioritized specifications based on expert opinion to force-rank multiple design concepts by the team. Having the team agree on which specifications to use, as well as a value or weighting of those needs, was critical to the process of selecting a final seat design to build into a fully functional prototype.</p>
<list id="list1-1064804611428927" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>Expert ratings</bold>. The first step in the design selection process was to use anonymous expert ratings regarding the importance of 14 specifications. Individual experts from many disciplines rated each potential specification on a 1-to-3 scale (1 = <italic>low importance</italic>, 2 = <italic>moderate</italic>, 3 = <italic>high importance</italic>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Prioritization scheme.</bold> The individual expert ratings were averaged to produce a prioritization scheme that all team members could agree to use during the rating process. Prioritized specifications enabled them to filter any specifications that were ranked as unimportant to the group of experts to reduce any influence during the final selection. The scheme would also further narrow options by weighting specifications on the basis of average expert ratings in the event that rankings did not yield a statistically significant lead design choice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Forced ranking.</bold> The final design selection was made by group ranking of the designs against one another, in relation to the specifications. Rather than asking each expert to rank individual designs, all team members were asked to rank each design against predetermined specifications. For example, the design that the experts felt took the least amount of time for patient loading was ranked first in relation to the functional requirement, time to load patient.</p>
<p>The design with the lowest total score from all the group rankings was the one that best met the requirements and was chosen as the final design. The team facilitated conversation to reduce bias from supporters of one design to reach a decision point. A neutral research assistant served as the nonvoting facilitator to keep the group on task and to record the findings. (See “Specifications and Group Prioritization” sidebar on page 15.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Selection matrix and weighted ranking.</bold> We imported forced rankings into a matrix designed specifically for this project. The selection matrix was built with the design concept numbers across the top and a list of specifications by row (in order of importance ratings) on the left (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1064804611428927">Table 2</xref>). For each specification, the ranking of each design concept was entered. The team then placed the design concepts in a forced-ranking level (during the facilitated group discussions) from 1 to 9, with 1 being the design that best met the functional requirement and 9 being the design that least met the functional requirement.</p></list-item>

<title>Traditional Design Selection Methods</title>
<p><bold><italic>Expert opinion elicitation</italic></bold> has long been part of the traditional decision-making process, most notably associated with the RAND Corporation after World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804611428927">Armstrong, 1985</xref>). This method concerns “the speculations, guesses, and estimates of people who are considered experts in so far as these serve as ‘cognitive input’ in some decision process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804611428927">Cooke, 1991</xref>). The methodology behind expert opinion traditionally involves measure selection, expert identification, and a set of ranking criteria with identified levels. Scores of each measure for each ranking criterion are elicited through expert opinion and aggregated into a single score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804611428927">Li &amp; Smidts, 2003</xref>). This method has been used to address everything from the war on poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804611428927">Cooke, 1991</xref>) to software engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804611428927">Li &amp; Smidts, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Goal-oriented requirements engineering</italic></bold> has proved useful in eliciting, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements in engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1064804611428927">van Lamsweerde, 2001</xref>). Prioritized specifications are used in a number of ways depending on the specific industry. As an example, designers have developed a list of general maxims, often specific to each designer, that set the framework for success. Requirements, such as consistency or simplicity, drive the design process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804611428927">Lund, 1997</xref>). Researchers have determined that organizations shun formal documentation of specifications, preferring simpler techniques that serve as anchors for future discussion. Other developers discuss requirements in detail before and/or during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804611428927">Cao &amp; Ramesh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Forced ranking</italic></bold> can be defined as a traditional evaluation method of forced distribution. With forced ranking, experts are instructed to rank design possibilities, in order, with respect to each specification. The end goal of forced ranking is that a final group rating will summarize and reflect the set of individual rankings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804611428927">Meister, 1985</xref>). Such forced ranking provides a clear order of design preference, in comparison with fuzzy ranking, which evaluates imprecise input from designers and intangible criteria during concept evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804611428927">Jiao &amp; Tseng, 1998</xref>). Given more tangible criteria, it is hoped that forced ranking can eliminate bias attributed to “undecided” or “no opinion” responses. This methodology is most commonly used as a performance management measure but is applicable in product design as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804611428927">Grote, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>After each specification was ranked, we tallied the total ranking for each design. <italic>T</italic> tests indicated no significant statistical differences between preliminary rankings. As a result, the matrix was retabulated with weighted specifications based on how important the experts had rated each one. Weighting was done by multiplying rankings by the order of importance from 1 to 14 for the 14 specifications. The lowest total rank yielded the best fit.</p>
<p>Design #2, the removable seat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804611428927">Figure 2</xref>), had the lowest ranking, with a mean ranking of 2.9. This preliminary ranking was not significantly different from the two next-closest design concepts (1 and 3; <italic>t</italic> test of mean difference, <italic>p</italic> = .165 and <italic>p</italic> = .286, respectively). Following the weighted ranking process, the removable seat (Design 2) ranked highest and was statistically different (<italic>p</italic> = .03) from the next-closest-ranked design when the importance ratings were considered. Therefore, Seat Design #2 was determined to best meet the project criteria.</p>

<title>Selected Seat Design</title>
<p>Seat Design #2 has a seating structure that can be completely removed from the vehicle to facilitate patient loading. It consists of a cage structure that supports the weight of the driver while also providing a protective enclosure for the patient. This structure was the strongest and most durable for the driver and the most protective of the patient. The cage structure attaches and detaches from the frame of the vehicle by use of a pair of quick-release mechanisms (QRMs) identical to those used in automotive racing for quick steering wheel removal. The QRM bases and connectors attach to the vehicle frame through QRM support flanges.</p>
<p>To improve the functionality of the removable seat mechanism, we designed a release that allows for both QRMs to be operated at the same time. The release is operated by the driver’s by the driver’s foot, which keeps his/her hands free to remove the cage after the QRMs have been released.</p>
<p>Following selection of the removable seat option, rapid prototypes were made at one-sixth scale with several improvements the design team had suggested after working with the mock-ups. We then performed a failure modes and effects analysis for multiple material types and configurations. Calculations that took into account dynamic loading were performed on each revision, in addition to the calculations involving static loading. The final version includes a more enclosed space for the patient, with clear polycarbonate panels, air filtration, and improved crash protection. Functional prototypes based on this latest design were commissioned for testing. For that design, the team created a mounting system that consists of a ledge on the front of the vehicle, which allows the seat to be supported during loading and unloading.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a large development project with ergonomic origins, it was exciting to see a multidisciplinary team come together for a usability review to produce measurable improvements in a health care–related product that will now better serve its users and the patients it transports. This result was accomplished by using traditional methods in a unique matrix of weighted prioritized specifications based on expert opinion and team consensus. The team ranked the prototypes against the expert-ranked concept specifications. Only the total weighted rankings yielded a significant difference among prototypes, enabling the selection of a single concept for further development.</p>
<p>Ergonomists are often asked to function in large product development efforts as members of a cross-functional, multidisciplinary team. The use of multiple experts makes it possible for authorities in each domain, including designers and end users, to provide input. In the realm of health care and medical device development, measuring and fulfilling user requirements will result in successful products that improve patient safety and device effectiveness and reduce product recalls and modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804611428927">Martin, Murphy, Crowe, &amp; Norris, 2006</xref>).</p>
