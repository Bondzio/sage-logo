<sec><title>Objective</title>
<p>The objective of this report is to assess the presence and viral load of JC polyomavirus (JCV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) patients in comparison to controls and to investigate if different types of immunosuppressive treatments were correlated to detection and viral load of JCV DNA in SLE.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Background</title>
<p>Reactivation of a latent JCV infection with subsequent development of the fatal disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has become an increasing problem in patients with autoimmune diseases treated with newer immunosuppressants. Accumulating data point out that SLE patients are at particular risk for PML compared to patients with other rheumatic diseases.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Methods</title>
<p>CSF samples (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and plasma samples (<italic>n</italic> = 51) from 71 SLE patients and 58 controls (53 CSF samples and 50 plasma samples) with other non-inflammatory neurological disease (OND) were analyzed for JCV DNA with a quantitative PCR method.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results</title>
<p>All CSF and plasma samples from NPSLE patients and controls were negative for JCV DNA.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>JCV DNA was absent in CSF and plasma in NPSLE patients and controls and consequently we were not able to identify any correlation between the occurrence of JCV DNA and type of immunosuppressive medication.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312470977" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare, serious demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). Primary infection with JCV is usually asymptomatic, occurs in childhood and is followed by lifelong viral persistence. The kidneys, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissue have been demonstrated as common reservoirs for JCV latency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312470977">1</xref></sup> Some studies have also shown that the healthy brain can harbor JCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312470977">2</xref></sup> PML occurs as a consequence of reactivation of JCV whereby the virus escapes latency, enters the CNS and causes a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes leading to demyelination. Reactivation of JCV is most commonly associated with conditions of immunosuppression but there are reports of PML developing in immunocompetent individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312470977">3</xref></sup> The majority of PML cases have been described in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, followed by immunosuppressed people, including patients with malignancies, transplant recipients and to a lesser extent autoimmune patients treated with immunomodulatory medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312470977">1</xref></sup> The incidence of PML in autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic diseases, has recently increased as a consequence of an increased use of new, more potent immunosuppressive drugs such as biologics (rituximab, natalizumab, infliximab and efalizumab) and other potent immunomodulatory medication like mycophenolate mofetil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312470977">4</xref></sup> Recent data emphasize that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) confer a higher risk for PML and the risk is increased even in SLE patients with a minimum of immunomodulatory treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470977">5</xref>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312470977">7</xref></sup> The underlying mechanisms for this observation are unresolved and poorly investigated. The clinical and radiological presentation of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is extremely heterogeneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312470977">8</xref></sup> and can thus be difficult to distinguish from classical signs and symptoms of PML. Due to the similarities between PML and NPSLE, the PML diagnosis is likely to be delayed in NPSLE patients, and PML might be underdiagnosed in this patient group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312470977">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312470977">9</xref></sup> There is a lack of clinical and laboratory predictors for PML and there is a great need for identification of factors triggering PML development.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyze whether JCV DNA can be detected in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a large group of patients with NPSLE treated with different types and amounts of immunomodulatory medication. JCV DNA was analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in CSF (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and plasma (<italic>n</italic> = 51) from 71 NPSLE patients and 58 controls with other non-inflammatory neurological disease (OND), CSF (<italic>n</italic> = 53), plasma (<italic>n</italic> = 50).</p>

<p>SLE patients suffering previous clinical neurological symptoms when included in a cross-sectional cohort study at the Department of Rheumatology, Karolinska University Hospital, were asked to participate. All patients fulfilled at least four of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312470977">8</xref></sup> Seventy-one consenting patients were included chronologically, five of 71 males, median age 49 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21–77 years), all of Caucasian origin. The patients underwent a structured clinical investigation by a rheumatologist and neurologist and information was collected by a structured interview. The presence of ongoing/prior neuropsychiatric manifestations was classified according to the ACR nomenclature of NPSLE syndromes by 19 distinct case definitions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312470977">8</xref></sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312470977">Figure 1</xref>. Ongoing and prior immunomodulatory treatment was documented. The controls included 58 patients with other non-inflammatory neurological disease (OND) (16/58 males, median age 39 years, IQR 31–43 years) from whom samples were obtained from our in-house biobank at the Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital. All control patients were treatment naïve; their diagnoses are listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312470977">Appendix</xref>. The study was approved by the regional ethical committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

<p>Seventy-one NPSLE patients and 58 OND controls were included in the study; demographic data of the patients are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312470977">Table 1</xref>. Sixty-three of the NPSLE patients had ongoing treatment with immunomodulatory medication at the time of sampling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312470977">Table 2</xref>). Five NPSLE patients were treatment naïve and eight of the patients had no immunomodulatory treatment at the time of sampling but had been treated with such medication prior to sampling. We analyzed CSF (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and plasma (<italic>n</italic> = 51) from 71 NPSLE patients and CSF (<italic>n</italic> = 53) and plasma (<italic>n</italic> = 50) from 58 controls. Paired CSF and plasma samples were obtained from 49 of the NPSLE patients and 44 of the control patients. All CSF and plasma samples from NPSLE patients as well as control patients were negative for JCV DNA. All NPSLE patients have been followed clinically, after sampling, for a mean of 5.4 years (range three to eight years) and none of them have developed clinical signs of PML. Six SLE patients died during the follow-up time; causes of death were cerebral vasculitis and pneumonia, CNS demyelination and pneumonia, cortical dementia, depression and cognitive impairment, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease.

<p>In this study, we did not detect JCV DNA in CSF or plasma in a large group of patients with NPSLE, of whom the majority had been exposed to varying degrees of immunosuppressive treatment. Five patients had been treated with the biologic drug rituxiumab and six patients had been treated with mycophenolate mofetil, which both have been associated with an increased risk of PML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312470977">12</xref></sup> Absence of JCV DNA in CSF and plasma was also observed in our control group consisting of patients with OND.</p>
<p>We have previously analyzed JCV DNA in CSF and plasma in multiple sclerosis (MS) and control patients, including a few SLE patients. In this study JCV DNA was detected in plasma, but not CSF, in two of the SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312470977">10</xref></sup> These patients have been followed clinically for more than five years without any signs of PML development. The observation of JCV DNA in the SLE patients encouraged us to perform the present study, and we hypothesized that different types and duration of immunosuppressive medication could be associated with reactivation of JCV and detection of JCV in the systemic circulation or in CSF. Such association was, however, not found since all of the samples were negative for JCV DNA.</p>
<p>There are several reports of PML occurring in SLE, both in association with newer biologic immunosuppressants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312470977">12</xref></sup> but also in patients treated with conventional disease-modifying agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312470977">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312470977">9</xref></sup> The incidence and prevalence of PML in SLE is not known but substantial data indicate an increased risk for PML compared to other rheumatic diseases; Calabrese and Molloy have reviewed the literature on case reports of PML occurring in patients with rheumatic diseases and identified 50 PML cases, of which 64% were patients diagnosed with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312470977">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312470977">13</xref></sup> The same authors performed a study on the national estimate on the frequency of PML in SLE and other rheumatic diseases based on United States (US) hospital discharges that demonstrated a comparatively high frequency of four PML cases per 100,000 discharges of SLE while the corresponding number was 0.4 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and two in patients with other connective-tissue diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312470977">5</xref></sup> In addition Calabrese and Molloy recently published data on PML reported in association with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312470977">14</xref></sup> In this study 34 cases of PML were confirmed, of which 17 occurred in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312470977">14</xref></sup> In another study from the US, based on data obtained from a large health insurer, an incidence rate of PML in SLE patients of 2.4 per 100,000 person-years was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312470977">15</xref></sup> From Sweden, a retrospective study on the incidence of PML in SLE, during a period of 25 years, demonstrated a minimum risk for PML as three of 200, which corresponds to one PML case per 800 patient-years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312470977">7</xref></sup> Brandão et al. followed SLE patients in their immunology outpatient clinic and reported on two cases of PML out of 608 SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312470977">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of JCV reactivation and development of PML are largely unknown. JCV exists in two genetic forms differing in their noncoding control region (NCCR). The <italic>archetypal</italic> form is the genetic variant of the virus associated with latency. During reactivation, the virus undergoes genetic rearrangements in the NCCR and transforms into the <italic>neurotrophic</italic> PML strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312470977">16</xref></sup> The site and mechanism of JCV transformation are not clarified. The generally accepted hypothesis is that PML is caused by reactivation of JCV at times of immunosuppression whereby the virus migrates to the brain and causes a lytic destruction of the glial cells and hence PML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312470977">16</xref></sup> However, since some studies also have demonstrated JCV latency within the CNS, it has been suggested that PML may occur as a consequence of reactivation of a latent JCV infection in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312470977">2</xref></sup> Interestingly, Bayliss et al. demonstrated that latent JCV DNA in the brain is more common in immunosuppressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS patients compared to immunocompetent patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312470977">17</xref></sup> When reviewing the literature we observed only one previous study investigating the presence of JCV DNA in peripheral blood samples from SLE patients, which in accordance with the present study, reported negative detection of JCV DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312470977">18</xref></sup> By contrast, there are several researchers who have studied a possible correlation between induction of JCV DNA in the blood and treatment with the biological drug natalizumab in patients with MS. Sadiq et al. observed the appearance of JCV DNA in one of 93 plasma samples and in two of 93 CSF samples after starting treatment with natalizumab, although none of these patients developed PML.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312470977">19</xref></sup> Rudick et al. analyzed a large number of blood samples from natalizumab-treated MS patients, including five patients who developed PML, and they observed that JCV DNA was present in a very low number of patients of whom none developed PML. In addition, in the five PML cases, JCV DNA was detected in the blood only after the onset of PML-related symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312470977">20</xref></sup> In conclusion, these studies indicate that analysis of JCV DNA in blood as a tool for risk stratification of PML is unlikely to identify patients with higher risk.</p>
<p>The mechanisms causing SLE patients to be predisposed to PML are poorly explained but the absence of a clear association with immunosuppressive treatments indicates that a disease-related immunological dysfunction might play an important role. The increased risk may also be related to host factors possibly found only in certain subgroups of SLE. It is known that conditions associated with cellular immunity dysfunctions increase the risk for JCV reactivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312470977">1</xref></sup> It has been suggested that in particular T CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphopenia may be important in the pathogenesis of PML in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312470977">21</xref></sup> Brandão et al. described two SLE patients who developed PML who had both been treated only with conventional immunosuppressants but had a profound T CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphopenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312470977">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The importance of the present study is the demonstration that occurrence of JCV DNA is not common in blood and CSF among patients with NPSLE with different immunomodulatory treatments. Since the use of newer, more potent immunosuppressive treatments in SLE and other autoimmune diseases is associated with an increased risk of PML, it complicates decision making regarding its usage in patients with less malignant disease stages. It is of great importance to characterize the mechanisms in immunosuppressive conditions leading to reactivation of JCV and to identify risk predictors for PML, which can be implicated when planning individual treatment. PML seems to develop almost always as a recrudescence of a latent infection, and analysis of JCV IgG antibodies in serum is useful in order to find out whether the patient at all has been infected with JCV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312470977">4</xref></sup> Uninfected patients should repeatedly be tested for JCV seroconversion during immunosuppressive treatment. Clinicians ought to have a high level of suspicion for PML in SLE. Diagnostic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and JCV DNA PCR analysis in CSF, should be considered, without delay, in SLE patients presenting with unexplained progressive neurological signs or symptoms.</p>
