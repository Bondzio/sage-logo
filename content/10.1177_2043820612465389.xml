Davies, a colleague for whom I have great intellectual admiration and with whom I maintain a good personal relationship. My admiration for his work does not mean that I necessarily share all his theoretical positions. Quite the contrary, there are several outstanding issues on which we disagree. But what is not in doubt, however, is the robustness of his arguments. J. S. Davies is a reference when discussing the meaning and implications of network governance, and his contribution to theoretical advances in this area of debate seems to be beyond doubt to me.</p><p>I belong to a research group, the Institute of Government and Public Policy, of the Autonomous University of Barcelona that has been working for some time with the concept of network governance, with special emphasis on the local level. Our work in this field may not have had a great echo in English-speaking academic circles, something that we must certainly improve, but instead it has had a remarkable following in Latin American and Spanish Political Science. Our conception of network governance has evolved over recent years and, far from being perfectly coherent, it has been subjected to various ambiguities and contradictions that I do not blush to acknowledge.</p><p>We started in late 90s defending a highly optimistic position about the transformation ‘from local government to local governance’. We believed that we detected much empirical evidence in the Spanish municipalities showing that, also here, the model of networked local governance was clearly on the rise: Spanish town councillors were changing their perception of the meaning of local government, evolving from a classic conception that put the emphasis on the bureaucratic provision of local services towards a new conception, strategic, pluralistic and relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612465389">Brugue and Valles, 2005</xref>); the option for a new style of local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612465389">Brugue and Goma, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612465389">Subirats, 2002</xref>) became evident in different areas of public policy and was embodied in the proliferation of strategic and participatory planning practices such as the Local Strategic Plans, Local Agendas 21, Community Development Plans or City Educational Projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612465389">Blanco and Gomà, 2002</xref>); significantly, networked local governance was leading to an increasingly frequent use of different types of citizen participation mechanism, such as participatory budgeting, advisory councils or citizens’ juries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612465389">Font, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we understood that the emerging model not only represented an opportunity to deal effectively with the increasingly complex problems but also to deepen the meaning and practice of local democracy.</p><p>Looking back, the weaknesses of this form of reasoning are now evident. We did not define with sufficient precision as to how network governance practices were innovative, especially considering that the dynamics of public–private cooperation have always existed in Spanish municipalities, even in the times of Franco. We tended to exaggerate the empirical relevance of such type of practice, forgetting that the local government in Spain remains firmly rooted in the principles of representative democracy and bureaucratic administration. We overestimated the implications of such practices for configuration and dynamics of local power relations, which have never ceased to be highly asymmetric. We tended to ignore that only certain network governance practices serve to deepen an elitist model of production of local policies, with clear negative effects on the quality of local democracy. We overvalued the importance of change in socioeconomic structures as a factor explaining the transformation of local politics and did not concede enough value to the discourses and ideas as an engine for that transformation. In fact, we ourselves through our ideas and discourses contributed to the expansion of the phenomenon of networked local governance in Spain, although we often confused the description of the phenomenon with its prescription.</p><p>J. S. Davies’ book presents a forceful critique of this kind of theoretical perspective that has taken the shift from government to governance for granted and welcomed the virtues of networks with enthusiasm. His theoretical arguments are strong and the historical times that we are living show that we have to agree on some key issues. In Spain, we do not have any empirical research that systematically analyses how various forms of local governance are being reshaped in the context of the crisis, but we can guess, by the dominant discourses, that the notion of network governance, especially in its participatory dimension, has lost steam. These are bad times for public debate, because the institutions are trying to convince us that ‘there is no alternative’ to the current policy of massive cuts in public services. Today, the exercises in deliberative democracy tend to be regarded as an unaffordable waste of time given the urgency of the decisions that must be taken. The logic of collaboration tends to get confused, now more than ever, with the decline of the public sector in favour of a greater role for private capital. The process of social disempowerment versus the markets is dramatic. From the point of view of those who promoted the ideology of the networks, it is disappointing to note how easily the public institutions have abandoned the discourse of the new politics. As J. S. Davies would tell us, the movement towards networked local governance has never been as strong as we assumed, and hierarchy, hegemony and domination always had great strength; however, much discourses pointed to other directions.</p><p>But I refuse to fall definitely in intellectual pessimism. In fact, I understand that the latest book of J. S. Davies goes beyond criticism of network governance to draw possible future paths, paths in which, paradoxically, networks continue to play a fundamental role. There are two principal antidotes to counteract pessimism about the possibility of developing a new networked politics. The first antidote entails convincing ourselves of the political superiority of networks as a form of collective governance. The classic distinction between hierarchies, markets and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612465389">Thompson, 2003</xref>) is fully in force, although it is insufficient because it only considers the question of ‘how’ and, conversely, tends to ignore the question of ‘what’. The emphasis in the literature on such generic goals as ‘intelligence’ or ‘democratic quality’ in public policy has fuelled a depoliticized vision of networks. If we want to resize its normative value, we must accept the invitation of J. S. Davies to consider the extent to which networks can be an effective strategy to subvert pre-existing relations of political power and generate significant social transformations. Not all governance networks have this capability, and indeed, it is clear that not even all of them claim to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612465389">Blanco, forthcoming</xref>), but we must persist in the idea that only through pluralistic and relational schemes can we generate this kind of political and social transformation. If this was already clear in the past, it is even more in the current context of economic crisis: the state alone cannot, and it is not even guaranteed that it can, continue taking a leading role in social intermediation processes. In networks, with greater or lesser presence of state actors, we will find the answers.</p><p>The second antidote consists, precisely, of emphasizing a wide variety of networked forms of governance in the face of a theoretical and normative conception that, by contrast, has tended to treat governance networks ‘as undifferentiated forms, as if they all could be characterized in the same general way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612465389">Provan and Kenis, 2008</xref>, p.233). J. S. Davies himself gives us a valuable heuristic tool for analyzing the diversity in various forms of network governance from a Gramscian perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612465389">Davies, 2011</xref>, pp. 131–137). The six ideal models identified in his book (flawed hegemony, governance by exclusion, interregnum, counter-hegemony, comprehensive hegemony and post-hegemony) may represent a useful starting point for analyzing the crucial issue of diversity in various forms of governance. Empirical research in this field has enormous challenges ahead: understanding what conditions help or hinder the development of some or the other forms of governance; assessing the chances of developing some or the other models and what are their main characteristics; analyzing in-depth the relationship between the<italic> what</italic>, the<italic> who </italic>and the <italic>how</italic> of this type of cooperative arrangements; and, above all, to explore the extent to which different models of governance significantly perpetuate or transform power relations and social policies.</p><p>Far from upsetting the theories of network governance, <italic>Challenging Governance Theory </italic>encourages us to face new and exciting intellectual challenges in the study of this phenomenon. This is not just another book in the endless list of works that explain the transformation to networked governance, but rather represents a turning point in the course that this debate has followed so far.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612465389"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>forthcoming</year>) <article-title>Analysing urban governance networks: bringing regime theory back in</article-title>. <source>Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy</source>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612465389"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blanco</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomà</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group> (eds) (<year>2002</year>) <source>Gobiernos Locales y Redes Participativas</source>. <publisher-loc>Barcelona, Spain</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Ariel</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612465389"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brugue</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Goma</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1998</year>) <source>Gobiernos Locales y Políticas Públicas</source>. <publisher-loc>Barcelona, Spain</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Ariel</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-2043820612465389"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brugue</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Valles</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>New-style councils, new-style councilors: from local government to local governance</article-title>. <source>Governance</source> <volume>18</volume>(<issue>2</issue>): <fpage>197</fpage>–<lpage>226</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr5-2043820612465389"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2011</year>) <source>Challenging Governance Theory.
