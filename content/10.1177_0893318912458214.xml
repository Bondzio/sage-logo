<abstract>
<p>Recurrent interpersonal conflict in organizational settings is common and impedes goal-attainment. Structurational divergence (SD) theory conceptualizes a distinctive negative communication spiral rooted in unresolved conflict resulting from incompatible rules of intersecting meaning structures. This article expands SD theory by examining the function of human agency, positing that the rendering of communication patterns as incomprehensible and untransformable diminishes agency. After explaining and expanding SD theory, an exploratory study examines the relationship of SD to conflict-related organizational- and communication-related constructs. Destructive communication (verbal aggression, ambiguity intolerance, controlling conflict management style, and taking conflict personally) is related to SD whereas constructive communication (solution oriented conflict management style, argumentativeness) is not. Implications are discussed for understanding conflict in nursing and other organizational settings as well as for intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recurrent conflict is common, distressing, and complex. It impedes the ability to accomplish organizational and personal goals. Conflict cycles and intractable negative or oppressive communication spirals have been explicated in various ways in communication theory and research, such as coordinated management of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0893318912458214">Pearce &amp; Cronen, 1980</xref>), moral conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0893318912458214">Pearce &amp; Littlejohn, 1997</xref>), paradoxes of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0893318912458214">Stohl &amp; Cheney, 2001</xref>), problematic integration theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912458214">Babrow, 2001</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912458214">Barker’s (1993)</xref> classic illustration of concertive control during organizational restructuring. Recurrent conflict is a multilayered phenomenon requiring complex explanation. Inspired by the work cited above, and extending structuration theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912458214">1984</xref>), <italic>structurational divergence (SD) theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912458214">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">Nicotera, Mahon, &amp; Zhao, 2010</xref>) explicates this phenomenon, positing that impasses stem from multiple meaning systems that simultaneously compel irreconcilably contrary obligations, creating a communication spiral: Unresolved conflict, immobilization, and erosion of development, which perpetuates the conflict.</p>
<p>For example, our recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2010</xref>) describes a recurrent conflict cycle experienced by hospital nurses in a geriatric care (GC) unit with the emergency department (ED). ED staff complained GC staff was uncooperative with inpatient admissions. GC staff complained that ED patients who should be admitted to intensive care (ICU) were transported to GC to await admission. When these patients became unstable, requiring immediate care, GC staff provided it, acting from a patient-centered ethic. These patients were subsequently admitted to ICU. Records reflected admission to ICU from ED with no way to document care given by GC. When performance reviews, cost calculations, and other such management reviews were conducted, GC care for those patients was credited to ED, but its negative impact (e.g., cost, time, and delayed care for other patients) resulted in poor performance sanctions for GC. This deepened GC resentment for ED and perpetuated the conflict. GC nurses became hesitant to provide care because of bureaucratic consequences—a severely immobilizing ethical dilemma.</p>
<p>Although in a medical setting, this example illustrates organizational and institutional, not clinical, problems. Applying SD theory, the structure <italic>patient-centered ethic</italic> is incompatible with the <italic>bureaucratic departmental</italic> structure. To act, individuals choose which structure to violate—suffering its normative sanctions and escalating conflict. ED admissions problems (unresolved conflict) resulted in inability to perform (immobilization), which resulted in poor and unfair performance reviews (erosion of development), perpetuating conflict. Seen in this way, <italic>the problem causes the problem</italic>, and <italic>no rule/resource exists to prioritize</italic> one structure over another. These two features represent the core of the phenomenon identified as SD.</p>
<p>Based on structuration theory, SD theory defines SD as an institutional positioning at a nexus of incompatible meaning structures that creates recurrent conflict cycles. Agency is central to structuration theory, but no previous work has considered agency in SD. The explication of agency loss in SD is the central conceptual contribution of this article, which then documents the relationship of SD to organizational and communication constructs common in conflict research, establishing a conceptual distinction between SD theory and conventional explanations of interpersonal conflict.</p>

<title>Structurational Divergence and the Loss of Agency</title>
<p>Structuration theory posits that people act and interact coherently based on meaning provided by institutionalized structures. <italic>Structure</italic> consists of “rules and resources, recursively implicated in the reproduction of social systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. 377). Rules are schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>). Resources are authoritative and allocative (command over persons and objects); human (e.g., intelligence, strength, knowledge.) and nonhuman (e.g., tools, documents); material and nonmaterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1979</xref>). Their nature is less important than the ontology of <italic>agency</italic>: Access to resources <italic>empowers</italic> people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>). “To be an agent means to be capable of exerting some degree of control over the social relations in which one is enmeshed, which in turn implies the ability to transform those social relations” (p. 20). <italic>Doing</italic> anything rests on agency provided by rules/resources, but SD blocks that access. For example, mobilizing GC resources to care for ED patients in the GC hallway is possible by agency provided in the patient-centered ethic. However, this act diminishes agency in the bureaucratic structure that negatively sanctions it. This institutional incompatibility manifests in recurrent conflict between ED and GC.</p>
<p>Knowledge of rules enables agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>), which explains the <italic>duality of structure</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912458214">1984</xref>): Structures shape social practices that constitute structures. Production/reproduction of structures in social practice is the heart of structuration, <italic>agency</italic> the driving force. <italic>Knowing</italic> structure enables <italic>doing</italic> structure, but in SD such knowledge is hidden or contradictory. <italic>Structure</italic> refers to “properties allowing the ‘binding’ of time-space in social systems, the properties which make it possible for discernibly similar social practices to exist across varying spans of time and space and which lend them ‘systemic’ form” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. 17). Rules, intertwined with resources, are “the modes whereby transformative relations are actually incorporated into the production and reproduction of social practices” (p. 18).Rules both constitute meaning and sanction modes of social conduct. Rules tell us what things mean and how to act; action produces, reproduces, and transforms structures in a continuous cycle. Agency arises from knowledge of structure; structures arise from agency (ability to act and to apply knowledge to new contexts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>). So, when rules from multiple structures are irreconcilably incompatible, agency suffers. SD theory can explicate this phenomenon.</p>
<sec id="section3-0893318912458214">
<title>SD Theory Fundamentals</title>
<p>SD has two components: The <italic>SD-nexus</italic> and the <italic>SD-cycle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">Nicotera et al., 2010</xref>). A <italic>nexus</italic> is a social/institutional position where multiple structures compel simultaneous obligations. In an <italic>SD-nexus</italic>, those interpenetrating structures are incompatible, with simultaneous, equally compelling, contradictory obligations. We cannot make coherent sense of interaction—cannot adequately <italic>know</italic> what things mean and so cannot adequately choose what to <italic>do</italic>. Following a game metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0893318912458214">Taylor &amp; VanEvery, 2011</xref>), we are given baseball equipment and football plays and put on a soccer field with others who have differing equipment and plays. Rules, resources, and landscape are multiply incompatible—and often invisible.</p>
<p>The <italic>SD-cycle</italic> is the resulting downward spiral of communication described previously, which self-perpetuates. SD occurs when an SD-nexus creates an SD-cycle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0893318912458214">Figure 1</xref> summarizes SD theory. The hallmark is <italic>immobilization</italic>—not inactivity, but lack of progress—feeling stuck or facing recurrent problems with no foreseeable end. Heretofore, there has been no conceptual device to explain why some SD-nexi escalate into SD-cycles and some do not. <italic>Agency</italic> is posited here as that device. Agency is efficacy—ability to act meaningfully. Our participants’ metaphors of paralysis, bondage, and slavery and emotional descriptions of immobilization (frustration, futility, hopelessness) illustrate inefficacy in SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">2010</xref>).</p>

<p>SD sufferers cannot make sense of interaction, coherently use resources, or apply rules because simultaneous oppositional structures are equally forceful. Re/production of one violates another, making the whole incoherent. Without knowing, there is no doing, no way to re/produce structure, no efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>). In a structurationally divergent interaction system, action cannot coherently re/produce or transform structure because the actor does not control resources. Without coherent meaning, action is impotent and agency lacks force. Our conceptual contribution herein is to explicate immobilization as agency loss.</p>
<p>Agency is never zero; doing nothing is a choice. However, individual efficacy at the SD-nexus is so compromised that agency is nonfunctional. Without control over structures, we cannot transform them. An SD system is self-perpetuating; its contradictions re/produce contradictory actions. We always have action choices, but in SD none satisfy all structurational constraints in place. This positioning is mystifying because the opposition is invisible or stultifying because the opposition is unsolvable. If to avoid a kick from the mule, I must choose being run over by the cart, I may just not move. I have agency to decide <italic>not</italic> to act but no efficacy to impact either structure transformatively. Acting on one structure subverts another, negating agency for the whole. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell (1992)</xref>, human capacity for agency is inherent, and agency is enabled by knowledgeability of structure. But neither he nor Giddens address what happens to agency under contradictory structures, a consideration SD theory can provide.</p>
<p>In summary, SD theory posits that interpenetration of equally compelling oppositional structures creates unknowable structure (SD-nexus), <italic>negating agency</italic> and giving rise to the self-perpetuating SD-cycle (unresolved conflict, immobilization, and inability to develop). SD is a holistic construct capturing both the nexus of incompatible meanings/rules and the downward communicative spirals it creates. In SD, we cannot assign meaning in a comprehensible socially sanctioned way, so interaction cannot re/produce comprehensible structures. Emergent structures are unproductive or oppressive, as seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912458214">Barker’s (1993)</xref> transitioning management structures.</p>

<title>Modalities of Meaning</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912458214">Giddens (1984)</xref> identifies structural modalities as <italic>signification, legitimation</italic>, and <italic>domination</italic>, rules that allow us to assign every act/utterance a signification, judge its appropriateness, and ascertain our places in a domination hierarchy. These modalities allow illustration of agency loss. Agency is not power over others, but empowerment to act meaningfully. Power is transformative capacity to change the social and material world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318912458214">Giddens, 1987</xref>). Giddens’ <italic>structure</italic> is socially shared or common meaning in these modalities, that provides the agency to re/produce and transform structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">Nicotera et al. (2010)</xref> illustrate</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The physician writes a medication order. The nurse looks at the prescription and questions,‘‘50 mg?’’ setting off a too-familiar conflicted interaction. Imagine that the nurse’s meaning system centers on safety checks and the physician’s on an authority/compliance nurse-physician relationship. For the nurse, that simple act (‘‘50 mg?’’) signifies a safety check, is <italic>legitimate</italic> because nurses must be constantly vigilant for medication errors, and presumes an egalitarian relationship in which all caregivers are equally responsible for safety (<italic>nondominant</italic>). For the physician, the act signifies disrespect for authority, is <italic>not legitimate</italic> because a nurse must simply comply with physician orders, and presumes a <italic>dominant/submissive</italic> relationship. (p. 365)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The “verify order” rule is from a safety-check structure, but because this particular physician does not ascribe to that structure, its intersection with an equally forceful authority structure forbidding such questions is an SD-nexus. Actions do not re/produce coherent structure, leaving both frustrated, blaming, and (with repetition) immobilized and unable to develop (SD-cycle). Conflict is unresolvable if parties mobilize resources to enact rules of incompatible structures.</p>
<p>Agency loss would not happen if the nurse acted solely from knowledge of the authority structure; the question would purposely signify disrespect for physician authority, illegitimate because it subverts the dominance relationship. <italic>This</italic> act is bursting with the agency of resistance. Resistance re/produces domination; resistance cannot exist in the absence of something to resist. The nurse is nondominant, as dictated by the structure, but she/he <italic>has agency.</italic> Knowledge of the structure enables action upon it, empowers meaningful action. This conflict would not be unresolvable. The nurse would still not have power <italic>over</italic> the physician but would be <italic>empowered by knowledge</italic> of the structure to act meaningfully upon it, resulting in its comprehensible reproduction and potentially its transformation to produce a new comprehensible structure.</p>

<sec id="section5-0893318912458214">
<title>Structurational Divergence as an Organizational Problem</title>
<p>The SD-nexus subverts agency. Because incompatible meaning structures are not apparent, the underlying source of conflict is unclear, making efforts to resolve it ineffective. Actions cannot reproduce a comprehensible structure, so resulting communication difficulties become entrenched. SD-nexi result when institutional positioning crosses institutional and cultural boundaries. SD theory has been pursued in the nursing context, but it is an institutional phenomenon. Like structuration, SD theory is applicable to all human social systems.</p>
<sec id="section6-0893318912458214">
<title>Background of SD Theory</title>
<p>The initial studies from which SD theory was developed included human service, public sector, and educational settings. SD theory began as an explanation of African American organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0893318912458214">Warfield-Coppock (1995)</xref> identified dysfunctional communication, termed <italic>enculturation</italic>, as a unique problem of African American organizations, explaining the phenomenon as rooted in incompatible intersection of African American culture and Euro-centric organizational form. <italic>Enculturated organization</italic> is a narrow theory of African American organizations. In explicating identical patterns in our own data from African American organizations, we applied a structurational explanation making clear the intersection of incompatible structures as the root of the phenomenon—not the situated cultural particularities of the structures themselves. To further broaden and clarify the explanation, we illustrated the phenomenon as a deep structurational process in an interpretation of the literature on organizational restructuring, mostly in the private manufacturing sector. The communication difficulties encountered in restructuring mirror those of the enculturated organization and are subject to the same structurational explanation. This explication of patterns across cultures, professions, and organizational settings demonstrates that while specific issues that arise from SD may be unique to the organizational setting, the root of the problem is structurational and applicable to any social system in which multiple structures interpenetrate—in other words, organizational life. Warfield-Coppock theorized too narrowly, failing to theorize explanatory roots and focusing on situated manifestations. Enculturated organization theory is applicable only to African American organizations, but SD theory explains the factors that constitute enculturation. When these factors exist in other settings, other specific issues arise, but patterns of the deeper SD phenomenon are the same.</p>
<p>Organizational access for the seminal SD case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2010</xref>) was initiated by a nurse manager who recognized her unit in the (2003) book. SD was then applied to nurses, recognizing their institutional positioning is at a complex nexus of multiple incompatible structures. Nursing is a fertile setting in which to observe SD easily. Nurses are organizationally interesting, living in a viper’s nest of potential SD. Given opportunity, SD theory could have easily been expanded with other healthcare workers, human service managers/administrators, schoolteachers, government workers, or social workers (all represented in the original data).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0893318912458214">
<title>SD as Organizational</title>
<p>Although developed in the nursing setting, SD is not a nursing—or healthcare—phenomenon. SD is an organizational communication construct grounded in institutional theory. While specific nursing issues that arise in conjunction with SD may not generalize, the conceptual advantages of concentrating on a consistent set of institutional structures (in the Giddensian sense) outweigh concerns about specific issue generalizability. Focusing on a consistent set of institutional constraints has fostered development of SD theory, allowing a clear picture of structurational interpenetration to emerge. The particular nature of those structures is less important than the observation of patterns ensuing from their problematic intersection. An extensive literature addresses the problem of generalizing from healthcare to other organizational settings. Still, while healthcare institutions are unique settings, it is clear that the organizational problems experienced in those settings are indeed <italic>organizational</italic>, not clinical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0893318912458214">Ramanujam and Rousseau (2006b)</xref> devoted a <italic>Journal of Organizational Behavior</italic> special issue to that problem; <italic>organization</italic> and <italic>healthcare organization</italic> are not the same, but organizational dynamics are still organizational. (See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912458214">Mintzberg, 1997</xref>, on organizational issues common to hospitals.)</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0893318912458214">Ramanujam and Rousseau (2006a)</xref> use organizational theory to develop a healthcare organization (HCO) theoretical framework applying organizational constructs to primary HCO problems. Conflicting missions, interaction of multiple professions, multiple external stakeholders, and an ambiguous complex external environment comprise a core set of HCO dynamics. These are structurational interpenetrations. Although specific HCO issues may not be generalizable to other organizational settings, underlying organizational explanations can be applied to settings with similar dynamics. While structures, and the agency they enable, “vary dramatically from one social world to another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0893318912458214">Sewell, 1992</xref>, p. 21), the point is not in the desires, intentions, creative transpositions, or other performances of agency enacted by individuals. The point is that structures enable agency, and SD renders agency impotent. In nursing, SD is readily observable; this study observes SD in the nursing context.</p>

<sec id="section8-0893318912458214">
<title>An Exploratory Study of SD and Communication</title>
<p>As a recently identified construct, SD’s published literature is limited. A quantitative scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">Nicotera et al., 2010</xref>) allows us to identify related constructs. The original studies empirically linked SD to poor outcomes across a range of human services and public sector settings. SD has since been qualitatively related in nursing settings to destructive communication, turnover, and potentially dangerous outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912458214">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318912458214">Mahon &amp; Nicotera, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912458214">2010</xref>). To provide a basis for more sophisticated modeling, this study seeks to identify relationships between SD and key destructive communication and organizational outcomes and to explore whether constructive communication is inversely related to SD. We also examine the extent to which these constructs differentiate high SD from low. Identifying related constructs will allow us to explore whether associated constructs are antecedents, results, mediators, or moderators of SD.</p>

<sec id="section9-0893318912458214">
<title>Conceptually Associated Constructs</title>
<p><italic>Role conflict</italic> (RC) and <italic>burnout</italic> have already been associated with SD as part of validity-testing process for the SD scale. These are explored again here, along with other variables associated with poor organizational outcomes in the nursing literature: <italic>bullying, depression</italic>, and <italic>turnover intent</italic>. Communication constructs included are <italic>argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness, conflict management style, taking conflict personally</italic>, and <italic>ambiguity intolerance</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section10-0893318912458214">
<title>Role Conflict, Burnout, and Depression</title>
<p>Role conflict (RC) is defined as incompatible role expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318912458214">House, Schuler, &amp; Lavanoni, 1983</xref>). Role expectations are action rules rooted in institutional structures. When structures interpenetrate, incompatible action rules manifest as RC. The nursing literature treats RC as an underlying cause of poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912458214">Chen, Chen, Tsai, &amp; Lo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318912458214">Musk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0893318912458214">Schriner, 2007</xref>), but defining RC structurationally explains it as part of the SD-cycle.</p>
<p>RC produces stress, causing burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912458214">Ellis &amp; Miller, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912458214">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0893318912458214">Patrick &amp; Lavery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0893318912458214">Shaha &amp; Rabenschlag, 2007</xref>). Burnout is exhaustion caused by long-term involvement in emotionally demanding situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0893318912458214">Pines &amp; Aronson, 1988</xref>). The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), standard in nursing research, has three subscales: Emotional exhaustion (EE), reduced personal accomplishment (RPA), and depersonalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318912458214">Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1981</xref>). <italic>EE</italic> is work-related fatigue; sufferers feel worn down—the essence of SD immobilization. <italic>RPA</italic> is specific to efficacy in <italic>providing patient care</italic>, which does not result from nursing SD. The ability to provide quality care in spite of SD is a source of pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Clinkscales, 2010</xref>). Depersonalization is callousness about patient needs and is likewise not related to SD. We expect burnout to be related to SD, with EE most closely related, RPA less so, and depersonalization not related.</p>
<p>Burnout is associated with depression among nurses (e.g., seminal work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318912458214">Firth, McIntee, McKeown, &amp; Britton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318912458214">Meier, 1984</xref>), especially as linked to EE. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912458214">Bandura’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912458214">2001</xref>) social cognitive approach to depression suits our central focus. Bandura defines agency (self-efficacy) as human capacity to exercise control over one’s life. Through agentic transactions, people are both products and producers of social systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912458214">Bandura, 2001</xref>). Self-efficacy beliefs, judgments of one’s own “capabilities to organize and execute courses of action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912458214">Bandura, 1986</xref>, p. 391), are directly related to depression vulnerability. SD may contribute to depression among nurses if it affects self-efficacy beliefs.</p>

<title>Bullying</title>
<p>Workplace bullying is related to structural factors and depressive individual outcomes. Job demands (e.g., RC) and resources (e.g., decision authority, coworker support) are powerful predictors of bullying, which mediates the relationship between job demands and depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912458214">Balducci, Fraccaroli, &amp; Schaufeli, 2011</xref>). The healthcare sector leads in reported workplace bullying incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0893318912458214">Zapf, Einarsen, Hoel, &amp; Vartia, 2003</xref>), and nurse-nurse bullying has been studied for decades. (For literature reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318912458214">Hutchinson, Vickers, Jackson, &amp; Wilkes, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912458214">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912458214">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912458214">Hutchinson, Wilkes, Vickers, &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>, in nursing, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912458214">Lutgen-Sandvik, Namie, &amp; Namie, 2009</xref>, in general workplace.) Hutchinson’s treatment of bullying in nursing is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912458214">Lutgen-Sandvik et al.’s (2009)</xref> communication-grounded definition: “repeated, health-harming mistreatment that takes one or more of the following forms: verbal abuse; offensive conduct and behaviors (including nonverbal) that are threatening, humiliating, or intimidating; or work interference and sabotage that prevent work from getting done” (p. 27). Repetition, duration, escalation, harm, attributed intent, hostile work environment, communication patterning, and distorted communication networks differentiate bullying from onetime incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912458214">Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2009</xref>). Bullying can be dispute-related, predatory, or rooted in organizational practice. When interpersonal disagreements escalate to entrenched conflict (like SD), dispute-related bullying results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912458214">Einarsen, 1999</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912458214">Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2009</xref>). Predatory bullying types are authoritative (abuse of power), displaced (taking workplace frustration out on coworkers), and discriminatory (out-group prejudice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912458214">Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2009</xref>). Of these, displaced-bullying is most closely related to SD.</p>
<p>Workplace bullying occurs in negative stressful environments characterized by role-conflict and -ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318912458214">Hoel &amp; Salin 2003</xref>). Together, incoherence of organizational procedures and relational powerlessness predict bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318912458214">Hodson, Roscigno, &amp; Lopez, 2006</xref>): “Unresolved contradictions in [the] meaning, nature, and implementation” of incoherent procedures “fail to prevent bullying” (p. 407). Under such SD conditions, bullying may be a frustrated attempt by individuals to reclaim agency lost to incoherent structures. Bullying, however, serves only to deepen the cycle of SD, further subverting agency.</p>

<title>Communication-Related Constructs</title>
<p>To explore how communication constructs link to SD, we identified several communication variables traditionally associated with aggression and conflict, assuming destructive communication is positively related to SD. Constructive communication may be inversely related, mitigating SD. Communication variables may mediate or moderate the effects of SD on professional, work product, or organizational outcomes.</p>
<p>Because interpersonal communication associated with SD is marked by hostility, anger, and frustration, we included communicative predispositions to aggression: <italic>Verbal aggressiveness</italic> (VA) and its constructive counterpart <italic>argumentativeness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912458214">Infante &amp; Rancer 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912458214">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>). VA, the tendency to approach disagreement with personal attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912458214">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>), is related to bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0893318912458214">Wigley, 1998</xref>) and is expected to be associated with SD. The nursing literature has examined bullying from the victim’s perspective—the degree to which one is bullied. Examining VA explores whether the <italic>perpetration</italic> of destructive acts may be related to SD. VA may be a destructive expression of agency.</p>
<p>Argumentativeness is a tendency to approach disagreement with issue attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912458214">Infante &amp; Rancer, 1982</xref>). Although argumentativeness is a constructive expression of agency, reasoned argument cannot likely solve fundamental invisible meaning incompatibility. Though it is probably ineffective once the SD-cycle entrenches, argument may discover fundamental meaning differences to prevent escalation of an SD-nexus into an SD-cycle. We expect argumentativeness to be inversely related to SD.</p>
<p>Beliefs about arguing underlie argumentativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0893318912458214">Rancer, Kosberg, &amp; Baukus, 1992</xref>). While teasing out experiences, behaviors, and attitudes is beyond the present scope, it is worthwhile to explore whether beliefs about arguing might be associated with SD. Individuals experiencing SD may develop negative beliefs about arguing. We expect that SD is associated with negative beliefs and inversely related to positive beliefs. Identifying patterns can generate questions about the intersections of SD, argumentative behavioral tendencies, and attitudes.</p>
<p><italic>Conflict management style</italic> (CMS) allows direct examination of agentic conflict communication tendencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0893318912458214">Putnam and Wilson’s (1982)</xref> organizational communication conflict instrument (OCCI) focuses on strategic communicative messages. The conceptualization is based on the dual concern model, five styles along two dimensions (assertiveness and cooperativeness). <italic>Avoiding</italic> is neither; <italic>smoothing</italic> is cooperative but not assertive; <italic>controlling</italic> is assertive but not cooperative; <italic>collaborative</italic> is both; and <italic>compromise</italic> is in moderate ranges. Factor analysis created three independent subscales: <italic>Solution orientation</italic> (compromise and collaboration); <italic>nonconfrontational</italic> (smoothing and avoiding); and <italic>controlling</italic>. Because SD-associated conflict is rooted in incompatible meaning, productive conflict management does not solve it, but solution oriented CMS is skilled interaction that may prevent escalation of an SD-nexus into an SD-cycle. We expect solution-oriented CMS to be inversely related to SD. Controlling CMS is expected to exacerbate SD, and vice versa, displaying an association with SD. Finally, we expect nonconfrontational CMS, a form of immobilization, to be associated with SD.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318912458214">Hample and Dalliger’s (1995)</xref> <italic>taking conflict personally</italic> (TCP) may also be related to SD. TCP has six dimensions. The first three are reactions to conflict: <italic>Direct personalization</italic> (hurt feelings from feeling criticized); <italic>persecution feelings</italic> (combative and feeling picked on); and <italic>stress reaction</italic> (tension and discomfort). Two others are general attitudes about effects of conflict: <italic>Positive</italic> and <italic>negative relational effects</italic>. The sixth is <italic>like/dislike valence</italic>. Individuals who feel conflict personally and negatively may experience SD and its loss of agency more intensely. We expect negative dimensions of TCP to be associated positively with SD and the positive dimensions to be associated negatively.</p>
<p>Finally, given the ambiguity associated with the SD-nexus, <italic>ambiguity intolerance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0893318912458214">Norton, 1975</xref>) may be related.

<title>Measuring SD</title>
<p>The self-report SD scale measures SD in the nursing context. Using 50 items generated from interview transcripts of nurses describing SD, a 17-item scale resulted from expert review, extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and validity-testing with a sizable sample of nurses. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0893318912458214">Nicotera et al., 2010</xref>, for details, scale items and instructions.) The instrument operationalizes SD at the individual level, holistically capturing SD and targeting each of its components. The summed subscales are <italic>unresolved conflict, immobilization/individual development</italic>, and <italic>managerial/organizational development</italic>. There is an operational connection between immobilization and individual development; whereas individual-level development and organizational-level are conceptually collapsed in the theory, they are operationally distinct. The scale can be used as an individual or group diagnostic tool. Scores above the midpoint label an individual as high-SD. For aggregates, a mean score above the midpoint is used in the same way. It must be cautioned, however, that full diagnosis of SD involves observation to identify the particular intersecting oppositional meanings. The instrument operationalizes the SD-nexus and the SD-cycle but cannot identify specific intersections.</p>

<sec id="section17-0893318912458214" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Results reveal several significant relationships with medium to large effect sizes. Both organizational and communication variables are associated with structurational divergence. (Throughout the reporting of results, with the exception of tables, the variable name structurational divergence will be spelled out, reserving the abbreviation SD for standard deviation.) The first hypothesis predicted that RC, burnout, bullying, depression, and turnover intent would be associated with structurational divergence. All of these destructive variables were positively associated with structurational divergence: RC (<italic>r</italic> = .68; <italic>p</italic> = .000; <italic>N</italic> = 80); burnout (<italic>r</italic> = .48; <italic>p</italic> = .000; <italic>N</italic> = 79); bullying (<italic>r</italic> = .64; <italic>p</italic> = .000; <italic>N</italic> = 76); and depression (<italic>r</italic> = .49; <italic>p</italic> = .000; <italic>N</italic> = 78). For burnout subscales, only EE was correlated with structurational divergence on its own (<italic>r</italic> = .60; <italic>p</italic> = .000; <italic>N</italic> = 81). Structurational divergence was significantly higher for those who indicated an intention to leave their current job (using statistics for unequal variances: <italic>t</italic> (53.85) = 3.64; <italic>p</italic> = .001; <italic>d</italic> = .85; intention to leave <italic>M</italic> = 42.73, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.78, <italic>n</italic> = 34; and no intention to leave <italic>M</italic> = 32.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.69, <italic>n</italic> = 40). It was impossible to test intention to leave the profession because only one person indicated such intention. Her explanation is, however, consistent with structurational divergence: “[I] feel that many times the contribution of nurses are overlooked and belittled. If any mistep [sic] is made, too much effort is made by peers and superiors to expose your ‘incompetence.’ [I am] growing weary of the ‘backstabbing’ nature of the profession.”</p>
<p>To answer the first RQ, examining whether these variables differentiate high levels of structurational divergence from low, the sample was split into two groups at the midpoint of the structurational divergence scale (high structurational divergence <italic>n</italic> = 13; low structurational divergence <italic>n</italic> = 71; and missing <italic>n</italic> = 2). Again, all tests were significant, with EE being the only subscale of burnout related on its own. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0893318912458214">Table 2</xref> for <italic>t</italic> tests. A chi-square test also indicated that the high structurational divergence group is differentiated from the low structurational divergence group by turnover intent as well (<italic>X</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 10.52; <italic>p</italic> = .001; <italic>Φ</italic> = .38).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SD is strongly related to the major organizational problems examined in this study: RC; burnout; bullying; and depression. Each of these problems can be argued as a loss of agency. All are associated with SD as measured on its continuous scale and differentiate those with a problematically high level of SD from those with low SD. Clearly, our pursuit of understanding the association of this phenomenon with troublesome workplace environment variables is warranted. The effect sizes for these findings were quite large.</p>
<sec id="section19-0893318912458214">
<title>Theorizing SD as Agentic Impotence</title>
<p>The loss of agency theorized here is not a total loss of human agency, which would be antithetical to the structurational premise. Structuration theory solves the conceptual tension between individual will and societal constraint, accounts for evolution of social structures, and bridges sociology and psychology. The introduction of Giddens to organizational communication served to solve similar tensions among the structural-functionalist, social psychological, and behaviorist approaches. Structuration provided what other theoretical frameworks (Weick’s organizing and Cushman's rules theory, for example) could accomplish only in part. The popularity of structurational approaches in organizational communication can be attributed to our continuing need to understand institutional/organizational structure and human behavior in concert with one another as their connections manifest in communication.</p>
<p>Agency, the primary construct meeting that need, presumes a teleological ontology. As agent, each individual member of an organizational system mobilizes resources and invokes existing structures to follow and use purposively. Agency allows individuals to choose, accidentally or strategically, actions that transform structures. This transformative agency is compromised by SD. RC reduces ability to meet the needs of others; meeting the needs of others is central to the nursing job function—the agentic goal. RC has been conceptualized as a surface level manifestation of SD, so its association is not surprising. When occupying an internally conflicted role, actions invoking one set of rules necessarily violate another set. In SD, moreover, the individual cannot effectively reproduce oppositional structures simultaneously and thus cannot transform them. The simultaneous nature of the demands conceptually differentiates SD from RC. Examining this through Giddens' modalities, communication signifies oppositional meanings for behaviors that are simultaneously legitimate and illegitimate, and the SD sufferer’s powerless position limits his/her ability to respond transformationally. Individuals in SD-entrenched systems consistently report feelings of powerlessness and inability to create effective changes that improve their lives and allow them to get things done. When productivity and performance are monitored by those in authority, the inability to meet those goals effectively because of the cross-purposes created in the SD system is defined here as impotent agency.</p>
<p>Metaphors such as “running in concrete,” “between a rock and a hard place,” and “the hamster wheel” have all been used to describe SD. The inability to accomplish tasks, meet goals, and achieve development resonates with our agency impotence interpretation of SD. Since development is a transformational phenomenon, the inability to transform structurationally divergent intersections of meaning into a coherent system seems a good explanation for the entirety of the SD-cycle. The constant repetition of attempts to solve intractable problems is highly stressful, so it is expected that SD is associated with burnout, particularly with emotional exhaustion. When it does not result in turnover, burnout leaves people feeling hopeless and trapped—immobilization in the SD-cycle. Burnout has long been associated with diminished efficacy, validating our interpretation. If SD creates and/or exacerbates RC at the same time that it generates intractable interpersonal and organizational conflicts, it is not surprising that SD is also associated with bullying and depression. Bullying is a long-recognized intractable problem in nursing. Anecdotal data from the portion of this sample who took the training course following this survey suggests a widespread belief among nurses that bullying is due to problem personalities. Indeed, a common cliché among nurses is that they “eat their young” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912458214">Anderson, 2009</xref>). Under the reasoning that the SD-nexus countermands agency and the SD-cycle deepens due to an inability to effect structural transformation, it seems that the frustration and anger generated by SD gets turned outward as bullying and inward as depression. Of course, under the adage that the only real fix for a bad job is finding a better job, an equally common manifestation of agency is exit, which brings us to turnover.</p>
<p>The fact that nearly half the sample indicated intention to leave their current jobs is chilling. Turnover, an oft-cited problem in nursing, leads to shortages and discontinuities in patient care. We conducted post hoc analyses to examine which variables are independently related to intentions to leave current job. All except depression are significantly related in the expected direction. (Again, for burnout subscales only EE is related on its own; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0893318912458214">Table 4</xref>). More research is needed to investigate the complex relationships among SD, communication, individual and organizational outcomes. Based on these promising results, a large (<italic>N</italic> = 713) follow-up study to conduct more sophisticated analysis replicates them and finds strong inverse relationships between SD and additional organizational variables: job satisfaction; professional identification; and organizational identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Kim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0893318912458214">Nicotera, Zhao, Kim, Peterson &amp; Mahon, 2012</xref>). Preliminary analyses also reveal that burnout, RC, bullying, and organizational identification partially mediate the relationships of SD with job satisfaction and turnover intent. This new dataset also includes hospital-provided performance measures (errors, cost overruns, actual turnover, and patient satisfaction) not yet analyzed.</p>

<title>Challenging Notions of Good Communication</title>
<p>The most intriguing finding in the present study is that while destructive communication variables are positively related to SD, all with large effect sizes, no constructive communication variables are significantly associated with SD. This is not an inverse relationship, but none at all. Good communication skills traditionally applied to conflict seem irrelevant—offering no protection from or recourse for this set of problems. To further explore this finding, the large follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0893318912458214">Nicotera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0893318912458214">Nicotera &amp; Kim, 2012</xref>) also included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912458214">Duran and Spitzberg’s (1995)</xref> cognitive communication competence (CCC), which operationalizes communication competence as conscious reflection on one's communication before, during, and after interaction. Remarkably, CCC is positively correlated with SD, albeit weakly, suggesting that thinking about one's communication, normally considered a constructive communication skill, not only is unhelpful under SD, but may actually contribute to the problem.</p>
<p>The present results suggest that skilled and unskilled communicators alike are sucked into the SD-cycle. It is not that lack of good communication fosters SD; it is that our level of good conflict communication skills means nothing to SD; evidence from our more recent data suggests it may even make it worse. Our findings validate our contention that conflict cycles, as explained by SD theory, require a more sophisticated understanding than individual differences (in values, goals, etc.), which might be called <italic>ordinary conflict</italic>. Good communication skills for ordinary conflict do not solve SD-related problems. Good interpersonal communication skills are irrelevant to SD because SD is not an interpersonal problem. SD is an organizational problem manifesting in interpersonal communication. The apparent irrelevance of the agentic activities of good communication also supports our contention that SD strips human agency.</p>
<p>The nature of the relationship between SD and destructive communication, while important, remains inconclusive. Destructive communication variables may be moderators, leading the SD-nexus to escalate to an SD-cycle, while constructive communication is irrelevant. It is interesting to note that while neither argumentativeness nor positive argument beliefs are related to SD, negative argument beliefs are positively associated. The distinction between argumentativeness and argument beliefs is behavior and attitude. SD may create a negative attitude toward the agentic activity of argument, stripping the individual both of agency and of belief in its value and suggesting developmental regression rather than just stagnation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0893318912458214">
<title>Implications for Intervention</title>
<p>To further examine the relationships of these variables with SD and assess potential for intervention, we compared significant bivariate correlations to <italic>t</italic> tests differentiating high- and low-SD. First, we identified variables with significant bivariate relationships that also differentiate high- from low-SD. All the organizational variables fell into this category. For communication variables, TCP persecution feelings, TCP negative relational effects, and TCP stress reaction also are each related in both ways. TCP direct personalization, on the other hand, differentiates high and low SD groups, but does not have a significant bivariate relationship with SD as a continuous variable. An intervention must directly address SD consciousness, helping participants to reframe interpretations of personal conflict as structural positioning problems—reframing opponents as allies with a common problem.</p>
<p>Second, we identified variables with a significant bivariate relationship with SD that do not differentiate high- from low-SD. Controlling management style, VA, and ambiguity intolerance (and its problem-solving subscale) fell into this group. This finding may indicate that these variables moderate the effects of SD; those diagnosed as high-SD were not significantly different from low-SDs for these destructive communication variables. TCP appears to operate differently with SD than all the other communication variables. The specific TCP subscales that seem most important are interesting. Feeling personally criticized, believing that conflict impacts relationships negatively, reacting with stress, and directly personalizing likely stem from an underlying dysfunctional presumption that conflict is necessarily destructive. Fundamental biases in Western organizational life frame conflict as necessarily dysfunctional and emotion as counterproductive; these are primary obstacles to the application of effective conflict intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912458214">Bodtker &amp; Jameson, 2001</xref>). Any intervention needs to dispel these biases.</p>
<p>Third, concluding that skills associated with good conflict management are not applicable to SD presents an interventionist quandary. SD masquerades as interpersonal conflict; lurking beneath the surface to manifest as something it is not, so any intervention must provide conflict analysis training, consciousness-raising, and skills for transcendence (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912458214">Bodtker &amp; Jameson’s, 2001</xref>, application of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912458214">Galtung’s, 1996</xref>, triadic theory, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0893318912458214">Pearce &amp; Littlejohn’s, 1997</xref>, transcendent eloquence). Our intervention consists of consciousness-raising focus groups that teach narrative skills for transformational change by empowering individuals to reframe their stressful conflicts and choose their own positioning. Reframing, or rewriting one’s own narrative, may or may not result in the resolution of incompatibility. However, transcendence occurs in the redefining of an enemy as a comrade with a common structural problem. Recurrent interpersonal conflicts are reframed as joint problem-solving tasks (as conceptualized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912458214">Canary and Spitzberg’s, 1989</xref>, model of competent conflict communication). This reframing provides choices for action, restoring transformational agency. If the SD-nexus cannot be resolved, reframing relationships transforms structure, allowing evolution of social practices to prevent escalation of the SD-cycle. The assessment of the training (attended by some of the participants in the present study after these data were collected) are reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally, although SD is an institutional phenomenon, all variables in the study were measured at the individual level because SD is manifested at the individual level and communication skills are individually based. It now is clear that the institutional forces driving SD are impervious to good conflict communication skills at the individual level, even as they encourage poor communication. More specialized skills, relying on deeper awareness of institutional forces and on an understanding of the SD phenomenon, may mitigate the effects of SD at the individual level. Our SD education program focuses energy on problems without blaming individuals or suggesting personal failings but by providing a framework to understand the underlying source of daily frustrations and a set of skills to navigate a difficult landscape. Nurses in this sample who later participated in the training course reported after the course that they felt a great sense of relief and renewed energy when their feelings that something was just not right were validated and a set of analytic and dialogic skills were provided for them to map their treacherous landscape. This response appears to be a resurgence of agency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0893318912458214">
<title>Nursing as an Organizational Setting</title>
<p>Nursing’s professional culture is conflict avoidant: Nurses do not seem to recognize the benefits of healthy conflict management, viewing direct confrontation of conflict as unprofessional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318912458214">Mahon &amp; Nicotera, 2011</xref>). Further study should examine the nature of the relationships among TCP variables and SD among nurses and in other populations. The nursing literature is flooded with descriptions of organizational challenges. A plethora of constructs has emerged (e.g., RC, burnout, moral distress, bullying), but because they lack grounding in organizational and communication theory, explanations are incomplete. Perhaps the most striking tone in this literature is the blame placed on the individual: If only the nurse had more skill, greater understanding, or advanced knowledge, the problem would disappear.</p>
<p>We hope our interdisciplinary effort to apply organizational communication theory to nursing fosters a new paradigm in nursing research and communication research in nursing settings that views the setting through the lenses of organizational theory. The nursing literature’s individual-focus, individual-blame approach has been unfruitful. SD theory as applied to nursing reveals that incompatible structural intersections foster cultures in which agency is impotent and unhealthy communication perpetuates.</p>

<title>Generalizing to Other Organizational Settings</title>
<p>Organizational communication researchers commonly conduct research in healthcare settings with scant, if any, attention to unique dynamics and constraints posed by the setting. Few pay attention to context. The organizational literature is applied to healthcare settings with inadequate regard to their distinct organizational features. Findings from these settings are often generalized to “organizations,” without acknowledging any organizationally distinct features of the healthcare organizational context. A cursory search of organizational research in the last 5 years in hospital settings generated a concerning number of published studies done this way, many by well-known scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912458214">Benoit-Barné &amp; Cooren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912458214">Bordia, Jones, Gallois, Callan, &amp; DiFonzo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912458214">Coyle-Shapiro, Kessler, &amp; Purcell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912458214">Doorewaard &amp; Brouns, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912458214">Ferres, Connell, &amp; Travaglione, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318912458214">Goodier &amp; Eisenberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912458214">Grice, Gallois, Jones, Paulsen, &amp; Callen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318912458214">Jamal &amp; Baba, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318912458214">Kaplan &amp; Patel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318912458214">Lewis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318912458214">Murray &amp; Peyrefitte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0893318912458214">Rooney, Paulson, Callan, Barbant, Gallois &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>). There are fewer that attend to the unique organizational features of HCOs, and in those that do, generic “organization” is the theoretic focus (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912458214">Fitzgerald &amp; Desjardins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318912458214">Gittel &amp; Weiss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0893318912458214">Viitanen &amp; Piiraninen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0893318912458214">Winch &amp; Derrick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0893318912458214">Ye, Marinova, &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0893318912458214">Ramanujam and Rousseau (2006a)</xref> highlight the <italic>fundamental pluralism</italic> of HCOs with four unique organizational features that amplify the administrative complexity of day-to-day tasks. First, HCOs have multiple <italic>conflicting missions</italic> (e.g., patient care, community service, medical education, profit, health research, religious values). Assessment of mission achievement must be based on multiple dimensions. Second, the HCO workforce is comprised of <italic>multiple professions</italic> with differing training and licensing requirements, salary structures, and power roles. Furthermore, they are socialized in other organizational systems.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>So dominant are institutionalized pre-employment processes that many HCOs attempt little or no socialization of their own workforce. Weak organization-based socialization means that individuals can have as many different professional practices and care-giving behaviors as the institutions that educated them. . . . The result is strong professional identification and weak organizational identification. (pp. 813-814)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Third, HCOs face <italic>multiple external stakeholders</italic>, including government and multiple professional associations. Finally, the HCO has a <italic>complex task environment</italic>—ambiguous, dynamic, local, and subject to the simultaneous demands of standardization and flexibility.</p>
<p>SD is undoubtedly an institutional phenomenon, but this identification does not predict SD in all organizational settings. The fundamental pluralism of HCOs likely makes the nursing environment susceptible. The identification of nursing as ripe for SD because of intersecting meaning systems is conceptually captured by this notion of fundamental pluralism, but the connection remains an empirical question. A full understanding can only be accomplished by expanding beyond nursing and healthcare to a variety of professional, organizational, and industrial settings. Wherever an SD-nexus can be identified, development of SD-cycles is possible. The question remains in what organizational settings SD-nexi might occur. SD is likely in settings marked by the kind of fundamental pluralism seen in HCOs, such as other human service and public sector organizations in government, education, social services, nonprofits, and so on, as well as in private sector organizations with pluralistic dynamic environments and structures, such as health insurance companies, highly regulated industries, and any organization undergoing fundamental restructuring or volatility in its environment.</p>

<title>Limitation</title>
<p>The respondents enrolled in the course following this survey were interested in learning about workplace conflict. The potential confounds between this self-selected group and rest of the sample was checked by <italic>t</italic> tests, revealing no significant differences on any variables, including SD. A chi-square between the SD-grouping split and the self-selected sampling split showed no significant difference. About 16% of the sample classify as high-SD, not predicted by self-selection. Still, there may be some unknown differences between the two groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These analyses offer a good beginning for exploring SD, which seems a fruitful avenue to understand more deeply, from a communication theory perspective, organizational conflict cycles and related problems. We have shown that organizational and communication variables are differently related to SD and that destructive and constructive communication variables must also be treated differently. In addition to deepening our understanding of SD and nursing, future research must examine SD across other professions and organizational settings.</p>
