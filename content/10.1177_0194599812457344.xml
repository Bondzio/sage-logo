<title>Background</title>
<p>Bacteria including <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and anaerobic bacteria such as <italic>Fusobacterium necrophorum</italic> have been implicated as etiological agents of chronic pharyngitis in Western literature.

<p>In total, 343 consecutive adults with persistent throat pain and/or irritation (duration ≥3 months) were screened for known causes of pharyngitis by a thorough clinical and endoscopic examination. In 71 patients, the evaluation performed was unable to determine any cause, and these were considered cases. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test to detect IgA and IgG antibodies to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> was performed on 66 of these cases and 62 controls.

<body>
<p>Chronic pharyngitis is a common clinical condition presenting most often as a persistent sore throat. Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians, and such patients form a significant bulk of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812457344">1</xref></sup> Most of these individuals get tested extensively because either an infectious cause or an irritant is suspected to cause the condition. However, despite detailed evaluation and numerous investigations, the most common scenario is a patient with persistent sore throat with no obvious etiological agent found to be responsible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812457344">2</xref></sup> There have been reports of agents such as <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumonia</italic>, and anaerobic bacteria such as <italic>Fusobacterium necrophorum</italic>, which can be treated effectively by currently available antibacterials, playing a role in chronic pharyngitis. However, it has not been established whether they simply act as copathogens or as primary etiological agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457344">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812457344"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812457344"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812457344">6</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, there are no clinical data from India on chronic pharyngitis, a common but difficult condition to treat.</p>
<p>Therefore, we undertook this prospective case-control study to evaluate the role of atypical etiological agents in South Indian individuals with chronic pharyngitis.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812457344" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Among the patients presenting with persistent throat pain and/or irritation (duration ≥3 months), 343 consecutive subjects were recruited for the study after obtaining informed consent. Detailed clinical evaluation was performed to rule out persistent sore throat secondary to laryngopharyngeal reflux, postnasal drip secondary to sinusitis and upper respiratory allergy, smoking, occupational irritants, or dental sepsis. Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy (NPLscopy) and rigid nasal endoscopy (RNE) were done to confirm the clinical findings as well as to rule out malignancy. The subjects in whom no obvious cause was detected were included as cases in the study. In addition to the above-mentioned causes for pharyngitis being criteria for exclusion, individuals who were immunocompromised, hypertensive, diabetic, or suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, or any malignancy also were excluded. All patients who were recruited had not been administered antimicrobials in the 2 weeks prior to testing.</p>
<p>Controls were selected from adult patients (≥17 years) who presented to the ENT outpatient department (OPD) with non-throat–related conditions such as torn earlobe for repair, migraine, vertigo, or hearing loss in nondischarging ears and had no ENT focus of infection. They were age- and sex-matched with the cases and included in the study if they had no history of throat pain or irritation for at least 3 months. All the controls included were immunocompetent individuals with no history of hypertension, diabetes, COPD, or coronary artery disease and were nonsmokers.</p>
<p>After obtaining informed consent from both cases and controls, throat swabs were taken for aerobic and anaerobic culture and venous blood samples for serological testing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812457344"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> depicts the flowchart for recruitment of cases and controls and the assays performed in this study.</p>

</fig>
<p>The samples were promptly delivered to the laboratory, where the following tests were performed as described below.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812457344">
<title>Aerobic Culture</title>
<p>For aerobic culture, the throat swab was inoculated onto a blood agar (BA) plate.</p>
<p>Each BA plate was incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The culture plates were read after 24 and 48 hours of incubation and pathogens identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812457344">
<title>Anaerobic Culture</title>
<p>For anaerobic culture, the swab was inoculated into BA, neomycin blood agar (NBA), thioglycollate broth (TG), and Robertson’s cooked meat medium (RCM). Following inoculation, the media were incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere at 37°C. Gram stains were done every 24 hours to detect growth in the TG and RCM. The plate media (BA and NBA) were checked after 72 hours. If organisms were observed, they were tested for aerotolerance (to prove that they were truly anaerobes), and identification was performed up to genus level using biochemicals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812457344">
<title>Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</title>
<p>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> were detected using commercially available kits (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany), and each assay was validated as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The procedure adopted is briefly described below. The serum dilution used was 1:100, and photometric measurement of the optical density (OD) was made using dual wavelengths (450 nm and 630 nm). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed on an automated ELISA workstation (Chemwell, Awareness Technology, Inc, Palm City, Florida). IgA ELISA was semi-quantitative, and the samples were first pre-adsorbed with IgG sorbent EUROSORB (Euroimmun AG). This was used to avoid false-positive results, which may be obtained because of the presence of rheumatoid factor, or false-negative results, which may be obtained because of an excess of IgG antibodies. The ratio between the OD between sample and calibrator was calculated, and a ratio ≥1.1 was considered positive. IgG antibodies were detected by a quantitative ELISA using 3-point calibration; values ≥22 U/mL were taken as positive.</p>
<p>IgA antibodies were detected by ELISA to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> in the 71 patients in whom no known cause was identified. In 66 cases and 62 controls, ELISA to detect IgG antibodies to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> (Euroimmun AG) was performed. The analysis of the results was done after the exclusion of those 5 cases and 9 controls in whom IgG ELISA could not be done.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812457344">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The results were analyzed and compared by the χ<sup>2</sup> test and the Fisher exact test, including the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI), using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). This study was approved by the institutional review board as well as the ethics committee of the Christian Medical College, Vellore.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Only 71 of the 343 consecutive consenting adults who were studied and found to have no obvious cause of persistent throat pain or irritation were included as cases. Among the 272 excluded, 160 had features suggestive of acid reflux disease, 80 had allergic rhinitis, 10 had periodontitis, 20 were smokers, and 2 had an enlarged styloid process. Among the 71 patients enrolled, 45 (63.4%) were men and 26 (36.6%) were women. The mean age of the cases was 34.8 years (range, 18-65 years). The mean duration of throat irritation and throat pain was 19.27 months and 6.56 months, respectively, in the cases.</p>
<p>In 66 of the cases and 62 of the controls recruited, IgG ELISA for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> could be done. The results of the culture and serological tests performed on these cases and controls are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812457344"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Elucidation of etiological agents can help in better understanding the pathology associated with chronic pharyngitis and therefore lead to better management of these patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective case-control study from India providing information on this common yet difficult to treat condition. Among the patients with chronic pharyngitis, coexistent laryngopharyngeal reflux was the most common cause for exclusion. This is in concordance with studies that show the role of reflux in chronic pharyngitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812457344">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>IgG antibodies are long lasting, and hence an elevated IgG titer provides information about past infection only and not of persistent illness. Since IgA antibodies are short lived, elevated titers suggest a persisting infection. Therefore, we used IgA as a marker for the detection of persistent infection with <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C pneumonia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812457344">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812457344">9</xref></sup> We preferred the ELISA over microimmunofluorescence (MIF), as it is easy to standardize, perform, and interpret because the OD results are obtained as numerical values. As a result, the test is less susceptible to interobserver and intraobserver variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812457344">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812457344">11</xref></sup> In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA are comparable with the MIF assay, which is the serological gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812457344">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812457344">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</title>
<p>Among those subjects in whom no obvious cause was found, a statistically significant difference between cases and controls was noted with only <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> serology for both IgA and IgG. An odds ratio of 3.4 suggests that individuals with chronic pharyngitis were 3.43 times more likely to be seropositive for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> than healthy individuals (<italic>P</italic> = .001). A similar study by Falck et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457344">3</xref></sup> demonstrated that 75% (9 of 12) of the patients with chronic pharyngitis had positive IgA antibodies to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic>. However, their study was limited by small sample size (n = 12) and lack of controls. In this study, 50% of the cases of chronic pharyngitis had positive IgA to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> in comparison to 22.5% of the controls.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic carriage of <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> in the respiratory tract is well described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812457344">17</xref></sup> Kern et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812457344">18</xref></sup> have reported a seroprevalence of 12.9% in healthy subjects. In our study, 22.5% of the healthy controls had IgA antibodies to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> by ELISA. This difference in the prevalence could be due to differences in epidemiology, including population studied.</p>
<p><italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> infections have been known to be persistent and may require longer periods of antibiotics for clinical resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812457344">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812457344">20</xref></sup> The infectious particle of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (ie, the elementary body) is metabolically inert and therefore resistant to the action of bacteriostatic antibiotics. Only the metabolically active chlamydial forms, the reticulate bodies, are affected by antibiotics such as macrolides and tetracyclines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812457344">21</xref></sup> Roblin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812457344">22</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that the efficacy of different antibiotics for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> was similar in terms of clinical improvement, although the organism could not be eradicated; similar findings also have been obtained by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457344">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812457344">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812457344">24</xref></sup> This dichotomy in clinical resolution and microbiological persistence suggests that the persistence is not secondary to the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we found all patients with positive IgA to <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> to have positive IgG (suggestive of past infection) in addition to signs of chronic inflammation, as evidenced by the presence of posterior pharyngeal wall granulations. The protracted nature of chronic pharyngitis can be explained by the persistence of this organism in an inert but viable form that is resistant to the action of antibiotics.</p>
<p>Despite the various mechanisms described, the exact molecular mechanism of chlamydial persistence is not known. There is hope that the mechanism of persistence will soon be unraveled by using tools such as proteomics and microarrays, as chronic persistent infection by <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> may be difficult to eradicate with a single course of antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812457344">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812457344">25</xref></sup> Falck et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457344">3</xref></sup> suggest that the immune mechanisms in most patients may eliminate the organism. There are animal studies that propose that induction of mucosal IgA immune response by local immunization may be the future of treatment of chronic pharyngitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812457344">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although we found a statistically significant association between the presence of IgA and IgG antibodies and chronic pharyngitis, there is a need to study this condition further using MIF and PCR. This is because the test format used can have a bearing on seropositivity and has been noted in individuals with coronary artery disease secondary to atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812457344">10</xref></sup> The lack of long-term follow-up precluded serial testing and also observation of clinical progress in our study subjects; future studies should include this so that we are better able to understand this clinical entity.</p>

<title>Mycoplasma pneumonia</title>
<p>IgA and IgG ELISA for <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> showed no significant difference between the cases and the controls. <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> was not found to be a significant etiological agent for chronic pharyngitis in this study. Beaver and Karow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812457344">6</xref></sup> demonstrated that 15% of patients with chronic pharyngitis had elevated IgM to <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>. They also inferred that individuals with allergies and silent laryngopharyngeal reflux have a more fragile pharyngeal mucosa and are consequently more prone to infection with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812457344">6</xref></sup> In this study, we have not attempted to study the role of atypical organisms in patients with allergies and laryngopharyngeal reflux.</p>

<sec id="section16-0194599812457344">
<title>Aerobic Organisms</title>
<p>Aerobic organisms were not found to be significant etiological agents for chronic pharyngitis. Common bacteriological agents incriminated in acute pharyngitis were not a significant cause of chronic pharyngitis in our study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812457344">27</xref></sup> Throat swabs for aerobic culture were not found to be a useful investigation in the evaluation of patients with chronic pharyngitis in this study.</p>
<sec id="section17-0194599812457344">
<title>Fusobacterium spp</title>
<p>The decreased isolation of <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> spp in our subjects as compared with healthy controls is probably due to the multiple courses of antibiotics and medicated gargles received by these patients prior to treatment at our institute. Anaerobes such as <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> spp are commensals in the oral cavity and therefore susceptible to action of oral penicillins, which are the agents generally prescribed for any suspected infection of the throat. Repeated courses of antibiotics have probably caused a reduction in the anaerobic oropharyngeal flora. In contrast, Batty et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812457344">4</xref></sup> have opined that these anaerobes are responsible for longstanding sore throat in the general population. They isolated <italic>F necrophorum</italic> from 21% of patients with persistent sore throat. In the current study, we did not find any such association.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence that persistent infection with <italic>C pneumoniae</italic> occurs in Indian subjects with chronic pharyngitis. Our results suggest that aerobic organisms and <italic>M pneumoniae</italic> are not associated with chronic pharyngitis. In addition, fusobacteria were isolated significantly more from controls than from cases. We postulate this to be due to the change in the normal pharyngeal flora in these patients due to multiple courses of antibiotics such patients usually receive. More studies, with long term follow-up, using more specific tests are necessary to validate these observations.</p>
