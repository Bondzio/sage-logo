<p>The setting: Early May, 2035—field trip season. Once a year teachers are allowed to seek permission to take their students out of the multimedia mega malls and food courts constructed after the 2023 elimination of the New York City School Department’s system of neighborhood schools. The theme of this year’s field trip is twentieth-century affordable housing, and the students have been authorized to visit two museums in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In the morning they will go to the Lower East Side Tenement House Museum, an institution with a half-century of experience in offering creative educational programs for diverse audiences. The afternoon will be devoted to a visit to the Governor Al Smith Houses that was built and managed by the New York City Public Housing Authority (NYCPH) until 2033 when its real estate holdings were liquidated. The Museum is located in a one bedroom dwelling unit in one of the high-rise buildings built in the 1950s as part of the former public housing development known as the Governor Al Smith Houses.</p>
<p>A post–field trip discussion revealed that the visit to the Tenement House Museum overwhelmingly convinced the students of the need for laws that ultimately led to the elimination of such tenement houses and the construction of the Governor Al Smith Houses and other similar public housing developments. They had seen with their own eyes how local laws regulating private sector housing and the construction of federally subsidized public housing successfully improved living conditions for ordinary New Yorkers.</p>
<p>At a time when the use of the power of the state—local, state, or federal government—to achieve particular economic or social goals has once again fallen out of favor in the United States, two books appear to offer a reminder of just how essential the state has been and remains in creating and maintaining decent living conditions for those who live in or near poverty. Taken together, these two books show how state action made the tenement house and the postwar high-rise public housing apartment the bookends of New York City’s twentieth-century affordable housing. A specific tenement house—97 Orchard Street in the Lower East Side—was the subject of the <italic>Biography of a Tenement House</italic> by Andrew S. Dolkart. As the James Marston Fitch Professor of Historic Preservation at Columbia University’s School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, Dolkart’s extensive research was carried out in support of the Lower East Side Tenement House Museum, the current occupant and owner of the tenement at 97 Orchard Street. New Yorkers registered their dissatisfaction with tenement dwellings by seeking residence in other types of housing as soon as they could afford to do so. Beginning in the 1930s, a small number of New Yorkers sought refuge from tenement life in public housing. The political impact of public housing and its residents was far greater than the actual numbers of residents, especially in New York City, according to Nicholas Dagen Bloom, author of <italic>Public Housing that Worked</italic>.</p>
<p>Bloom’s analysis is based on the records of the NYCHA housed at the LaGuardia Archives at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. His book was also informed by personal experience. His parents reside in one of the middle-income apartment buildings adjacent to the General Ulysses S. Grant public housing development. The co-commingling of the low and middle-income housing was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Morningside Heights urban renewal project. Dolkart could hardly be better suited for his role as the nation’s foremost tenement house detective. His father was born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents who resided in a similar Lower East Side tenement named The Mayflower (p. vii).</p>
<p>Dolkart and Bloom reveal how the housing choices available to ordinary New Yorkers since the American Civil War have been (and continue to be) determined by the complex interplay of numerous environmental, economic, political, social, and cultural factors and issues. What twentieth-century householders actually got for their money—how many square feet of living space, and how much natural light, fresh air, and other facilities depended on decisions made by elected and appointed public officials, bankers, realtors, residential developers, real estate investors, and previous generations of renters. In the final analysis, however, the laws passed and policy decisions made in New York City Hall, Albany, and Washington, DC, were more important in determining quality of living conditions than the state of the real estate market at any given time.</p>
<p>The story of how and why in 1867 New York City lawmakers first began what would be a continuous process to define and regulate tenement houses is familiar to many students and scholars of urban life. Dolkart’s unique contribution is to show how each major tenement law affected a particular residence. He documented exactly what measures the landlord undertook to comply with the law and how the alterations were physically carried out. The tenement erected at 97 Orchard Street in 1863-64 by German immigrant Lucus Glockner as a residence and investment originally lacked water, gas, electricity, or central heating system yet was in compliance with the Tenement House Act of 1867 because it had at least one sewer-connected privy or toilet for every twenty inhabitants.</p>
<p>Dolkart argues that the watershed year for the regulation of New York City tenements came in 1901. So-called new-law tenements covered less of the building lot than “old-law tenements” such as 97 Orchard Street, and had bigger airshafts. The new law did not require retrofitting the windowless rooms of old-law tenements. Landlords were, however, compelled to replace outdoor privies with at least one flush toilet for every two families. Rather than comply with a 1934 fire safety law, the owners of 97 Orchard Street evicted the residents and turned the former apartments into storage area for the commercial enterprises on the ground floor and basement. Between 1864 and 1935 (when the building was closed as a residence), it housed an estimated 7,000 persons.</p>
<p>The residents of 97 Orchard Street searched for new apartments during a time of national debate over the scarcity of affordable housing in New York City and elsewhere. As part of his New Deal economic recovery program, President Franklin D. Roosevelt secured Congressional approval of a program of slum clearance and public housing construction in 1933, but it was not until the passage of the US Housing Act of 1937 that the United States joined the other major industrialized nations in the world in committing itself to a permanent public housing program for low-income households. Although a small handful of public housing developments were built in New York City in the 1930s and the war years, the NYCHA hit its stride in the 1950s when dozens of nearly identical high-rise brick apartment buildings were erected.</p>
<p>Bloom convincingly argues that unlike Chicago, Los Angeles and other major US cities, public housing in New York City was not a public policy failure. Among the reasons why public housing “worked” in New York City was that the city blazed its own trail and did not pursue the same course of action as other big cities. During the 1920s, it became clear that despite several decades of philanthropic ventures seeking to bring decent housing within the economic reach of wage earners, scores of families continued to live in old-law tenements and other dwellings that offered only slightly safer and healthier accommodations. In 1926, the New York State Assembly authorized New York City to offer tax incentives to limited dividend corporations that built affordable housing. The Assembly also passed enabling legislation to make it possible for cities to create public housing authorities and seek federal housing aid. New York City actively sought federal housing funds and at the same time, constructed a limited number of city and state-funded low- and middle-income public housing developments and administered a cooperative housing program for veterans. Although the city would later back away from middle-income public housing, the NYCHA had established a precedent of taking direct action and using state and local funds to address its own housing problems. Bloom concludes that a good measure of the NYCHA’s success in administering public housing came about because New York City leaders rejected the notion that the impetus for housing legislation had to come from Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Bloom maintains that the NYCHA also enjoyed greater managerial success than other public housing authorities because it took the job more seriously and borrowed procedures and standards from successful private firms that managed high-rise residential property. The NYCHA also took certain liberties with federal and state laws and court decisions regarding resident selection. Whereas many city housing authorities such as Chicago felt politically compelled to accept applications from a broad cross section of the city’s most impoverished families, the NYCHA held out for the cream of the city’s qualifying households. Up until roughly 1968 when the NYCHA began offering what Bloom calls “welfare-state public housing” it went to great lengths to keep the percentage of welfare recipients at a minimum and actively worked to keep buildings from being numerically dominated by those who were unemployed, had children out of wedlock, or had been in trouble with the law (p. 245). Funding for the NYCHA’s extensive building maintenance and upkeep programs was reduced by the passage of the Brooke Amendment of 1969 limiting public housing rents to one-quarter of the resident’s monthly income.</p>
<p>The NYCHA returned to its historical mission of offering “affordable housing” in the 1990s when nationally demands were made for the dismantling of the welfare system (p. 245). Public housing began disappearing from America’s cities, in part a result of the federally funded Hope VI program originally started under President George H. W. Bush. New York City’s participation in the Hope VI program has, however, been “nominal” (p. 267). At the time of the book’s publication, the NYCHA was considering using Hope VI funds to improve, not raze, the isolated public housing towers in the Rockaway section of Queens. Bloom concludes his study with an expression of optimism that New Yorkers and Americans at large realize the importance of state involvement in affordable housing so that the NYCHA would survive to mark its centennial in 2034.</p>
<p>New Yorkers of limited economic means welcomed the opportunity to live in public housing. They knew from personal experience or stories from relatives and friends what life was like when the streets of the Lower East Side were lined with four- and five-story tenements used for manufacturing, commerce, and domestic life. A December 1864 study found that 495,592 of the city’s 813,669 residents lived in 15,309 tenement houses with an average of 7 1/6 families in each. The tenth ward of the Lower East Side which included the block containing 97 Orchard Street, had 240,000 inhabitants per square mile, a figure that exceeded the most crowded sections of East London, England (p. 17).</p>
<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, the NYCHA concentrated public housing on the Lower East Side. The non-descript brick towers that line Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, including the Governor Al Smith Homes, continue to offer small, but affordable apartments in close proximity to potential employers, public transportation, and other services. The “old law” tenement has thankfully become a museum piece. As the National Public Housing Museum takes shape in the only remaining building of the Jane Addams Houses, a prewar public housing development in Chicago the question is now whether the United States will allow the entire low-income public housing program to go the same route.</p>
