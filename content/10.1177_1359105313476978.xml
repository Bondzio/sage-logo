<abstract>
<p>Health psychology has the potential to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the concept, processes, and outcomes of health literacy. Three areas for discussion are presented here: (1) health literacy as a multimodal concept; (2) the role of the health-care system, the professional, and tools of the trade; and (3) the relevance of social context, participation, and empowerment. The three levels of health literacy proposed by Nutbeam are mapped onto the four evolving approaches in health psychology proposed by Marks to explore the synergy between these research areas. It is hoped that this <italic>Special Section on Health Literacy</italic> will generate more discussion and activity among health psychologists into health literacy research and practice.</p>

<body>
<p>Health literacy as a concept has evolved over the years. While early conceptualizations focused on functional literacy skills (i.e. ability to read, write, and count), current discussions have emphasized its multidimensional aspect to encompass a broader range of skills, including the ability to communicate effectively, appraise information critically, and engage actively in society to increase control over the wider determinants of health. Research on health literacy is flourishing, with over 5000 PubMed-listed articles to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105313476978">Sorensen et al., 2012</xref>), while 5 years ago the total was only 1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105313476978">Rudd, 2007</xref>). The field has a wealth of evidence that brings the intricate link between health literacy and health outcomes to the fore. Significant relationships between low health literacy skills and poor health-related knowledge and outcomes have been widely reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105313476978">DeWalt et al., 2004</xref>). Low health literacy has been consistently associated with higher hospitalization rates, greater use of emergency care, and lower use of screening and vaccination services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105313476978">Berkman et al., 2011</xref>). By limiting people’s ability to correctly identify medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105313476978">Kripalani et al., 2006</xref>), interpret prescription warning labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105313476978">Davis et al., 2006</xref>), or make sense of health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105313476978">Pignone and DeWalt, 2006</xref>), inadequate levels of health literacy can have detrimental consequences to treatment adherence and self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105313476978">Easton et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105313476978">Nutbeam (2008)</xref> pointed out that health literacy can be conceptualized in two ways: (1) as a clinical “risk” or (2) as a personal “asset.” As a clinical “risk,” health literacy is seen as something that needs to be managed in clinical care. This is done in order to minimize the negative consequences of inadequate levels of health literacy on patients. In contrast, health literacy can also be conceptualized as a personal “asset” that highlights the development of individual and collective competencies to enable people to take control over the determinants of health. This perspective is geared more toward personal and collective empowerment rather than clinical treatment.</p>
<p>This <italic>Special Section on Health Literacy</italic> draws upon these two perspectives. It recognizes that poor health literacy needs to be addressed in order to improve individual patient outcomes. To address this risk, medical and public health professionals must become aware of this barrier, pursue research to understand it better, devise interventions to overcome it, and test those interventions. It also recognizes that developing and investing in health literacy could enable individuals and communities to develop and implement more equitable and sustainable actions to improve health. To build this asset, medical and public health professionals must form a partnership with the individuals and communities they serve to build the capacity of both providers and consumers of health services. Health psychology has a role to play in both addressing risks and building assets. Contributions for this special section take the discussion on health literacy in three overlapping directions: (1) health literacy as a multimodal concept; (2) the role of the health-care system, the professional, and tools of the trade; and (3) the relevance of social context, participation, and empowerment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105313476978">
<title>Health literacy as a multimodal concept</title>
<p>The evolution of the concept of health literacy is reflective of the three levels of health literacy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105313476978">Nutbeam (2000)</xref>, that is, functional, interactive, and critical. Functional health literacy refers to the basic reading and writing skills that can help individuals to function effectively in the health-care context; interactive health literacy refers to the development of personal skills that enable individuals to act upon the advice received, and critical health literacy refers to people’s ability to appraise information critically and to use it appropriately. All three levels of health literacy are needed in order to maximize a person’s ability to participate effectively in health care. Smith, Nutbeam, and McCaffery’s article entitled, “Insights into the concept and measurement of health literacy from a study of shared decision making in a low literacy population” (this section), supports this argument. Drawing upon a series of studies that aimed to develop and evaluate a bowel screening decision aid for people with low literacy, the authors show how all levels of health literacy are required to enable patients to participate fully in decision making. For example, the authors argue that patients need to have the basic reading ability to decode and make sense of information. In order to engage effectively in decision making, patients also need higher order processes that involve tasks such as retaining, extracting, and assimilating information. Patients also need to have the ability to analyze the information critically and to use it in practice. In this article, the authors present tools that distinguish among and measure higher-level health literacy skills. In addition, they highlight the need for further research on health literacy and greater sophistication in both the definition and measurement of this concept.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105313476978">Zarcadoolas et al. (2005)</xref> proposed a multidimensional framework for understanding health literacy, which organized the concept into four central domains, that is, fundamental literacy, scientific literacy, civic literacy, and cultural literacy. Gillis, Gray, and Murphy (this section) explore the extent to which practitioners’ accounts of breastfeeding promotion practice in Canada reflect the multiple domains of health literacy described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105313476978">Zarcadoolas et al. (2005)</xref>. Their findings show that practitioners attribute the concept of health literacy to the skills of both the health-care provider delivering the information and its intended recipients. The authors map the multiple domains of health literacy onto the practitioners’ responses and highlight the importance of recognizing the dynamic nature of this concept. Although building capacity for health literacy is not identified as a conscious focus of practice, the authors suggest that practitioners need to actively reflect upon notions of health literacy and how it impacts their interactions with service users.</p>

<sec id="section2-1359105313476978">
<title>The health-care system, the professional, and tools of the trade</title>
<p>Recent discussions on health literacy also highlight the nature of the health-care system, the role of the professional delivering the service, and the tools used in the health-care context to disseminate information to patients. Health literacy is not the sole responsibility of the patient. It is also important to consider the suitability of the materials used in health care, the difficulty of the tasks required of patients, the professionals’ ability to communicate effectively to patients, and the overall complexity of the health-care system. These factors need to match patients’ needs and skills in order for them to participate effectively in health care. Rima Rudd’s editorial, “Needed Action in Health Literacy” (this section), calls for health literacy research to provide more insight into how health-care systems could be simplified. It also highlights the importance of making health information more accessible and improving interactions between health-care professionals and service users. She argues that previous research on health literacy focused on individual patients’ skills, while neglecting the role of health-care context, the information materials used by health-care professionals, and the proficiencies of the health-care professionals themselves. Rudd’s editorial emphasizes the importance of recognizing the complexity of health-care systems and how they impact the experiences of patients.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105313476978">Doyle, Doherty, Morgan, McBride, and Hickey’s (2013)</xref> article, “Understanding communication of health information: a lesson in health literacy for junior medical and physiotherapy students” (published in an earlier issue), recognizes how important it is to ensure that patients are receiving optimal health information. Good quality patient information leaflets (PILs) can be used as tools by health-care professionals to communicate more effectively with their patients. In this article, the authors examine medical and physiotherapy students’ ability to assess the readability, psychological content, and quality of smoking PILs. As shown in this study, although the materials’ readability was generally adequate, the quality of the content of these materials could be improved. Findings suggest that adding more theory-based content (e.g. use of psychological theories in smoking cessation) will not have detrimental consequences on the materials’ readability. In addition, this study also highlights the importance of engaging future users of PILs in critically evaluating the materials to identify how these could be improved to support more effective exchanges with patients.</p>
<p>Apart from the materials used in health care, it is also vital that health literacy researchers take into consideration the materials used when collecting health literacy data, including the mode of administration. As reflected in Wallace, Chisolm, Abdel-Rasoul and DeVoe and Miser’s article, “Survey Mode Matters: Adults’ self-reported statistical confidence, ability to obtain health information, and perceptions of patient-healthcare provider communication” (this section), the survey mode used to collect health literacy data can also influence participants’ responses to survey items. In this study, the authors examined several health literacy-related variables using two modes of delivery: (1) random digital dial (RDD) and (2) mail. The findings show that participants responded more favorably when RDD was used than when mail was used. This article suggests that participants’ health literacy skills could have influenced the responses since completing the survey through the mail requires reading, while responding to the RDD survey does not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359105313476978">
<title>Social context, participation, and empowerment</title>
<p>Future research and activities on health literacy also need to consider the relevance of social context in determining engagement and participation of individuals in health care. Socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors could have an impact on people’s ability and willingness to participate actively in health-related programs. Protheroe, Brooks, Chew-Graham, Gardner, and Rogers’ article, “Permission to participate? A study of participation in patients from differing socio-economic backgrounds” (this section), highlights the relevance of sociocultural contexts in people’s ability to engage with information. This qualitative study explores the perceptions of participation of people from different levels of socioeconomic status. This research supports previous studies that reflect socioeconomic differentials in health literacy, that is, those from lower socioeconomic areas tend to have lower levels of health literacy. However, this study makes the case that these outcomes are compounded by prior expectations and social positions, which are formulated in the sociocultural context. The authors highlight the need to recognize people’s “ability to participate” when attempting to engage them in health improvement. For example, to participate actively in health care, people need to have the ability to ask questions and challenge or seek alternative information. They also need to be in a social position that will enable them to engage in such activities. Thus, programs that aim to improve health literacy may not be sufficient if broader sociocultural contexts are not recognized.</p>
<p>The need to recognize the impact of sociocultural contexts on health literacy is further explored in Estacio’s article, “Health literacy and community empowerment: It is more than just reading, writing and counting” (this section). This article presents an example of a community-based project that adopts an empowerment education model in health literacy. Based within a small indigenous community in the Philippines, this study highlights how health can be conceptualized within people’s socioeconomic and political environments. Although developing individual health literacy skills is important, this article asserts that unbalanced power relations and unfair structures that impact on people’s health and quality of life need to be taken into consideration when designing and implementing health improvement activities. Furthermore, literacy programs that aim to promote health by developing community capabilities need to understand how health is being conceptualized by the local community to ensure that such activities are culturally and socially appropriate.</p>
<p>Participatory action research is one way to engage community members in understanding and developing competencies in health literacy. Scheib and Brinton Lykes’ article, “Documenting community-based healthcare in post-disaster context: African-American and Latina women engage PhotoPAR” (this section) presents an example of a participatory action and photo elicitation research project conducted by community health workers in post-Katrina New Orleans. It draws upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105313476978">Nutbeam’s (2000)</xref> concept of “critical health literacy” to clarify how participants enhanced their abilities to critically analyze information through increased self-awareness and other awareness. In this study, African-American and Latina women community workers developed critical literacies by increasing self-knowledge and empathy. This enabled them to enhance their capacity to self-care and participate in actions that could address barriers to personal and community well-being. In the process, an exhibition was held to showcase the participants’ photos. Thus, facilitating PhotoPAR also provided a platform for this small group of women to share their experiences to a wider audience.</p>

<title>Using health psychology to understand and promote health literacy</title>
<p>Health psychology has demonstrated remarkable growth over the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105313476978">Murray, in press</xref>) and has been making significant contributions to our understanding of health-related behavior, health promotion, and disease prevention. Despite its potential, health psychology’s contribution to our understanding of the concept, processes, and outcomes of health literacy has been limited. To outline the potential contributions of health psychology to health literacy research and practice, the three levels of health literacy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105313476978">Nutbeam (2000)</xref> are mapped onto the four evolving approaches in health psychology proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105313476978">Marks (2002)</xref>, that is, clinical health psychology, public health psychology, community health psychology, and critical health psychology (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105313476978">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This <italic>Special Section on Health Literacy</italic> is a first step toward greater discussion and engagement among health psychologists in this research area. With its extensive theoretical and methodological foundations, health psychology has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the development and promotion of health literacy by working collaboratively with peers from other disciplines, such health promotion, health-care delivery, and management. If this special section is successful, then future issues will have articles that explore what health psychology has to offer in health literacy research and practice, as well as reports of studies that apply health psychology directly to health literacy interventions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105313476978">Table 1</xref> provides an initial framework for identifying possible actions and interventions that draw on the knowledge of health psychology.</p>
