<abstract>
<p>Sardinia acts as an ideal setting for multiple sclerosis (MS) studies because its prevalence of MS is one of the highest worldwide. Several pathogens have been investigated amongst 119 Sardinian MS patients and 117 healthy controls to determine whether they might have a role in triggering MS in genetically predisposed individuals. <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP) and Epstein Barr virus DNA were detected in 27.5% and 17.3%, respectively, of the MS patients. Moreover an extremely high humoral immune response against MAP recombinant protein MAP FprB (homologous to human myelin P0) was observed, whereas no significant results were found against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> FprA and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> HP986 protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) aetiology remains unknown, though several data suggest that MS is a multi-factorial disease caused by the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Our recent study proposes that <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> subsp. <italic>paratuberculosis</italic> (MAP) infection could be a risk factor for MS in Sardinian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433430">1</xref></sup> Sardinians have a genetically isolated background characterized by a unique high-rate incidence of several autoimmune disorders, particularly type 1 diabetes (T1D) and MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511433430">2</xref></sup> Taken together, this particular genetic makeup of Sardinians and the wide presence of a potentially infective microorganism such as MAP could act synergistically in predisposing the population to develop MS. In this study, we searched for the presence of the MAP specific insertion element IS900 DNA in the blood of MS patients. Furthermore, we identified, cloned and purified a MAP protein (MAP FprB) homologous to human myelin P zero (P0) (NP_000521.2) to search for antibodies in the blood of MS patients which may cross-react with the host protein.</p>
<p>Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has been recently associated to MS predisposition. EBV expresses proteins which may mimic MS autoantigens, leading to the production of autoantibodies, which in turn may cause self aggression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511433430">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contradictory conclusions were reported for <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (Hp);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511433430">4</xref></sup> to clarify whether it plays a role in Sardinian populations, this pathogen was also included in the study.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>In this study, 119 MS patients and 117 matched healthy controls were collected as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433430">1</xref></sup> according to the 2010 Revised McDonald criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511433430">5</xref></sup> Eighty were female and 39 were male with a F/M ratio of 2/1. The mean age at the inclusion was 41 (SD ± 11.8) years; the mean age at onset was 31 (SD ± 9.8) years and the duration of the disease was 10 (SD ± 9.8) years. The clinical course was relapsing–remitting in the majority (80.5%) whereas it was progressive in the remaining group (12.2% secondary progressive and 7.3% primary progressive). The neurological disability evaluated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was a mean of 2 (SD ± 2) and ranged from 0 to 6.5. Healthy controls were ethnically all Sardinians from at least three generations and demographically (sex and age) matched; in particular were considered people whose relationship to patients was as friends or spouses, but who were not blood relatives. All samples were evaluated blindly.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>FprB antibodies were searched in a total number of 119 MS patients and 117 healthy controls (HCs). We report the results as two groups: group one (50 MS patients, 56 HCs), which in our previous paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433430">1</xref></sup> was found to be positive for MAP2694 protein, and group two (69 MS patients, 61 HCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511433430">Figure 1</xref>). Concerning the first group, strong ELISA values were obtained in 42% of MS patients and in only 4% of HCs (chi squared=20.754; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511433430">Figure 1(a)</xref>) whereas in the second group strong ELISA titres were observed in 25% of MS patients and 5% of HCs (chi squared=8.216; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511433430">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Considering the two groups together the percentages reported for MAP FprB reactivity were 31% for MS patients and 6% for the HCs (chi squared=22.895; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; odds ratio [OR]=7.1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511433430">Table 1</xref>). The association was extremely significant statistically. On the other hand both <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) FprA and HP986 recombinant antigens showed no differences between MS patients and controls after ELISA testing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The association of MAP with MS was previously reported by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511433430">1</xref></sup> This study was undertaken to evaluate a larger number of MS patients and controls and at the same time to evaluate the potential antigenic properties of a novel identified MAP FprB protein which shares homology with host protein myelin P0. An association was reported of MS in subjects affected with hereditary neuropathies due to mutations in the P0 gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511433430">7</xref></sup> Interestingly, P0 is homologous to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a protein of the central nervous system (CNS), which is a minor component of myelin sheath. MOG is a CNS-specific autoantigen responsible for primary demyelination in multiple sclerosis as well as myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP).</p>
<p>The existence of silent MS, an autoimmune process that operates in the pre-disease stage, has been proven.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511433430">8</xref></sup> During this latent phase, an abnormal immunological phenomenon occurs, which is associated with epitope spreading related to various environmental and genetic factors in a time dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>MAP could be one environmental factor responsible for the activation of this apoptotic process during the early youth of the genetically predisposed subjects. We searched also for the presence of other infectious factors recently reported in the literature, such as EBV, which seem to be involved in CNS axon demyelization. Our data confirm the association and this may imply that more than one environmental factor is necessary to trigger the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals.</p>
<p>MAP may be acquired early in life through milk ingestion and its colonization site is the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The GIT and CNS are strictly bi-directionally connected through immune mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511433430">9</xref></sup> MAP persistence in the gut might cause the spreading of inflammatory epitopes and cell mediators responsible in turns for initiating inflammation in the brain. Inflammation is due to the massive infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Th17 cells. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) process and expose MAP’s epitopes on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II activating T cells in the gut. The spreading of pro-inflammatory mediator drive the immune response towards a Th1/Th17 phenotype. These cells may reach the CNS by the bloodstream penetrating the blood–brain barrier and create a milieu of Th1/Th17-type cytokines involved in the pathogenesis and apoptosis of neuronal cells in MS.</p>
