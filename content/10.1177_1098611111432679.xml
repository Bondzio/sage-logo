<abstract>
<p>Policing research has generally focused on easily measured outcome factors such as response time, force usage, and arrest. Empirical studies examining outcomes important to public legitimacy, such as police responsiveness, are less prevalent in the literature. Using observational and interview data from two medium sized cities (Indianapolis, Indiana, and St. Petersburg, Florida), the present inquiry examines how officers respond to noncoercive citizen requests for service during encounters, and the impact that situational and officer characteristics have on their willingness to comply with requests. Results indicate that officers comply with a majority of citizen requests, and even when they do not comply they often provide an explanation why. Encounters involving respectful citizens, wealthier citizens, White officers, and St. Petersburg officers were all more likely to result in compliance, while officers were less likely to comply with requests from younger and older citizens. Moreover, encounters involving White citizens, a greater number of citizen bystanders, and officers with a higher level of education all reduced the likelihood that officers would provide an explanation for denying citizen requests. Policy implications and recommendations for future research and theoretical development are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Policing encompasses a wide variety of tasks, which makes quantifying officer performance a difficult task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111432679">Fyfe, 1993</xref>). Traditional measures of police work have often included response times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098611111432679">Spelman &amp; Brown, 1981</xref>), arrests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098611111432679">Smith &amp; Visher, 1981</xref>), and clearance rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098611111432679">Chaiken, Greenwood, &amp; Petersilia, 1996</xref>). Although these measures are important indicators, they are limited with respect to addressing the majority of time and services that police officers contribute during the course of their duties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098611111432679">Skolnick &amp; Fyfe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098611111432679">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Good policing is broader in scope than traditional performance measures indicate, and it is important to consider an officer’s response to needs expressed by citizens during the course of their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111432679">Fyfe, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on recent empirical examinations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski, Snipes, Parks, &amp; Maxwell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun, Payne, &amp; Wu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>), we examine situational and officer-based determinants of responsive service through officer compliance with noncoercive citizen requests during encounters (i.e., filing a report, acting on the citizen’s behalf with a government/official agency or private organization, providing physical assistance, and/or providing information on how to deal with a problem). More specifically, we examine whether varying types of situational factors (e.g., citizen sex, race, age, wealth, demeanor, and alcohol/drug use, proactivity, number of citizens/officers present at the scene, site) influence officer willingness to comply with requests, as well as whether certain types of officers (i.e., by sex, race, education, experience, assignment, and community policing orientation) are more or less likely to fulfill citizen requests.</p>
<p>We begin with a review of the literature that highlights the importance of examining service-related police behavior, followed by a review of those studies that have examined the relationship between situational and officer-based characteristics with service-related behaviors. We then highlight the current inquiry and methodology, followed by the analyses. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications and future research.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework and Literature Review</title>
<p>The police mandate underwent extensive change during much of the past century, initially with the development of the reform/professional era and more recently with the evolution of community policing. Professional model advocates placed a great deal of emphasis on response times, arrests, and clearance rates, which have become ingrained in policing practice and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098611111432679">Alpert &amp; Moore, 1993</xref>). However, these traditional measures may lack a rich use for those police administrators interested in nontraditional or “softer” outcome measures, such as those outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111432679">Guyot (1991</xref>) in <italic>Policing as Though People Matter</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111432679">Mastrofski (1999)</xref> in <italic>Policing for People</italic>. Both authors emphasize the importance of the police providing “service” to citizens, which goes beyond a law enforcement or order maintenance function.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111432679">Guyot (1991</xref>) encourages the police to serve citizens as customers, and to value measures of police work that exhibit officer effort and attentiveness toward citizen concerns. Although crime related or emergency calls should take priority over calls for nonemergency assistance, officers should not forgo an opportunity to interact with and assist a citizen to go in-service and carry out a simple patrol function. Police practices that “pull officers away from work so that they can resume looking for and waiting for work” are misguided according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111432679">Guyot (1991</xref>, p. 58).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111432679">Mastrofski (1999)</xref> tends to agree that police activity is often judged by the public not through traditional measures of effectiveness, but through such behavior as an officer’s ability to demonstrate responsiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1098611111432679">1</xref></sup> He argues that police officers should be responsive to citizen needs, such as those expressed in the form of a direct request for some form of service. Officers should provide a good-faith effort to fulfill specific citizen requests during encounters with the police when possible; and when fulfilling a citizen request is not warranted (or possible) officers should offer an explanation for why the request will not be fulfilled. In other words, policing should go beyond the rules outlined by bureaucracy and a strict adherence to the crime control mandate. Essentially, citizens expect the police to arrive in a timely fashion, know the proper way to address a problem, provide service, be polite, and act in a fair manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098611111432679">Maguire &amp; Uchida, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, although a substantial amount of research has examined traditional police outcome measures (e.g., arrest, and use of force) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098611111432679">Bayley &amp; Garofalo, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111432679">Brown &amp; Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098611111432679">Finckenauer, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611111432679">Paoline &amp; Terrill, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098611111432679">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098611111432679">Worden, 1995</xref>), fewer studies have focused on service-related behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111432679">National Research Council, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611111432679">Riksheim &amp; Chermak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111432679">Sherman, 1980</xref>). Nonetheless, there is a small but growing body of research emerging that offers promising insight within this area. More specifically, several fairly recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>) have looked at a number of service type behaviors by relying on a variety of different approaches.</p>
<p>Using data from the Project on Policing Neighborhoods (POPN), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref> examined officer compliance with citizen requests to control other citizens. In particular, they examined the extent to which various situational and officer-based measures predicted officer compliance with citizen requests to: advise or persuade, warn or threaten, force someone to leave the scene, or arrest another citizen. While the authors found that legal and situational determinants (e.g., evidence of crime, victim request for arrest, demeanor and intoxication) were the strongest predictors of compliance, numerous officer-based factors were also significant. For instance, they found that female and more experienced officers were less likely to comply with citizen requests to control other citizens at the scene. In addition, officers with a proclivity toward community policing were more inclined to fulfill citizen requests.</p>
<p>Sun and colleagues also drew on POPN data to examine service-related police behavior in a variety of ways. In 2003, Sun compared field training officers (FTOs) with nontraining officers with respect to how they handled interpersonal disputes via several outcome measures that included control and aggressiveness scales, as well as one labeled “supportive” actions (i.e., counsel, concern, and courtesy).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098611111432679">2</xref></sup> Besides FTO status, he found that many of the control factors influenced police supportive actions. Officers were more likely to engage in supportive behaviors when interacting with citizens who were female, citizens acting irrational, citizens in conflict with another citizen identified as an “intimate,” and when there was greater evidence of wrongdoing. Conversely, officers were less likely to engage in supportive behaviors when interacting with citizens who were poor, citizens who displayed disrespect, as well as citizens identified as suspects, disputants, witnesses, and third parties (as opposed to victims). In addition, officers were less likely to offer supportive actions when other officers were present, and when the encounter occurred in a high distress patrol beat.</p>
<p>Research on supportive actions was enhanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref>, who revisited police responses to interpersonal conflict, with a primary focus on the role of officer race. Three models were estimated on coercive (i.e., advise, command, verbal threat, investigation, physical restraint, and arrest) and supportive actions (i.e., direct to sign a formal complaint, use the legal process, seek help of other agencies, seek help from family/friends, call the police if the problem reoccurs, officers provide physical assistance, information, or comfort on own initiative, officers are respectful) using situational and officer determinants, as well as interaction terms. Situational characteristics were the best predictors, with supportive behaviors more likely for citizens who were female, not poor, not suspects, respectful, irrational, and who had evidence against them. In addition, officers were more likely to provide support when the citizen did not live in a more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood. With regard to officer characteristics, more educated officers (e.g., those with a college degree or higher) were more likely to engage in supportive actions. Consideration of interaction terms found that Black officers were more likely to engage in supportive activities than White officers when encountering citizens in Black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A more recent study, conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> examined officer differences with respect to coercive (arrest, interrogation, search, threaten to use force, restraint, use of handcuff, pain compliance, incapacitation methods, and draw/discharge weapon) and noncoercive behaviors (providing physical assistance and information on officers’ own initiative, providing physical assistance and information requested by citizens, filing an incident report, acting on citizens’ behalf, advising citizens to sign complaint, to use legal process, to seek help of other agencies, to seek help of family or friends, to help another). In relation to situational characteristics, they found that officers were less likely to engage in noncoercive behaviors when dealing with male citizens, those citizens classified as poor, and citizens behaving in a hostile fashion (e.g., disrespectful). Conversely, officers were more likely to respond with noncoercive actions when dealing with older citizens and those acting irrationally. In terms of officer characteristics, only officer assignment had a significant impact on noncoercive behaviors when controlling for other potential influences. Surprisingly, community policing officers were less likely to engage in noncoercive activities than were their patrol counterparts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref> also looked at police service within the context of controlling and “supportive behaviors,” and included several of the outcome actions used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and colleagues (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">2008</xref>), such as signing a formal complaint or using the legal process to solve a problem, offering comfort, and providing information/assistance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp 2008</xref>, p. 428 for further specification). Although her primary interest involved potential gender differences (finding that female officers were less likely to offer supportive actions to citizens), a host of situational and officer-based variables were examined. She found that officers were more likely to engage in supportive behaviors when they expected violence, when an encounter was initiated by a citizen (as opposed to an officer), when interacting with female citizens, young and old citizens (as opposed to “middle aged”), as well as injured citizens. More experienced officers were also more likely to offer supportive actions. Conversely, officers were less likely to engage in supportive behaviors when dealing with resistant citizens. In addition, minority officers were less likely to offer supportive actions to citizens.</p>

<title>Current Inquiry</title>
<p>Although the emerging research on officer responsiveness adds greatly to the small body of work involving service-related policing behavior, prior research has not explicitly examined officer responsiveness to citizen requests for noncoercive actions. Although controlling citizens is an integral portion of police work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611111432679">Bittner, 1970</xref>), differences in the rate at which officers use coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098611111432679">Worden, 1995</xref>) may affect the rates at which they comply with requests that require police action of a coercive nature. Moreover, prior work on noncoercive actions, or what has been referred to as “supportive actions,” does not explicitly distinguish between officer initiated behavior and citizen requests,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1098611111432679">3</xref></sup> a key test of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111432679">Mastrofski’s (1999)</xref> responsiveness element as a characteristic of quality policing. Although measuring productivity in noncoercive encounters remains important, focusing on direct requests offers a representation of the quality of police responses where citizens express a need.</p>
<p>Prior research is also limited with respect to looking beyond simple compliance with requests for service. Responsiveness can be accomplished by officers in situations where they cannot or will not comply with a request, if they provide a reason for the refusal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111432679">Mastrofski (1999</xref>, p. 2) indicates that officers “can be responsive even when they deny a citizen’s request by explaining the denial.” Thus, measuring and assessing responsiveness is broader than just simply complying or not complying with requests.</p>
<p>The current study examines three primary research questions: (a) What is the frequency with which citizens request service during encounters with the police? (b) How often do the police fulfill citizen requests for service? (c) What situational and officer-based characteristics predict officer responsiveness to citizen requests for service? Following this, we examine those cases where officers do not comply with citizen requests by asking a fourth research question: (d) How often and what factors predict officer willingness to provide an explanation for refusing to comply with a citizen request for service?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1098611111432679">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1098611111432679" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The present analyses draw on two data sources from the POPN: systematic observation of patrol officers and in-person interviews.</p> <p>Patrol observation was conducted by trained observers throughout 24 beats (240 hours of observation per beat) in Indianapolis and St. Petersburg using Systematic Social Observation (SSO) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. 1998</xref> for a detailed description of SSO methodology). Field researchers accompanied officers during all encounters with the public during the shift. An encounter was a face-to-face communication between officers and citizens that was more than a passing greeting. The observer’s function was to document what happened during the observation session and to note how the officer interpreted situations he or she encountered. The day following a ride, observers transcribed their notes into detailed narrative accounts and coded them according to a predefined protocol into a CODIT datafile. In total, POPN observers recorded contact with approximately 12,000 citizens, with events ranging from less than a minute to several hours. In addition to the observational data, we also draw on in-person interviews conducted by POPN researchers, which documented officer characteristics (e.g. race, education, experience) as well as community policing training and views (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. 2000</xref> for a detailed description of POPN methodology).</p>
<sec id="section5-1098611111432679">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The outcome measures involving officer responsiveness to citizen requests during encounters with citizens were drawn from four specific questions captured by POPN observers: (a) Did the citizen ask police for information on how to deal with a problem? (b) Did the citizen ask police for physical assistance for self or others? (c) Did the citizen ask the police to file a report? (d) Did the citizen ask police to act on the citizen’s behalf with a government official/agency, or private organization?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1098611111432679">5</xref></sup> We use both a dichotomous outcome measure (1 = <italic>officer fully complied</italic> and 0 = <italic>officer did not fully comply</italic>), as well as an ordinal measure of compliance (2 = <italic>officer fully complied</italic>, 1 = <italic>officer promised to comply or partially complied</italic>, and 0 = <italic>officer did not comply</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1098611111432679">6</xref></sup> In addition, to answer our final research question involving whether an officer provided an explanation when denying citizen requests, we use a third outcome measured dichotomously (1 = <italic>officer provided an explanation for denying request</italic> and 0 = <italic>officer did not provide an explanation for denying request</italic>). Considering the conceptual framework of this study (i.e., compliance with service-related requests) the present analysis includes citizens identified by POPN observers as victims, disputants, helpless persons, third parties, and witnesses (e.g., those citizens identified in roles where one would reasonably expect police responsiveness in the format examined here).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1098611111432679">7</xref></sup> Using this selection criteria there were 1,041 police–citizen encounters where citizens requested one or more of the above four actions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1098611111432679">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As previously noted, the bulk of literature concerning the impact of situational and officer-based characteristics on police behavior is based on coercive types of action (e.g., arrests, use of force; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098611111432679">Cohen &amp; Chaiken, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098611111432679">Friedrich, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098611111432679">Smith &amp; Klein, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098611111432679">Terrill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098611111432679">Worden, 1995</xref>). Fortunately, more recent research has begun to focus directly on service-related outcomes. As such, we draw on this prior work to help guide the models offered below. More specifically, we include ten situational and six officer-based measures due to their stated relevance in previous studies involving officer responsive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>).

<p>Several situational measures provide fairly clear directional hypotheses. For example, studies have found a consistent gender effect as officers sympathize less with the needs of male citizens compared with females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). Citizen wealth has also shown fairly consistent direction, with those of higher wealth obtaining more favorable outcomes from police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). Those of lower economic standing may appear to be less respectable and deserving of police action, and officers may be less likely to comply with requests from undesirable citizens with whom they have trouble identifying. Research on citizen demeanor has also received substantial consistency in predicting police service behaviors, with disrespectful citizens generally having more negative interactions with police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref>, citizen sobriety is predicted to increase the likelihood of compliance, as police may be less tolerant or willing to assist a citizen who is in need through circumstances viewed as the citizen’s own making. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun (2003)</xref> found that those acting “irrationally” were more likely to receive supportive actions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1098611111432679">9</xref></sup> but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref> did not find an effect. Citizen age (young/old—those less than 13 years or greater than 59 years) is predicted to have a positive impact on the likelihood that officers comply with requests for service. Although some research has pointed toward null findings for age (Mastrofski, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>), other research has indicated that officers may be more attentive to young or old citizens due to an increased perception of need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also support for a directional hypothesis involving site. We posit that encounters occurring in St. Petersburg will be more likely to result in officer compliance compared with Indianapolis given the style of policing promoted within these two organizations. St. Petersburg emphasized a community partnership approach whereas Indianapolis emphasized a more aggressive “broken windows” approach. Use of departmental directives as an indicator of officer behavior has been supported by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several of the hypothesized effects depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098611111432679">Table 1</xref> for situational variables are multidirectional. Citizen race has generally been shown to have a null relationship to officer service behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). However, given the historical marginality of minority citizens, it could be argued that they will receive more negative treatment from the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098611111432679">Fyfe, 1988</xref>). Conversely, minority citizens may also appear to be in greater need of services, prompting more positive attention in noncoercive encounters.</p>
<p>Other situational variables have multidirectional hypotheses as well. Officer proactivity has been under researched with respect to the provision of assistance, with recent literature pointing toward citizen initiated encounters producing more supportive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>). However, citizens who summon police to encounters may be more likely to be victims or witnesses rather than suspects. In terms of the number of officers present at the scene, an increased officer presence may result in service refusals, as officers do not want to appear “soft” in front of colleagues. Alternatively, officers may behave more favorably if others are around who may be able to hold them accountable. Recent research has not shown a consistent effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the number of citizens present also does not provide a clear direction. Officers may be uncomfortable in a large crowd prompting them to exit rather than spend the time to fulfill a request or provide an explanation. However, other explanations may also hold merit, such as officers being held accountable to citizens when many witnesses are present.</p>
<p>Officer-based variables show primarily multidirectional hypotheses, as results of previous research have been fairly inconsistent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> found no gender effect, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref> found that female officers were less likely to engage in supportive actions. Nonetheless, empirical research has shown female officers having more positive attitudes toward assisting citizens (however, this has not translated into behavioral differences; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098611111432679">DeJong, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on officer race also yields hypotheses that could indicate increased or reduced responsiveness. Non-White officers have been shown to have more supportive views of community policing in some departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611111432679">Paoline, Meyers, &amp; Worden, 2000</xref>), but historically research does not strongly support a relationship between officer race and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111432679">National Research Council, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611111432679">Riksheim &amp; Chermak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111432679">Sherman, 1980</xref>). Recent research on officer behavior has also demonstrated mixed findings as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). With respect to coercive behavior (e.g., arrest), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111432679">Brown and Frank (2006)</xref> found that Black officers considered more contextual factors, and were more likely to arrest minority citizens. This lends credence to the image of Black officers as conflicted, trying not to show favoritism toward minority citizens in front of their colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111432679">Brown &amp; Frank, 2006</xref>), and having a greater understanding of life in predominantly Black neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Officer education and experience have been examined to a lesser extent, although these variables have received more attention recently within the policing literature. Although some anticipate that a disparity between well-educated officers and a poorly educated public may result in disconnect that would make more educated officers less likely to comply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>), others believe that a college education improves police work by sensitizing officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098611111432679">Paoline &amp; Terrill, 2007</xref>). Officer experience also provides mixed empirical support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref> found that older officers were less likely to comply with citizen requests to control compared with younger officers, either out of cynicism or wisdom. This has been countered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref>, who indicates that more experienced officers provide support at a slightly higher rate, which may be related to knowledge about the community and an ability to direct citizens to service agencies.</p>
<p>Finally, officers in the POPN study also varied in their assignments, with some engaged in traditional 911 patrol and others in community policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098611111432679">Parks, Mastrofski, DeJong, &amp; Gray, 1999</xref>). Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> found that community policing officers were less likely to provide noncoercive actions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref> found community policing officers were no more or less likely to comply with coercive requests than patrol officers. Beyond departmental assignment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref> also found that an officer’s proclivity toward community policing, measured as an interaction between the amount of community policing training an officer receives and her or his willingness to handle disputes, nuisances, and minor disorders, increases the odds of responsive compliance with citizen requests to control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1098611111432679">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>We begin by examining how often citizens requested service during encounters with the police, as well as the extent to which officers fulfilled such requests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1098611111432679">11</xref></sup> As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1098611111432679">Table 3</xref>, citizens made 1,222 requests across 1,041 police–citizen officers. Of these, officers fully complied 63.3 percent of the time. Citizens were more likely to request that officers provide information than any other service-related request, followed by requests that an officer file a report, provide physical help for the requester or another citizen, and that an officer act on their behalf with an official or agency. Officers were most likely to fully comply with requests for information (79.4%), followed by requests for physical help (65.2%), requests that an officer act with an agency (58.5%), and requests that the officer file a report (40.5%).</p>

<p>Next, we examined the potential relationship between situational/officer characteristics and police responsiveness by using a series of multivariate models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1098611111432679">12</xref></sup> First, we estimated a binary logistic regression model where the dependent variable is captured dichotomously (i.e., officer fully complied with a service request, officer did not fully comply). Second, we estimated an ordinal logit model where the dependent variable is captured categorically with ranking (i.e., officer fully complied with a service request, promised/partially complied, did not comply).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1098611111432679">13</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1098611111432679">Table 4</xref> displays the binary logistic regression results. As shown, the model is significantly better at predicting officer compliance with citizen requests than a model containing only the intercept (χ<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098611111432679">2</xref></sup> = 51.133, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Two of the situational factors are statistically significant. Citizens demonstrating a respectful demeanor toward officers were more likely to have their requests for service granted. In fact, this variable shows the strongest influence, with officers being nearly three times more likely (as evidenced by the odds ratio) to fulfill requests when the citizen was acting in a respectful manner. We also find that St. Petersburg officers were more likely to fulfill citizen requests for service compared with Indianapolis officers. This is not surprising given St. Peterburg’s community partnership approach compared with Indianapolis’s more aggressive “broken windows” model. Finally, only one officer-based measure was statistically significant. White officers were significantly more likely to comply with citizen requests for service than non-White officers.</p>

<p>Our final research questions asks: how often and what characteristics predict officer willingness to provide an explanation for refusing to comply with a citizen request for service? As indicated previously, responsiveness is more conceptually dynamic than simply indicating whether officers fulfill a request. Fortunately, observers coded whether an officer provided an explanation when not fulfilling a request.</p>
<p>We found that of the 127 police–citizen encounters where officers denied a citizen request, the officer offered an explanation in 96 (75.6%) of these cases. Thus, in three of every four denied requests the officer offered some sort of explanation for why the request was not fulfilled. Once again we use a logistic binary regression model given our outcome measure (0 = <italic>officer did not provide an explanation for refusing a request</italic> and 1 = <italic>officer did provide an explanation for refusing a request</italic>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1098611111432679">Table 6</xref> shows the descriptive statistics for this model and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1098611111432679">Table 7</xref> presents the multivariate results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1098611111432679">14</xref></sup> In terms of situational characteristics, citizen race and the number of citizens present on the scene demonstrate a relationship to an officer’s willingness to provide an explanation. White citizens were less likely to have an explanation provided (<italic>b</italic> = −2.232, <italic>p</italic> = .001), while the greater the number of citizens present at the scene the less likely an officer was to offer an explanation (<italic>b</italic> = −0.173, <italic>p</italic> = .017). Turning to the officer-based measures, only one variable was statistically significant: officer education (<italic>b</italic> = −1.670, <italic>p</italic> = .018). Officers with a 4-year degree or more were less likely to provide an explanation for denying a request.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Unlike some other forms of police behavior (e.g., problem solving, criminal investigation, interrogation techniques, etc.), it would not seem responsiveness requires a particular skill. Fulfilling a citizen’s request for a report, information, physical help, or acting on behalf of a citizen with another agency all seem within the abilities and duties of an officer. In the context of the present inquiry, we found that officers often comply with citizen service requests (63.3%), although one may also argue that a one-third noncompliance rate is too high. Furthermore, we found that officers frequently (75% of the time) provide citizens an explanation in instances when they decide not to fulfill a citizen’s request.</p>
<p>The present study also adds to a small, but growing body of research that seeks to examine the relationship between situational/officer-based factors and varying forms of service-related police behavior. In particular, there have been several contemporary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>) that incorporate service features. However, it is important to carefully consider how service has been measured across studies. Service as measured in the present study looks directly at individual officer responses to specific citizen requests for noncoercive actions. This form of service, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111432679">Mastrofski (1999)</xref> refers to as “responsiveness,” is a related but somewhat distinct feature of service from what others have examined in the form of “supportive actions.” Supportive actions have been more widely conceptualized to include behaviors such as offering varying forms of assistance, providing comfort, and offering reassurance, which may or may not be initiated on the officer’s own or at the request of the citizen. It is not that one particular approach is better or worse, but rather demonstrates the multidimensional nature of how service can be conceptualized and measured. Just as important, one has to consider such issues when interpreting results.</p>
<p>Turning to variable effects, we view our findings within the context of the four studies that most directly look at service and noncoercive type behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1098611111432679">15</xref></sup> Although we found no effect in terms of citizen gender, this measure shows a high rate of consistency across the other four studies in that officers were more likely to offer some type of service to female citizens as opposed to males. There appears to be several other factors that show a fairly high degree of consistency across studies. First, the role of citizen race appears to be marginal, as this variable was not significantly related to service behavior in the present inquiry nor generally in the other service studies reviewed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>). Second, we found that wealthier citizens and those displaying a respectful demeanor toward officers were more likely to receive responsive service. With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref>, each of the other studies reviewed found similar findings. Other factors show more contradictory results across studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> found officers to be more supportive if the citizen was older (e.g., senior), but age was not a significant factor in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun (2003)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref>. Complicating matters further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref> found that officers were more likely to offer supportive actions to younger/older citizens (as opposed to middle aged), whereas the present analyses show that officers are less likely to offer responsive service.</p>
<p>With respect to officer-based factors, officer gender offers the most consistency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref>, and the present inquiry all failed to identify a difference in the extent to which females and male officers provided service. The only study to find a gender difference was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref>, with females being significantly less likely to offer supportive actions (contrary to what was hypothesized). Less clarity is uncovered when looking at officer race. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref>, as well as the current study, both found that non-White officers were less likely to engage in service behavior (or White officers more likely). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref> found no race effect in their additive model of supportive actions, but consideration of interaction terms found that Black officers were more likely to engage in supportive activities than White officers when encountering citizens in primarily Black neighborhoods. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> officer race did not obtain statistical significance in preliminary models, and thus was excluded from their reported model.</p>
<p>Several other officer-based variables have produced limited effects and require additional research. For instance, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun and Payne (2004)</xref> found that higher education increased supportive actions, the present inquiry did not find an educational effect. Furthermore, three studies failed to uncover an experience level effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098611111432679">Sun &amp; Payne, 2004</xref>; and the present inquiry), but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111432679">Rabe-Hemp (2008)</xref> found that more experienced officers were more likely to offer supportive service. Finally, there is little evidence showing a community policing effect in terms of assignment to a community policing unit or proclivity toward community policing through training or attitudes.</p>
<p>Taken as a collective whole, several broader issues emerge. For instance, officers are generally more likely to respond to citizen requests when done so in a respectful manner by the citizen. In this sense, there appears to be a type of “human element” at work similar to research linking citizen demeanor to more coercive types of police actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111432679">National Research Council, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611111432679">Riksheim &amp; Chermak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111432679">Sherman, 1980</xref>). However, there is less evidence of other “connectedness” type measures (e.g., education, community policing assignment, training, views) influencing distinguishable service-related behavior. For example, neither education level, community policing assignment, nor community policing training/views appear to influence responsive service in most studies. When there is an effect, it is not always positive. For example, we found that more educated officers are less likely to offer an explanation when denying service requests for noncoercive actions.</p>
<p>Besides the need for additional studies examining service behavior (whether it be supportive actions, responsive actions, or other conceptualizations of service) and the factors that may influence such decision making, future research should attempt to tap into “why” officers choose to decline citizen requests (e.g., building on explanation). In terms of policy implications, the findings indicate that there may be a benefit to an organizational problem-solving community policing approach as opposed to an aggressive order maintenance model. St. Peterburg officers, who practiced the former, were more likely to comply with citizen service requests, compared with Indianapolis officers who practiced the latter. Conversely, we found no direct benefit to either community policing assignment or officer proclivity for community policing (as measured through training and officer’s attitudinal willingness to handle order maintenance problems). Perhaps providing service, in the form of responding to citizen requests, is less of a “community policing” expectation than a “policing” expectation in and of itself.</p>
<p>Overall, only one officer-based measure (i.e., race) predicted compliance, with White officers more likely to comply with requests. Why this is the case is unknown and future researchers are encouraged to further explore this issue. Besides race, the evidence indicates, for the most part, there are not certain “types” of officers that are more or less likely to offer responsive service. As such, recruiting certain types of officers by attribute would do little in way on increasing this desirable feature of policing. Rather, it would appear organizations should focus more on how officers handle the situational dynamics of the police–citizen encounter, which may increase public satisfaction and increase legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098611111432679">Reisig &amp; Parks, 2002</xref>). In fact, police organizations may gain greater credibility when officers fulfill citizen requests not when it is easy to do so (i.e., when the customer asks nicely), but when it is hard to do so (i.e., when the customer does not). Training protocols that attempt to illustrate the benefits of officer compliance during instances when it is hardest to do so may actually provide much greater “bang for the buck” so to speak. In the end, an officer’s ability to empathize or sympathize with citizens may improve officer responsiveness.</p>
<p>As with any study, the present inquiry comes with limitations, many of which have been documented by researchers using POPN data (e.g., reactivity, only two medium size departments, not representative of all patrol officers, cross sectional; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111432679">Paoline, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098611111432679">Spano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098611111432679">Terrill, 2001</xref>). Two additional limitations specific to this particular inquiry are also worth noting. First, POPN was designed to capture many aspects of police–citizen encounters. If the research was designed specifically to suit request endeavors, and service requests in particular, a wider array of requests could potentially be captured. Second, this research does not examine the target action for requests that were being made of officers. For example, officers were least likely to fulfill a request for filing a report. This may be due to a reluctance to engage in paperwork by the officer, or it may be due to differences in the importance individual officers attach to a particular problem. Some officers may see filing a report for a dog running loose in the neighborhood as a good use of their time and a community need, whereas others may view these problems as a low priority. In addition, citizens may feel more comfortable asking community policing officers or non-White officers for assistance in less serious occasions. Although legal factors such as evidence or crime seriousness can serve a proxy for the problem, and show the most influence in terms of impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al., 2000</xref>), the present inquiry does not have a measure of the importance tied to the requests made by a citizen for service.</p>

<p>Counsel involved police actions such as asking citizens to sign a formal compliant or use the legal process to solve a problem, concern involved the police comforting or reassuring citizens, and courtesy involved officers not disrespecting citizens (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun, 2003</xref>, p. 33 for more detail).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1098611111432679">
<label>3.</label>
<p>For example, the dependent measures used in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111432679">Sun et al. (2008)</xref> study include noncoercive service activities that officers engaged in through their own initiative (i.e., proactive service) rather than specific citizen requests. In addition, Sun and colleagues’ used a broad-based 13-item scale that included such items as advising citizens to sign complaints and seek outside help from others (e.g., family members or friends). Although this scale is an adequate measure of officer noncoercive productivity, greater refinement allows for an examination of officer responsiveness (i.e., restricting cases to those where a citizen makes a specific request).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1098611111432679">
<label>4.</label>
<p>It is important to note that we examine citizen requests for service during all types of encounters with the police, not just designated service-related encounters or calls.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1098611111432679">
<label>5.</label>
<p>For each question observers had six selection options: ignored request without acknowledging it, explicitly refused to comply without saying why, declined to comply and explained why, promised to comply at some future time, partially complied in citizen’s presence, and complied fully in citizen’s presence.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1098611111432679">
<label>6.</label>
<p>This decision was partially due to wanting to apply the same categories used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref>, but was also conceptual in nature. More specifically, it is difficult to ordinally rank partial and promised compliance. On the surface, an officer who at least partially complies with a citizen request may be considered greater compliance than a mere promise to do so at a future time. On the other hand, if an officer does in fact follow through on her or his promise then the compliance may actually be greater than partial compliance at the scene.</p>
</fn>

<p>As opposed to citizens identified by POPN observers as suspects, quasi police, nonpolice service providers, friends, and occupational acquaintances, which are not included in this analysis. Nonetheless, a reviewer suggested that we should still offer a statistical control for citizen role, for failure to do so would treat “a broad universe of citizens as equal in the eyes of officers with no expectation of differential responses.” We disagree that victims, disputants, helpless persons, third parties, and witnesses represent a “broad universe of citizens.” For the purposes of the current inquiry, we have little reason to believe that officers would be more/less likely to respond to witnesses differently than victims, nor third parties differently than helpless persons in relation to the four types of service requests examined here. Conversely, if we were to include suspects or friends of the officer we would be concerned with the potential for differential responses (e.g., officers being less likely to comply with suspect requests and more likely to comply with victim requests). In this case we would have a broad universe of citizens that would require a statistical control for citizen role.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1098611111432679">

<p>POPN observers completed two forms (and subsequently data files) as part of each police–citizen encounter that occurred. The first was an encounter form, which captured information such as the initiation source for the encounter (e.g., police or citizen), time and location of occurrence, whether the encounter involved a larger problem solving effort, etc. The second was a citizen form, which captured information on the specifics of each citizen (ranging from demographic to behavior indicators) and the interaction between each citizen and the observed officer. Thus, instances where officers interacted with multiple citizens resulted in multiple encounters at the citizen level.</p>

<p>Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098611111432679">Sun (2003)</xref> used a mixed measure of irrationality, which included substance use, as well as mental illness and emotional indicators.</p>

<p>Community policing proclivity is an interaction term created using data from the POPN interview questions. It is derived from an officer community policing training scale (1 = <italic>none</italic>, 2 = <italic>less than a day</italic>, 3 = <italic>1-2 days</italic>, 4 = <italic>3-5 days</italic>, and 5 = <italic>more than 5 days</italic>), and six questions asking officers about how often they should handle public nuisances, neighbor and family disputes, trash/litter, nuisance businesses, and parents who do not control their children as part of their role conception (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 2 = <italic>much of the time</italic>, and 3 = <italic>always</italic>). For a more detailed description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref>.</p>

<p>Officers were credited with their greatest degree of effort during an encounter (i.e., officers fully comply with one request and partially comply with another, within the same encounter, were credited with full compliance).</p>

<p>Collinearity tests were assessed with no problematic covariance uncovered. Most variables displayed a correlation between .02 and .16. The highest value was the correlation between the number of citizens present and the number of officers present at the encounter (.55). This value still falls well below the threshold of .70. In addition, no problematic variance inflation factors (VIF) were found. Again, the highest values occurred with the maximum number of citizens (1.47) and the maximum number of officers (1.48) at an encounter.</p>

<p>Preferably one would investigate the effects of officer characteristics by nesting citizen encounters within specific officers and subsequently using hierarchical modeling techniques. However, the structure of these data did not suggest an analysis of this type. Research suggests that there should be ten or more level-one units (in this case, police–citizen encounters) to estimate stable hierarchical models with acceptable levels of bias (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611111432679">Mok &amp; Flynn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098611111432679">Mok &amp; Warton, 1996</xref>). Although there were 268 officers across 978 cases (i.e., citizen encounters), too many officers (240 of 268, 89.6%) had an insufficient number of cases (&lt;10) to estimate reliable hierarchical models.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1098611111432679">

<p>Given an overall small number of cases in this analysis (<italic>N</italic> = 120) the officer gender, proactive, and site variables are excluded as a result of little to no variability in these measures.</p>

<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111432679">Mastrofski et al. (2000)</xref> study looks directly at officer responses to specific citizen requests, but in the form of coercive or controlling actions as opposed to noncoercive service type actions.</p>
