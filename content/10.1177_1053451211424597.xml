<p>Functional behavioral assessment (FBA) has been recognized as one of the most commonly recommended approaches for identifying the function of problem behaviors and developing positive behavioral supports to increase target behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451211424597">Blood &amp; Neel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211424597">Reid &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451211424597">Scott, Alter, &amp; McQuillan, 2010</xref>). The promotion of FBA has been further exemplified by its inclusion in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451211424597">IDEIA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424597">Johnston &amp; O’Neill, 2001</xref>), which mandates that an FBA must be completed as part of the individualized education program (IEP) if a student’s behavior interferes with his or her academic progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451211424597">Yell, 2006</xref>). Books, journals, workshops, and conferences have been available nationwide to promote the use of FBA across settings, disabilities, and ages. However, despite the increased promotion of FBA, there remains a disconnect between the research on FBA and the actual practice of conducting functional assessments in school-based settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451211424597">Blood &amp; Neel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424597">Johnston &amp; O’Neill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211424597">Reid &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific guidelines for conducting an FBA are not explicitly outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451211424597">IDEIA (2004)</xref>. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that an FBA includes a description of the problem behaviors, an explanation of ecological setting events, an examination of antecedents and consequences that maintain the behavior, and a description of the function of the problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451211424597">Kauffman &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>). This information is generally collected through a variety of strategies including structured interviews, archival record reviews, direct observation of behavior with antecedent–behavior–consequence analysis, frequency count and scatter plots, and systematic experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451211424597">McLaren &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451211424597">O’Neill et al., 1997</xref>). When all of this information has been collected, a hypothesis statement is formulated and a positive behavioral intervention plan is developed to address the function of the problem behavior in a prosocial manner.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424597">Johnston and O’Neill (2001)</xref> reported that school personnel often struggle to make sense of and implement FBA procedures in relevant situations because of its complexity. If an FBA is to be implemented as intended, it is often a multifaceted, time-consuming, and complicated process that incorporates a variety of assessment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451211424597">Larson &amp; Maag, 1998</xref>). The accuracy and feasibility of the FBA process when implemented by school staff remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451211424597">Kern, Hilt, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>). Although the time required to conduct an FBA varies widely, the procedures used in most of the studies on FBA suggest the process requires a significant amount of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451211424597">Lohrmann-O’Rourke, Knoster, &amp; Llewellyn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211424597">Reid &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). This is significant given that approaches involving a substantial amount expertise, time, and effort are not likely to be embraced by teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451211424597">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). Because of the time and effort involved to complete FBAs, many schools now spend time completing paper and pencil FBA reports to satisfy legal requirements but may not be of much applied use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451211424597">Johnston &amp; O’Neill, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, in a recent review of FBAs and behavior intervention plans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451211424597">Van Acker, Boreson, Gable, and Potterton (2005)</xref> found that the majority of FBAs conducted by school personnel were unable to identify the target behavior and were unlikely to result in adequate behavioral intervention plans.</p>
<p>The time and comprehensive nature required to conduct a thorough FBA and intervention plan can appear overwhelming to many teachers. To make it more applicable for school personnel, there is a need to develop an approach to identifying the key components of FBA in a manner that is efficient and practical for educational settings.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451211424597">
<title>Initial Line of Inquiry</title>
<p>One type of practical approach for addressing the key components of FBA is to use the <italic>Screening for Understanding of Student Problem Behavior: An Initial Line of Inquiry 3rd Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451211424597">Knoster &amp; Llewellyn, 2007</xref>). The initial line of inquiry (ILI) is a team-based interview to be used in conjunction with the child study team planning process for dealing with continuous problem behaviors prior to conducting a formal FBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451211424597">Lohrmann-O’Rourke et al., 1999</xref>). These child study teams can be IEP teams, teacher assistance teams, multidisciplinary teams, or any group of individuals who know the child well. The ILI is used to link student and teacher behaviors to the environmental factors that influence the student’s behavior in school. By reviewing and examining these factors as a team, teachers are able to engage in a structured brainstorming activity to identify alternative behaviors and target interventions to increase more desirable behaviors. For the purpose of this study, a one-page reproducible, screening matrix form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451211424597">Figure 1</xref>) was created to organize the key features of the ILI.</p>

<p>To complete the ILI screening matrix, a facilitator, who may be internal (e.g., school psychologist) or external (e.g., consultant), leads the child study team through the steps to complete the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451211424597">Knoster &amp; Llewellyn, 2007</xref>). The facilitator’s role is to lead the brainstorming activity across the domains of the matrix to help the team reach consensus on each of the domains. Using a whiteboard, the facilitator leads the team in a brainstorming exercise that elicits information across six major domains discussed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451211424597">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The benefit of assessing the child across these six areas is that it gives the team a more comprehensive understanding of the variables that influence a child’s behavior. For example, examining the strengths of the child allows team members to have a frame of reference from which they are able to design interventions. In addition, it documents the student’s positive attributes that need to be developed and keeps the team from focusing strictly on the negative characteristics.</p>
<p>After this information has been collected, a hypothesis, or series of summary statements, is agreed on. The facilitator then asks team members to describe in observable and measurable terms the desired behaviors they would like to see the child display that would address the function of the inappropriate behaviors. Once targeted behaviors have been identified, the team begins to brainstorm interventions that would help increase the desired behaviors they want the child to display. After reviewing intervention ideas, the student’s teacher chooses a series of interventions that he or she thinks can be implemented and assessed in a consistent and reliable manner. Although this decision should include input from team members, it is important that the teacher, or person responsible for implementing the intervention, is fully committed to implementing the interventions as intended. The team then discusses a strategy to assist in the data collection and intervention implementation as well as possible barriers that could get in the way of implementation. The entire process takes approximately 60 min to complete.</p>

<title>Tyrone’s Case Study</title>
<p>Tyrone was a 13-year-old, eighth grade student who was receiving special education services at a self-contained school for students with behavioral disorders (see Note <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1053451211424597">1</xref>). Tyrone was referred to the school for the following inappropriate behaviors: physical aggression, aggression to property, disrespect, noncompliance, profanity, and disruption. Tyrone met state and federal special education criteria for behavioral disorder. Tyrone’s level of academic performance was below grade level in all academic areas. Tyrone was chosen for this case study because he was exhibiting significant behavior problems in the self-contained school and the staff were looking for strategies to brainstorm solutions to reduce the problem behaviors. The self-contained school Tyrone attended conducted weekly 1-hr child study team meetings to review the progress of particular students who may be exhibiting some behavioral challenges within the school building or in the community. The purpose of these meetings was to review the student’s behavioral intervention plan and to discuss possible interventions to decrease the problem behaviors that the child may be exhibiting.</p>
<sec id="section3-1053451211424597">
<title>Tyrone’s Problem Behavior</title>
<p>After completing the screening matrix for Tyrone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451211424597">Figure 2</xref>), the team reached consensus that the primary problem behavior was his frequency of talking out of turn and interrupting the classroom during instruction in personal growth, math, English, and health to gain the teacher’s attention. The team agreed that an appropriate alternative behavior would be for Tyrone to raise his hand to talk in class. Although Tyrone also exhibited more aggressive behaviors, the child study team believed that these less aggressive behaviors were oftentimes the antecedents to the more violent behaviors. Therefore, the team chose to focus on addressing these attention-seeking, interrupting behaviors.</p>

<title>Tyrone’s Intervention</title>
<p>To address the function of Tyrone’s attention seeking behavior, the team agreed on a series of social skills lessons that would teach appropriate ways to receive teacher attention, help him deal with distractions, and create opportunities for him to receive positive reinforcement. In addition, Tyrone was taught a self-monitoring strategy to facilitate generalization of those social skills and to create another opportunity for him to receive positive attention and reinforcement. The team decided that Tyrone’s problem behaviors were most evident during health class, so that was the setting in which the interventions were first applied.</p>
<p>The first phase of the intervention was to use the <italic>Social Skills Strategies</italic> curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451211424597">Gajewski, Hirn, &amp; Mayo, 1998</xref>) to directly teach the social skills for asking for help, impulse control, using self-control, and avoiding trouble. The teacher was responsible for using the curriculum to teach Tyrone these skills. The curriculum consisted of direct instruction of social skills, role-play activities, permanent product assignments, and end-of-chapter assessments.</p>
<p>The second phase of the intervention was to teach Tyrone how to self-monitor the number of times he raised his hand appropriately during health class to receive teacher attention. The team decided to try health class because this was the class where Tyrone exhibited the problem behavior the most, and it was also the class in which his teacher felt she could implement the intervention most reliably. After a training phase for hand raising, each time Tyrone raised his hand in class, the teacher would try to call on him or subtly acknowledge him for raising his hand. In addition, Tyrone would write a check mark in the appropriate box for each time he raised his hand appropriately. Initially, Tyrone was prompted when to place the check mark, but after 2 days, he was able to monitor himself. While Tyrone monitored the number of times he raised his hand appropriately, staff monitored the number of times he talked out of turn or interrupted. Talk-outs were operationalized as vocal utterances that were made by the student without the teacher’s permission or acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Data were collected by using Tyrone’s self-monitoring sheet for raising his hand during health class for 20 days. Data were also collected by the paraeducator on how many times Tyrone talked out of turn during class. The goals were for Tyrone to raise his hand appropriately to talk at least four times during a given class period and to not talk out of turn or interrupt more than one time during the class period. If Tyrone met each of those goals, he would receive 5 min of center time for each class period in which he met the goals. Center time consisted of opportunities to play on the computer, play a video game, or listen to the radio. Center time was earned before lunch and before dismissal at the end of the day.</p>

<title>Tyrone’s Results</title>
<p>The frequencies of Tyrone’s talk-outs and hand raising in health class are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1053451211424597">Figure 3</xref>. Tyrone’s behavior was monitored for 20 consecutive days, with baseline data being collected for the first 6 days for talk-outs and hand raising. Each class period lasted 30 min. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1053451211424597">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate that during baseline Tyrone averaged 4.33 talk-outs per class period, with infrequent hand raising. During intervention, Tyrone’s target behavior of raising his hand increased to an average of 3 times per class, and his talk-outs decreased in average to 1.7 times per class. A transition period of 3 days was apparent as Tyrone learned the self-monitoring technique. Once Tyrone had practiced the self-monitoring skill, his talk-outs decreased significantly and his hand raising increased at a similar rate. Tyrone’s talk-outs outnumbered his hand raising on only 2 days once the intervention was mastered. On both occasions, behavioral incidences earlier in the day led to Tyrone’s talk-outs and ignoring self-monitoring rules.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Analysis of this case study suggests that the ILI screening matrix may be a useful tool for child study teams to reach consensus on the function of a problem behavior and to develop interventions in a timely manner. As illustrated in this case study, child study teams are able to complete the matrix and reach consensus on the function of a child’s problem behavior and derive interventions within an hour. In addition, teams are able to discuss a plan for implementation and data collection. The interventions derived from the matrix in this study had a positive effect on the increase of a desirable behavior and the decrease of a problem behavior. For instance, Tyrone increased the number of times he raised his hand to receive teacher attention from approximately once per class to three times per class. In addition, as he increased the number of times he raised his hand during class, the number of talk-outs decreased by almost 75%.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the collection of data on the target behavior allows the child study teams to monitor the progress of the interventions and to determine if they were addressing the function of the problem behavior. Since the matrix can be completed in conjunction with the child study team meetings, team members have opportunities to discuss the implementation of the intervention and to monitor progress. If the students do not make progress on the target behaviors, the teams reevaluate the function of the behavior and discuss the need for alternative interventions.</p>
<p>The ILI screening matrix was designed to assist child study teams with an efficient procedure to identify the function of a problem behavior and to derive positive behavioral interventions that may address the function of the problem behavior in a prosocial manner. Many of the child study team members commented on how they liked the screening approach, and it made more sense to them than conducting a formal FBA. Although the screening matrix is not meant to replace FBAs, it may be an efficient alternative to assist school personnel in determining the function of a problem behavior and deriving interventions to increase a more prosocial behavior before a student’s behavior becomes so problematic that it requires the extensive use of resources required for an FBA. Specifically, as a screening measure, the ILI matrix could be an effective measure for addressing problem behavior within a schoolwide tiered support system designed to increase prosocial behaviors.</p>
<p>Given the amount of time, expertise, and resources required to conduct a formal FBA, the benefits of the ILI screening matrix and other practical approaches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451211424597">Lane, Weisenbach, Phillips, &amp; Wehby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451211424597">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451211424597">Stichter, Lewis, Johnson, &amp; Trussell, 2004</xref>) to identifying the function of problem behaviors should not be ignored. Schools are in need of practitioner-friendly approaches to help them devise strategies to address problem behavior. The current application of FBA has not been embraced by school districts as it has been by researchers who have promoted its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451211424597">Blood &amp; Neel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451211424597">Reid &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451211424597">Sasso, Conroy, Stichter, &amp; Fox, 2001</xref>). To bridge the gap between research and practice, researchers and practitioners need to continue to investigate procedures that teachers are willing to utilize and implement independent of researcher facilitation. For that to happen, approaches to behavioral intervention planning must be easy to implement, require limited resources, and be embraced by school personnel.</p>
