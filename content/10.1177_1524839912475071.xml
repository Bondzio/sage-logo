<p>The Hunger and Obesity workshop, organized by the Institute of Medicine, examined the relationship between food insecurity and the obesity pandemic that the United States is facing today. The workshop brought together a diverse group of experts and discussed these issues among special subpopulation groups, examined variables through a socioecological model, suggested effective government programs demonstrating positive impact, proposed key research questions, methods, and measures, and also pointed to research gaps for future works. Health promotion practitioners and researchers, either new or experienced, could gain a broader perspective on important current issues surrounding obesity and food insecurity.

<p>The Institute of Medicine (IOM) organized a workshop on Hunger and Obesity, per the request of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Services. Currently, USDA provides three core programs to combat food insecurity aiming to encourage participants to adhere to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the National School Lunch Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The discussions of the IOM workshop focused on the relationship between food insecurity and the obesity pandemic the United States is facing today. Sentinel populations, including young children, immigrants, Native Americans, and rural populations were examined. In addition, the four levels of a socioecological model—individual, family and household, environmental, and institutional—were discussed, along with an integrated framework of all the levels. Major research questions, methods, and measures that may be useful to address the knowledge gaps identified from the workshop were also highlighted.</p>
<p>The first session covered the workshop goals and background, and the second session discussed the coexistence of food insecurity and obesity. Although there have been observable significant increases in both food insecurity and obesity, current literature on this relationship have been mixed. To set the stage, definitions were provided to describe different levels of food security, including food security (high, marginal, low, and very low), food insecurity, food insufficiency, and hunger. Food security refers to “physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912475071">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912475071">National Research Council, 2006</xref>), and has been an indicator that the USDA uses as an ongoing measure of the effectiveness of federal nutrition assistance programs.</p>
<p>The connection between food insecurity and obesity is a complicated one. Among children, current research has not found a clear pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912475071">Gundersen, Garasky, &amp; Lohman, 2009</xref>). Among adults, this relationship is mixed. For women, studies showed that food insecurity increased the risk of obesity; whereas for men it showed reduced obesity risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912475071">Laraia, 2010</xref>). The IOM workshop suggests future research to focus on the role of stress among low-income households, choice of variables and measures, and the links between food insecurity and diet quality or food choices. Using different research designs may further contribute to our understanding, such as longitudinal and retrospective studies to examine the dynamics of the relationships, and experimental studies to establish causative links.</p>
<p>The third workshop session discussed the role of socioeconomic disparities on the food insecurity and obesity relationship. Measuring socioeconomic status (SES) is a challenge because of its multidimensional characteristics. The workshop panelists stressed the importance of measuring dimensions of SES that are most relevant to the target population as there are limitations of SES measures and effect those limitations could have on conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912475071">Braveman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from national surveys have shown that, for children, higher income is linked to lower rates of obesity, and an unsafe and disadvantaged neighborhood increases obesity risk. For adults, although the overall prevalence of obesity is also higher among lower education groups, adults with higher education also had a faster increase of obesity prevalence. Decreased physical activity and increased total energy intake may be important contributing factors among the adult population.</p>
<p>The fourth workshop session discussed what it called the “sentinel populations,” specific groups within a population that might help explain or clarify possible links between food insecurity and obesity. In this session, children, immigrants, American Indians, and rural populations were examined.</p>
<p>Young, low-income children warrant special attention because of food insecurity influences nutrition during development, it may lead to increased risk of obesity later in life. For immigrants, limited data are available to establish conclusions. Although border states such as California or Texas are still popular entry points, there is an increased trend of immigrants moving to states such as Georgia that traditionally have not had large foreign-born populations. One important implication is the lack of sufficient access to services. The Latino population also has documentation status as a significant concern, which makes this population less likely to access government services even if available. Acculturation is another risk factor as immigrants are exposed to marketing of low-priced, high-sugar, high-fat foods in the United States, which changes the ways they shop, produce, and consume food in a new country. Although new immigrants share some common characteristics related to food insecurity, the workshop panelists noted the need to focus on heterogeneity, including immigrants’ country of origin, where they live, parental SES, and other factors.</p>
<p>For Native American populations, many of the reservations are situated in food deserts where people have to travel a long distance get healthier or fresher food. Because of the community-oriented nature of the populations, the workshop panelists encouraged researchers to apply a holistic approach for a community-based solution. In rural populations, either areas with small population size or nonmetropolitan areas, the relationship between food insecurity and obesity is likely bidirectional and may be compounded by the persistent poverty, and lack of quality health programs, and so on.</p>
<p>Sessions 5 to 8 covered the different levels of the socioecological model. At the individual level, obesity may have an adverse affect on employment, because of either weight-related health problems or discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912475071">Roehling, 1999</xref>). The panel suggested a framework extending across the life course to help explain the long-term links. Additional research agenda suggested include more cohort studies that start early in childhood, cross-sectional studies collecting life course circumstances, examining mental health issues, parenting skills, and so on.</p>
<p>The sixth workshop session discussed the family and household level and examined the complex dynamics within families. Food insecurity is linked not only to maternal stress but also to the psychosocial functioning of children. However, families in low-income areas have also shown tremendous resilience. The panelists pointed that children understand what is going on and how it affects them and their family more than we think. Studies show that children are not only aware of the food insecurity issues in the family but also take responsibility for the food insecurity. It was interesting to note that children’s awareness included all cognitive, emotional, and physical levels. Children from the food insecure families know the struggles adults deal with, worry about the scarcity of food, and experience hunger and tiredness associated with food insecurity. Thus, children in such families often take responsibility in helping manage food resources by eating less, choosing less expensive foods, and sometimes working to help the family situation.</p>
<p>Partnering with families and asking about their needs is essential to creating change. The photovoice strategies for lower income families can give community members an opportunity to dialogue and share experiences, as well as allow them to reframe issues for researchers.</p>
<p>The seventh session focused on the environment level, such as access to supermarket, marketing, and community stressors. The panelists discussed some possible mechanisms related to the food environment. The first mechanism is the high availability of energy-dense food options and the low cost of less healthful options in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912475071">Townsend, Aaron, Monsivais, Keim, &amp; Drewnowski, 2009</xref>). The stress of living in substandard neighborhoods where only limited healthful foods options are available contributes to obesity. Energy-dense foods tend to be inversely associated with dietary quality and cost, and the impact of prices on body mass index was stronger for children in lower SES.</p>
<p>Marketing of foods is another mechanism. Studies show less fruit and vegetable consumption in schools with vending machines. Whereas the presence of supermarkets is linked to decreased obesity, the presence of convenience stores is linked to increased obesity rates. In addition to food availability and price, food purchases depend on a number of other factors such as travel cost, promotional effect, age, race/ethnicity, education, tastes and preference, income, and so on. Most of the existing neighborhood studies are cross-sectional. Research needs to look at interventions studies to further determine causality.</p>
<p>The eighth session targets the institutional level. Institutions help create environments that shape household and individual behaviors, thus, could be considered as the most encompassing level from a socioecological perspective. Making healthier options more visible and accessible is important in influencing food choices. The discussion highlighted the local and organic foods movement, which could serve as a model for making changes in food assistance programs that could significantly affect the lives of low-income people.</p>
<p>The Food Bank of Central New York, which implemented a no-soda and no-candy policy, was used as an example to illustrate the impact of institutional initiatives. Since 2004, it has put significant resources into refrigerators and freezers to handle different kinds of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fresh fruits, and vegetables. In addition, it has partnered with neighborhood stores for people to redeem low-fat/skim milk vouchers. This case can serve as a prime model for the nation on how cities and states could work together to meet the needs of the community.</p>
<p>The ninth session put all the levels together. It should be noted that the influence of multiple factors on the food insecurity and obesity relationship is integrative. Models that incorporate these factors can help inform intervention strategies. Conditional cash transfer programs, tying cash incentives with positive behavior change, and parental investments in their children, demonstrated effectiveness among low-income populations. The Opportunity New York City/Family Rewards program is a successful example encouraging parents adhering to well-baby visits, immunization, nutritional regimens, and school attendance.</p>
<p>Session 10 focused on research applications. Current research efforts addressing diet improvement have examined school foods, portion sizes, marketing, nutrient levels, changing consumption, weight stigma, and so forth. The panelists highlighted several “sweet spot” government single intervention programs demonstrating effectiveness on both obesity and food insecurity. For example, school breakfast programs have effectively reduced hunger and obesity in low-income families. The Child and Adult Care Food Program provide needed nutrition and reduce overweight issue among preschool children. Federal after-school supper programs also show children have higher daily intake of fruits, vegetables, milk, and key nutrients. The panelists also suggested that research programs could grow directly from policy initiatives designed to achieve goals related to food insecurity and obesity. The mandates of fresh drinking water availability in school, eliminating sugar sweetened beverages, and limit one serving of 100% juice per day in California preschools are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Session 11 discussed research gaps from four key disciplinary perspectives: nutrition, sociology, psychology, and economics. The session highlighted different conceptual frameworks and viewpoints on the complex food insecurity and obesity relationships. It was interesting to note that lifestyle, behaviors, and environments were common factors brought up by all experts. For example, the nutritionist discussed the role of working at night in disrupting eating and physical activities, the sociologist pointed how federal assistant program influenced the different cost-of-living areas, the psychologist spoke on the impact of environmental stress related to food insecurity on weight gain, and the economist noted the possible effect of cyclical eating behavior resulting from resources received on a cyclical basis.</p>
<p>Session 12 addressed research methods and measures considering who and what are measured, and in what time frame they are measured. Because of the complexity and multidimensional nature of the food insecurity and obesity relationship, a combination of methodological approaches is encouraged. The last workshop session highlighted the need for communications research to reframe obesity issues and disseminate research findings. Establishing public–private partnerships between various federal agencies and private foundations is essential to tackle this complex problem.</p>
<p>In summary, the workshop pointed out that the harmful impacts of food insecurity are sufficiently severe to justify action, regardless of their effects on obesity. A number of research gaps and policy suggestions were provided. The workshop brought a diverse group of experts who might not normally talk with each other in depth to discuss the important obesity issues and potential links with food insecurity, poverty, and stress. Special attention was brought to SES disparity groups and the sentinel populations. The socioecological model perspectives provided a broader and more comprehensive examination as well.</p>
<p>Although all panel sessions and discussions were organized by related themes in speakers’ expertise areas, each specific session could perhaps benefit from a clearer structure and flow. Because of the dynamic nature of the discussions, it may also be a little difficult for readers to follow the discussion summary at the end of each session. Nevertheless, the workshop highlighted current knowledge and challenges in research, provided effective examples on some federal programs and promising state policies addressing obesity and food insecurity, and pointed to a number of research gaps for future works. Health promotion practitioners and researchers, either new or experienced, could gain a broader perspective on important current issues surrounding obesity and food insecurity.</p>
