<p>This thought provoking collection of articles explores the concept of exile. After a foreword by Rainer Albertz, Brad E. Kelle opens the volume by surveying the ways in which the study of exile has changed over the last 30 years. The first six articles look at the exile in Babylon from a historical perspective. Aaron A. Burke highlights how the <italic>Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction</italic> model for refugee studies can shed light upon 2 Kgs; Oded Lipschits explores how the evidence from Ramat Rachel informs on the administration, economy, and material culture in Judah; Avraham Faust emphasizes that deportation is one among many factors that can cause demographic change; Jacob L. Wright explores the use of the concept of Jerusalem’s wealth in the Dtr history; Marian H. Feldman investigates the way in which the Assyrians portrayed foreigners; and Bob Becking stresses that neither the exile nor the return was as large as often thought.</p>
<p>The next five articles explore the consequences of exile and destruction upon identity. Frank Ritchel Ames reads Ruth and Jer 29:4-23 against studies on forced displacement; Christl M. Maier argues that the female personification of Jerusalem serves as a collective memory for the community; Michael M. Homan shares how his experiences in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina shaped his understanding of the catastrophe in 586 BC; M. Jan Holton explores African types of comparative biblical hermeneutics of the exile; and Hugo Kamya discusses how modern studies of the psychological impact of displacement can shed light upon Ezra-Nehemiah.</p>
<p>The following five studies deal with the psychological repercussions of exile and forced migration. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher applies social psychology on Micah 4, Ezekiel and Daniel; William Morrow reads Deut 7 as an exilic revenge fantasy, depicting the Canaanites as the ‘other’ who must be destroyed so that the exiles can preserve their own identity; David M. Carr highlights the ways in which exile reshapes the refugees’ identity, creating nationalism and xenophobia (e.g. Isa 40-55); David G. Garber Jr. argues that the interplay between the two Hebrew verbs ללח I and II in Ezekiel accentuates that Judah deserved the trauma that befell them; and Janet L. Rumfelt discusses the lack of belief among survivors of trauma in a safe world governed by a moral structure.</p>
<p>The last six studies explore how biblical and modern texts represent experiences of exile. Samuel E. Balentine investigates the differences between prose and poetry in retelling the exile; Carolyn J. Sharp points out that the literature of subjugated people can generate distortions and new violence (e.g. Jeremiah, Ezekiel); T.M. Lemos maintains that Ezekiel’s use of animal metaphors to denote the sexual prowess of Judah’s ‘lovers’ is in line with ancient Near Eastern ideals of masculinity; Amy Meverden argues that Daughter Zion in Lamentations shares many characteristics with the archaic Roman legal concept of a <italic>homo sacer</italic>; Shelly Rambo highlights the underside of the American founding myth as the land of freedom and opportunity; and Nghana Lewis explores black male crime and violence through the lens of Tony Morrison’s character Cholly (<italic>The Bluest Eye</italic>). To be recommended.</p>
