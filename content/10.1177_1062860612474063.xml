<abstract>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that predictive accuracy of acuity models flattens when more than 10 variables are used. The authors hypothesized that the exclusion of laboratory data would produce a reliable predictive model. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set from 2005 to 2008 was reviewed. Logistic regression was used to develop models from 86 preoperative variables to predict 30-day morbidity and mortality. Models were compared by measuring area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values that then were analyzed with unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. As the number of variables decreased, the change in the AUROC for mortality and morbidity were not statistically significant for 10- and 5-variable models. Although the AUROC for acuity models decreased slightly for morbidity and mortality when laboratory values were excluded, these changes were not statistically significant. This study shows that models developed to predict surgical outcomes can achieve similar predictive accuracy without laboratory data.</p>

<p>Regulators, payers, consumers, and purchasers all demand an increased focus on outcomes, particularly in surgery. Hospitals track the quality of surgical care provided more closely, as quality outcomes and accurate preoperative risk stratification have developed into priorities. This quality outcomes focus has made the field of medicine increasingly evidence based, and health care professionals are subsequently faced with the challenge of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data.</p>
<p>Patient data have been used to predict surgical risk by stratifying patients into levels of predicted operative mortality. Recent advances have allowed different categories of variables to be combined into models with excellent risk adjustment and prediction. However, the data collection process places increased demands on patients and caregivers and is associated with increased costs to health care systems.</p>
<p>The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612474063">1</xref></sup> is a robust system that collects audited and verified data from over 200 US hospitals and reports 30-day acuity-adjusted morbidity and mortality. Each participating hospital undergoes audit visits and is required to meet strict criteria, with an interrater reliability exceeding 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612474063">2</xref></sup> More than 240 variables are collected by trained nurse data coordinators and submitted centrally. Data are used to develop observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for adverse events for each hospital, which are then compared with O/E ratios from other institutions.</p>
<p>Although data collected by NSQIP are a valuable resource for developing acuity models with great predictive accuracy, these data sets are expensive to maintain. Annual subscription fees for participating in NSQIP in conjunction with the cost of a full-time nurse abstractor exceeds $100 000 yearly. In addition, the demands of data collection are resource intensive. Each category of data requires different interfaces and methodologies with analogous impact on the abstractor’s time. For example, laboratory data usually are obtained manually, although a few institutions have developed direct interfaces at great expense. Serum albumin is one of the few laboratory variables frequently used for acuity-adjusted risk models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612474063">3</xref></sup> Other laboratory data, such as creatinine or liver function, appear as categorized variables intermittently. In the setting of limited resources with intense demands for efficiency, the question arises whether use of different categories of data will maintain reliability and accuracy of risk models.</p>
<p>Birkmeyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612474063">4</xref></sup> reported that risk models from previous studies based on the NSQIP data set flatten when more than 10 variables are used. This finding was attributed to some variables being internally correlated with other risk factors, or too rare variables, or variables that are inadequate to contribute to risk adjustment.</p>
<p>Collection of clinically validated data remains cumbersome. In this data-driven medical era, much redundant information is collected, and the authors believe that models can be parsimoniously constructed. They aimed to explore how to reduce the amount of data needed to risk stratify patients by focusing their investigation on excluding laboratory data, which would eliminate a level of complexity in the pursuit of quality data. Laboratory results such as albumin have been consistently important in creating models of patient risk. Yet to obtain this one laboratory value at the typical institution would require either a laboratory interface or a separate method for clinical lookup. The authors hypothesized that it is possible to construct predictive models without laboratory values and still obtain similar accuracy.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Under the data use agreement of the ACS and with institutional review board approval, the NSQIP participant use files (PUF) from 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. The data were sampled from NSQIP participating hospitals and included more than 240 variables such as demographics, surgical profile, preoperative comorbidities, and intraoperative and postoperative characteristics from patients who underwent major surgical procedures. Outcome variables were 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality, which were the focus of this study. Morbidity is defined as the occurrence of any of the 20 postoperative complication variables that are collected in NSQIP: superficial and deep wound infections, organ space infections, wound dehiscence, pneumonia, respiratory failure, renal failure, dialysis, blood transfusion, sepsis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrest, stroke, coma &gt;24 hours, peripheral nerve injury, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, urinary tract infection, and failure of procedure. In developing models to predict surgical outcomes, the authors used 86 variables obtained preoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612474063">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612474063">Table 1</xref> displays the total number of patients and patients without missing data from 2005 to 2008. To maintain consistency in the analysis, patients with any missing data were excluded. This ensured that the patient population did not change when comparing risk models that used different variables. It also prevented risk variables being affected by the bias introduced by methods to fill missing data. The type and the originating category of missing data also were observed.</p>

<p>Logistic regression was used to develop models to predict 30-day risk, with morbidity and mortality as outcomes. The authors initially developed 2 risk models using 86 variables. The models were based on the 2007 ACS NSQIP PUF for patients who had no missing data. The predictive models were then compared with (<italic>a</italic>) models using the first 1, 5, and 10 variables found by forward selection based on the Wald statistic; (<italic>b</italic>) models constructed for the same patients but with 53 variables as a result of excluding laboratory data; and (<italic>c</italic>) models using 86 variables for patients from the 2005-2006 NSQIP PUF who did not have missing data. Risk models were compared based on how well they predicted outcomes for patients without missing data from the 2008 NSQIP PUF. The comparisons were performed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and the associated standard error for each model. The AUROC values were compared between models using an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
<p>To analyze category and type of missing data, the authors focused on the 2007 PUF. Logistic regression models similar to NSQIP annual reports were generated. These used a variety of demographic, laboratory, and comorbidity-related data.</p>

The first 10 variables for morbidity were ASA score, work RVU, preoperative albumin, emergent versus nonemergent cases, functional status, inpatient versus outpatient case, preoperative sepsis, usage of steroids, and weight.

<p>Missing data continues to be a concern even in strictly audited samples such as NSQIP. Only 13.7% of patients over the 4 years of this study had no missing data.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Creating models for acuity adjustment and risk stratification is a resource-intensive and cumbersome process, especially in the current data-driven medical field. Although methodologies for data collection and analysis have evolved significantly in recent years, health care professionals are still required to collect and study a large number of variables. The authors compared predictive models using fewer variables and different categories of data and found a potential for simpler models with analogous efficiency. This study demonstrates how different categories of variables only incrementally increased the accuracy of predictive models. The 80:20 rule, known as the Pareto principle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612474063">6</xref></sup> a long-held dictum in the business community whereby 80% of the effects arise from 20% of the causes, may apply to the health care setting. Using the Pareto principle, it is possible that 80% of postoperative risk can be predicted by using 20% of the available data or by using 20% of time and effort.</p>
<p>Overall this analysis demonstrates that models developed to predict surgical outcomes can achieve similar predictive accuracy by using demographic and comorbidity categories of data and by using an historical data set. Laboratory data were not required to maintain predictive accuracy. By paring down the categories of data and variables within categories, it may be possible to train risk models with decreased complexity, making data more efficient and easier to obtain. This has the potential to simplify core elements of acuity model development as they become less complex and less expensive.</p>
<p>By reporting results of missing data, the authors aimed to make their methodology more transparent and, in the process, discovered the significant volume of missing data even in the robust and widely accepted NSQIP PUF. This demonstrates how difficult it is to maintain complete data sets. For example, the case of serum albumin values missing in 46% of patients in this study illustrates the resource challenge of seeking missing laboratory values unless health care institutions install laboratory interfaces, which are expensive to maintain. This study’s results show that laboratory data can be omitted from risk model development, which instead can rely on the easily acquired clinical characteristics and demographics found in every history and physical, with resultant equivalent accuracy. But one may argue that the solution to the “missing data” problem would be to strive to improve data collection and transmission. However, this may be difficult to motivate given that the current work demonstrates that model accuracy can be maintained simply by exploiting parsimony, without involved changes to protocols or the need for additional resources. The current prescription in health care and meaningful use is toward the collection of more data; the results from the current study support this by emphasizing that more data should be collected, but those data should be chosen differently from the kinds of redundant information presently collected. In the setting of scarce resources with intense demands for efficiency, it is perhaps not worth collecting all categories of data. Even though methodologies for studying data have evolved, collecting validated data remains cumbersome. As we study the kinds of data presently collected, and compare the predictive accuracy of different risk models in the context of risk stratification, opportunities for simplification may emerge. This also is extremely important in that pursuing quality data in resource-limited settings (eg, in rural hospitals or countries that have not moved to electronic medical records) may allow them to participate in surgical quality improvement. Every effort should be made to develop simplified tools that will improve surgical outcomes globally.</p>
<p>Previous studies based on the NSQIP data set and on other surgical registries have demonstrated that the accuracy of predictive models reaches a plateau with roughly 10 variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612474063">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612474063"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612474063"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612474063">10</xref></sup> Quality control and comparison of acuity-adjusted, interhospital, and intersurgeon mortality rates have been prevalent over the past 15 years in cardiac surgery. With an aim to provide fair outcome comparisons, complex cardiac surgical risk models that use an extensive array of risk variables have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612474063">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612474063"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612474063"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612474063">14</xref></sup> This was initially challenged by Jones et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612474063">7</xref></sup> who showed that use of 7 core variables (age, sex, reoperation, ejection fraction, left main stem disease, number of coronary arteries with &gt;70% stenosis, and acuity) equally predicted postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) mortality rates compared with the more comprehensive risk models. Similarly, Tu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612474063">8</xref></sup> analyzed more than 5500 patients who had undergone isolated CABG and demonstrated that incorporation of only 6 core variables led to a model with an AUROC of 0.77, with a nonsignificant improvement to 0.79 (<italic>P</italic> = .06) after including 6 additional level 1 variables.</p>
<p>The current study is not without shortcomings. First, the effect of complex models was not addressed at the individual patient level. Although more comprehensive risk models do not affect results at the interhospital level, they may provide a more accurate assessment of individual patients at high operative risk. Second, coding errors are a potential flaw in NSQIP. Third, this study is subject to limitations inherent to any retrospective analysis. Finally, the analysis was restricted to only the 13.7% of patients without missing data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is becoming more obvious that large databases have a significant number of variables with little or no value in predictive risk models. This study reveals that use of demographic and comorbidity data sets—far less variables than traditionally used and without the laboratory data set—still achieves analogous predictive accuracy. Identifying and defining a common set of variables in procedure-specific risk models can potentially reduce health care expenditures and relieve the resource burden while maintaining high standards of accuracy. Although this study focused exclusively on the NSQIP PUF, these results can extend more broadly to other clinical disciplines. The findings from this study may encourage the development of less complex acuity models in an affordable and time-efficient manner.</p>
