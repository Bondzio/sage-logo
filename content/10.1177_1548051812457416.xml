<abstract>
<p>Leadership development has been continually recognized by organizations as a competence and a mind-set that is worthy of substantial time and resources. Although various approaches have stressed the development of skills or behaviors, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the development of attitudes and belief systems is also relevant. In an effort to increase knowledge in this area, the authors conducted a quasi-experimental study to understand whether motivation to lead (social-normative) and leader role identity would increase in business students exposed to behavior-modeling methods emphasizing the importance of transformational leadership. The results show that, in comparison with students in an introduction to management course, the quasi-experimental–condition students significantly increased the value that they placed on the leader role, as well as their identity as leaders. The findings are discussed in terms of both theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<p>Leadership is a phenomenon that has been heralded as a positive force for change and a focus for development of individuals, groups, and organizations. Each year, organizations spend significant amounts of time and money in the pursuit of increasing the quality of leadership in their organizations. Our understanding of effective leadership development in the workplace continues to improve through the efforts of organizational scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812457416">DeRue, Ashford, &amp; Cotton, 2009</xref>). In a recent meta-analysis of 200 experimental and quasi-experimental lab and field studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812457416">Avolio, Reichard, Hannah, Walumbwa, and Chan (2009)</xref> found that leadership development efforts tend to have a positive impact on outcomes in organizations.</p>
<p>With that said, there are a number of unanswered questions relevant to understanding the process of leadership development. For example, can leadership actually be taught within a manageable time frame, and if so, what aspects of leadership are teachable, relevant, and desirable? Moreover, how do aspects of leader attitudes or belief systems come into play in their development?</p>
<p>To address such questions, several key issues must be considered. First, leadership capabilities need to be defined. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day and Harrison (2007)</xref> noted, “leadership . . . can and does take on multiple meanings and appearance” (p. 360). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812457416">DeRue and Ashford (2010)</xref> stated that “leadership is ambiguous, with no clear definition or meaning across people” (p. 630). Accordingly, when examining leadership processes or qualities, it is imperative for researchers to specify the precise phenomenon to be developed. Second, and more specifically, developable, personal qualities and behaviors need to be identified. In addressing this challenge, we will need to identify not only important qualities and behaviors but also those that can be reasonably developed. Third, a potentially viable learning framework should be systematically examined to better understand how leadership capabilities can be developed.</p>
<p>To deal with the first issue, in the current study, we focused on the development of transformational leadership potential in an undergraduate business program. Transformational leadership has been a commonly used model for understanding exceptional leadership behavior and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812457416">Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812457416">Lowe, Kroeck, &amp; Sivasubramaniam, 1996</xref>). As such, it represents a potentially viable basis for the development of more effective leaders. It is also in line with commonly held prototypes of effective leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812457416">Lord &amp; Maher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812457416">Offerman, Kennedy, &amp; Wirtz, 1994</xref>), and thus, it may be especially easy to understand and identify with transformational leadership.</p>
<p>To address the second issue mentioned above, we focused on motivation to lead (MTL) and leader role identity (LRI) as key personal qualities that might be reasonable to develop in the context of an undergraduate business curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812457416">Chan and Drasgow (2001)</xref> characterized MTL as an individual differences construct that could affect an individual’s desire to assume a leader role or further training to be a leader. Although there may be some traitlike aspects with regard to MTL, it is also to some degree statelike and potentially malleable over time. Chan and Drasgow conceptualized MTL as being able to “change with leadership experience and training” (p. 482). Moreover, it is an important construct because it may predict leadership behavior and performance if an individual ultimately assumes a leader position.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined LRI as a potentially viable characteristic to develop in the context of undergraduate business education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day and Harrison (2007)</xref> stated that “the development of a leader identity is critically important in the ongoing and continuous development of a leader” and that “thinking of oneself as a leader is an important motivator for acting as a leader and further developing leadership skills” (pp. 365-366). These sentiments have been echoed by various other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812457416">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812457416">DeRue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812457416">Hall, 2004</xref>). For example, Hall theorized that the activities of leaders are motivated by how they see themselves and how they want others to see them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812457416">Lord and Hall (2005)</xref> further proposed that “one’s self-view as a leader not only influences proactive attempts to gain leadership experience, it may also be an important cue to access knowledge related to leadership” (p. 611). Accordingly, rather than focusing exclusively on knowledge or skill acquisition, a good first step might be to first solidify aspects of followers’ identities as leaders. Like MTL, LRI may have traitlike features and thus be relatively enduring. Nevertheless, at the same time, it may also be somewhat malleable, depending on experience, training, and the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812457416">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we broadly propose that experiential learning would be more effective than a more passive approach, whereby a learner may simply receive information about leadership behavior and its importance through techniques such as lecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812457416">Kayes, 2002</xref>). However, beyond the broad concept of experiential learning, we further propose that an emphasis on behavior modeling techniques and principles would be especially effective in terms of facilitating leadership outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812457416">Taylor, Russ-Eft, &amp; Chan, 2005</xref>). That is, leadership education emphasizing behavior modeling might be particularly effective at stimulating both MTL and LRI. Key features of this approach include exposure of the learner to successful models, typically through videos, as well as positive reinforcement for the learner who attempts to emulate the behavior or principles pertaining to the behavior.</p>
<p>In line with some previous work examining the effects of pedagogical approaches in the classroom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812457416">DeTienne &amp; Chandler, 2004</xref>), the current study involved a Solomon four-group, quasi-experimental design. We examined the effects of a behavior-modeling approach, largely stressing the value of transformational leadership, in a leadership course at a major U.S. business school. Specifically, we examined effects pertaining to MTL and LRI. Students in that course were compared with students in an introductory management course that did not emphasize leadership principles and that did not use the behavior-modeling approach. As described further below, we found significant increases in the above outcomes for students in the leadership course but not for students in the introduction to management course.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, we describe transformational leadership and its development, the nature of MTL and LRI as important personal qualities of prospective leaders, and how behavior modeling can be applied in leadership education contexts in an attempt to affect such qualities. We then describe our methodology and findings, as well future research directions and potential implications for leadership development efforts in organizations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1548051812457416">
<title>Transformational Leadership and Its Development</title>
<p>The transformational leadership paradigm has been highly influential as a theoretical framework in the leadership literature over the past 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812457416">Avolio, Walumbwa, &amp; Weber, 2009</xref>). Indeed, it has been the focus of numerous studies examining leadership and its positive effects on performance at individual, group, and organizational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812457416">Judge &amp; Piccolo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812457416">Lowe et al., 1996</xref>). Although authors have proposed multiple models of transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812457416">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812457416">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, &amp; Fetter, 1990</xref>), several consistent themes emerge.</p>
<p>First, this paradigm emphasizes how exceptionally effective leaders communicate and interact with followers in a manner that inspires followers to achieve higher levels of performance and commitment to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812457416">Bass &amp; Bass, 2008</xref>). A key aspect of such inspiration is how transformational leaders create a shared sense of purpose and articulate compelling visions that excite and generate commitment to their pursuit on the part of followers. Second, transformational leaders attempt to form a deep understanding of the developmental needs and aspirations of followers, a dimension labeled individualized consideration by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812457416">Bass and Avolio (1994)</xref>. Third, these leaders may attempt to intellectually stimulate the thinking of followers by getting them to question old assumptions, getting at the heart of complex problems, and envisioning old problems in new ways.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812457416">Bass and Avolio (1994)</xref> contrasted transformational and transactional forms of leadership. The latter is characterized by exchanges between leaders and followers. Such exchanges can be positive in nature, such as the giving of praise for a job well done. They can also be more punitive, such as taking corrective action when a follower fails to reach performance targets. As described in more below, the predominant emphasis of the leadership course in the current study was on transformational, rather than transactional, leadership.</p>
<sec id="section2-1548051812457416">
<title>Can Transformational Leadership Be Developed or Learned?</title>
<p>The extent to which transformational leadership may be developed in prospective leaders remains an ongoing controversy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812457416">Bass (1990)</xref> maintained that “transformational leadership can be learned, and it can—and should—be the subject of management training and development” (p. 27). On the other hand, theorists have considered the charismatic basis for transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812457416">Bass, 1985</xref>), and thus, it might be questionable as to whether such a quality can really be developed in individuals.</p>
<p>This debate notwithstanding, some research has provided evidence that transformational leadership behaviors can indeed be strengthened. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812457416">Avolio (1994)</xref> examined the development of transformational leadership by linking life events and experiences to ratings of leadership for a group of 182 community leaders who represented a diverse profile of individuals from both the profit and not-for-profit sectors. He found that favorable experiences in elementary and high school predicted transformational leadership as an adult. Furthermore, although results vary, findings from quasi and true field experiments provide some evidence that leaders can indeed be trained to display transformational behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812457416">Barling, Weber, and Kelloway (1996)</xref> conducted a field experiment with 20 managers trained in transformational leadership and compared them with control groups. They found positive training effects on the managers’ intellectual stimulation behavior. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812457416">Kelloway, Barling, and Helleur (2000)</xref> investigated the effect of leadership training and counseling feedback on subordinates’ perceptions of transformational leadership, using 40 organizational leaders in a 2 (training) × 2 (feedback) research design. They showed that both training and feedback resulted in increased subordinate perceptions of leaders’ transformational leadership.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812457416">Dvir, Eden, Avolio, and Shamir (2002)</xref> conducted a field experiment using a sample of Israeli Defense Force infantry platoon commanders. They found that the platoon commanders who had undergone training were more transformational, demonstrated less passive leadership, and were less likely to engage in management-by-exception behavior. A comparison group did not demonstrate the same effects. They further found that in contrast to the comparison group, the platoons led by the leaders trained in transformational leadership had higher senses of self-efficacy and belonging and scored higher on measures of objective performance 6 months following training. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812457416">Parry and Sinha (2005)</xref> conducted quasi–field experiment research to test the effectiveness of transformational leadership training. They found that the display of all transformational leadership factors (i.e., idealized influence, individualized consideration, inspiration motivation, and intellectual stimulation) and contingent reward behaviors can be increased through training. Interestingly, they found a reduction in the display of passive transactional leadership behavior as a result of the training, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812457416">Dvir et al.’s (2002)</xref> findings.</p>
<p>Much of the research cited above dealing with the development of transformational leadership capabilities has taken place using people in existing leadership positions. We are aware of no research in classroom settings involving students. One potential problem is that students are often not in leadership roles, especially in the case of younger or undergraduate students. Thus, it may be difficult to both identify and measure their behavior, especially in terms of complex or involved phenomena such as transformational leadership. However, research has suggested that it is precisely at this stage of their development that leadership capabilities may form, which may be subsequently related to their future success, as well as the success of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812457416">Avolio, Rotundo, &amp; Walumbwa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812457416">Waldman &amp; Korbar, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We suggest that at this early stage in their development, students may form key motives, values, and aspects of identity that could shape their future actions and behaviors as leaders. Similar observations led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day and Harrison (2007)</xref> to suggest that leader development should increasingly focus on building the leader identities of individuals. When one thinks of herself or himself as a leader, she or he is likely to be motivated to act like a leader and develop leadership skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>). Indeed, MTL and LRI are relevant to the acceleration of developmental readiness of leaders as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812457416">Hannah and Avolio (2010)</xref>. Accordingly, we examine these two variables, which are likely to set the stage for future transformational leadership development and behavior.</p>

<title>Motivation to Lead and Leader Role Identity</title>
<sec id="section4-1548051812457416">
<title>Motivation to lead</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812457416">Chan and Drasgow (2001)</xref> described MTL in terms of three dimensions. First, the affective-identity aspect is characterized by enjoying opportunities to lead, a tendency to take charge, and viewing oneself as having intrinsic leadership qualities. Second, the social-normative aspect stresses leadership as being valuable to organizations and as an honor, privilege, and duty. Third, the noncalculative aspect emphasizes overlooking the potential personal costs associated with leading.</p>
<p>The structure of these dimensions is not altogether clear. Although there is some conceptual basis for treating MTL as a unified construct, there is also empirical evidence that the dimensions should be delineated and that they constitute three separate factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812457416">Chan &amp; Drasgow, 2001</xref>). In the current study, we chose to separate the dimensions, and indeed only focus on the social-normative aspect. That dimension was mentioned in the syllabus of the leadership course (described in more detail below) in terms of the course purpose, and it was also emphasized continually in class discussions. In other words, students were taught the value of leadership in organizations and encouraged to believe that leading is both a privilege and an obligation. Reinforcing that notion, they were further presented with evidence that there may be an underemphasis on leadership practices and principles in the real world of organizations. Accordingly, it was stressed that it is their obligation to show leadership in current or future positions when the need arises. In contrast, the affective-identity dimension was not seen as relevant, since leadership was not conceptualized in the class as simply taking or being “in charge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812457416">Chan &amp; Drasgow, 2001</xref>, p. 486). In addition, students were discouraged to believe that leadership was an intrinsic trait, or something with which an individual is born. Moreover, we did not form a prediction pertaining to the noncalculative dimension, since students were not encouraged (or discouraged) to think in noncalculative terms with regard to engaging in leadership.</p>

<sec id="section5-1548051812457416">
<title>Leader role identity</title>
<p>In general, identification is a process through which people define themselves, communicate that definition to others, and use that definition to proceed through various aspects of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812457416">Ashforth, Harrison, &amp; Corley, 2008</xref>). Identification with a particular role involves viewing a “role’s defining essence as self-defining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812457416">Ashforth et al., 2008</xref>, p. 329), and it results in behaviors that are aligned with the identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812457416">Thatcher &amp; Zhu, 2006</xref>). More specifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812457416">DeRue et al. (2009)</xref> depicted leader identity in terms of an internalized state whereby an individual incorporates the leader role into his or her self-concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812457416">DeRue and Ashford (2010)</xref> further argued that the development of leader identity represents a social construction process whereby such an identity will be stronger when, for a given individual, the leader role is granted by potential followers.</p>
<p>We concur that leader identity can be somewhat context specific, depending on specific relationships that are formed between the leader and followers. However, at the same time, we argue that identification with the leader role, or LRI, can also be a basic part of an individual’s self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812457416">Kark, Shamir, &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812457416">Walumbwa &amp; Hartnell, 2011</xref>). That is, LRI can be conceptualized more globally (i.e., across contexts) as “the sub-component of one’s identity that relates to being a leader or how one thinks of oneself as a leader” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>, p. 365). In addition, LRI can emphasize a particular framework, such as transformational leadership. Furthermore, we argue below that it can have an impact in early educational experiences, such as undergraduate business education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812457416">Avolio, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Learning Context and Hypotheses</title>
<p>In the current study, we compared students in sections of an undergraduate course on leadership in organizations with those in an introduction course to managerial principles. Apart from some obvious course differences in terms of content (e.g., use of a leadership vs. a managerial principles textbook), two key factors were unique with regard to the leadership course. First, much of the course content emphasized the value and use of transformational leadership behavior and skills. Indeed, related topics were also linked in the course to transformational leadership, such as strategic/visionary leadership, ethical/responsible leadership, and leadership oriented toward organizational change. Accordingly, we focused our predictions of LRI specifically in terms of identification with the transformational leadership role.</p>
<p>Second, behavior-modeling principles were largely applied as a learning strategy. Behavior modeling is an approach to learning that is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812457416">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> social learning theory, which stresses attention, retention, reproduction, and motivational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812457416">Baldwin, 1992</xref>). Typically, it has been used in industry to identify well-defined behaviors or skills for trainees to learn, such as supervisory, sales, and customer service skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812457416">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). The basic idea is that trainees are introduced to the specific behaviors or skills to be learned. They then view a model on video, attempt to reproduce the behavior or skills, get feedback on those attempts, and then become motivated to engage in the newly-learned behavior or skills on the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812457416">Baldwin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812457416">Decker &amp; Nathan, 1985</xref>). To a large extent, the behavior-modeling technique has shown positive effects in terms of trainee learning and application to on-the-job behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812457416">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although well-defined behaviors or skills have generally been the focus (e.g., a specific type of sales pitch), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812457416">Mayer and Russell (1987)</xref> suggested that values or attitudes pertaining to broader behavioral phenomena could be relevant to the behavior modeling approach. That is, forms of leadership, such as transformational leadership, could be targeted through behavior modeling by focusing on belief systems and attitudinal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812457416">Mayer &amp; Russell, 1987</xref>). In short, the targeted learning could involve beliefs/values and attitudes on the part of learners. Our learners were largely students who did not currently hold leadership positions. Accordingly, the successful application of transformational leadership behavior in an on-the-job setting did not constitute a practical learning outcome. However, it was practical to attempt to influence their MTL and LRI, which, as previously noted, are likely to be important precursors to future leader development activities and behaviors.</p>
<p>In the current research, in an attempt to affect these outcomes, we applied a modified approach to behavior modeling that stressed the attentional and motivational aspects of the process. A quasi-experimental, leadership class was organized largely around the presentation of videos that demonstrated primarily positive aspects of transformational leadership and related concepts. Thus, models were shown in the videos demonstrating behaviors and beliefs/values relevant to transformational leadership (e.g., individualized consideration, visionary communication, ethical reasoning, and so forth).</p>
<p>Two approaches were taken to maximize the students’ attention and motivation. First, although positive models of transformational leadership were emphasized (e.g., a leader showing individualized consideration by learning the names, interests, and needs of followers at lower levels in an organization), we also used models who showed more challenging or controversial behavior. The controversial models revealed aspects of “tough love,” showing courage or standing up for principles or values (e.g., standing up to or even firing followers who might violate ethical standards or those who try to sabotage change efforts or one’s standing as a leader), and so forth. In these instances, students could see that transformational leadership may in some instances be controversial and challenging and even create conflict. As such, it was more realistic and thus motivational for the students.</p>
<p>Second, the videos featured a combination of well-known as well as unknown (to the students) leaders. The former included individuals such as Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines. The students’ familiarity with such leaders tended to involve a general knowledge of the leaders’ company/organizations, expertises, accomplishments, and successes. This familiarity facilitated discussion of the potential outcomes and benefits of the modeled leadership behaviors. However, we also featured less-known leaders who were at lower levels and, oftentimes, much closer in age to the students. Moreover, we featured leaders of various race/ethnic backgrounds and gender. Exposing individuals to such a diversity of models has been found to be effective at gaining the attention and motivating prospective learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812457416">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). Students seemed to highly identify with peer examples, and it may have made it easier for the students to imagine themselves in the situations that they observed.</p>
<p>In line with the principles of behavior modeling, each video was preceded by a presentation of learning principles. These principles and actions of the models were then discussed at multiple points in a respective video (i.e., points at which the video was stopped for class discussion) as well as at the video’s end. Students were encouraged to consider how the learning principles were shown by the model, why they were important, and how they could be shown in current and future behavior. Positive reinforcement was given throughout the discussion by both the instructor and fellow classmates. Furthermore, and as described below, other experiential activities (e.g., role-plays, cases, and guest speakers) were used to reinforce learning in the videos.</p>
<p>In sum, using a Solomon four-group design, we compared three sections of a leadership class based largely on behavior-modeling principles with three sections of an introduction to management course that served as a control group. We predicted the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1548051812457416" list-type="simple">

<title>Participants, Experimental Design, and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants included 251 junior- and senior-level students enrolled in an undergraduate business program at a major public university in the United States. These students were enrolled in either (a) a course on introduction to management or (b) a course on leadership in organizations. There were three sections of the introduction to management course and three sections of the leadership course. The size of the sections ranged from 37 to 66 students. Both courses were required in the curriculum. The former course was a prerequisite for the latter, and students generally took the leadership course soon after the introduction to management course. Students chose their sections for these courses, so we can not claim a pure, random assignment to one of the four groups described in the experimental design described below. However, we compared students in these courses (and the various sections) in terms of age, gender, number of separate full-time jobs held, number of years of work experience, and number of years of work experience in a supervisory position. We found no significant differences between students in the two courses (and the various sections) based on these variables. The mean age across participants was 24.5 years, and approximately 46% of the students were female. The average number of previous jobs held was two, average work experience was 4.5 years, and average experience in supervisory positions was 1.5 years. Accordingly, these students could be characterized as nontraditional in that most of them had held (or currently held) jobs in fields such as sales, customer service, clerical/administrative, and manufacturing. Moreover, some of them had held supervisory positions.</p>
<p>We used a Solomon four-group design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812457416">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963</xref>) to guide our data collection. An advantage of this approach is that it allows for an examination of the effects of testing (i.e., simply administering a pretest of MTL and LRI), as well as the effects of maturation and history with regard to study participants. Maturation and history are both potential threats to the internal validity of studies. Graphically, the design that we used was the following:</p>

</p>
<p>where R pertains to a quasi-random assignment (as described above), O refers to an observation or assessment of participants, and X refers to the treatment—in this case, the leadership course. Thus, O<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> represent the pretest and posttest of a group of treatment group participants (<italic>N</italic> = 48), O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>4</sub> represent the pretest and posttest of a group of control group participants in the introduction to management course (<italic>N</italic> = 40), O<sub>5</sub> represents the posttest only of a group of treatment group participants (<italic>N</italic> = 74), and O<sub>6</sub> represents the posttest only of a group of control group participants (<italic>N</italic> = 89).</p>
<p>Two additional things should be noted with regard to this design. First, for the pretest/posttest groups, students were eliminated if they did not complete both the pretest and the posttest. This happened in a few instances in which students dropped the course or were not present for either of the assessments. They were also eliminated in the few instances in which they were simultaneously enrolled in both courses. Second, students in the leadership course were taught by Instructor A, whereas students in the introduction to management course were taught by Instructor B. Accordingly, it is possible that effects might be simply because of the quality of the instructor. However, an examination of course evaluations suggested no significant differences between instructors in terms of students’ perceptions of their effectiveness. That is, there were no significant differences in terms of either the students’ perceptions of instructor effectiveness or the overall value of the course.</p>
<p>Demographic information as well as MTL and LRI measures were collected at each survey administration. The pretest occurred the first day of each respective class, whereas the posttest occurred on the last day. Pretest and posttest surveys were identical and began with the statement that the purpose of the data collection was “to better understand outcomes based on participation in this course.” Students were also told that their participation was voluntary, it would not affect their course grades, and answers to survey items would remain confidential. To be able to match pretest and posttest surveys, students were requested to put their names on each. However, they were assured that their names would not be identified with the research and would be deleted once data were coded and analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1548051812457416">
<title>Treatment Videos</title>
<p>As already described above, the use of video presentations constituted the core of our behavior-modeling approach in the leadership course. These videos were based predominantly on the Leadership in Focus collection produced by the Center for Leadership Development and Research at Stanford University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leadershipinfocus.net/2-0/index.cfm?Event=location.index&amp;CFID=194982&amp;CFTOKEN=55693894">http://www.leadershipinfocus.net/2-0/index.cfm?Event=location.index&amp;CFID=194982&amp;CFTOKEN=55693894</ext-link>). In total, we used 22 of these videos. Although several of the videos featured prominent leaders who provided perspectives on effective leadership (e.g., CEOs including Herb Kelleher and Anne Mulcahy), the majority of the videos employed less known individuals in a variety of organizations in the public and private sectors. These individuals were typically at low- to mid-level management positions.</p>
<p>Most of the Leadership in Focus videos that we used presented a case problem. The problem would be discussed with students prior to showing the video, and principles from course learning would be articulated. Then the various segments (i.e., typically three or four segments per video) would be shown. In the first segment, the featured leader would describe a problem that she or he had faced in his or her organization. The instructor would pause the video after that segment for class discussion, which would include student input in how they thought the leader would end up addressing the problem, as well as how they themselves would have addressed it based on course learning. Then in the second segment, students would get more information about how the problem was actually handled by the leader through his or her explanation and, oftentimes, through reenactments of his or her actual behavior. When that segment ended, the video was again paused for further class discussion. In addition, the second or third segments would feature the leader’s perceptions of outcomes. This process continued until the end of the video. It should further be noted that the videos also frequently depicted the role models espousing values and beliefs relevant to social-normative MTL or LRI, as described further below.</p>
<p>As an example, one video featured a young, middle manager from the Dell Corporation. This individual described his problem of trying to gain the trust of individuals two layers below him in the organization. To accomplish this goal, he did things such as going to staff meetings involving line workers, getting to know these people as individuals (e.g., their likes and dislikes), learning their names, learning about equipment needs that they might have to be able to do their jobs better, and so forth. The instructor used the video to illustrate the value of individualized consideration, which as mentioned above, is one of the components of transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812457416">Bass &amp; Avolio, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812457416">Bass &amp; Bass, 2008</xref>). As a result of the video, students could have a better feel for individualized consideration and how they themselves might be able to employ it in their current and future endeavors. In addition, they could see a role model espousing the need to show leadership and to incorporate individualized consideration in his behavior repertoire. The same process was used with other videos and role models in terms of demonstrations of other aspects of transformational leadership dimensions, including idealized influence, inspirational motivation, and intellectual stimulation.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, other experiential techniques were used in the leadership course. These included written cases, a few role-play exercises, and occasional guest speakers. These methods were also used to reinforce transformational leadership or related concepts, as was done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812457416">Dvir et al.’s (2002)</xref> field study. However, the Leadership in Focus videos, and associated behavior-modeling principles, constituted the most consistently applied method for reinforcing transformational leadership concepts and their importance. It should further be noted that experiential techniques, including the use of videos, were also employed in the introduction to management classes. However, there was no attempt to incorporate behavioral modeling in those classes.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>In the survey that was administered at pretest and posttest, we assessed three types of variables: (a) demographic characteristics, (b) MTL, and (c) LRI.</p>
<sec id="section11-1548051812457416">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>As discussed previously, demographic variables were collected to ensure that differences in the outcomes of the two courses could be attributed to differences in the course instruction and not to differences in the makeup of the students in the two courses. Specifically, we collected age, gender, number of separate full-time jobs held, number of years of work experience, and number of years of work experience in a supervisory position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1548051812457416">
<title>Social-normative MTL</title>
<p>Social-normative MTL was assessed using the nine-item social-normative subscale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812457416">Chan and Drasgow’s (2001)</xref> MTL measure. All items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Sample items include “It is an honor and privilege to be asked to lead” and “It is appropriate for people to accept leadership roles or positions when they are asked.” For comparison purposes, the affective-identity and noncalculative subscales of MTL were also collected. Each of these measures also contained nine items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1548051812457416">
<title>Leader role identity</title>
<p>LRI was measured using a version of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812457416">Galvin (2010)</xref> seven-item measure. Respondents were given a description of the transformational leader role and then asked to rate items assessing their level of identification with the role. All items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. A full version of the measure can be found as “Role 1” in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1548051812457416">appendix</xref>. For comparison purposes, identification with the transactional leader role was also measured (see “Role 2” in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1548051812457416">appendix</xref>). We did not anticipate a positive change in identification with the transactional leader role, since the leadership course was focused predominantly on transformational aspects of leadership.</p>

<p>As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812457416">Campbell and Stanley (1963)</xref>, before conducting tests of hypotheses, we performed several analyses of variance to determine if pretesting and maturation may have influenced posttest scores. In each case, the interaction of the course (i.e., leadership vs. introduction to management) and whether or not the individual took the pretest was not significantly related to any of the outcome variables of interest. Our subsequent analyses were based on the approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812457416">DeTienne and Chandler (2004)</xref> to examine hypotheses assessing the influence of classroom instruction on particular outcomes. We used paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests to examine the relationships in Hypotheses 1a and 1b. These tests assessed the influence of the training on levels of social-normative MTL and transformational LRI. We compared the pre- and posttest mean scores to determine if the students’ social-normative MTL and transformational LRI tended to increase after completing the leadership course.</p>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812457416">Table 2</xref>, both Hypotheses 1a and 1b received support in that there were significant increases with regard to pre- versus posttest scores for both social-normative MTL and <italic>transformational</italic> LRI in the leadership course. No such increases were found in the introduction to management course. For comparison purposes, we also examined mean pre- versus posttest scores of <italic>transactional</italic> LRI (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1548051812457416">appendix</xref>). As expected, there were no significant differences in the pre- and posttest scores for either the experimental or the control conditions for <italic>transactional</italic> LRI. Collectively, these findings provide initial evidence supporting the idea that leadership training in the classroom, with an emphasis on behavior-modeling methods stressing the importance of transformational leadership, has the potential to increase social-normative MTL and transformational LRI among undergraduate students.</p>

<p>To examine Hypotheses 2a and 2b, we used independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests. These tests assessed whether or not students in our sample who completed the leadership course tended to have higher posttest social-normative MTL and transformational LRI, as compared with students who had not taken the leadership course. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1548051812457416">Table 3</xref>, Hypothesis 2a received support in that the posttest social-normative scores of students in the leadership course were significantly higher than students in the introduction to management course. However, Hypothesis 2b received only modest support in that the difference between classes with regard to transformational LRI was only marginally significant (i.e., <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). These findings provide additional evidence that behavior-modeling methods emphasizing the importance of transformational leadership will result in a higher degree of social-normative MTL and a stronger LRI based on transformational leadership, as compared with students in an introduction to management course serving as a control group. It is further interesting to note that <italic>transactional</italic> LRI was found to be significantly lower among the students who completed the leadership course, as compared with the mean score of the students who took the introduction to management course. Transactional leadership is actually somewhat in line with the more managerial approach to dealing with people that was indeed emphasized in the introduction to management course.</p>

<p>As post hoc analyses, we also conducted analyses comparing the pre- and posttest mean scores for both affective-identity MTL and noncalculative MTL. We further compared the posttest scores of the treatment and control groups for both variables. There were no significant changes in these variables after taking either course. The affective-identity MTL posttest scores were similar for both classes. However, noncalculative MTL was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) for the groups who took the leadership course. Evidently, the leadership students had more of a tendency to overlook the potential personal costs associated with leading.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although many organizations emphasize leadership development, empirical research in this area has been relatively lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812457416">Avolio, Reichard, et al., 2009</xref>). In the current research, we conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine the development of MTL and LRI. As predicted, we found that students attending a leadership course emphasizing transformational leadership and a behavior-modeling approach achieved higher social-normative MTL and transformational LRI, as compared with students in an introduction to management course. No such effects were obtained for transactional LRI. Furthermore, post hoc analyses revealed that leadership students had lower posttest scores with regard to transactional LRI, as compared with the introduction to management students. Taken together, in line with the arguments of prior authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812457416">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812457416">DeRue et al., 2009</xref>), our findings suggest that it is possible to have an impact on individuals’ MTL and their identification with particular leadership roles—in this case, transformational leadership.</p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest several theoretical and research implications. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the first study to demonstrate how leadership education emphasizing behavior modeling can be used to develop motivational or identity factors relevant to effective leadership. As such, it reinforces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812457416">Mayer and Russell’s (1987)</xref> ideas suggesting that behavior modeling techniques may not only have an effect on specific behavioral change. That is, it may also affect attitudinal or belief systems. Thus, our findings may be seen as an extension of behavior-modeling research efforts to attitudinal or belief systems such as MTL and LRI.</p>
<p>Second, our findings suggest that behavior modeling may provide an initial technique for ultimately generating transformational leadership behaviors. However, over time, mediating variables in this process may include MTL and LRI. Future research might verify the mediating link of MTL and LRI between behavior modeling and the realization of actual transformational leadership behaviors. Such mediating variables may be found to be especially important to developing a consistent and long-term orientation toward behaviors that are characteristic of transformational leadership.</p>
<p>Third, our study can provide insights for an understanding of the developmental readiness of current or future leaders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812457416">Hannah and Avolio (2010)</xref> recently suggested the relevance of variables such as goal orientation and developmental efficacy. We would argue for the inclusion of both MTL and LRI in conceptualizations of leader developmental readiness. That is, the variables examined here may help further our understanding of such readiness, or how to “develop developmental readiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812457416">Hannah &amp; Avolio, 2010</xref>, p. 1184). With that said, the generalizability of our findings to leader trainees in organizational settings is yet to be demonstrated. Nevertheless, we can envision situations in which the development of MTL and LRI may be a critical first step for trainees. For example, individuals who show a high degree of technical competence or performance in lower level jobs are often promoted to leadership positions. It may be beneficial for initial development activities to stress the viability, as well as desirability, of effective leadership behaviors (e.g., transformational leadership) prior to direct efforts to build actual skills or behaviors. Perhaps the type of behavior-modeling approach described here can boost MTL and LRI relatively quickly, while setting the stage for further development. Developmental efforts tied to MTL and LRI may also provide opportunities for early identification of individuals with high leadership potential.</p>
<sec id="section16-1548051812457416">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>Practically, this study contributes insights that may be useful for instructional effectiveness and future leader development initiatives. Specifically, business school programs and organizations seeking to enhance and/or develop transformational leadership might first focus on MTL and LRI variables. Furthermore, to potentially affect such variables, instructional techniques should include behavior-modeling approaches. Techniques of this nature can help individuals develop to their leadership potential by first affecting their MTL, as well as their identity as leaders.</p>
<p>Behavior modeling may also be valuable for online education applications. Videos could be initially presented and discussed online. They could then be subsequently stored using online courseware and later revisited by students as demonstrations of particular aspects of effective leadership. It might be interesting to examine the effects of traditional versus online uses of behavior-modeling techniques to develop leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to applications in educational settings, an organization might generate short videos that portray effective leader models, especially those who tout the value of leadership within the organization. Examples might include the founder or current, high-level leaders of the organization. Individuals could examine such material on their own, perhaps before meeting with mentors or coming together for leadership development activities. In short, the goal would be to expose future leaders to role models who espouse the value of leadership and the importance of identifying with the leader role.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, video presentations constituted the core of our behavior-modeling approach in the leadership course. However, as discussed above, the videos were supplemented by guest speakers and in-class cases and role-plays. In real-world organizations, similar approaches may also prove to be beneficial and enhance development. Guest speakers from within the organization, who discuss their real-world experiences implementing the concepts being taught, may prove especially useful. Such speakers would likely provide opportunities for the learners to ask questions and dig deeper into the specific issues or challenges that may be especially relevant to their organization, and may also provide a higher level of personalization to the approach. This approach may be especially useful when done in a series with guest speakers from diverse parts of the organization. Individuals seeking to implement the behavior-modeling approach may also provide participants opportunities to engage in simulations or other action-oriented classroom experiences that challenge them to implement the approaches being taught in situations that involve relevant complexity and contextual challenges. Such experiences would likely reinforce the behaviors and would provide additional opportunities for feedback and discussion regarding challenges, best practices, and learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1548051812457416">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>We should note several issues pertaining to our research that have implications for future work. First, our approach is quasi-experimental in nature. As such, it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the behavior-modeling principles and techniques truly accounted for our effects, as opposed to other aspects of the approach used in the leadership course. For example, it is possible that simply the introduction of transformational leadership concepts in the leadership class accounted for our results. However, anonymous written comments in the leadership course suggested that the videos did indeed matter. Example comments include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1548051812457416" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“I loved all the videos, especially the one with the female Army Captain who had to deal with the insubordinate male sergeant. They helped me a lot to understand the full concept that was being taught in that class.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“I thought this class was very productive and enhanced my learning. It was nice to see actual videos on various leaders and their issues and how they handled their situations.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“The content of this class was very interesting, and I found the multiple video cases helpful.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite these comments, we encourage future research to more systematically evaluate potential effects based specifically on behavior modeling. Relatedly, it may be a misnomer to label the introduction to management course as a <italic>control</italic> group. These individuals might more accurately reflect a <italic>comparison</italic> group that can be used to at least help rule out simple maturation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812457416">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963</xref>), since increases in MTL and LRI were seen only in the leadership course. Moreover, the comparison group allowed us to rule out explanations based on instructor quality, since there were no significant differences with regard to this variable between the two courses.</p>
<p>Although there were no significant differences in terms of either the students’ perceptions of instructor effectiveness or their perceived overall value of the course, we acknowledge that additional measures, which would allow us to ascertain potential differences in instructor quality, could have improved the rigor of our study. Future studies may be strengthened by having instructor quality assessed by third-party raters, who are not participating in the course, or by providing other externally valid methods of comparison that might diminish potential concerns with differences in instructor quality.</p>
<p>Second, it is important to acknowledge that there are some potential limitations with our sample related to the generalizeability of the findings to other groups (e.g., executives). It is possible that students with limited work experience (i.e., average of 4.5 years) and supervisory experience (i.e., average of 1.5 years) may be more susceptible to changes in MTL and LRI than more experienced individuals. For instance, experienced executives may have more deeply ingrained self-concepts and identities that are less malleable or plastic, making them less susceptible to changes in MTL and LRI. More experienced individuals may need additional exposure to behavioral modeling in order to achieve similar outcomes to those achieved with less experienced undergraduates. Alternatively, more experienced individuals may find the behavioral modeling more impactful than undergraduates because of the potential relevance and usefulness to current role demands and work situations.</p>
<p>Third, the current intervention involved a solitary leadership course. The question arises as to the effects on MTL and LRI if an entire curriculum was devoted to transformational leadership development. Arguably, our attained effects represent a conservative estimate, which could be maximized by the continual reinforcement of transformational leadership principles across a curriculum. Such continuity could help solidify students’ MTL and LRI. A more ongoing approach may also be useful in leadership development efforts within actual organizations. In short, future research may consider whether changes in MTL and LRI are enduring in the single course format. It may be that more comprehensive and long-term approaches tend to be more effective in creating enduring changes to MTL and LRI. Because of the differences in postcourse plans (e.g., internships, work experience, additional coursework) of the students in our sample, it would have been difficult to ascertain whether or not the observed changes were sustained, or the causes of any lack of sustainability. However, future research in more controlled settings may seek to determine whether such changes endure and which factors (e.g., content review) might enhance the probability that changes in MTL and LRI will endure.</p>
<p>Fourth, as suggested in the prior discussion, future research might examine the effects of MTL and LRI on subsequent behavior and outcomes of students and other new leaders in their early careers. Presumably, those individuals with higher scores are more likely to actually engage in transformational leadership behavior in future positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812457416">Galvin, 2010</xref>). As a result, they could realize early career success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812457416">Waldman and Korbar (2004)</xref> provide a model for conducting longitudinal research of this nature. Future research that demonstrates behavioral outcomes of achieved changes in MTL and LRI in the workplace would also help show that changes that occur in the classroom, or in training settings, are not simply the result of a halo effect that might have been created for leadership by the course content. It would also help demonstrate that such changes endure and result in the desired behavior on the job.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study provides a demonstration of how leadership instruction in a classroom setting can be used for the purpose of developing one’s MTL, as well as to strengthen one’s identity as a leader. Variables of this nature may represent the basis of subsequent behavior in actual leadership positions. As such, it may behoove researchers and instructors to devote more attention to their development among students in business programs, as well as individuals who enter leadership positions in organizations.</p>
