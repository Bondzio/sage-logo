<p>Through the festive season gone by, I was struggling to cope with the havoc that some infinitesimally small virus was causing within me. It ravaged my digestive system, caused the dormant asthma to flare up and made my well exercised calf muscles feel like concrete. And when after a couple of days I was feeling well, it came back again. But many in the UK were similarly bothered at this time; in fact some where far worse which meant they were admitted to hospital. Going up and downstairs to different wards attending to my duties was not exercise – it felt like punishment. And during periods of enforced inactivity (Bank Holidays as we call them) I pondered over a certain lack of rigour in scientific communication that is evident in papers, book chapters and even grant applications. It is difficult enough to get timely review of scientific articles; for some years IJLEW used to check out the accuracy of its citations. We need to stretch beyond that; and in the age of electronic publication when e-journals and free e-journals offer unchallenged space, quality will be expensive but always essential.</p>
<p>Talking of quality, I have just attended the first meeting of this year: Diabetes Summit 2013 was held in Chennai, India over 18, 19 January 2013 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ibhi.in">www.ibhi.in</ext-link>). Some 800 delegates participated in this “showcase” of academic, healthcare and industry achievements in the United Kingdom and India to share and learn. The UK will have learnt much from the success of work done in the primary care sector in Kerala and Tamil Nadu (both in Southern India). Keynote Lectures were presented by Andrew Boulton (Manchester, UK) whose experience stretch back to meeting Paul Brand at his clinic in Karigiri and Mark Hanson, Southampton UK who impressed the need for promoting prevention of non communicable diseases at the highest levels. Mike Nithaviriankis, Deputy High Commissioner for the United Kingdom and Prithvi Mohandas did very well to get Minister of Health Anna Soubry (UK) and her counterpart from New Delhi to attend the meeting and associated exhibition. We need governments everywhere to push prevention of diabetes even to cope with the burden. Are nutrition and exercise key to success?</p>
