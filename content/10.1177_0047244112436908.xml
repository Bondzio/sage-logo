<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the ideology of Slow Food (SF), an influential movement founded in Italy in 1986. Through an analysis of a wide range of texts, ranging from SF’s opposition to fast food to its ambition to establish a new ‘gastronomic science’ and a new ‘development model’ based on the three criteria of <italic>buono</italic> (good), <italic>pulito</italic> (clean) and <italic>giusto</italic> (tasty), the article concludes that SF is a descendant of the countercultural and anti-consumerist movements of the 1960s and 70s. It also claims that SF’s understanding of the capitalist system is limited, that its idea of a new agriculture and a new economy is simply that of returning to a primitive, pre-industrial economy (without explaining how that economy could feed the present world population), that its ideal of a new world is that of a stratified and immutable society, and that its main goal is to combine the commercial promotion of high-price luxury food products with political engagement.</p>

<body>
<p>During the 2008 Italian elections, the manifestos of three major political parties set out their goals as far as agriculture was concerned: the development of short supply chains; the introduction of farmers’ markets; the struggle against bio-piracy and the abandonment of rural areas; and support for organic farming. All these goals have been vigorously supported by Slow Food (SF) for many years.</p>
<p>In this paper, I intend to study the ideology of SF. Ideology, in this case, means not only a systematic view of the world but also a false conscience, socially determined, which conceals the true nature of social relations and processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047244112436908">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>After a short description of SF and its origins, I shall address the movement’s connections with counterculture, its complex relations with gluttony, its ideas of pleasure, its conception of gastronomy and its views on science. I shall examine SF’s opposition to ‘industrial’ farming, its critique of growth, and its suggestions for a different kind of development. Finally, the article will describe the key elements of SF ideology: the ideas of tradition, of a new consumer, and of a new engagement through food consumption.</p>
<p>Formerly called ArciGola, SF was founded in 1986 by Carlo Petrini, and became an international association in 1989. Today it has around 90,000 members, with centres in seven countries and followers in 130, divided into approximately 800 basic units called <italic>convivia</italic> or <italic>condotte</italic>, which organize courses, tasting panels, dinners, travel and promotions, etc. In Italy, SF owns a publishing house, maintains two magazines and operates a service company (SlowFood Promozione S.r.l.). It has created, together with public and private bodies, not-for-profit entities such as the Fondazione SlowFood per la Biodiversità, a university for gastronomic studies, a wine bank, the Mother Earth (Terra Madre) Foundation and so on. It also organizes the so-called Presìdi, devoted to the preservation and defence of rare foods, as well as events such as the Saloni del Gusto, Cheese, SlowFish, and many others. It is a true multinational entity, capable of raising funds on a large scale, of concluding cooperation agreements with governments and large corporations, and of mobilizing politicians and prominent personalities with divergent political opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047244112436908">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>SF’s main goals are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0047244112436908" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>placing the right emphasis on the pleasure of food, and learning how to appreciate different recipes and tastes, in order to recognize the various places and skills of production, and to respect the rhythms of the seasons and of the <italic>convivium</italic>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sustaining the education of taste as a defence against poor quality, food fraud and the standardization of our meals;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>safeguarding local cuisines, traditional production systems, and vegetable and animal species at risk of extinction;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sustaining a new model of agriculture that is less intensive and cleaner;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>defending biodiversity and the right of the people to food sovereignty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047244112436908">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>SF was created in the late 1980s by people feeling a ‘snobbish distaste for that consumerist and TV-addicted Italy’ and a desire to ‘contain this barbaric invasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 92). Its origins date back to a reaction to the first Italian fast-food outlets (the first McDonald’s restaurant in Italy opened in 1985), but from the very beginning it was opposed not just to a food model but to an entire culture: ‘fast food was backed by a new culture and a new civilization having one value only: profit. Pleasure is totally incompatible with productivity, since the time spent in its pursuit is subtracted from production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 90–1). Thus, in the SF Manifesto, we read that modern civilization started under ‘the signs of dynamism and acceleration’, taking the machine as a model for man himself and velocity as the ‘dominant ideal’.<italic>’</italic>SF proposes to ‘defeat the virus of fast’, opposing the ‘dynamic life’, an ‘easy life’: ‘May suitable doses of guaranteed sensual pleasure and slow, long-lasting enjoyment preserve us from the contagion of the multitude that mistakes frenzy for efficiency.’ This is SF’s ‘modest proposal for a gradual as well as progressive recovery of man, both as an individual and as a species, in the long-delayed process of environmental reclamation, in order to make life liveable again, starting from basic desires’. And the proof is easy:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>people devoted to fast rhythms and efficiency are mostly stupid and sad: it suffices to look at them … It is under the symbol of the snail that we shall recognise the lovers of material culture and those who still treasure the slow enjoyment of pleasures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 93–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many things in this text are remarkable. First, the description of a consumer of fast food being a ‘barbarian’, ‘stupid and sad’, and even the victim of a ‘virus’, recalls almost literally a de-humanized man, devoted to the pursuit of low, materialistic or even diabolic aims, which many traditionalist authors have handed down. Moreover, the identification of speed as a fundamental feature of modern life (of ‘industrial civilization’) is also a <italic>topos</italic> of the critique of modernity dating back to the first reactions to the Industrial Revolution,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047244112436908">4</xref></sup> and which today is echoed by many Italian intellectuals. Last, the equation of modernity to the worship of the machine is also a <italic>locus classicus</italic> of the critiques of the Industrial Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047244112436908">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is above all striking that SF ignores the fact that fast food (i.e. food rapidly bought and eaten outside the home) has always existed, from ancient Rome to medieval China, from seventeenth-century France to pre-Columbian America. On the other hand, what is very recent and typical of modern bourgeois civilization – save for limited circles of privileged people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2001</xref>: 38–9) – is precisely the meal slowly consumed at the family table. It is therefore wrong to consider fast food as a modern phenomenon.</p>
<p>By its own admission SF’s hostility to fast food is due to cultural reasons: namely, fast food would upset the ‘“mores”, the “customs”, the complex of habits and behaviours followed by a people, with no law to impose them. Fast food with its planetary standardization has totally erased these traditions, these “mores”, as regards eating’ and it is, by consequence, and in the etymological sense, ‘immoral’. Even conceding ‘that consumers of fast food get the same pleasure from it [that] others get from a glass of Barolo or from a dinner in good company’, SF would nonetheless object: ‘how could we renounce the habits, rhythms and cultural layers which form our history, our identity, without incurring the risk of turning ourselves into barbarians?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>The major weakness of this kind of criticism is that it is based on the untested conviction that consumption of certain products (comics, photo stories, quiz games or fast food) cannot be aesthetically enjoyed<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047244112436908">6</xref></sup> and cannot have another rational justification; the success of that product, therefore, must be due to propaganda such as mass media or advertising, to mass conformism, or to the decay and debasement of culture. But the premises of this argument are not only elitist<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047244112436908">7</xref></sup> but unproven. These prejudices prevent SF from recognizing that fast food, like other mass products, attracts consumers not because of their lack of culture or the hypnotic influence of media and advertising, but because it <italic>can be consumed quickly</italic> and <italic>at a low price</italic> by people without much time and/or money. These are quite reasonable motives, which by themselves are wholly capable of explaining the success of fast food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047244112436908">Jones et al., 2003</xref>: 302ff), with no need to assume decay or debasement.</p>
<p>SF’s position clearly derives from the counterculture of the 1960s and 70s, as do many other contemporary social movements (so-called ‘critical consumption’, ‘fair trade’, purchase groups, etc.), which have recently attracted the attention of sociologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047244112436908">Sassatelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112436908">Ceccarini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047244112436908">Leonini and Sassatelli, 2008</xref>). Such roots in counterculture also become apparent through SF’s conviction that the future can be modified and guided by the consumption choices of individuals:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In a world where the ‘sensorial deprivation produces a dulling of our faculties of hearing, seeing, touching, tasting and sniffing’, the training of the senses becomes an ‘act of resistance against the destruction of taste and against the annihilation of knowledge’. It becomes a true political act . . . The gourmet, from this viewpoint, may see himself as a privileged person who can distinguish and who, guided by a sensitivity which does not respond to the distractions of industrial civilisation, can direct the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 80–1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ingredients of counterculture are all present here: the dulling of the senses and of the conscience, the ‘transmission of stimulus’, the ‘conditioning’, the repression of the senses, which can be defeated by recovering what the ‘system’ wants to cancel, i.e. our primitive perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 80–1); and this return to spontaneity, genuineness and authenticity is not simply an act of individual protest, but a truly political, even a revolutionary act.</p>
<p>Since the need to consume is induced by mass production, the intrinsic logic of these positions requires that the same need must be standardized, precisely like the products we are led to desire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047244112436908">8</xref></sup> The consumer society is seen as a system of rigid, inflexible uniformity; therefore, non-standard acts of consumption become politically radical acts. This is the basis of the theory of the rebel consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047244112436908">Heath and Potter, 2005</xref>: 110–11).</p>
<p>History has disproved this theory. The list of things in the past 50 years that were declared ‘subversive’, only to swiftly become mainstream, such as long hair, bikinis, jazz, scooters, tattoos, postmodernism, organic food, rock and punk, is impressive. However, none of the ‘subversions’ they were thought to produce occurred. Therefore, we might ask: ‘how many times can the system be subverted without any noticeable effect before we begin to question the means of subversion?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047244112436908">Heath and Potter, 2005</xref>: 152). But the truth is that consumer needs are not standardized and uniform; on the contrary, consumerism is driven not by a desire for uniformity, but for distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047244112436908">Sassatelli, 2004</xref>: 161ff). It is for this reason that anti-consumerist positions are so easily exploitable or recoverable by the system: because non-standard consumption confers distinction. No such thing as ‘subversive’ consumption exists. On the contrary, anti-consumerist and countercultural positions, distracting the attention and passion of people from democratic institutions and from the drafting of truly effective reform policies, have facilitated the birth of a vociferous but practically ineffective radicalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047244112436908">Heath and Potter, 2005</xref>: 69, 329).</p>
<p>Even a quick look at the kinds of individual behaviour praised by SF confirms this conclusion. Having personal relations with producers and suppliers, as well as spending time at the table in good company, are costly and time-consuming activities: in other words, they are <italic>luxury goods</italic>. As a consequence, they confer distinction and are increasingly requested – this is typical of the status-conferring product.</p>
<p>The fact that non-standard, ‘critical’ consumption produces effects that are exactly contrary to intention – that is, it drives consumerism, thus creating new niche markets – is perhaps unavoidable also for another reason. The anti-consumerist, critical consumerist and ‘fair trade’ movements and the like are divided between a will to change existing economic behaviour, and therefore obtain effectiveness, and a desire to show their identity publicly. The first tendency is to seek ways of collaborating with the ‘normal’ economy; the other avoids any contacts, in order to escape the risk of ‘contamination’ or ‘selling out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047244112436908">Ceccarini, 2008</xref>: 98 and <italic>passim</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047244112436908">Leonini and Sassatelli, 2008</xref>: 106–7 and <italic>passim</italic>). But the main psychological motive of critical consumers is a drive towards identity and self-gratification; and therefore it is likely that the same drive induces critical consumers to make increasingly symbolical choices.</p>
<p>The centrality of pleasure claimed by SF has often raised the suspicion that the movement comprises only a band of gluttons; in many instances, SF has been forced to defend itself from such a charge. It is a crucial issue for the whole strategy of the movement. In fact SF has always claimed the right to gastronomic pleasure to be politically progressive, whereas it was traditionally considered to be a value of conservatives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>for the first time the left approached the issues of wine and conviviality, and claimed a right to pleasure. Which up to that time was thought to be reserved only to the upper-middle classes: conceited doctors, lawyers and journalists, intent only on putting a noble mask upon their guzzling. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the first place, it is difficult to understand why the term ‘glutton’ should be an insult. Historically, gluttons have arisen from the decline of the dualistic food culture, in which on one side (for the great majority) there was penury and hunger, and on the other side (for a few) there was plenty and ostentation, with another minority in the middle (mainly religious) who considered abstinence from food to be a virtue. Gluttony could emerge and flourish only in affluent and egalitarian societies, in which conspicuous banquets are replaced by quiet dinners, thus transforming cooking from a public to a private affair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2004</xref>: 134; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047244112436908">Capatti and Montanari, 2006 [1999]</xref>: 339). Gluttony is, after all, a hobby like any other.</p>
<p>Moreover, even assuming that not all purchasers of ‘quality products’ are ‘middle-aged’ and ‘pleasure-seeking’, one thing is certain: they are all affluent because the products promoted by SF are luxury goods, and as such they are necessarily intended for a minority. This point must be stressed, because SF is constantly concealing it. On the one hand, the emphasis the movement puts on hand-crafted and local produce implies a limited production, with obvious consequences for prices; it is not by chance that SF itself imposes quantitative limits on producers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047244112436908">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is the nature of quality goods that makes them products that only have ‘quality’ as opposed to ‘mass’ or standardized production; it is precisely for this reason that quality goods are capable of conferring status and distinction.</p>
<p>SF not only has an ambition to promote good cooking and good wine in the world; it also wants to reach a public who, besides being affluent, feel guilty about it, and want to do something to mitigate their embarrassment. The masterstroke of SF lies exactly in having found a synthesis between the genuine desire to eat well and the need to be ‘on the right side’: in other words, in having reconciled food and engagement. And this is why the movement is forced to disown the glutton, who is intrinsically a <italic>disengaged</italic> character. The political programme of SF – which should allow its members to feel at ease with their own conscience – consists of changing the food habits and the methods of food production of the whole world. It is clear that, in the face of such an immense task, the actual nature of the food whose consumption is promoted by SF becomes rather embarrassing and must therefore be concealed as much as possible. How could one seriously claim to feed the world with Colonnata lard, Zeri lamb, Ustica lentils or Tortona strawberries (to say nothing of the gilded hunchbacked tench of Pianalto di Poirino or the Saluzzo white hen), washing all that down with a bottle of Barolo or Sciacchetrà?</p>
<p>Refusing the traditional negative connotation of the glutton implies a positive redefinition of the pleasures of the table. For instance, it is claimed that the pleasure ‘preached’ by SF ‘is not a hedonistic act which is an end in itself’; rather, it should be combined with ‘awareness and responsibility, study and knowledge’ because ‘gastronomic pleasure, if it is not methodically taught, is halved’. On the other hand, gastronomic pleasure is ‘the premise for recovering slow and harmonious rhythms of life’ since, at the origins of our present predicament, there is a mistake, which should be urgently corrected: the breaking off ‘of the pleasure–health relation’, which has consisted in the expulsion ‘of pleasure from the universe of positive – ethical and political – values and its replacement with excess’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: v, 46, 26, 24).</p>
<p>Here we find clearly expressed the idea that pleasure plays a crucial role in the definition of a new society (which is further evidence of SF’s direct derivation from counterculture). What is also striking is the presentation of pleasure as a right, a position previously contained in its founding manifesto. As a consequence, ‘if pleasure is a moral right, then an education, an ethics of taste becomes necessary, to guarantee it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 74). Such a conclusion, however, is not inevitable. First, the fact that pleasure is a right is by no means self-evident. And if education is necessary, other difficulties arise. In order to own a right, it is not ‘education’ that is needed, but the law to establish it and institutions to protect it.</p>
<p>Probably realizing the weakness of this position, SF adds another argument: that ‘food is culture’. It is necessary ‘to give centrality back to food’, so that food and its production recover ‘their rightful centrality among human activities’. And the reason is that ‘food is the main factor in defining human identity, since what we eat is always a cultural product’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 21, 32). That food is a cultural product is true, but this does not prove the conclusion. If being a ‘cultural product’ is what makes an activity ‘the main factor in defining human identity’, then all other human activities are equally ‘main factors’, and therefore food cannot be the central one.</p>
<p>In any case, SF promotes a detailed education, starting from the ‘first years in the life, in which tastes and distastes are formed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 75, 78); in fact, SF’s ‘educational’ initiatives are multiplying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047244112436908">10</xref></sup> The aims of such an education are ambitious: calling ‘the masters of material culture’ to teach us how to avoid ‘the chaos of fast life’, thus turning upside down ‘an ideology which has always put the body and its needs into second place after abstract knowledge’. The goal to be pursued in education should be that of ‘“staying well” with oneself and with others, of reaching a somatic and “libidic” equilibrium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 79, 76).</p>
<p>From the necessity to educate taste it is only a few steps to an idea that is no less daring: that gastronomy is a science. ‘Gastronomy’, for SF, does not simply mean ‘eating well’: first, because this would imply sharing ‘the commonplace which looks at the history of nutrition – economy and subsistence – and at the history of gastronomy – culture and pleasure – as separate’; and, second, ‘because in so doing, one takes into consideration only a small fraction, perhaps the less noble fraction, of the complex system of “roots” which are at the basis of our food’. Unfortunately, to the great annoyance of SF, the view that gastronomy is a science is not widespread. Nonetheless, according to SF, not only is it a science, it is even a ‘complex science’ – a sort of super-science encompassing all others, since it studies aspects of nature and culture which all fall within the scope of each particular science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 51–2).</p>
<p>However, paradoxically, real science is viewed with extreme suspicion by SF: because it is ‘reductionist’ and ‘quantitative’, because it ‘denies that some senses may serve the interpretation of reality, ‘because it is allied to ‘productivism’, and because it refuses to grant ‘equal dignity’ to ‘traditional knowledge’. It is necessary not to ‘establish new hierarchies’; on the contrary, we should make room for all kinds of progress:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The producers of good, clean and fair food (most of them peasants), those who are not yet irreparably marked by the breaking of the umbilical cord with the earth, possess a knowledge which cannot be learnt at school, which cannot be calculated by mathematical formulas, but which is the result of a symbiotic relationship with creation which many among us on this Earth have lost. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 181ff)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is, however, a shallow vision. For example, the idea that science must be evaluated and discussed not on the basis of its methods or results, but on the basis of its practical goals for which it is or can be employed, is untenable (and also recalls the traditionalist critiques of science);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047244112436908">11</xref></sup> also, the description of modern science as reductionist and merely quantitative is neither well grounded nor original, to say nothing of the irrationality that SF attributes to the traditional knowledge of peasants and artisans, as if it were transmitted not through education and communication but through contact or magic (the ‘symbiotic relationship with creation’).</p>
<p>In sum, this obsession for cultural recognition goes together with a great distrust of science, which SF is always ready to doubt, apodictically distinguishing between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 108–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047244112436908">Capatti, 1997</xref>), or irresponsibly adopting scientific theories and proclaiming them,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047244112436908">12</xref></sup> totally distorting their meaning, even years after the same theories have been radically confuted. This is a strange mixture of uncritical belief in scientific theories and uncritical disbelief in scientific method. Two good examples of this are SF’s attitude towards food miles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047244112436908">13</xref></sup> and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047244112436908">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In SF’s ‘system’, a crucial role is played by the critique of industrial agriculture and by praise of ‘traditional’ farming. The history of Western agriculture is seen by SF as a gradual but unstoppable passage from ‘naturalness’ to ‘unnaturalness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 22). However, the concept of ‘naturalness’, if applied to agriculture, looks very problematic. In fact, since none of the plants grown by man exist in nature, and since ‘the history of agriculture has been the history of mankind until the nineteenth century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047244112436908">Diamond, 2005 [1997]</xref>: 158ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047244112436908">Grigg, 1982</xref>: 15), one must conclude that agriculture – like most human activities – is an artificial intervention in nature, an alteration of it and even a violence towards it (which in antiquity required the appropriate rites of expiation and purification);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047244112436908">15</xref></sup> in fact the artificiality of agriculture is common knowledge in Western culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047244112436908">16</xref></sup> Obviously this does not mean that because all agricultural activities are ‘unnatural’, all of them are admissible; it does mean, however, that ‘naturalness’ cannot be the watershed between what can and cannot be done in agriculture because ‘naturalness’ does not exist.</p>
<p>Conversely, for SF, agriculture became ‘unnatural’ only recently, with the green revolution, i.e. after the triumph of chemistry (in the shape of fertilizers, pesticides) and ‘inputs foreign to millennial ecosystems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 22), and the end of growing and breeding only ‘native varieties and races’, which, being ‘inserted into the ecosystem which saw their birth and evolution, guarantee the conservation of that ecosystem’. In the first place, do such things as ‘millennial ecosystems’ and ‘native varieties and races’ actually exist? Petrini and SF are shocked by the fact that today the square peppers of Asti are being replaced by a Dutch variety, and that in place of their peppers, the Asti farmers grow tulips, which, according to SF, would be one of the ‘paradoxes of agriculture combined with so-called globalization: peppers which cross boundaries and mountains in exchange for tulips … thus upsetting two agricultural traditions which rendered them typical and obviously well suited to their original ecosystems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 5–6). Unfortunately, however, since peppers arrived in Europe from America in the sixteenth century (the same century that tulips arrived in Europe from Turkey), there was neither any ‘upsetting’ of agricultural tradition nor any product ‘well suited to their original ecosystems’; in any case, it is difficult to see why introducing a new variety was good in the sixteenth century but a ‘paradox’ today. A sixteenth-century SF would have prevented, among other things, the creation of the famous Asti pepper soup. The truth is that there are no agricultural products ‘well suited to their original ecosystems’ because there are no original agricultural ecosystems. The products of agriculture and breeding are the most globalized on earth.</p>
<p>‘Naturalness’ is often evoked but rarely defined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047244112436908">17</xref></sup> For example, it is considered to be a <italic>sine qua non</italic> of food quality:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the quality of a food product is greater the more natural that product is. Natural is not equivalent to organic: we are speaking of a system, not of a certified method of production. Natural means no additives, preservatives, flavourings or technologies of production that upset the naturalness of the processes of working, breeding, growing, etc. <italic>(Dizionario di SF</italic>, ‘Qualità’)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, using the concept of ‘natural’ systems or processes to define a ‘natural’ product is a vicious circle. Unavoidably, SF finds itself lost within labyrinths of distinctions so subtle as to eclipse even the Jesuit casuistry mocked by Pascal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047244112436908">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>SF’s critique of modern industrial agriculture is also based on other premises. The main one is that, notwithstanding the increase in the extent of cultivated land, the use of fertilizers, water consumption and pollution, output is still not sufficient to feed everyone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 24–5). On the contrary, agro-industry ‘in some way gave us the illusion that the food problems of mankind could be solved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 20). So we would conclude that these problems could be solved and that all other efforts must stop in order to return to the old ways. But SF explains neither how we could get back to the previous situation nor how we could (once we did so) feed the present world population. The focus of SF’s attention is in fact elsewhere:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>food and its production must recover their centrality and the criteria guiding our actions need to be reassessed. The problem in fact is no more the quantity of food produced but its complex quality . . . The goal is to improve concretely the life of all, but without imposing a model of development which is no longer sustainable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 20–1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But if the question is no longer the quantity of food produced, why should the green revolution be ‘a disaster’? And, conversely, how could one claim to ‘improve concretely the life of all’ without solving the problem of hunger? It is difficult to avoid the impression that beyond hollow declarations of principle SF has no interest at all in the actual inequalities in the access to food.</p>
<p>In fact, SF has very few suggestions to offer on the question of how to increase farm production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047244112436908">19</xref></sup> This is not surprising, since SF is convinced that the hunger problem is not due to underproduction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047244112436908">20</xref></sup> This, however, contradicts the claim that the green revolution has been unable to solve the hunger problem. Because either the production is equal to needs (and then it is not true that modern agriculture is a failure) or else production is already insufficient and will become more so in the future<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047244112436908">21</xref></sup> (and then it becomes urgent to explain how to increase it, what kind of agriculture should replace the present one, and how people would be fed without re-creating either mass hunger or the ‘two-tier’ food system typical of pre-industrial societies). But the only clear message is that SF wants to stop industrial agriculture (what it calls ‘a pure contradiction’): what we need is to ‘de-industrialize agriculture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 117). Once again, SF claims that it is necessary to refuse all that is ‘unnatural’ and ‘introduces an unsustainable artifice within the dialectic relation between man and earth’: in other words, it is necessary to eliminate pesticides and chemical fertilizers, to renounce intensive agriculture, and to limit ourselves to native species and varieties. What SF is thinking of is not organic farming<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047244112436908">22</xref></sup> but rather ‘traditional’ agriculture – returning to pre-existing methods and techniques (<italic>Dizionario di SF</italic>, ‘Agricoltura’) – which, although it does not exclude all innovation in principle, is nonetheless embedded in a social structure considered to be immutable. The very idea of a ‘traditional’ agriculture, however, like that of a ‘natural’ one, is wrong, given that the history of agriculture is an almost uninterrupted succession of revolutions and innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047244112436908">Mazoyer and Roudart, 2002</xref>: 411ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047244112436908">Slicher Van Bath, 1972 [1962]</xref>: 413ff).</p>
<p>Therefore we are facing the paradox of a movement that objects to industrial and intensive farming because it are unable to solve the hunger problem, only to put in its place an agriculture that would produce even less, or (in order to maintain at least approximately the present level of output) would cause enormous environmental damage due to the need for widespread deforestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047244112436908">Sala, 2005</xref>:109; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047244112436908">Poli, 2001</xref>: 152ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047244112436908">Borlaug, 2000</xref>: 488).</p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that SF doubts the need for growth for reasons that are at best questionable. Its theory is based on catastrophic data (the collapse of biodiversity, an exponential increase in consumption), which, contrary to what SF believes, are not facts, but hypotheses which have been greatly criticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047244112436908">Grigg, 1982</xref>: 21ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047244112436908">Tietenberg, 2006 [2004]</xref>: 299ff).</p>
<p>Lacking a consensus on the ‘limits to growth’, taking for granted that our system is ‘a capitalism which can be translated into the most extreme and egoistic individualism, into the debasing, and to the wasting, of all common goods. Goods like land and water, peace and happiness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 183) becomes only an a priori position, based on the distortion of elementary concepts. For instance, it is by no means certain that ‘common goods’ are endangered by ‘capitalism’, since one could object that only the economic and technological progress produced by capitalism guarantees better protection for these goods, and has even generated, in the minds of the majority, a sense of their importance and the need to protect them. Moreover, there is a fundamental confusion about the meaning of common goods (commons), which is not synonymous with exhaustible resources, but indicates those goods that are (in the parlance of economics) both non-excludable and rival in consumption. Thus, diamonds and oil are not commons, but beaches, water and fish are. The reason why commons are facing the risk of exhaustion or excessive consumption (known in economics as the ‘tragedy of the commons’) is not the immorality or egoism of consumers, but the impossibility of limiting access to those goods; it follows – although this conclusion has never been drawn by SF – that one way to protect the commons is to privatize them. It would also be necessary to explain clearly which new and more ‘sustainable’ system should replace capitalism. In fact, SF adds anti-consumerist positions (downshifting, fair trade) to vague vindications of the ‘right of people to take care of their own nutrition and freely and democratically to decide the kind of agriculture they prefer’. But, because nobody denies this right, we may wonder why SF is assuming that decisions are taken undemocratically. Moreover, this defence of freedom of choice is contradicted by SF’s adamant conviction that only one way is possible: ‘peasant agriculture is fundamental for the struggle against GMOs, and in defence of biodiversity, food sovereignty, the farmers’ standard of living, the occupation of empty lands, the protection of the environment, and against the agro-chemical and agro-food multinationals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 168). If SF’s idea of ‘sustainability’ remains vague, we should not expect that its attempts to describe a new kind of sustainable development are any better defined: sustainability, being a vague concept (like ‘naturalness’), cannot be used to define a process. And in fact SF is forced to introduce a new paradigm to describe its brave new world.</p>
<p>The Mother Earth (Terra Madre) movement is supposed be an example of ‘a truly sustainable development, unconnected to the idea of economic growth at all costs, but connected to the idea of human growth, to the diffusion of a common good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2009</xref>: 17ff). This new development should create:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>new alternative values: gratuitousness, an economy independent of money, an economic evaluation (not monetization) of non-material goods and of specific abilities, innovative and sustainable rules for the distribution of products, an extended right to mobility, a reciprocal enrichment based on different human experiences, a new dignity for traditional knowledge and for peasant life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 209)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For this to happen, ‘we cannot help relying upon the new technologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 201). It is to be noted that SF remembers industry and progress only when it needs them, but is ready to forget their existence once they have delivered. Technological progress is also considered as already given, independent of what Marx called the relations of production: SF never wonders how a society of small farmers could survive, what institutions it would create, how it would obtain the necessary capital, and how it would experience or promote technological progress. This system (never defined) ‘can and must work because it is the way progressively to correct some macroscopic distortions of our food system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 210) – note the inadvertent and simplistic passage from the normative plan to the descriptive one.</p>
<p>In this new world a ‘predisposition to gift, to gratuitousness’ would eventually emerge (we are told neither how nor why):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>giving without asking, but being assured of getting back because we are on the same level, with the same dignity and the same predisposition to let other people grow up, being aware of the existence of limits and taking care not to go beyond those limits only in order to gain money and lose humanity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 243)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this tirade we gather that the great novelty proposed by SF is nothing less than a return to primitive society, in which institutions such as the potlatch and the gift represent the basis of the socio-economic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047244112436908">Latouche, 2007</xref>: 44, 46). It was, as we now know after decades of interdisciplinary studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047244112436908">23</xref></sup> the kind of society which not only suffered from a systematic scarcity, but which, like all pre-industrial societies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047244112436908">24</xref></sup> far from being more ‘human’ and ‘generous’ than modern ones, was actually based on robbery, violence and the systematic exploitation of nature and other people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047244112436908">25</xref></sup> But SF ignores this debate.</p>
<p>The ‘new’ concept of the development of SF is paradoxical for another reason as well. According to SF:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>no one can be saved if he is not allowed to know, to realise that he, too, owns material wealth … The goal of the future Presìdia of SF in underdeveloped areas shall be to recover and spread traditional knowledge, making it a source of development and welfare. The ‘poor’ countries are actually rich in an extraordinary heritage of vegetable and animal species, in ancient local knowledge, in unexploited human potential. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 102–3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is, therefore, no such thing as a poor country: the secret of development lies not in producing more food, more water, more education, more hospitals, more drugs, more roads or more houses. Development entails simply convincing the underdeveloped countries that they are already rich – admittedly, a very cheap solution (and a gross misunderstanding of the true nature of underdevelopment).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047244112436908">26</xref></sup> Moreover, there are ecosystems ‘based on animal species which allow a community to live prosperously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 66). But how? Through an entry in the SF guide (known as <italic>Food Planet</italic>) and consequent notoriety within the ‘glutton community’. Thus the very survival and prosperity of the ‘traditional’ community presupposes the existence of rich consumers, and consequently of developed countries (and one should also ask how this situation could be supported by SF, which is a fierce critic of transport and tourism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047244112436908">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basic unit of this new kind of development would be ‘the rural community with its rites, its feasts, its social relationships, its agricultural practices, its beliefs’. Such rural communities are composed of fishermen, peasants, dairy farmers, cooks and innkeepers. Called ‘food communities’, they should be the elementary units from which we should start anew: ‘food communities have a strategic importance in designing a new society … The communities, in fact, are based on feeling, on fraternity, on the refutation of egoism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 169, 203).</p>
<p>Actually, it is not that difficult to become a member of these ‘communities’: in particular, one does not need to produce anything. In fact:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>consuming is difficult today, even more than producing … ‘Consumption’ can no more hide what is actually its true meaning, that is, tear, wear, destruction, progressive exhaustion. Therefore, we must change our attitude, and first of all our words. Consumption is the final act of the production and distribution process: it is to be seen as such, and no longer as external to the process. The old consumer must therefore begin to feel somehow part of the productive process, understanding it, influencing it with his preferences, supporting it in case of difficulty, opposing it when it is wrong or unsustainable. The old consumer, today a new gourmet, must begin to feel like a co-producer. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 165)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This whole passage,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047244112436908">28</xref></sup> which has a striking similarity to a passage by Ruskin,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047244112436908">29</xref></sup> is weakened by a complete misunderstanding of the relationship between production and consumption. Consumption is not the ‘final act of the productive process’ but simply the other face of production (we produce so that others may consume, we produce what others consume, and we consume what others produce). One cannot be separated from the other; the addition of ‘personal knowledge’ is wholly superfluous, and in most cases impossible. What the ‘wrong model’ envisaged by SF is remains a mystery (if someone kills a cow and sells me a steak, this is ‘consumption’ whether the steak was bought in a supermarket or in a ‘food community’); but if there is one, surely it lies in the conviction that vaguely ‘feel[ing] somehow part of the productive process’ is sufficient to transform the consumer magically into a ‘co-producer’. Not to mention that it is unclear why such a relationship of ‘co-production’ should exist for food but not for all the other products on sale. It is difficult not to share the words used by Marx and Engels against similar opinions in the eighteenth century:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His real difficulties begin when he wishes to prove that he produces when he consumes … This is moreover the same sort of argument that the aristocracy, the clergy, the rentiers, etc., have always used to prove their own productivity … Since he knows nothing of the real relations of production and consumption, he has to take refuge in human essence … For the same reason, he insists on proceeding from consumption instead of from production. If you proceed from production, you necessarily concern yourself with the real conditions of production and with the productive activity of men. But if you proceed from consumption, you can set your mind at rest by merely declaring that consumption is not at present ‘human’, and by postulating ‘human consumption’, education for true consumption and so on. You can be content with such phrases, without bothering at all about the real living conditions and the activity of men. It should be mentioned in conclusion that precisely those economists who took consumption as their starting-point happened to be reactionary and ignored the revolutionary element in competition and large-scale industry. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047244112436908">Marx and Engels, 1845</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We are dealing, in sum, with purely rhetorical exercises: idealizations of an imaginary past, of which SF selects only the appealing features, systematically forgetting all others. Thus the idea of a return to the ‘Jeffersonian ideal of a government ruled by the values of a nation of farmers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 208–9) is greeted with enthusiasm by SF, without taking into consideration that one of those values was slavery. Similarly, when SF praises the ‘traditional role of women in the food chain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2006</xref>: 6), we should also remember that for centuries the role of women was an extremely subordinate one, and that their emancipation in developed countries was achieved precisely by overthrowing this traditional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047244112436908">Allen and Sachs, 2007</xref>: 15ff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047244112436908">Walter, 2008</xref>: 9–10).</p>
<p>Moreover, food ‘traditions’, like the roles or social levels of a given cooking method, can be extremely different in space and time. Taking them as given once and for all, in lieu of considering them as a historical product, is a purely ideological operation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a form of ‘folkloric revival’ . . . i.e. one way in which contemporary society ‘recovers’ the past overturning its meaning: a perfectly legitimate operation if done with the awareness of creating a new culture; an ambiguous and misleading operation, if one tries to smuggle it in as a simple repetition of the past. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047244112436908">Montanari, 2007 [2004]</xref>: 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And this leads to a series of reversals of historical truth. For instance, it leads us to believe that ‘natural’ foods were always widespread in the past, although, in fact, they were always seen with suspicion, since they were considered unwholesome, at least until the advent of modern methods of industrial preservation and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2001</xref>: 36–8; Montanari, 2007: 21ff, 65ff). It also leads us to imagine that ‘localness’ and ‘seasonality’ were the traditional attributes of healthy, tasty food, whereas, conversely, local, seasonal food was left to the poor, while the rich diet of the privileged few included food of the most diverse origins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047244112436908">30</xref></sup> It leads us to believe in the existence of local ‘traditional’ cuisines, whereas actually they, like most of the ‘traditional’ recipes contained in our cookery books, are a recent phenomenon, and do not predate the Industrial Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2001</xref>: 39; Capatti and Montanari, 2006: 101). Finally, it leads us to think that the genuineness and pleasantness of food were a prerogative of the countryside, whereas the city has always been the place where food was more abundant and tastier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2001</xref>: 39; Capatti and Montanari, 2006: 101). From this viewpoint, SF fits perfectly into that ‘pastoral’ ideology of the countryside that emerged in eighteenth-century England: nostalgic discourses on an allegedly uncontaminated ‘nature’ were developed by the bourgeoisie in order to create visions of idyllic lifestyles, which actually never existed and whose only function was to idealize ‘a deep desire for stability, served to cover and to evade the actual and bitter contradictions of the [present] time’, as well as ‘to promote superficial comparisons and to prevent real ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047244112436908">Williams, 1978 [1973]</xref>: 45, 54).</p>
<p>The invention by SF of an ‘unhistorical’, ‘mythical’ and ‘romantic’ past has also been noted by many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047244112436908">Jones et al., 2003</xref>: 303; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047244112436908">Roos et al., 2007</xref>: 7). In particular, it is striking to note the neglect of history and the misunderstanding of the present among the members of SF USA discovered by Gaytàn. These people ascribe cultural value only to food traditions originating far away from the USA in space or time; they complain of the absence of ‘traditions’ in America and are busy ‘creating’ new ones under the shape of ‘particular cultural moments’; they impute the end of family meals to the fact that ‘now she [the woman] doesn’t want to be a stay-at-home mom; she wants to have a career. Then who does the cooking?’; they denounce the lack, in the United States, of European-like artisans, and therefore they propose public financial support for American artisans as a way of ‘restoring culture’. In other words, they employ ‘recycled discourses from the past’ and ‘operate within a new global collective imaginary that draws from an established hierarchy of culture, [so that] they are almost always limited by the boundaries of the elite hierarchies on which they rely’, and thus they ‘exclude non-European and urban working-class expressions of culture from articulations of resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047244112436908">Gaytàn, 2004</xref>: 13, 16, 17, 18). This vision of tradition is purely mythical. Above all, it does not recognize:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the conditions of inequity or oppression often inherent within the preservation of tradition – whether they are socio-economic differences limiting access to education and opportunity or a gender tradition in which the labour of women in the kitchen bears the responsibility for maintaining harmony in the family home and preserving the cultural traditions of society.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Far from seriously making progress towards changing the present state of things, SF ends by ‘fetishizing cultural differences and sentimentalizing struggles for cultural or economic survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047244112436908">Donati, 2005</xref>: 239).</p>
<p>And yet, SF attributes the miraculous virtues of its new society and economy to the final triumph of its ‘food communities’ – nothing less than the birth of a new humanity. It wants in fact to create a more pleasant type of human being. S/he is:</p>

<p>What is certain is that this ‘new man’ has both leisure time and money, since he is a regular at restaurants and inns, participates in philanthropic events, etc. He is, moreover, a member of a ‘non-exclusive elite’: a meaningless oxymoron, particularly since this ‘elite’ seems to have, as its greatest ambition, nothing more than ‘influencing’ (albeit ‘substantially’) ‘the menus offered by … restaurants’.</p>
<p>The ideological nature of this image is clearly shown when, on the subject of the impact of long supply chains on food prices, SF promotes not legislative changes but moral reform: ‘the utilitaristic and individualistic spirit of the merchant . . . must be corrected into a more altruistic path, or at least in a communitarian direction’. Thus, for example, in order to eliminate ‘speculation’, it would suffice that traders ‘limit’ their quest for profit, up to the point, where necessary, of disappearing. Naturally, the forms of commerce which SF takes into consideration are the ‘little shops and other forms of direct commerce’; and within the framework of a general ‘reduction of the number of middlemen’, the trader should guarantee ‘a control of prices, which must be fair for both sellers and buyers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 231, 234). This is not only a simplistic position (which is also very common in the ‘critical consumption’ movements), it is also typical of reactionary thinking to believe that there can exist something like a ‘fair price’ or even a ‘fair’ distribution among the different factors of production <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047244112436908">31</xref></sup> – that is, abstracting from the actual relations of production. It is also typical of SF to believe that ‘moral reform’ can by itself change the structures of production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047244112436908">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>SF’s recovery of ‘rural’ values includes – this is also typical of a certain contemporary Italian ideology – sobriety, moderation and thrift, all of which are characteristically seen as moral qualities and as a return to the idea of limiting oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2005</xref>: 248, 125–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047244112436908">Cassano, 2005 [1996]</xref>: xxviiiff). In turn they are conceived as capable in themselves of determining the optimal dimensions of economic activity and even of the civil community. And so SF comes to the point of distinguishing between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ – or even ‘criminal’ – consumption practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047244112436908">Greco and Scaffidi, 2007</xref>: 83ff, 90).</p>
<p>A significant part of SF’s activity consists of the protection of wine and food specialities ‘at risk of extinction’: hence events such as the Ark of Taste. The name makes one think of a ‘conservative spirit’, but, Petrini explains, ‘in truth, none of us believed in the “old little world”, but everything led us to think it was better “to defend” it, because, when the floodgates are opened, the only safety is the Ark’. SF wishes to present itself as a movement struggling for food biodiversity and against standardization. The defence against standardization quickly turns into a defence against globalization: ‘everywhere food expresses cultural distinctions, it is the first way to identify a people. This is why we must defend that heritage against globalisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 153). Then follows a critique of the present ‘system’, in which:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the equilibrium between the local and the global dimension has totally disappeared, [in which] those who decide what is in our food are no longer ourselves, or cooks, or our trusted shopkeepers, but the rules of the global market: so … we give up the richness of a diet in accordance with the seasons in order to consume tomatoes in January rather than thistles and turnip greens … we are no longer capable of giving up the ‘privilege’ of eating Chile cherries in December and so on. Who gains from this situation? Clearly not the peasant producers and not the citizen consumers, as we know all too well. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047244112436908">Burdese, 2008</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One may ask how a system could survive if it is good for neither producers nor consumers; why eating food out of season, which was once the privilege of kings and noblemen and is today within reach of all pockets, should be despised; and last but not least, why all such things should be ‘clear’.</p>
<p>Nobody will deny that it is more than reasonable, and even praiseworthy, to preserve a food or a processing method; but SF pretends to disguise a crusade aimed at saving rare products – which in the pre-industrial economy found few purchasers due to their high price, and which therefore can succeed today only because, thanks to industrialization and economic development, a sufficiently large and rich group of consumers has emerged<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047244112436908">33</xref></sup>– as an operation which will somehow restore the pre-industrial and rural culture (a culture which, moreover, did not exist in the terms imagined by SF). This implies a total misunderstanding of the real situation: it is the very existence of modern industrial society that makes it possible, by creating a market, to preserve the rarest and costliest products. In other words, it is not the limitation of the market but rather its expansion that ensures their survival; it is not the reduction of consumption but its increase that enables us to preserve varieties and breeds that are at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2001</xref>: 43).</p>
<p>But the ideological disguise cannot hide the real nature of this enterprise, which is commercial promotion: ‘on the Ark, we should take on board only products with a commercial future, capable of obtaining superior prices because they possess excellent organoleptic qualities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047244112436908">Petrini, 2001</xref>: 96). It is, in sum, a marketing operation, aimed not only at attracting a young public, but also at revolutionizing the traditional social classification of the gourmet. The new ‘leftist gluttons’ may be affluent people too, but they will no longer feel guilty for wishing to eat well: in fact, they will combine the love of good cooking with political ‘engagement’. This combination is achieved through a skilful connection to a critique of mass culture, in particular the anti-consumerist and ‘critical consumption’ movements. This is the real programme of SF. And the entire ideology of the movement is oriented towards this goal.</p>
<p>Petrini has often claimed that in ‘mass-produced agriculture brought in by multinational companies, poverty and hunger are neither right-wing nor left-wing issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047244112436908">Petrini and Padovani, 2005</xref>: 157). Perhaps this is true, but what does distinguish the right and the left are the solutions to those problems. The solutions proposed by SF (the return to a traditional, pre-industrial, extensive or even subsistence farming) do not look very promising, not to mention SF’s critique and rejection of technical and scientific progress, of science itself (which, SF believes, should abandon all claims to hegemony and accept a dialogue between equals with the ‘traditional knowledge’), and of economic growth. Moreover, the same concepts used by SF in order to criticize modern agriculture and industry – naturalness, sustainability and tradition – are inaccurate, devoid of any concrete historical content, and ultimately unworkable.</p>
<p>The portrait of the ‘slow man’ (<italic>sic</italic>) is that of a person rich in money and leisure time. The fact that the means that enable the ‘slow man’ to exert his taste and his senses originate precisely from the diabolical activities of speed, industrialization and standardization – in short, capitalism – is something that SF does not even notice. And SF does not realize that such a way of life cannot be affordable below a given level of income, and so cannot be the basis for a ‘new model of development’ because it presupposes development to be precisely what is occurring at the moment. This removal of real concrete processes, this total obliviousness to or misunderstanding of historical processes is a typical feature of ideology. Moreover, attributing to pre-industrial, backward or even primitive societies the leisure to think, to cultivate human relations, etc., is a pure myth. Developed societies are in fact only those that can afford to ‘lose time’, since increases in productivity allow them to produce more in less time. Rather, traditional pre-industrial, underdeveloped societies are those that devote most of their time to production for their own subsistence, that are most obsessed with production, and that exploit natural resources most mercilessly and endanger the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047244112436908">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The result, then, is the denigration of progress, together with praise for the ‘little’ local communities and the re-evaluation of atavistic traditions. This is not a novelty either: reactionary thought has always cherished strong connections with places, because only in the local dimension can traditions survive, and only the linkage to the particular can protect traditional society from the attacks of rationalism. But the paradox is that the ‘traditions’ envisaged by SF, especially the culinary ones, are recent phenomena, resulting from the disappearance of pre-industrial peasant civilization; at the same time, they are ideological attempts to replace a real past with a pastoral countryside that is totally fictitious. The goal of this operation is, historically, to placate the anxieties of the new hegemonic class, transferring back into a distant past the ideals of peace, quietness and harmony it cannot find in the present. The real ‘traditional’ society praised by SF was one in which class and gender differences were enormous, social mobility was practically non-existent, and most of the population lacked sufficient food. The end of that deeply unjust and oppressive system is precisely due to the victory of that technical progress and economic growth that SF considers to be the root of all evil.</p>
<p>I have described the main myths on which SF’s ideology is based: those of nature, tradition and limit, the critique of progress, the suspicion of science, praise of the traditional role of women, connection with the land – the list itself sounds eloquent. The stratagem that allows SF, as well as other contemporary political ideologies, to present this position as ‘progressive’ consists in connecting the critique of economic development, scientific and technical progress, and industrialization – a critique which is in itself very ancient – to the critique of imperialism and ethnocentrism on the one hand and consumerism and mass culture on the other.</p>
<p>Conservatism and reaction contain important truths and are capable of activating that beneficial dialectic which is both the basis of and the justification for politics. But in order to be fruitful all dialectic presupposes that one party does not disguise itself as the other. If SF were to present itself as a movement of gourmets, no harm could be done. But when it claims to know the secret formula for protecting biodiversity, feeding the starving and even creating new sustainable growth, then there is a danger that ‘the best for the few is the enemy of the good for the many’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047244112436908">Laudan, 2004</xref>: 143). As long as there are starving people in the world, the way to help them is not to maintain culinary and agricultural traditions, but to change them.</p>
<p>The fact that a movement like SF – anti-progressive, anti-scientific, worshipping traditional societies, fond of the little stratified and perennial communities in which the place of each is eternally fixed and immutable, uninterested in and ignorant of history and the realities of production, and thus incapable of seeing the inextricable contradictions and historical fictions that riddle this vision – might be considered left-wing in Italy today is something that deserves close study and should create in all those who care for the future of our country more than a passing worry.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we romanticize the past, we may miss the fact that it is the modern, global, industrial economy … that allows us to savour traditional, peasant, fresh, and natural foods … Culinary Luddism, far from escaping the modern global food economy, is parasitic upon it.</p>

<p>A similar misunderstanding is also present in many contemporary movements of ‘critical consumption’. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047244112436908">Sassatelli and Davolio (2006</xref>: 6). For an interesting analysis of some contemporary restatements of the relations between production and consumption, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047244112436908">Sassatelli (2004</xref>: 135ff).</p>

<p>consumption absolute is the end, crown, and perfection of production; and a wise consumption is a far more difficult art than wise production. Twenty people can gain money for one who can use it; and the vital question, for individual and for nation, is never ‘how much do they make?’ but ‘to what purpose do they spend?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047244112436908">1923 [1860]</xref>: 144)</p>
