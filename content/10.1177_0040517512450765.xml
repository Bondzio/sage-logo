<abstract>
<p>The currently used high-performance fiber materials for soft body armor have very low surface friction and this has become an issue in the effectiveness of ballistic energy absorption. In this study, non-polymerizing reactive plasma gas N<sub>2</sub> and chemical vapor (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si were employed to modify Kevlar fabric surface for the application of ballistic impact material. Scanning electron microscopy observations yield information about the surface effect of the fabrics after plasma treatment. The surface morphology of the treated fabrics was studied. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis was used to analyze the surface chemical properties of the treated samples. The yarn pulling-out test shows that the resistance to pulling out yarns from fabrics plasma-treated treated with N<sub>2</sub> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si plasma-treated fabric is increased 18% and 300% respectively, compared with the untreated Kevlar fabric. Finite element simulation results revealed that fabric with a higher surface coefficient of friction performs better in ballistic energy absorption.</p>

<body>
<p>Innovations in high-performance fibers have been the driving force for developments in body protection against ballistic threats. Fabrics made from high-performance fibers have been widely used in flexible body armors, leading to better protection, lighter weight, and better designs. The ballistic performance of a manufactured fabric depends on the used fiber mechanical properties, fabric construction method, and yarn counts and densities.</p>
<p>The fiber friction properties, along with the fiber physical properties, play an important role in slowing down the projectile. Friction also helps to strip the jackets from bullets, deform the bullet and, ultimately, stop it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512450765">1</xref></sup> One factor that influences the ballistic performance of a material is the friction among fibers and between fabric and projectile during projectile penetration. Controlled friction between fibers is desirable to slow down and deform the projectile. If fiber-to-fiber friction is very low, the material will not offer any resistance to the penetrating projectile and the projectile will not slow down or be deformed. Owing to the low surface friction of the ballistic fibers, once a ballistic fabric has been produced, its surface treatments are additional parameters to be considered for the optimum conditions for ballistic applications.</p>
<p>Kevlar is well known as a highly crystalline polymer; its surface coefficient of friction is very low. To achieve decent ballistic performance of soft body armor made of Kevlar fabric, it is necessary to find ways to overcome the lack of friction of the Kevlar. A technique that combines yarns of high tensile strength, high modulus, and low coefficients of friction and yarns of high coefficients of friction has been used to improve the surface friction of Kevlar fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512450765">2</xref></sup> The disadvantage of this method is that the bulk properties of the Kevlar fabric have been changed, which will affect the ballistic performance.</p>
<p>Unlike liquid processes, which penetrate deep into the fibers, plasma produces no more than a surface reaction; it only modifies the topmost 1–100 nm of the treated substrates and does not destroy the bulk properties of the treated materials. Inert materials that are difficult to treat can be easily imparted with desired functions with plasma treatment. The process condition is dry; no drying is required after the process and this makes the production more reliable and safe. Depending on the used plasma gas/gases, physical sputtering, chemical etching, and plasma polymerization may occur on the treated substrate surface. Thin active film can be grown based on substrate materials by perhaps one of the most versatile methods – chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Its exploitation to produce advanced functional surfaces for industrial/commercial applications has expanded rapidly in recent years.</p>
<p>Low-temperature plasma (LTP) has already been used by industry for the treatment of metal and polymer materials as a surface modification technique. LTP is an ionic gas, the components and properties of which are different from those of the normal gases. Both polymerizing plasma gases and non-polymerizing plasma gases can be used in LTP treatment.</p>
<p>The structures of fiber and textile materials are more complicated compared with plain metal or plastic surfaces, but recently there has been greater interest in the plasma treatment of textiles. Stone et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512450765">3</xref></sup> revealed that exposure of cotton yarn to the plasma of an electrical glow discharge resulted in an increase in breaking strength of the yarn. LTP treatment also has been used to treat fabrics to improve the shrinkage, wettability, and dyeability, reported by Kan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512450765">4</xref></sup> Surface properties of plasma-treated textile substrates have been studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512450765">5</xref></sup> and, furthermore, Sun and Stylios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512450765">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512450765">7</xref></sup> reported that with plasma pretreatment to the active surface of cotton and wool fabrics, the scouring and dyeing time can be reduced. This will have little effect on the handle of the treated fabric. Research on non-polymerizing air plasma treatment found that the tribological properties of the Kevlar fabric/phenolic composites have been improved caused by the increased surface roughness. As a result, the bond between the Kevlar fabric and phenolic adhesive resin strengthened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512450765">8</xref></sup> Brown et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512450765">9</xref></sup> reported that interlaminar shear strength and flexural strength of fabric composites are improved when the aramid fibers are pretreated in an ammonia plasma.</p>
<p>Very few papers can be found in the study of plasma treatment of high-performance materials for ballistic resistance applications. In this study, non-polymerizing reactive plasma N<sub>2</sub> and polymerizing plasma (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si have been employed to modify the surface properties of the Kevlar fabric. The surface morphology and element component have been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, respectively, to compare the plasma-treated and the untreated Kevlar fabrics. A yarn pulling-out test has also been carried out to study the frictional behavior of the yarns in a plain woven Kevlar fabric. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) model is proposed to simulate the projectile–fabric impact and predict the surface friction of the Kevlar fabric in the influence of ballistic performance, by using a commercial FE analysis package, Abaqus.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040517512450765"><title>Plasma treatment</title>
<p>The plasma treatment device provided by Salford University, the working theory of which shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512450765">Figure 1</xref>, is used for plasma treatment of the plain woven Kevlar fabric in this study. It consists of five main parts. They are the reaction chamber, audio rate frequency generator, power distribution rack, measuring equipment, and gas supplier. A chamber (120 mm × 120 mm) containing a cathode and anode is attached to an audio rate frequency generator. The samples to be treated are inserted between the two electrodes within the plasma reaction chamber. Gas at a metered rate is allowed to enter the chamber. Plasma will be generated once a low voltage between the electrodes is applied in the audio-frequency range. The whole process is controlled via a sophisticated system.

<p>The Kevlar fabric samples to be treated are cut to the required dimensions for each experiment, and conditioned before use. Non-polymerizing reactive plasma gas N<sub>2</sub> is used to modify the surface of the Kevlar fabric.

<sec id="sec4-0040517512450765"><title>Surface morphology examination</title>
<p>Kevlar fabric, being an insulator, is prone to charging by the electron beam. In order to prevent this from occurring, an ultra-thin layer of carbon is sputter coated on each sample in an Edwards/E306A coating system, which consists of a vacuum chamber and an operating board, before SEM examination. The thin film provides electrical conductivity, enhances the signal, and may add strength to the specimen. The samples to be tested were placed on the metal supporter (2.5 cm in diameter).</p>
<p>The surface morphologies of Kevlar fiber of the plasma-treated and untreated specimens are investigated using SEM. The acceleration voltage was 5 kv.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040517512450765"><title>Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis</title>
<p>An EDX analysis enables one to analyze the surface element component of the SEM-examined specimen. X-rays generated from any particular element are characteristic of that element and, as such, can be used to identify which elements are actually present under the electron probe. This is achieved by constructing an index of X-rays collected from a particular spot on the specimen surface, which is known as a spectrum.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0040517512450765"><title>Resistance of yarn pulling-out test</title>
<p>To understand the effect of plasma treatment on the influence of the mechanical behavior of the warp and weft yarns in the fabric, a yarn pulling-out test is carried out to examine the resistance of pulling-out warp yarns from plasma-treated fabric with comparison to the untreated fabric.</p>
<p>In this laboratory-developed method, the testing procedure mostly follows yarn strength standard test BS ISO 3341:2000. An Instron tensile tester (Model No 4411) is used in the experiment. The load applied to pulling a yarn out of the fabric in relation to the yarn displacement is recorded. The difference is the samples used. Instead of using yarn as a testing sample in the yarn strength test, samples to be tested in this study are prepared as follows. Samples are cut into 9.5 cm × 9.5 cm dimensions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512450765">Figure 2</xref>. The fabric is held by the lower clamp in this set up and corrugated jaws are used to prevent fabric slippage from the clamp jaws. The specimens are clamped in such a way that the weft yarns are in the vertical direction. Warp yarns of 6 cm were taken out from the lower end of the specimen before being clamped, and the effectual yarn length is therefore 3.5 cm. The rate of movement of the upper jaw is set to 100 mm/min. The test stops when there is no load applied on the yarn. Five yarns were tested for each fabric specimen.
<fig id="fig2-0040517512450765" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Yarn pulling-out test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512450765-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>

<p>SEM observations of plasma-treated and untreated Kevlar fibers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512450765">Figure 3</xref>. It shows a rougher surface for the nitrogen plasma gas-treated Kevlar fiber compared with the untreated fiber. This may be attributed to the physical bombardment and the etching effect of the nitrogen plasma species acting on the treated fiber surface. A rougher surface of the nitrogen gas plasma-treated fiber may increase the friction among fibers and yarns and the friction between the treated fabric surface and the contacted surface of any other objectives.
<fig id="fig3-0040517512450765" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Scanning electron microscopy images of (a) and (b) untreated, (c) and (d) N<sub>2</sub> plasma-treated, and (e) and (f) (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si plasma-treated fibers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512450765-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si is an organic monomer; plasma polymer will be formed onto the treated substrate surface when it is introduced into the plasma reaction chamber. From the images, it can be seen that Kevlar fiber is covered by a new surface layer after (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si plasma treatment. The properties of the treated fiber surface depend on the new covered layer rather than the inner Kevlar fiber. In this case, the treated Kevlar fabric surface property would have a significant change. In the meantime, the interaction mechanisms of the fibers and the yarns in the fabric would also be changed to a great extent.</p>
<p>From the surface morphology of the nitrogen plasma gas and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si plasma chemical vapor deposition, it is believed that the surface friction of the treated Kevlar fabric can be increased using plasma technology. This implies that Kevlar fabric ballistic performance may be improved using proper plasma gas and treatment parameters to overcome the disadvantage of the low surface friction of Kevlar fiber.</p>

<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512450765">Table 3</xref>, it can be seen that the chemical components of the nitrogen plasma gas-treated Kevlar fiber are almost the same as the untreated Kevlar fiber. Nitrogen is a type of non-polymerizing reactive plasma gas; physical bombardment and chemical etching of the plasma species may occur between nitrogen gas plasma and the treated Kevlar fiber surface. As a result, holes may be produced on the modified substrate surface, which has been proved by Sun and Stylios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512450765">7</xref></sup> on the non-polymerizing reactive plasma-treated fiber surface. There is no plasma polymer formed on the treated fiber surface during nitrogen plasma treatment. In this case, the chemical components of the treated and untreated substrate surface are similar. Three elements silicon, carbon, and oxygen are detected in the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si chemical vapor deposited on the Kevlar fiber surface. When an organic compound, a monomer, is introduced into plasma, the monomer gains energy from the plasma through inelastic collision and is activated and fragmented into activated small molecules. The small molecules are recombined to form a large molecule. Finally, polymers are deposited at the surface of the substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512450765">10</xref></sup> Polymers formed by plasma polymerization show distinguished chemical composition and chemical and physical properties compared with those formed by conventional polymerization. Once the polymers are deposited, they are constantly irradiated by the plasma until completing the polymerization process. In such a condition, even the deposited polymers are subjected to an interaction of the plasma. As a result, the polymers are degraded somewhat. More precisely, the polymers taken out after completing the plasma polymerization process are different in chemical structure to those deposited immediately.</p>
<p>Oxygen contained in the treated Kevlar fiber may be due to the water in the air contained in the plasma reaction chamber and the water contained in the pipe where the chemical vapor went through. Hydrogen and chlorine contained in the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>Si vapor may become volatile matters. Only single elements can be detected by using EDX analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) will be needed for further investigation into the polar groups contained in the plasma-treated Kevlar fiber surface.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512450765">Figure 4</xref> gives a comparison of the load–extension curves for pulling yarns out from a typical plain woven fabric and typical plain woven fabrics treated by nitrogen and dichlorodimethylsilane plasma. The load indicates the resistance to the yarn pulling from fabrics.
<fig id="fig4-0040517512450765" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Resistance of pulling out a yarn from fabric.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512450765-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It can be seen that the initial slopes of the curves for the plain woven fabrics treated by nitrogen and dichlorodimethylsilane are steeper than that of the untreated plain woven fabric. This indicates that the initial load needed for pulling a yarn from the fabric is higher for the plasma-treated than for the untreated plain woven fabric. It shows an 18% increase of the maximum load needed to pull out a yarn from the nitrogen plasma-treated fabric, compared with the untreated plain woven fabric, on average. It has been proved that low-temperature non-polymerizing reactive plasma treatment caused etching and ablation action on the treated fabric surface, resulting in a roughening effect on the fabric surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512450765">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512450765">12</xref></sup> reflected by the higher values in surface roughness and surface friction in Kawabata Evaluation System (KES) test for the plasma-treated fabrics compared with that of the untreated fabrics. The rougher surface might impart more contact points within the fibers and yarns, resulting in the enhanced inter-yarn and fiber friction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512450765">13</xref></sup> so that a larger amount of load is required during pulling out a yarn from nitrogen plasma-treated fabric. Moreover, the increased friction among fibers and yarns produces a greater cohesive force between the yarns and fibers; a larger amount of energy is required during fabric tensile stressing and, as a result, the tensile strength of the treated yarns and fabrics may be increased.</p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512450765">Figure 4</xref>, it can be seen that the load of pulling out a yarn from dichlorodimethylsilane-treated plain woven Kevlar fabric is three times that of pulling out a yarn from the untreated fabric. This is believed to be caused by the additional plasma polymer layer on the treated Kevlar fabric surface, which sticks the fibers and yarns and the plasma polymer layer together as a whole; a much higher load is required to overcome the resistance from the adjacent fibers and yarns and the covered plasma polymer layer to pull out a yarn from dichlorodimethylsilane-treated Kevlar fabric than the untreated Kevlar fabric. It also can be seen that the forces to pull out a yarn from plasma-treated fabrics are higher than the untreated ones during the whole yarn pulling-out process.</p>
<p>Zhang and Sun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512450765">14</xref></sup> have studied the yarn pull-out behavior from woven Kevlar fabrics and found that the yarn pull-out force has a positive correlation to the impact performance: fabric with higher pull-out force performed better in impact tests. Due to the limited sample size that can be obtained from the plasma treatment device, the samples treated are not big enough to be used for ballistic impact tests. However, according to Zhang and Sun’s findings, it can be concluded that the performance of Kevlar fabrics can be improved by using nitrogen and dichlorodimethylsilane plasma surface modification.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0040517512450765"><title>Simulation of ballistic impact affected by surface friction</title>
<p>Due to the limited sample size that can be obtained from the plasma treatment device at Salford University, the samples treated are not sufficient to be used for ballistic impact tests. Therefore, in order to find the ballistic impact performance of plasma surface modification of Kevlar fabric, the FE method is used to simulate how the surface friction of Kevlar fabric influences the ballistic performance. A FE model has been established and validated by using the impact and residual velocities from the tested untreated Kevlar fabrics.</p>
<p>In the FE model, eight warp and eight weft Kevlar yarns are included in the fabric geometric model created by UniverWeave<sup>©</sup>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512450765">Figure 5</xref> shows the deformation of the simulated model. The velocity of the projectile is decreased with the increase of impact time. The energy loss of the projectile is transferred to the energy absorbed by the impacted fabric. Therefore, energy absorbed by the fabric can be obtained by

<p>The model was validated by the ballistic shooting test. The correlation coefficient between the simulated result and the result from practice is 95.31%, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512450765">Figure 6</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512450765">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the energy absorbed by fabric versus impact time in different coefficients of friction of fiber material from the created model. It shows that fabric absorbs more energy with the increase of impact time, and more energy was absorbed by the fabrics with higher coefficients of friction compared with that of the lower values. This indicates that ballistic performance can be improved by modification of the surface roughness of the impacted fabric.

<p>Plasma treatment as a surface modification method has been applied on plain woven Kevlar fabric for ballistic applications. The surface morphology and chemical properties of the treated fabric have been examined as a comparison to the untreated fabric. A rougher surface is observed in the plasma-treated Kevlar fiber surface. The yarn pulling-out test shows that the resistance to pull out a yarn from plasma-treated fabrics is higher than for the untreated fabric. Furthermore, results from FE prediction show that ballistic fabric with a rougher surface absorbs more impact energy. This implies that plasma surface modification of ballistic fiber/fabric would be able to improve the performance to weight ratio of currently used body armor made of high-performance fibers.</p>
