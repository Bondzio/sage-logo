<abstract>
<p>We examine and criticize inaccurate stereotypes of the Tea Party as a revolutionary, insurgent, populist force. We demonstrate the Tea Party’s role in furthering the longstanding and polarizing rightward drift of the Republican Party. We trace the pro-establishment voting biases of the Tea Party in a variety of policy areas and the capitulation of the Democratic Party to the Tea Party–Republican political and economic agenda. The role of the mass media in amplifying the message of the Tea Party (largely neglected in the dominant political discourse) is also examined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>American politics, society, and policy tipped so far to the plutocratic right – consistent with the long rightward drift of the nation’s politics over more than three decades – in the last two years that it almost seemed reasonable last summer to suggest formally renaming the United States ‘America, Incorporated’. Masses of ordinary Americans struggled as the US economy limped through the weakest ‘recovery’ (more ‘statistical’ than human) on record and threatened to return to technical recession. The great global slump that started in 2007 – brought to us by the egregiously wealth-top-heavy profits system – continued to ruin millions of lives at home, with misery fed by federal and state austerity programs that slashed social programs and public workers even as the elite enjoyed spectacular opulence and outsized influence over state and local policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511435711">McNally, 2011</xref>). In June of 2011, the official jobless rates went back above nine percent (real or functional employment was considerably higher) and millions of Americans faced the expiration of extended unemployment benefits (Moody’s Analytics projected a loss of $37 billion in purchasing power as a result) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511435711">Rich, 2011</xref>). Evictions and foreclosures continued at historically high levels and food pantries were serving record numbers of poor Americans in some locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511435711">CBS Los Angeles, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511435711">Prior, 2011</xref>). Forty-five million Americans go hungry each night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511435711">Malloy, 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, the top one percent that owns more than 40 percent of the nation’s wealth (and 57 percent of its financial wealth) grew more spectacularly rich than ever in the wake of a Great Recession that has played the classic role of capitalist crises – increasing the concentration of wealth and power. Wealth concentration is abetted by the federal government’s remarkably weak and falling taxation of the rich. As US Senator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511435711">Bernie Sanders (2011)</xref> noted in no less a capitalist venue than the editorial pages of the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> last 29 July:<disp-quote>
<p>The rich are getting richer. Their effective tax rate, in recent years, has been reduced to the lowest in modern history. Nurses, teachers and firemen actually pay a higher tax rate than some billionaires. It’s no wonder the American people are angry …. Many corporations, including General Electric and Exxon-Mobil, have made billions in profits while using loopholes to avoid paying any federal income taxes. We lose $100 billion every year in federal revenue from companies and individuals who stash their wealth in tax havens off-shore like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. The sum of all the revenue collected by the Treasury today totals just 14.8 percent of our gross domestic product, the lowest in about 50 years.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In bold defiance of majority citizen opinion, increased taxes on the rich and corporate few and expanded protections and opportunities for the business order’s faceless victims were completely ‘off the table’, despite the fact that massive tax cuts for the wealthy and rampant tax avoidance and tax fraud by elite investors and multinational corporations were – along with increased war spending and the massive federal bailout of giant banks and corporations associated with the recent financial crisis – the leading causes of the government deficit that politicians of both ruling parties claim to abhor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511435711">Rasmus, 2011a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511435711">1</xref></sup> There was no chance for a meaningful renewed stimulus package as the federal government stretched to bay pack the wealthy bondholders it took loans from to bail out the giant financial firms that did so much to crash the US and global economy in 2007 and 2008. The only real break with neoliberal ‘free market ideology’ to follow in the wake of the neoliberal economic collapse of 2008 has involved the government decision (made under the command of capital) to spend an unprecedented sum of taxpayer money propping up leading financial and other capitalist firms deemed ‘too big’ and powerful ‘to fail’. The ‘left hand of the state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511435711">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>: 2, 22–44), the parts of the public sector that serve the social and democratic needs of the non-affluent majority, was ever more starved in the name of ‘fiscal responsibility’. The right hand of the state, the portions of the state that serve the opulent minority and dole out punishment for the poor at home and abroad, remained alive and well (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511435711">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511435711">Pilger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511435711">Street, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Ordinary Americans continued in the Age of Obama to receive ‘a blunt lesson about power, who has it and who doesn’t. They [have] watched Washington run to rescue the very financial interests that caused the catastrophe. They [have] learned that government has plenty of money to spend when the right people want it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511435711">Greider, 2009</xref>). The harsh neoliberal message was clear as day in the United States: ‘the banks having been rescued, [and] governments will do nothing to avert the continuing human recession. Instead, they plan to intensify their attacks on social programs and the world working class’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511435711">McNally, 2011</xref>: 184). Importantly for younger US citizens and voters, the ‘blunt lesson’ has been taught with Democrats in nominal power in the White House and Senate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511435711">Sanders (2011)</xref> noted:<disp-quote>
<p>Republicans in Congress have been fanatically determined to protect the interests of the wealthy and large multinational corporations so that they do not contribute a single penny toward deficit reduction. If the Republicans have their way, the entire burden of deficit reduction will be placed on the elderly, the sick, children and working families …. [But] President Obama and the Democrats have been extremely weak in opposing these right-wing extremist proposals. Although the United States now has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major industrialized country, Democrats have not succeeded in getting any new revenue from those at the top of the economic ladder to reduce the deficit. Instead, they’ve handed the wealthy even more tax breaks. In December, the House and the Senate extended President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for the rich and lowered estate tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. In April, to avoid the Republican effort to shut down the government, they allowed $38.5 billion in cuts to vitally important programs for working-class and middle-class Americans.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such was life under America’s ongoing ‘unelected dictatorship of money’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511435711">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Debt Ceiling Crisis of 2011</title>
<p>The dictatorship’s grip was on ugly display during Washington’s epic debt-ceiling drama in July and August of 2011. Unbowed by a terrible summer jobs report suggesting a likely return to technical recession and the urgent necessity of major counter-cyclical government jobs and social assistance programs, the nation’s ‘deeply conservative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511435711">MacFarquhar, 2007</xref>), nominally Democratic president Barack Obama responded to Republican threats – first made in May of 2011 – to block the raising of the debt ceiling by advancing a regressive long-term austerity program to the right of what even the average Republican voter wanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511435711">Applebaum, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511435711">3</xref></sup> He hit the golfing fairways with Republican Speaker John Boehner to offer a ‘grand bargain’ to reduce federal spending by $4 trillion over ten years, predominantly on the basis of Social Security, Medicare, and other spending cuts, including a rise in the age of Medicare eligibility. Top Democrats played along with the more openly plutocratic Republicans’ ploy of requiring massive social spending cuts if Congress would allow the government to keep borrowing money by raising the federal debt ceiling beyond the current $14.29 trillion borrowing limit. The Democrats agreed not to raise tax rates and even, quite remarkably, to a three-to-one rate of spending cuts to revenue increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511435711">Krugman, 2011a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511435711">4</xref></sup> The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, discussed backing a ‘debt reduction’ measure of three trillion or even four trillion if the Republicans ‘meet him part way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435711">Brooks, 2011</xref>). Obama expressed his willingness to support an end to Medicare’s longstanding availability to all Americans, regardless of income. As the leading liberal economist and <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist Paul Krugman notes, Republicans were not even suggesting cuts to Social Security: ‘this is something Mr. Obama and those he listens to apparently want for its own sake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511435711">Krugman, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>It did not matter that trying to ‘balance the budget’ by slashing social programs was certain to deepen the slump since spending cuts promised to reduce mass purchasing power and feed unemployment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511435711">Krugman (2011b)</xref> observed, going against the historical grain of the long right tilt in Washington, ‘businesses aren’t holding back because they lack confidence in government policies; they’re holding back because they don’t have enough customers – a problem that would be made worse, not better, by short-term spending cuts’. Even the editorial board of the <italic>New York Times</italic> rightly ‘fear[ed] [that] the sort of deal [Obama] is willing to consider, based overwhelmingly on spending cuts, could still consign the country to more years of economic stagnation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511435711"><italic>New York Times</italic> Editors, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Preparing to run for re-election as a ‘moderate’ in 2012, the supposedly liberal Obama preemptively conceded that any rise in the debt ceiling must be accompanied by spending cuts. Obama’s deficit reduction proposals were well to the right of what the average American voter supports and even ‘a bit to the right of what the average Republican voter prefers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511435711">Krugman, 2011a</xref>: A21). As the <italic>Times</italic> national correspondent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511435711">Jackie Calmes (2011b</xref>: A1) noted at the end of July, Obama ‘adopted the Republicans’ language and in some cases their policies’. Calmes noted that, in spite of ‘unemployment lingering at its highest level in decades, Mr. Obama has not fought this year for a big jobs program with billions of dollars for public-works projects, which liberals in his party have clamored for’.</p>
<p>The president essentially shared Republicans’ position that the deficit, not unemployment, was the top economic issue facing the US and that what ailed the economy was excessive big government taxation and regulation. In a presidential address last July, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511435711">Obama (2011)</xref> voiced core Republican themes by saying, ‘Government has to start living within its means, just like families do’. Offering a prescription to solve the debt debacle, Obama argued: ‘We have to cut the spending we can’t afford so we can put the economy on sounder footing, and give our businesses the confidence they need to grow and create jobs.’ As the progressive activist and writer Shamus Cooke noted:<disp-quote>
<p>This is the language of the right wing, which is now the language of both the Democrat and Republican parties. In reality, the U.S. government could easily access trillions of dollars in revenue; it simply chooses not to. Both political parties refuse to discuss how raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations could easily fix the current deficit issue on both the federal and state levels. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511435711">Cooke, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is quite true, just as the ongoing elite-manufactured ‘crisis of Social Security’ could easily be fixed by lifting the regressive cap on payroll taxes and taxing investment income to adequately fund old age pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511435711">Benavie, 2003</xref>: 23).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511435711">5</xref></p>
<p>One of the more perverse aspects of last summer’s debt-ceiling drama was the claim of Democratic pundits and spin doctors (e.g. MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell) that the center-right president <italic>never really meant to institute draconian Social Security, Medicare and social spending cuts</italic> – that the ‘grand bargain’ Obama offered was really just a <italic>clever ploy</italic> to expose the Republicans’ partisan and arch-regressive agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511435711">Rasmus, 2011b</xref>). This was a preposterous narrative, as was seen when Obama subsequently signed on to the bipartisan ‘Gang of Six’ budget plan, which ‘offered huge tax breaks for some of the wealthiest people in the country, while lowering Social Security benefits for retirees and the disabled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511435711">Baker, 2011</xref>). As budget ‘negotiations’ developed in the last week of July, Obama embraced Senator Harry Reid’s regressive plan to avert debt ceiling default. Reid’s plan would have slashed $2.4 trillion over a 10-year period, including $900 billion in cuts to education, health care, nutrition, affordable housing, child care, ‘and many other programs desperately needed by working families and the most vulnerable’, Senator Sanders noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511435711">2011</xref>). Reid’s plan did ‘not ask the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations to make any sacrifice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511435711">Sanders, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0896920511435711">
<title>Signing on to the Republican Framework</title>
<p>But even this was not reactionary enough for the Republicans in Congress. Briefly tempted by the opportunity to lock in deep, long-term spending cuts with a president who ‘want[ed] a right-leaning deficit deal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511435711">Douthat, 2011</xref>), Boehner pulled back from Obama’s offer on the fairways, citing the White House’s supposed ‘insistence on tax increases’ (a curious take on the administration effort to close some longstanding business tax loopholes). The nation appeared headed to a potentially disastrous suspension of its ability to borrow and spend. Moody’s Investors and Standard and Poor’s warned of a historically unprecedented downgrading of US debt if the crisis was not resolved.</p>
<p>The crisis was finally ‘resolved’ with the Republicans getting their way yet again in the ‘Age of Obama’. The ‘historic’ debt-ceiling accord agreed to by Obama, Harry Reid, and John Boehner and passed by Congress on 2 August 2011 amounted to $917 billion in spending cuts with no revenue-generating tax hikes or loophole-closings of any kind. The GOP was supposed to have ‘compromised’ by dropping a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and by agreeing that the debt ceiling will not be allowed to emerge as an issue again before the 2012 elections. But the amendment was never anything but theater and a bargaining chip. The rightmost of the nation’s two establishment business parties was likely to push for further spending cuts (exempting the Pentagon) when the 2012 budget deadline of 1 October gave them another opportunity to threaten to shut down the government in the name of ‘deficit reduction’.</p>
<p>Defending themselves against progressive charges of ‘selling out’, the administration and its conservative Democratic allies boasted that the ‘deal’ did not include any major attacks on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. But the real assault on those ‘entitlements’ (this term is never applied by ‘mainstream’ commentators to the Pentagon system and other forms of corporate welfare) had just been pushed back a little. As left economist Jack Rasmus explained, ‘The bigger attack on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid is still to come. The next round … is the 2012 budget negotiations that are supposed to conclude by September 23’. Rasmus warned: ‘Republicans will get another “bite of the apple” in spending only cuts at that time. And Obama and Democrats will likely cave in to those demands yet again, as they have repeatedly the past year’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511435711">Rasmus, 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>Things were likely to get more regressive in November. That’s when the 2 August agreement’s twelve-member ‘Bipartisan Debt Reduction Commission’ was slated to make proposals for a further $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. Obama announced that the commission’s recommendations would be ‘submitted for an up or down vote only’ by Congress. If Congress fails to approve the proposals, a pre-arranged set of cuts will kick in. Rasmus elaborated, ‘That means some small group … will … decide solely between themselves the composition and magnitude of cuts in Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, how much tax loopholes will be closed, and how much Defense spending will be cut’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511435711">Rasmus, 2011c</xref>). The reactionary composition and leanings of such commissions are well understood in the neoliberal era. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511435711">Rasmus (2011c)</xref> noted, ‘We can expect two dollars in cuts in Medicare and Social Security for every one dollar in tax loophole closing and Defense spending reductions … if we’re lucky’.</p>
<p>‘It’s hard,’ the Republican <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> columnist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511435711">William McGurn (2011)</xref> noted as the bargain was signed, ‘to look at the debt-ceiling and see it as anything but a conservative victory …. The deal has Democrats, essentially, signing on to the Republican framework for defining the problem: spending that is too high rather than taxes that are too low …. Come the 2012 elections this deal will help force the debate that all conservatives have wanted all along’.</p>

<title>Blaming the Tea Party</title>
<p>Elite pundits and other members of the political class blamed the ‘Tea Party’ for the increasingly hard right drift of American politics and policy that was on such stark display in 2011. That is what the conservative <italic>New York Times</italic> columnist David Brooks did early in the debt-ceiling crisis in July 2011, reflecting on why the Republicans would fail to sign on with Obama’s initial right-leaning offer. ‘If the Republican Party were a normal party,’ Brooks argued, ‘it would … seize the opportunity to put a long-term limit on the growth of government. It would seize the opportunity to put the country on a sound fiscal footing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435711">2011</xref>). But ‘over the past few years’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435711">Brooks (2011)</xref> claimed, the Republican Party ‘has been infected by a faction that is more of a psychological protest than a practical, governing alternative. The members of this movement do not accept the logic of compromise, no matter how sweet the terms’. Though he did not formally say so, the ‘protest movement’ Brooks referenced was the ‘Tea Party’.</p>
<p>By July 2011, <italic>Washington Post</italic> national correspondent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511435711">Dan Balz (2011)</xref> pointed the finger of blame at ‘the hold the <italic>Tea Party movement</italic> continues to have on [the Republican] party’ – the ‘biggest obstacle’ House Speaker John Boehner had to ‘overcome’ on the path to a ‘deal’. At the outer reaches of the blame-the-Tea Party phenomenon, Brooks’s fellow <italic>Times</italic> columnist Maureen Dowd waxed knowingly on how ‘the Tea Party drives [the government] Thunderbird off the cliff with the president and speaker of the House strapped in the back’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511435711">Dowd, 2011</xref>: SR11). Dowd worried that ‘the maniacal Tea Party freshmen’ were ‘trying to burn down the House they were elected to serve in …. Like gargoyles on the Capitol, the adamantine nihilists are determined to blow up the country’s prestige, their party and even their own re-election chances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511435711">2011</xref>: SR11). Dowd was astonished at the power of ‘the towel-snapping Tea Party crazies’ who have ‘changed the entire discussion. <italic>They’ve neutralized the White House. They’ve whipped their [GOP] leadership into submission. They’ve taken taxes and revenues off the table. They’ve withered the stock and bond markets</italic>’ [emphasis added], Dowd wrote, echoing Barack Obama’s claim that a small House ‘faction’ (Tea Party ‘conservatives’) was holding the US economy ‘captive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511435711">2011</xref>: SR11).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920511435711">
<title>A Democratic Presidency as Illegitimate</title>
<p>Well before the time of the debt-ceiling crisis that sparked Brooks’s comment, it had become standard fare in media commentary to refer to extremism in Washington as being driven by the Tea Party ‘insurgency’, which was thought to be pulling the more ‘establishment’ and ‘moderately’ oriented Republican Party (and Democrats) to the right, in what represented a veritable ‘revolution’ in American politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511435711">DiMaggio, 2011</xref>). But Brooks, Balz, Dowd, and much of the rest of the media establishment were missing key points. The Republican Party did not and does not care about ‘putting the country on a sound fiscal footing’. Part of its harsh posture in mid and late July of 2011 simply reflected the all too normal hyper-partisanship of a GOP that refuses to accept any Democratic presidency. ‘As a result,’ Krugman explained last July, Republicans are automatically against anything the president wants, ‘even if that president advances something their party supported in the past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511435711">2011a</xref>: A21). Obama’s 2010 health ‘reform’ measure was and is a perfect case in point, a richly corporatist measure based on past Republican legislative initiatives that Republicans (and not just those of a ‘Tea Party persuasion’) instantly denounced as ‘socialist’ once the new Democratic president embraced and advanced it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511435711">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Republicans quite ‘normally’ wished for Obama to fail so that they may place one of their own in the White House. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated more than once that the Republicans’ top priority was to ‘make Obama a one-term president’ (a rather tactless goal to announce as the country struggled with its worst economic crisis in 70 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511435711">Memoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511435711">Reich, 2011</xref>). The Republicans therefore wished to deny him the appearance of bold leadership and of having reached out across supposed ideological barriers to shed his (false) identity as a ‘big government liberal’ and to win the strategically significant Independent and ‘moderate’ votes that were so critical to his 2008 victory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0896920511435711">
<title>‘Deficits Don’t Matter’</title>
<p>Partisan goals aside, the Republican Party’s official goal of ‘deficit reduction’ is cover for its deeper, ideologically driven, plutocratic agenda. Republicans have taken advantage of every opportunity over the last three decades to run up sky high deficits and debt in the name of promoting tax cuts for the rich, endless expansion of the militarist-imperialist state, and ever increasing corporate welfare, as seen in recent examples such as the bank bailout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435711">Herman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511435711">Rasmus, 2011a</xref>). Most of the nation’s public debt is a creation of the Republicans themselves, who expect the public to believe that they have ‘found God’ again, after they were thrown out of power in 2008. Where were the supposedly independent, insurgent, ‘populist’ and anti-establishment Tea Party activists when George W. Bush and his cohorts were pushing the deficit and ‘big government’ through the roof in openly plutocratic and messianic-militarist ways? As Edward S. Herman noted in April of 2010:<disp-quote>
<p>Big Government, Deficits, Entitlements, and ‘Centrists’ … These are words that come into prominence whenever the right wing and business community go on the offensive. Big government was not featured by the right wing or business during the recent (2001–09) Bush years because, although the federal government and budget were growing, it was via an enlargement of the military and police budgets and an attack on the privacy and civil rights of ordinary citizens, in the alleged interest of ‘national security.’</p>
<p>In the Reagan years, also, the size of government grew, but this was with social budgets, organized labor, and environmental protections under attack. During George W. Bush’s term, there were a number of encroachments by the federal government on ‘state’s rights,’ e.g. allowing the feds to override state authority on matters such as environmental rules (the EPA disallowed California’s attempt to limit auto tailpipe emissions in 2007) and medical practice (the Department of Justice sought to overturn an Oregon law legalizing physician-assisted suicide in 2002 and later).</p>
<p>There were no Tea Party-like campaigns to protest this growth in government and attack on Constitutional (and state’s) rights in the Bush years, because the growing and encroaching government was in the right hands. It is only when it gets into the wrong hands and there is the threat that government will serve the undeserving poor – or even the middle class – and neglect the corporate community and national ‘security’ that business, the military-industrial complex (MIC), and right-wing protest cadres get agitated about big government. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511435711">Herman, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The extraordinary cynicism and hypocrisy of the right is clear enough: pursue irresponsible fiscal policies while in power, then push forward with propagandistic initiatives such as the ‘cut, cap, and balance’ amendment, which Republicans would never have considered passing when they controlled the White House and Congress. ‘Deficit reduction’, after all, is not a serious Republican policy in its own right, but a weapon to be called upon whenever Democrats take power, so as to ensure that the few remaining progressive impulses of the Democrats are consistently held at bay. This is no small part of what former Vice President Dick Cheney meant in 2004 when he said that ‘deficits don’t matter’, in response to the soon-to-be-fired Secretary of the Treasury Paul O’Neill’s warning about the fiscal impact of massive tax cuts for the rich combined with giant increases in military spending.</p>
<p>The modern Republicans want nothing less than complete destruction of the last remnants of the liberal state. They are driven by the desire to wage hard-right ideological warfare, demolish social welfare programs, smash workers’ organizations, concentrate political power, and advance the interests of their big money backers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511435711">Wolin, 2008</xref>). Observing that Obama had actually been pressing for greater deficit reduction than the Republicans last July, <italic>New York Times</italic> correspondent Jackie Calmes noted that the Republicans’ ‘dynamic in the debt talks reflects the culmination of a 30-year evolution in Republican thinking, dating to the start of President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The change is from emphasizing balanced budgets – or at least lower deficits – to what tax-cutting conservatives have called “starve the beast,” that is, cut taxes and force government to shrink’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511435711">Calmes, 2011a</xref>: A1). Calmes failed to mention that the Republicans only want to shrink the left hand of the state. The right hand is to remain well fed as far they are concerned.</p>

<title>Super Republicans: The Tea Party is the GOP</title>
<p>Brooks was yet further off base when he argued that the Republican Party had been taken over by the Tea Party ‘protest movement’. As we show in our book <italic>Crashing the Tea Party: Mass Media and the Campaign to Remake American Politics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511435711">2011</xref>), the conventional mainstream description of the Tea Party phenomenon as a popular protest movement is dramatically off base. The Tea Party is a loose, elite-directed conglomeration of partisan interest groups set on returning the Republican Party to power. Despite protestations to the contrary, it is partisan Republican at its core, its leading activists and main supporters accurately described by one mainstream reporter as ‘super-Republicans’. It is not an uprising or protest against the existing political system. Rather, it is a reactionary, top-down manifestation of that system, dressed up and sold as an outsider rebellion set on changing the rules in Washington and across the country. Consistent with the long-term rightward trajectory of the Republican Party and US politics since the 1970s (see below), its basic function, deeply enabled by a corporate media that eagerly spread Tea Party ‘movement’ mythology, was to help the deeply unpopular (because so transparently plutocratic) Republican Party re-brand itself in deceptive grassroots and populist clothing to take political advantage of the widespread economic insecurity imposed by the epic recession of 2008–09 during the mid-term congressional and state elections of November 2010. As we show at some length in the aforementioned volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511435711">Street and DiMaggio, 2011</xref>), Matt Taibbi was correct when he argued two years ago: ‘The Tea Party today is being pitched in the media as this great threat to the Republican Party; in reality, the Tea Party is the GOP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511435711">Taibbi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘Tea Party has pulled a hesitant Republican Party to the right’ narrative lacks empirical evidence. Our review of ideology in Congress (as revealed in analysis of voting records of the parties from the interest group <italic>Americans for Democratic Action</italic>) finds that the current crop of ‘Tea Party’ Republicans are no more extreme in their voting than Republicans were in other extreme right-wing periods in their party’s past, as in the mid-1990s, when the ‘Republican Revolution’ shut down government numerous times in an effort to gut the social welfare state. The extremism of the Tea Party is nothing new; it is part of an ongoing trend visible in American politics that has been around for the last 15 years.</p>
<p>There are almost no significant differences in the voting records of ‘Tea Party Republicans’ and ‘establishment Republicans’ when it comes to political-economic issues. In July 2011, the Republican House passed a bill that would have permitted an increase in the national debt limit only if it was accompanied a ‘cut, cap, and balance pledge’ that required supporters to vote for ‘substantial cuts in spending’, ‘passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment’, and ‘enforceable spending caps’. As a hallmark of the Tea Party agenda, support for such an effort should have separated Tea Party and ‘moderate’ Republicans to a significant degree. In reality, however, there was no real difference: the bill was supported by 93 percent of the House’s 60 Tea Party Caucus members and by 94 percent of its 180 non-Tea Party Republicans. It is the same basic super-Republican story with other bellwether House votes earlier last year: ‘Obamacare Repeal’ (supported by 100 percent of all House Republicans, Tea Party and non-Tea Party, in January 2011); Patriot Act Reauthorization (supported by 90 percent of Tea Party Republicans and 91 percent of non-Tea Party Republicans in the House); the Balanced Budget Amendment (supported by 93 percent of Tea Party Republicans and 94 percent of non-Tea Party Republicans in the House). The first real hint of ideological and/or factional division came with the debt ceiling vote of 1 August 2011 (supported by 53 percent of the House’s Tea Party Caucus and 81 percent of non-Tea Party House Republicans), and even here the majority of Tea Party officeholders supported the right wing legislation that predicated lifting the debt ceiling on passage of legislation that relied only on spending cuts and no taxes to reduce the deficit.</p>
<p>The bill was rightly considered a great Tea Party triumph despite the formal opposition of the most extreme section of the Tea Party Caucus. It was consistent with the demand of the powerful right-wing group Americans for Tax Reform, which has been pushing politicians for decades to sign a pledge to never vote for any net tax increase under any circumstances. All but six of the 240 Republicans in the House, along with two Democrats, have signed the pledge, meaning that at least 174 of the House’s 180 non-Tea Party Republicans are reactionary enemies of positive government action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511435711">Bruni, 2011</xref>). Such harsh, hard-right Republican reality notwithstanding, the <italic>New York Times</italic> insisted on the notion of strong division between a moderate GOP ‘center’ and a Tea Party movement that was pushing the party to the right. ‘Despite the success of Tea Party lawmakers in the debt debate,’ <italic>Times</italic> reporter Michael D. Shear wrote on 2 August, ‘Republican candidates in 2012 are still unsure about moving too far from the center’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511435711">Shear, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The Long Right Tilt</title>
<p>Tea Party ‘super Republican’ positions (which we might half-humorously call ‘Teapublican’ positions) are consistent with the deeper and long-term rightward drift of the Republican Party and American politics more broadly over the last 35 years of the neoliberal era. According to a common narrative in the mass media, the contemporary bipartisan political system is terribly polarized along a left–right continuum, with Democrats moving dramatically to the left and Republicans moving somewhat less dramatically to the right. This is a great illusion. Republican politicians have become far more reactionary than the Democrats have been ‘liberal’ over the last half century and the rightward shift of the Republican Party is the main cause of such polarization as exists. Democratic Party liberalism rose in the 1960s and 1970s, a reflection largely of the defeat and subsequent exodus of center-right southern Democrats from the party. From the Carter administration onward, however, Democrats have grown increasingly conservative in their embrace of neoliberalism and their declining support for worker protections and entitlement programs. The Democratic Party today is essentially a party of moderate conservatives, as reflected in Bill Clinton’s celebration of ‘Eisenhower Republican’ orientation, and in Obama’s deep commitment to bipartisan ‘compromise’ and ‘middle ground’ (such an approach cannot help but pull Obama and the rest of the party in an ever rightward direction). Since the 1970s, by contrast, Republicans became nearly twice as conservative, never moving back to the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511435711">Hacker and Pierson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511435711">Hacker and Pierson (2005)</xref>, this dangerous and ongoing rightward tilt has resulted from a number of underlying and interrelated, overlapping factors in the neoliberal era, including the following:</p>

<title>Dismal Demobilizing Democrats</title>
<p>It was not only or even mainly moderate conservatives like Brooks who cite the super-powered Tea Party dragon to divert attention from the ever more rightward drift of their favorite mainstream business party. Democrats have consistently pointed to the Tea Party specter to rally voters to agree to cower under the umbrella of a lesser evil Democratic Party that has itself moved well to the plutocratic right. ‘Sure,’ the Democrats’ message to their liberal and progressive voting ‘base’ runs: ‘we may not have lived up to our progressive campaign promises of democratic change, but look at who we have to deal with and who stands to win if we are voted out: the swamp-fed Tea Party monster!’ <italic>Times</italic> columnist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511435711">Ross Douthat (2011)</xref> put his finger on a key point in his reflections on why Obama has consistently ‘caved’ (as ‘disappointed’ liberals say again and again) in the face of Teapublican demands since the significantly Tea Party-fueled Republican triumph in the congressional mid-term elections last November. As Douthat noted:<disp-quote>
<p>The not-so secret is that the White House has given ground on purpose. Just as Republicans want to use the debt ceiling to make the president live with bigger spending cuts than he would otherwise support, Obama’s political team wants to use those cra-a-a-zy Tea Partiers to make Democrats live with bigger cuts than they normally would support. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511435711">Douthat, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Douthat thought the administration wanted a ‘right-leaning deficit deal’ in its effort to woo ideology-averse Independent voters for the 2012 election, who had been told again and again (falsely) that Obama is a left leaning big government liberal. There may have been some truth in that formulation, but the bigger story was likely that the center-right Obama wanted to reward his big money backers and was more than willing to alienate much of his liberal base – even going to the point of proposing attacks on Medicare and Social Security (in by now standard defiance of his campaign pledges) – in order to serve elite business interests. Of course, ‘those cra-a-a-zy’ Teapublicans owed no small part of their power to the Democratic Party’s savage demobilization of its own progressive base as it acted in accord with its own longstanding identity as (in former Nixon strategist Kevin Phillips’s phrase) ‘history’s second most enthusiastic capitalist party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511435711">Street and DiMaggio, 2011</xref>). The left-liberal political scientist Sheldon Wolin easily foretold this Democratic performance in his 2008 book, <italic>Democracy Incorporated</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>The timidity of a Democratic Party mesmerized by centrist precepts points to the crucial fact that, for the poor, minorities, the working-class, anti-corporatists, pro-environmentalists, and anti-imperialists, there is no opposition party working actively on their behalf. And this despite the fact that these elements are recognized as the loyal base of the party. By ignoring dissent and assuming the dissenters have no alternative, the party serves an important, if ironical, stabilizing function and in effect marginalizes any possible threat to the corporate allies of the Republicans. Unlike the Democrats, however, the Republicans, with their combination of reactionary and innovative elements, are a cohesive, if not a coherent, opposition force. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511435711">Wolin, 2008</xref>: 206)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The electoral consequences of the Democrats’ centrist timidity were deadly. In the general mid-term contest, the Democrats suffered from significant declines in voter participation on the part of segments of the electorate that played key roles in their triumphs in the 2006 (Congressional) and 2008 (Congressional and presidential) elections cycles: union households, young voters, and black voters. By contrast, voters who identified themselves as ‘conservative’ increased their share of the active electorate significantly from 2006 and 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511435711">6</xref></sup> This was all it took for the highly energized and re-branded Republican Party – what we only half-jokingly call ‘the Tea.O.P.’ – to clean up in a mid-term election, when turnout is considerably smaller than during the quadrennial race that includes a presidential election. As the left sociologist and activist Charlie Post noted, no big ‘shift to the right’ was required or took place: ‘An 8 percent shift in an election where only 40 percent voted – a shift of approximately three percent of the total eligible voters – accounts for the Republicans’ victory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511435711">Post, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511435711">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was the victory of a Republican Party that has become radically regressive, authoritarian, and arch-plutocratic over recent decades, well before the rise of the Tea Party ‘protest movement’ Brooks accuses of spoiling the GOP’s status as ‘a normal conservative party’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511435711">Wolin (2008)</xref> noted well before the contemporary Tea Party brand was formally launched, the word ‘conservative’ merits quotation marks when used in connection to the radically regressive 21st-century GOP. He writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The character of the Republic Party reflects a profound change: radicalism has shifted its location and meaning. Formerly it was associated with the Left and the use of political power to lift the standard of living and life prospects of the lower classes, of those who were disadvantaged under current distributive principles. Radicalism is now the property of those who, quaintly, call themselves ‘conservatives’ and are called such by media commentators. In fact, pseudo-conservatism is in charge of and owns the radicalizing powers that are dramatically changing, in some cases revolutionizing, the conditions of human life, of economy, of politics, foreign policy, education, and the prospects for the planet. It is hard to imagine any power more radical in its determination to undo the social gains of the past century. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511435711">Wolin, 2008</xref>: 206)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is the hard right party that the deeply conservative Obama cannot stop readily accommodating. Obama keeps ‘caving in’ to the Republican Party, much to the all too credulous dismay of many liberals and progressives who cling to the naive notion that the president is really one of them. We are familiar by now with the standard liberal defense. The president, an all too persistent story line goes, is a progressive, left-leaning man of liberal instincts boxed in by cra-a-a-zy Tea Partiers who ‘took over the Republican Party’ and left him no choice but to shift rightward to ‘get something done’. This narrative ought to be understood as embarrassing and nonsensical. The ‘Tea Party’ is an expression of the long-term rightward drift of the ever more radical, pseudo-conservative Republican Party, for which ‘deficit reduction’ is just a tool in its long-term war on those parts of government that do not serve the affluent. Consistent with his longstanding identity as a corporate and imperial ‘player’, the thoroughly corporate and imperial Obama governed from the big business-friendly, Teapublican-accommodating center-right in his first year, when the Democrats held both houses of Congress, including a filibuster-proof Senate majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511435711">8</xref></sup> He and his party stood down progressive organizations, energies, and voters (another promise kept to corporate and Wall Street sponsors) in 2009 and 2010, leaving the door open for the Republicans’ Tea Party rebranding and triumph, a victory that helped Obama move yet further into his right-leaning, privilege-pleasing ‘comfort zone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511435711">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Irrelevant Majority</title>
<p>The high-stakes budget and debt-ceiling policy drama of 2011 stood in standard bold and bipartisan defiance of majority public opinion. Most Americans believed that job creation should be a bigger government priority than deficit reduction, that social protections should be expanded (not contracted), that the rich are under-taxed, that wealth inequality and poverty are the nation’s leading moral issues, that big business and the wealthy exercise far too much influence over government, that government dollars should be significantly transferred from military to social programs (Obama’s non-existent peace dividend), that Social Security and Medicare benefits should be protected and expanded, and that public sector workers deserve and require full collective bargaining rights – the very rights that came under attack in numerous Republican-controlled state legislatures in 2011. An April 2011 Washington Post/ABC News survey found that 78 percent of Americans were opposed to cuts in Medicare, while 72 percent favored taxing the rich in order to reduce the deficit. A July 14–17 Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 72 percent of Americans believed that Americans earning more than $250,000 a year should pay more in taxes (Washington Post/ABC).</p>
<p>But none of this sort of longstanding majority progressive opinion ever seems to matter in the US, where, as the American philosopher John Dewey noted more than a century ago, ‘politics is the shadow cast on society by big business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511435711">Chomsky, 2006</xref>: 206). Welcome to America’s gaping ‘democratic deficit’, a significantly greater problem than the nation’s much bemoaned and overplayed financial deficit. Politicians and pundits allied with both wings of the American one-and-a-half party system can blame the poorly understood Tea Party ‘movement’ all they want, but the real and deeper culprits are that narrow system and the aforementioned unelected dictatorship of money it serves and protects. The hope that anything progressive can be achieved within and through that system seems ever more dubious with each passing electoral extravaganza and political branding campaign. But elections and opinion polls are hardly the only or most effective method of expressing public sentiments over and against concentrated wealth and power. Mass street demonstrations and strikes and social movement formation beneath and beyond the dominant institutions are the more relevant popular avenues.</p>
<p>While serious progressives must surely fight for reforms and corrections like the expansion and protection of labor rights and carbon emission limits and welfare benefits (and much more), they should also realize that reforms will not suffice. Dewey was surely correct when he warned that the nation’s democratic institutions would never escape the giant capitalist ‘shadow’ as long as power rests with ‘business for private profit through private control of banking, land, industry, reinforced by command of the press, press agents, and other means of publicity and propaganda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511435711">Chomsky, 2006</xref>: 206).</p>

According to MacFarquhar, after conducting in depth interviews with candidate Obama and a survey of his political career, she writes: ‘In his view of history, in his respect for tradition, in his skepticism that the world can be changed any way but very, very slowly, Obama is deeply conservative.’ For a discussion of the debt ceiling dispute between Republicans and Democrats, see the following excerpt from the <italic>New York Times</italic>: ‘It has been clear since last fall that the government would hit the debt ceiling, the legal maximum that it can borrow, at some point during 2011. In May, the Treasury said that it had reached the legal limit and that it would begin to cancel obligations to other parts of the government, allowing it to borrow enough money to pay all of the government’s bills until early August. …The president asked Congress to increase the limit. House Republicans refused unanimously, insisting that Democrats first agree to cut spending by the same amount.”</p></fn>

<p>The ongoing assault on Social Security is a telling follow-up to more than two decades of the federal government looting the Social Security trust fund to pay down federal debt created by massive tax cuts on the rich and big business. As Jack Rasmus noted in <italic>Z Magazine</italic>, ‘payroll taxes paid by working class households earning less than $108,600 a year have risen progressively since the mid-1980s as taxes on corporations and investor households have been cut. More than $2 trillion in revenue surplus has been generated the past 25 years by the payroll tax that finances social security. Unfortunately, that entire $2 trillion surplus has been diverted from the social security trust fund by Congress and presidents since Reagan and used every year to offset the growing federal budget deficits. That offsetting of U.S. budget deficits has enabled Congress in turn to pass massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, from Reagan to Obama. In other words, what amounts to $2 trillion of workers’ deferred wages paid into social security has been transferred to the wealthy and corporations, in large part to enable the continuing $3.8 trillion dollar tax cuts for the rich and corporations.” See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511435711">Rasmus (2011a)</xref> – an excellent guide to the last 30-plus years of multi-pronged top-down class warfare in the US.</p></fn>

<p>Of course, a beginning point would be for the government to stop raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for tax cuts for the rich. Currently, just less than one-third (32 percent) of the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt is comprised of money the US government has ‘borrowed from itself’ from Social Security. The US government owes itself $4.6 trillion, mostly borrowed from Social Security revenues.
