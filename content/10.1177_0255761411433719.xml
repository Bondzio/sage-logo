<abstract>
<p>Nine National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) accredited universities in the United States (US) with the greatest populations of international students were surveyed to identify the status of East Asian international students’ attitudes toward their schools. Among East Asian international music students at US higher education institutions, the results indicated that the professor’s reputation, scholarships, and the program’s reputation were perceived as the most influential factors impacting the program choice; a good relationship with professors, good feedback from professors, and emotional stability were perceived as the most influential factors impacting academic success; and the professor’s teaching, the professor’s expertise, and the improvement of musical skills were perceived as the most influential factors impacting students’ satisfaction levels. The most problematic issues reported were the language barrier and the cultural differences between their host and home countries. In addition, many of the East Asian international music students in this study noted financial difficulties. Recommendation and conclusion are provided for US institutions and East Asian international students.</p>

<p>Over the past several decades, the importance of international students has been increasingly emphasized in the United States (US) institutions of higher learning. According to the 2010 report of US Immigrant and Customs Enforcement (USICE), ‘on June 30, 2010, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) contained records for 1,084,122 active non-immigrant students, exchanging visitors, and their dependants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411433719">USICE, 2010</xref>, p. 4). Indeed, the United States of America has been the leading country in hosting international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411433719">Edmonds, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The contributions of international students have been crucial to US higher education institutions and the economy in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411433719">Farnam, 2005</xref>). Students have spent approximately US$13.5 billion on tuition and living expenses each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411433719">Chow, Baumgartner, Bhandari, &amp; Donahue, 2007</xref>). Especially the number of Asian students at colleges and universities in the US has dramatically increased over the last decades and has reached the two-thirds mark among the entire international student population in US higher education institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411433719">USICE, 2006</xref>). Based on the 2006 report of USICE, the total percentage of international students from Asia was 65% among foreign students in US higher education institutions, and ‘the top five countries (Korea, India, China, Japan, and Taiwan) of citizenship by active foreign students were from Asia and represent 48% of the foreign student population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0255761411433719">USICE, 2006</xref>, para. 3). Moreover, except for India, every country among the top five was located in East Asia. From these data, it can be concluded that international students from Asia, and especially East Asia, have a clear presence in many US institutions.</p>
<p>The greater the presence of international students, the greater may be the need to profile international students for the benefit of US higher education institutions. There has been an initial look at the basic profile of international students. The US government publishes statistical reports annually, such as the <italic>Opendoors: Report of the Institute of International Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411433719">Institute of International Education [IIE], 2007</xref>). Also, numerous researchers in the US have studied the status of international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411433719">Kagan &amp; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411433719">Pederson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411433719">Perrucci &amp; Hu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411433719">Sohrab &amp; Myrna, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411433719">Stoynoff, 1997</xref>). In summary, international students are very important to US institutions of higher education, and many studies have identified the status of international students in the US and the difficulties international students face in adjusting their lives to the US.</p>
<p>Asian students have also occupied a substantive place in music schools in US institutions of higher education. The Julliard School of Music, one of the finest music schools in the US, is often called <italic>Kolliard</italic> because there are so many Korean international students in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411433719">Korean Concert Society, 2004</xref>). In fact, more than half of the students in the Julliard pre-college class have been documented as coming from Korea, China, and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411433719">Thomas, 2003</xref>), but there is a lack of research that has been conducted on Asian music students in US institutions of higher education. Actually there have been numerous studies conducted on US music students in higher education institutions. Studies have indicated that music students’ previous musical experiences before entering college were one of the most important factors music majors used in their college choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411433719">Gilbert, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411433719">Gillespie &amp; Hamann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411433719">Jones, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761411433719">Ploumis-Devick, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411433719">Schmidt, Zdzinski, &amp; Ballard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761411433719">Shelter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411433719">Sichivitsa, 2003</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411433719">Jones (1964)</xref> indicated that support from parents and teachers was a very important factor in the career choice of college music students.</p>
<p>While these studies have produced fruitful results for investigating reasons why college music students choose music as their college majors (the career choice of music majors), other studies have addressed identifying factors on the college choice of music majors (why college music students choose a specific school; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411433719">Locke, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411433719">Ludeman, 1964</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411433719">Locke (1982)</xref> concluded that the reputation of the music department and faculty were influential factors in the college choice of music majors. These results coincide with the results of studies about the college choice of Asian international students in US higher education institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411433719">Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411433719">Kelly, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411433719">Poock &amp; Love, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411433719">Talbot, Maier, &amp; Rushlau, 1996</xref>) indicating the reputation of the programs and the faculty were the most influential factors in their college choices. However, there have been few studies about international music students, especially East Asian international music students, even though they have been documented as having a presence in US music institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411433719">Korean Concert Society, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0255761411433719">Thomas, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons the purpose of this study was to describe the attitudes of East Asian (Korea, China, Taiwan, and Japan) international music students in US higher education institutions toward US higher education issues. There were four major research questions for this study: (1) what were the perceived factors that influenced the program choice of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions?; (2) what were the perceived factors influencing academic success of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions?; (3) what was the perceived program satisfaction level of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions?; and (4) what were the perceived solutions to problems encountered as East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions? This information could be beneficial for both US higher education music institutions and international music students in their institutions in that the institutions could develop strategies to attract more East Asian international music students to their institutions and the students could avoid pitfalls and increase their opportunities in the music institutions.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section2-0255761411433719">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The population of this study was East Asian (Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese) international music students attending nine US major universities with a large number of international students and with music programs accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411433719">NASM, 2007</xref>). After the international offices or schools of music forwarded the participant invitation email to the East Asian international music students at their universities, 92 participants completed the East Asian International Music Student Inventory (EAIMSI) and were used as the responding sample for this study.</p>
<p>Respondents from this study were 63 females (68%) and 21 males (23%) from Korea (<italic>n</italic> = 49, 53%), China (<italic>n</italic> = 13, 14%), Japan (<italic>n</italic> = 10, 11%), and Taiwan (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 10%), and eight people (9%) did not indicate their gender and 11 people (12%) who did not report their nationality. The average age was 27.83 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.76, ranging from 18.00 to 39.00). Among them, 63 participants were single (68%), 20 participants were married (22%), and nine people (10%) did not indicate their marital status. Regarding their studies, the most common major was piano performance (<italic>n</italic> = 38, 41%), followed by voice (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 12%), violin (<italic>n</italic> = 6, 7%), composition (<italic>n</italic> = 6, 7%), conducting (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 5%), jazz studies (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 5%), cello (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 2%), music theory (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), flute (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), saxophone (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), organ (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), harp (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), musicology (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%), and music education (<italic>n</italic> = 1, 1%); there were 12 people (13%) who did not indicate their music major fields.</p>
<p>The participants’ degree levels were doctorate (<italic>n</italic> = 48, 52%), masters (<italic>n</italic> = 28, 30%), undergraduate (<italic>n</italic> = 7, 8%), and nine people (10%) did not report their current degree level. For language proficiency, there was a greater number of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 59, 64%) who had submitted Test of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores than participants (<italic>n</italic> = 17, 18%) who had completed English as a second language (ESL) courses and there were six participants (7%) who were not required to submit English proficiency and one participant (1%) who documented English proficiency another way. Nine people (10%) did not indicate their English proficiency documentation. Additionally, 13 participants submitted Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores (14%).</p>
<p>Regarding primary economic funding sources for their studies, parents (<italic>n</italic> = 38, 41%) were the most common primary economic source, followed by Teaching Assistant (TA)/Teaching Fellow (TF) positions (<italic>n</italic> = 22, 24%), scholarships (<italic>n</italic> = 17, 18%), personal (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 4%), and others (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 2%). Lastly, the average number of years residing in the US was 5.11 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.51, ranging from 0.25 to 14.00). Nine people did not report the number of years they had resided in the US. In addition, the largest number of participants lived in off-campus apartments (<italic>n</italic> = 64, 70%), followed by on-campus apartments (<italic>n</italic> = 14, 15%), dormitories (<italic>n</italic> = 3, 3%), and others (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 2%). Nine people did not indicate their living status.</p>

<title>Data collection and procedure</title>
<p>This study was a descriptive study using survey methodological procedures, with an online, web-based questionnaire. The <italic>QuestionPro</italic> online survey tool was used for data gathering from the East Asian international music student participants, in that ‘<italic>QuestionPro</italic>’s online survey software is a one-stop solution for managing feedback via email’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761411433719"><italic>QuestionPro</italic>, 2008</xref>, para. 1).</p>
<p>For this study, it was deemed more appropriate to use convenience sampling for the following reasons. First, it was necessary to choose US higher education institutions with large populations of international students so as best to represent the international student population. Past research has documented that international students tend to choose several particular institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411433719">Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411433719">Kelly, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411433719">IIE, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411433719">Poock &amp; Love, 2001</xref>) and that led to the selection of the type of school that would commonly attract large numbers of international students. Second, it was necessary for the institutions to have music programs. Since there are US higher education institutions that do not have many international students or music programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411433719">US News &amp; World Report, 2008</xref>), this study used convenience sampling to ensure representativeness of international students and music students in the accessible population.</p>
<p>In order to improve the generalizability of this study, nine universities were selected that had the greatest number of international students and that had an accredited music program. Two considerations were used in the selection of US higher education institutions utilized in this study: (1) US higher education institutions that had the largest number of international students; and (2) US higher education institutions that had music programs accredited by the NASM in that NASM ‘has been recognized by the United States Department of Education as the agency responsible for the accreditation of all music curricula’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411433719">NASM, 2003</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>Concerning US higher education institutions with the largest number of international students, the <italic>Opendoors</italic> report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411433719">IEE, 2007</xref>), supported by the US Department of State’s Bureau of Educational Cultural Affairs, documented the status of international students in US higher education institutions by listing the 20 US higher education institutions with the most international students. From these 20 schools, nine were accredited by the NASM and agreed to participate.</p>
<p>After, the international office forwarded the participant invitation email to the East Asian international music students in the nine schools, 182 people of East international music students accessed the EAIMSI, 99 people started the EAIMSI, and seven people did not complete the EAIMSI. As a result, 92 participants completed the EAIMSI voluntarily. The average time taken to complete this questionnaire was 12.96 minutes, and the completion rate was 93%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0255761411433719">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Based on the research questions, the EAIMSI was developed. The EAIMSI questionnaire contained a total of 68 questions that were divided into three sections: (1) 53 questions in five-point Likert-type scale format (strongly disagree = 1, disagree = 2, neutral = 3, agree = 4, strongly agree = 5) for measuring the perceived factors influencing the program choice, academic success, and program satisfaction level of East Asian international students; (2) two questions in an open-ended format for identifying the greatest challenges encountered by East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions, and any perceived solutions to those challenges; and (3) 13 demographical questions including eight multiple choice questions and five open-ended questions for background information of participants. Each question of the EAIMSI was developed after reviewing literature related to the research questions.</p>
<p>The first research question addressed the perceived factors that influenced the program choice of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions. There were 18 questions concerning the program choice of East Asian international students. The second research question addressed the perceived factors influencing the academic success of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions. There were 15 questions concerning the perceived factors. The third research question addressed the perceived program satisfaction level of East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions. There were 20 questions concerning students’ perceived program satisfaction.</p>
<p>The fourth research question addressed the perceived challenges and possible solutions to the challenges encountered by East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions. Two questions were asked in an open-ended format in order to obtain in-depth, descriptive information from the East Asian international music student participants: (1) one question concerning three of the most difficult problems encountered as an East Asian international music student attending a US higher education institution; and (2) one question concerning a possible solution to each listed problem. The responses to the EAIMSI were analyzed for each section of the questionnaire; research question I (program choice: question 1 through 18); research question II (academic success: question 19 through 33); research question III (satisfaction: question 34 through 53); research question IV (challenges and solutions: questions 54 and 55); and 13 demographical questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0255761411433719">
<title>Validity and reliability</title>
<p>Content validity was evaluated of the EAIMSI by a panel of three experts, including a director of an international office, a faculty member in music, and an expert in survey research methodology. Once the three panel members were selected, the 20 content-validity questions with the EAIMSI were sent to the three members because all three members returned an acceptance email. There were minor revisions based on the suggestions of the panel of experts. After the content validity check for the EAIMSI was finalized, a field test was conducted. Three East Asian students in a US higher music education institution were selected for the field test. In general, the three students replied that the survey questions were related to their lives as East Asian international music students in US higher education institutions. In addition, each question was clear and easy to follow, and there were no further suggestions.</p>
<p>Once the field test was completed, the reliability check was conducted. Participants in the pilot test were East Asian international music students at a southeastern university with a large number of music students in the US and had music programs accredited by the NASM. There were 12 test–retest reliability respondents who completed the EAIMSI twice. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (Pearson <italic>r</italic>) ranged from 0.88 to 1.00 for each question. Based on the relatively high reliability coefficients, all questions were retained in the questionnaire.</p>

<p>Regarding the perceived challenges encountered by East Asian international music students attending US higher education institutions and possible solutions to the challenges (research question IV), respondents indicated that the language barrier (<italic>n</italic> = 50) and the cultural differences (<italic>n</italic> = 32) between their host and own countries were the most problematic issues in their lives in the US. Concerning the language barrier, several respondents presented specific examples of their difficulties: (1) writing academic papers in English (<italic>n</italic> = 9); (2) speaking English (<italic>n</italic> = 4); (3) possessing effective presentation skills in English (<italic>n</italic> = 3); and (4) possessing good research skills in English (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
<p>Possible solutions to these challenges were provided: (1) international students should try to get acclimated to the host culture through making American friends (<italic>n</italic> = 29), joining social activities (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and listening to the radio and watching TV (<italic>n</italic> = 1). A student stated, ‘Make American friends who are also musicians and have them to borrow their notes and to revise your papers.’ Another student stated, ‘Make some time for social meeting between Asian students and American students;’ and (2) international students need to practice English with patience because it takes time to learn (<italic>n</italic> = 11). A student stated, ‘Time will solve many problems.’ The students also presented several suggestions concerning how to practice English effectively, such as writing in English everyday (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and reading as many English books as possible (<italic>n</italic> = 7). A student stated, ‘Language barrier can be overcome by reading more material in every field.’ Another student stated, ‘Write diary everyday;’ (3) international students need to be more assertive in class, as well as in their social lives and with a positive attitude (<italic>n</italic> = 8), such as trying to understand American ways (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and accepting all cultural differences (<italic>n</italic> = 1); (4) international students need to prepare for class in advance (<italic>n</italic> = 3); and (5) international students need to not be afraid of failing (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>
<p>In addition, many of the East Asian international music students (<italic>n</italic> = 35) in this study noted financial difficulties. Participants were concerned about increasing tuition and living expenses. Specifically, two respondents reported they were concerned with expensive medical expenses. Some suggested solutions to this problem were that the schools should offer more job opportunities in the schools (<italic>n</italic> = 11), more scholarships (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and inexpensive medical services (<italic>n</italic> = 2) as international students cannot work outside of school.</p>
<p>Respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 13) also indicated they experienced difficulties in maintaining good relationships with others, such as professors (<italic>n</italic> = 5), Americans (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and people in their own culture (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Possible solutions to this problem were that professors and Americans need to be more open-minded to international students (<italic>n</italic> = 4). However, two students suggested just focusing on studying instead of dealing with this issue in that the students could not control this problem. Maintaining emotional stability was another important difficulty noted by the respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 9), as well as loneliness (<italic>n</italic> = 5) or homesickness (<italic>n</italic> = 4). One respondent stated, ‘I need a mentor without any fee, who help [sic] me both mentally and physically once a week.’</p>

<title>Conclusions and discussions</title>
<p>The findings from this current study may be valuable for both US higher education institutions and international music students in their institutions. The findings of this study suggest that ‘the professor’s reputation,’ ‘scholarships’ and ‘the program’s reputation’ were the most important factors perceived to influence the program choice of East Asian international music students in US higher education institutions. These data confirmed findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411433719">Chen (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411433719">Poock and Love (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411433719">Talbot and colleagues (1996)</xref> who found that the most important factor in attracting international students was the reputation of the school. Possible implications of this finding are that US higher education music institutions should: (1) strive to attract and maintain the highest quality professors for promoting the reputation of the school; and (2) attempt to provide as many scholarships as possible in order to attract East Asian international music students to their schools.</p>
<p>Similar to previous studies, the findings of the current study indicated that a ‘good relationship with professors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411433719">Woody, 2000</xref>) and ‘good feedback from professors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411433719">Burt &amp; Mills, 2006</xref>) were the most influential factors to influence the self-perceived academic success of East Asian international music students. In contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761411433719">Perrucci &amp; Hu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411433719">Wan, Chapman, &amp; Biggs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411433719">Yeh &amp; Inose, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411433719">Ying, 2003</xref>), language factors in the current study were perceived to be less important than the professor factors.</p>
<p>The reasons that professor factors were perceived to be more influential than language factors, and that conversational English was perceived to be more important than the English writing, might be related to the fact that this study focused on the East Asian international ‘music’ students. For music students in private lesson settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411433719">Kostaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411433719">Teachout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411433719">Wolfgang, 1990</xref>), conversational English skills might be more important than English writing skills. An implication of this finding might be that music faculty may wish to consider the best ways to build and maintain good relationships with East Asian international music students by providing appropriate both verbal and non-verbal feedback.</p>
<p>Another top factor influencing the academic success of East Asian international music students was emotional stability. This finding is supported extensively in the literature. According to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411433719">Yeh and Inose (2003)</xref>, East Asian international students were at high risk for alienation and their stress levels were prominently higher than those of international students with European backgrounds. In order to help them adjust their lives to US culture smoothly, faculty may need to communicate with their students in every lesson about the student’s sense of accomplishment, stability, and frustrations. Also, East Asian international students should consider trying to build social support networks in the host culture for maintaining emotional stability.</p>
<p>East Asian international music students in this study indicated that ‘the support of the student-writing lab,’ ‘the support of international office,’ and ‘the support of the student-counseling center’ were the least influential factors perceived to influence academic success. This finding supports extant literature results that Asian international students tended not to be familiar with using counseling centers provided by their schools, even though they were experiencing mental distress, because they may not want to admit to having problems or may not take the time or resources to fix the problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761411433719">Sohrab &amp; Myrna, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0255761411433719">Sue &amp; Sue, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411433719">Yuen &amp; Tinsley, 1981</xref>). Universities may want to determine the best ways to improve the quality of the student-support systems such as the student counseling center and the student writing lab in order to reduce stress and mental distress that these respondents have experienced.</p>
<p>Regarding satisfaction levels of East Asian international music students in US higher education institutions, this study found that ‘the professor’s teaching,’ ‘the professor’s expertise’ and ‘the improvement of musical skills’ were the highest-rated factors for the perceived program satisfaction level of East Asian international music students, which support extent findings of previous studies in that the professor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411433719">Burt &amp; Mills, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0255761411433719">Woody, 2000</xref>) and musical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411433719">Kostaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0255761411433719">Teachout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411433719">Wolfgang, 1990</xref>) were the most important variables in the lives of music students. Furthermore, the current study’s findings suggested the professor was perceived to be an important factor in both program choice and satisfaction of East Asian international music students in the US. An implication of this finding could be that US institutions may wish to consider sending more faculty members abroad for recruitment tours, which could encourage familiarity and comfort between the faculty members and the prospective students.</p>
<p>In this study ‘the food,’ ‘the service of the international office,’ and ‘the practice rooms’ were the lowest-rated factors for the perceived program satisfaction level of the students. Moreover, the service provided by the international office was perceived to be one of the lowest-rated factors for both the academic success and satisfaction level of East Asian international music students, even though the international office exists specifically to help international students. In addition, US music institutions may want to consider that the practice rooms were the lowest-rated factor for the perceived program satisfaction level of the students. The practice room is an important place for music students to stay extensive hours every day to increase their performance skills and it serves a social means of talking to other students outside the practice rooms during practice breaks. It may be important, then, for US music institutions to consider improving the condition and availability of practice rooms as a top priority for attracting and retaining satisfied international music students.</p>
<p>Regarding the perceived challenges and possible solutions to the challenges encountered by East Asian international music students, the language barrier was the most often-cited issue in adjusting their lives to the US and is supported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411433719">Kagan &amp; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761411433719">Stoynoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411433719">Wan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411433719">Yeh &amp; Inose, 2003</xref>). These data suggested that students found writing academic papers to be the most difficult skill in English and further confirms the result of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0255761411433719">Ying’s (2003)</xref> study. Moreover, these music students perceived that the level of their own written English skills were the lowest among other English skills. To solve this problem, students presented several suggestions such as writing in a diary in English everyday and practicing English with patience, in that learning is not instantaneous.</p>
<p>Another problematic issue perceived by the East Asian international music students was emotional stress due to the cultural differences between their host and own countries. This finding is also supported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761411433719">Pedersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411433719">Yeh &amp; Inose, 2003</xref>) in that international students have been shown to experience culture shock. In order to overcome this barrier, students suggested making American friends and spending as much time as possible with them. Similar results were found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411433719">Kagan and Cohen’s (1990)</xref> study of 159 international and American students; they found that having both American and native friends was one of the most important factors influencing the academic achievement and the cultural adjustment of international students.</p>
<p>Another suggested solution related to attitudes. East Asian international music students indicated that a positive attitude was very important to their adjustment to US cultural ways, such as trying to understand American customs, accepting cultural differences, and not being afraid of failing. This might imply that East Asian international students in US higher education music institutions may need to maintain an open mind concerning US culture and a positive attitude in order to make a successful adjustment in the US.</p>
<p>The findings aligned with results of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411433719">Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761411433719">Pook &amp; Love, 2001</xref>) that found financial matters to be one of the top priorities in the lives of East Asian international music students. Approximately 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 36) of East Asian international music students indicated that they were experiencing financial difficulties in relation to tuition and living expenses. The findings showed that the most common primary economic source was parents, followed by a TA/TF position, and scholarships. Because international students cannot work off-campus, they want their schools to provide more scholarships and on-campus job opportunities in the schools.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings of the current study could be beneficial for both US higher education music institutions and their international music students as a way to develop strategies to attract more East Asian international music students to their institutions and the students could avoid pitfalls and increase their opportunities in the music institutions. While the financial costs to the universities that have been discussed in this section might seem ominous, the benefits of having satisfied, productive, highly-skilled international music students seems to be worth the effort.</p>

<p>Neuf universités accréditées à l’Association Nationale des Écoles de Musique (NASM) aux Etats-Unis avec le plus grand nombre d’étudiants internationaux ont été interrogés afin d’identifier le statut des attitudes des étudiants internationaux de l’Asie de l’Est vers leurs écoles. Parmi ces étudiants de musique dans les établissements d’enseignement supérieur américains, les résultats indiquent que la réputation du professeur, les bourses, et la réputation du programme ont été perçus comme des facteurs les plus influents sur le choix de programme; une bonne relation avec les professeurs, les bons commentaires des professeurs, et la stabilité émotionnelle ont été perçus comme des facteurs les plus influents sur la réussite scolaire; et l’enseignement du professeur, l’expertise du professeur, et l’amélioration des compétences musicales ont été perçus comme des facteurs les plus influents sur les niveaux de satisfaction des étudiants. Les questions les plus problématiques ont été rapportés para rapport à la barrière de la langue et les différences culturelles entre leur pays d’accueil et leurs pays d’origine. En outre, beaucoup d’étudiants internationaux de musique de l’Est asiatique dans cette étude fait état de difficultés financières.

<title>Actitudes de los estudiantes de música extranjeros provenientes de Asia oriental hacia las instituciones de Educación Superior de Estados Unidos</title>
<p>Se encuestaron a estudiantes extranjeros de las nueve universidades estadounidenses con mayor número de alumnos internacionales que están acreditadas por la Asociación Nacional de Escuelas de Música (NASM) con el fin de identificar la actitud del alumnado de Asia Oriental hacia sus centros de estudio. Los resultados indicaron que la reputación del profesor universitario, las becas, y el prestigio del programa son los factores que se perciben como más influyentes a la hora de elegir un plan de estudios. Una buena relación con los profesores universitarios, retroalimentación positiva por parte de los mismos y la estabilidad emocional se percibían como los factores más influyentes en el éxito académico. Y la enseñanza del profesor universitario, su experiencia, y la mejora de las habilidades musicales fueron los factores que se percibieron más influyentes en los niveles de satisfacción del alumnado. Las cuestiones más problemáticas de las analizadas fueron la barrera lingüística y las diferencias culturales entre sus países de origen y el de acogida. Además, muchos de los estudiantes internacionales de música provenientes de Asia Oriental de este estudio apuntaron dificultades financieras. Se aportan recomendaciones y conclusiones para instituciones estadounidenses y para estudiantes internacionales provenientes de Asia oriental.</p>
