<abstract>
<p>This paper reports the findings of an unobtrusive research inquiry investigating the possible use and misuse of Alzheimer’s disease in public policy debate on the legalization of euthanasia. The component of the study being reported identified the problematic use of five key metaphors: the Alzheimer metaphor, which in turn was reinforced by three additional metaphors – the epidemic metaphor, the military metaphor, and the predatory thief metaphor; and the euthanasia metaphor. All metaphors were found to be morally loaded and used influentially to stigmatize Alzheimer's disease and mediate public opinion supporting the legalization of euthanasia as an end-of-life ‘solution’ for people with the disease. It is contended that, in the interests of promoting intellectual honesty and giving proper recognition to the extraordinary complexity of the issue, the problematic use and influence of metaphoric thinking in the public debate about Alzheimer's disease and euthanasia needs to be made transparent, questioned and challenged.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211429168" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the past decade there has been a subtle shift in public attitudes and beliefs favouring euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide in the context of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia care. This shift in attitude has seen a growing societal ‘Alzheimerization’ of the euthanasia debate, an outcome that stands to have significant public policy implications for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and their carers. In light of this trend, it is important to understand the processes that might be informing the shift in public attitude that is occurring so that an appropriate response by stakeholders can be made. To this end, it would be helpful to examine critically how Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are portrayed in public discourses and possibly used as a linguistic framing device to influence public opinion on the euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide question and the moral permissibility of legalizing euthanasia as a bona fide medical procedure and end-of-life regimen. It is a key aim of this article to provide such an examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211429168"><title>Background</title>
<p>With the notable exception of a short period of Anglo-American scholarship around the early 1990s, and the unique public debate that has been occurring in the cultural context of the Netherlands over the past two decades, contemporary debate on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has generally not been applicable to people living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211429168">Glick &amp; Hutchinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>). This has largely been due to three key factors: first, uncertainty regarding the capacity of persons in the later stages of the disease to authentically desire and competently choose euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide as an end-of-life care option; second, the limited capacity of medical and nursing staff to reliably ascertain the progression of the disease and the extent to which it is <italic>in fact</italic> causing ‘unbearable suffering’ in the persons concerned and which might otherwise be appealed to in order to justify the provision of a medically assisted death; and finally, concerns about the ‘authoritative control’ of euthanasia procedures – notably in terms of who should decide, what type of assistance to die should be given, who should give it, and upon what basis (criteria) formal decisions to euthanize a person with Alzheimer’s disease/dementia should be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211429168">MacDonald, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>These uncertainties and concerns have historically contributed to a relative lull in the debate about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the context of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia care. This lull has been further sustained over the past decade by the situational factor of health professional attitudes (particularly of medical practitioners) who, while increasingly inclined to support physician-assisted suicide in patients with cancer, have been more reticent in supporting physician-assisted suicide in the case of people living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. A key driver of this reticence has been unresolved concerns about ‘safeguarding patient autonomy in the decision-making process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211429168">MacDonald, 1998</xref>, p. 73). There are signs, however, that this reticence is beginning to wane.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a palpable shift in public attitudes and beliefs about the desirability and moral permissibility of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide as an end-of-life ‘solution’ for people living with Alzheimer’s disease – not just at the end stage of the disease, but also at its beginning stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>). A potent social marker of this shift in attitude and beliefs can be found in the first officially reported case in the Netherlands of the euthanasia of a patient in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and the subsequent societal ‘Alzheimerization’ of the euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide debate in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>). The case in question, first reported in 2004, involved a 65-year-old man who had been living with Alzheimer’s disease for 3<sup> </sup>years. His death through euthanasia was ultimately deemed lawful by the Netherlands’ oversight assessment committee on grounds that the patient was ‘suffering hopelessly and unbearably’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211429168">Sheldon, 2005</xref>, p. 1041). What is particularly significant about this case is that, in the lead up to it, there had been considerable controversy in the Netherlands about whether Alzheimer’s disease/dementia <italic>per se</italic> constituted ‘hopeless and unbearable suffering’ and whether the serious symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia can be meaningfully experienced as ‘hopeless and unbearable suffering’ by those living with these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211429168">Rurup, Onwuteaka-Philipsen, van der Heide, van der Wal, &amp; van der Maas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the time the project being reported here was being conducted, there had been only four reported cases of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide of people in the early stage of dementia in the Netherlands. Significantly, all four patients were relatively young (i.e. 63<sup> </sup>years, 64<sup> </sup>years, 65<sup> </sup>years, and 69<sup> </sup>years of age), with some presenting with atypical symptoms and one possibly not having dementia at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211429168">Hertogh, de Boer, Droes, &amp; Eefstinge, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Netherlands is not the only country in which the euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide and lay ‘mercy killings’ of people with Alzheimer’s disease/dementia has been reported. Other cases include the notorious 1990 case in the United States of Janet Adkins, the first highly publicized American case of physician-assisted suicide involving a person living with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211429168">Post, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211429168">Thomasma, 1992</xref>); the 1998 Australian case of Raymond Riordan, a 71-year-old man convicted in the Victorian Supreme Court of attempted murder after trying to kill his 71-year-old wife who had advanced Alzheimer’s disease (Johnstone 2009); and the 2007 Australian case of Caren Jenning and Shirley Justins, both of whom were charged with, and subsequently convicted of, the murder of Jenning’s partner, Graeme Wylie (a 75-year-old former Qantas pilot who had Alzheimer’s disease), ostensibly on the grounds of a suicide pact that had been agreed between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211429168">Kennedy &amp; Braithwaite, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211429168">Coopes &amp; Bennet, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, the societal ‘Alzheimerization’ of the euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide debate took a new turn when an eminent Oxford philosopher, Baroness Mary Warnock, sparked public outrage when she advocated that elderly people suffering from dementia should consider ending their lives because of being a burden on their families, the National Health Service (NHS) and society. Regarded as one of Britain’s ‘most garlanded intellectuals and a platinum-level member of the great and good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211429168">Beckford, 2008</xref>), Baroness Warnock is reported to have stated,<disp-quote>
<p>If you’re demented [sic], you’re wasting people’ lives – your family’s lives – and you’re wasting resources of the National Health Service […]. I’m absolutely, fully in agreement with the argument that if pain is insufferable, then someone should be given help to die, but I feel there’s a wider argument that if somebody absolutely, desperately wants to die because they’re a burden to their family, or the state, then I think they too should be allowed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211429168">Beckford, 2008</xref>).</p></disp-quote>Baroness Warnock’s views were not unprecedented. Three years earlier, the Dutch Minister of Health had taken a similar stance, reportedly suggesting during parliamentary debates on euthanasia that ‘it would be wise for people in the early stages of dementia to draft an advance directive requesting euthanasia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211429168">ten Have, 2005</xref>, p. 164). She is also reported to have advocated the ‘distribution of suicide pills among the elderly’ (ten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211429168">Have, 2005</xref>, p. 164). Elsewhere the Dutch health minister is reported as ‘regularly intervening in the dementia debate’ and as stating as a private person that ‘she would welcome euthanasia in the event of a progressive loss of memory coupled with the inability to recognize her children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211429168">Hertogh et al., 2007</xref>, p.49).</p>
<p>In recognition of the extraordinary complexity of the issues at stake, this study was designed not to posit claims about the rightness or wrongness of euthanasia in the context of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia care. Rather it was designed to help bring transparency to the debate and to pave the way for a greater level of intellectual honesty and sophisticated thinking about the complexities of the issues at stake, which have otherwise been lost in the euthanasia debate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211429168" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The project was progressed as an unobtrusive qualitative research inquiry, using existing documentary sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211429168">Kellehear, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211429168">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211429168">McCulloch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211429168">Scott, 1990</xref>). Two complementary unobtrusive approaches were used: (i) discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211429168">Tonkiss, 1998</xref>), and (ii) philosophic inquiry (encompassing bioethics inquiry strategies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211429168">Jecker, Jonsen, &amp; Pearlman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211429168">Seech, 2004</xref>). Following the conduct of a preliminary literature review, the study was progressed systematically using the following steps: sample selection and data collection, data analysis, and presentation and discussion of the research findings. As this was a scholarly inquiry that did not involve human participants, ethics approval was not required.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211429168"><title>Sample selection and data collection</title>
<p>Data were sampled and collected from five main databases: discipline, professional and academic literature databases; media databases (for news publications, television, radio, documentary and film); public opinion polling databases; legal databases; and the homepages of select partisan groups, notably, Alzheimer’s disease/dementia associations, palliative care advocacy organizations, right-to-die (pro-euthanasia) and right-to-life (anti-euthanasia) activist groups. A keyword search of these databases was made used using the following terms: ‘Alzheimer’s disease’, ‘Euthanasia’, ‘Dementia’, ‘(Physician) Assisted Suicide’, ‘Mercy Killing’, ‘Murder’, ‘Voluntary Euthanasia’, ‘Public interest’, ‘Public Policy’. In addition, complementary and ad hoc searches were made of university library holdings, the popular search engines <italic>Google</italic> and<italic> Google Scholar,</italic> and the reference lists and bibliographies contained in journal articles and texts selected and located during the course of the project. Throughout the course of the project, several serendipitous discoveries also occurred, resulting in the collection of still further data that had not been accessed via conventional search strategies. The units of analysis selected for this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211429168">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Data were sorted, coded and analysed in two stages. In the first stage, a content and thematic analysis was undertaken with the following four ‘moral policy’ drivers described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211429168">Glick (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211429168">Glick and Hutchinson (1999)</xref> being used as an interpretive frame:

Attention was also given to ‘who’ was speaking and from what position of authority they were speaking from (e.g. whether they were lay or professional people; had a high or low public profile).

<p>In the second stage, the following processes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211429168">Nathanson (1999)</xref> as being characteristic of catalytic social movements were used as an interpretive frame: ‘framing of risk’, ‘problem construction’ and ‘demand for action’.

<sec id="sec6-1471301211429168"><title>Findings</title>
<p>The component of the study being reported here found that <italic>Alzheimer’s disease</italic> (and to a lesser extent dementia generally) has primarily been conceptualized and represented in a metaphorical rather than a literal way in public and professional debate on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Four Alzheimer’s disease-related metaphors were identified and described: the <italic>Alzheimer metaphor</italic>, which in turn was reinforced by three additional metaphors, namely, the <italic>epidemic metaphor</italic>, the <italic>military metaphor</italic>, and the <italic>predatory thief</italic> metaphor. A fifth metaphor, the <italic>euthanasia metaphor</italic>, was also indentified and described. All metaphors were found to be morally loaded and used influentially to stigmatize Alzheimer’s disease and mediate public opinion favouring the legalization of euthanasia as an end-of-life ‘solution’ for people diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211429168"><title>The Alzheimer metaphor</title>
<p>The very notion of Alzheimer’s disease was found to have been conceptualized and used as a clichéd, yet potent and unsettling metaphor for ‘losing one’s mind’ and ultimately ‘personal control’, which is intricately associated with culturally constructed notions of personhood and eligibility for moral membership of the human social environment. Other metaphoric associations discerned included: ‘losing one’s selfhood’, ‘losing one’s identity’, ‘losing one’s capacity to make meaningful self-determining choices’, ‘losing one’s dignity’, and ‘losing the capacity to face one’s helpless mortality heroically’. For the purposes of this report, the metaphorical representation of Alzheimer’s disease was termed and will be referred to hereon in as the Alzheimer metaphor.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data strongly indicated that Alzheimer’s disease, like other mysterious diseases (for example, tuberculosis, leprosy, cancer, and AIDS), is perceived as intractable and capricious and is generally not well understood by the public. Moreover, although not as mysterious as tuberculosis and cancer were originally perceived to be and although not contagious, Alzheimer’s disease is nonetheless just as feared and just as strongly <italic>felt</italic> to be contagious, literally and morally. The fear of contagion aroused by Alzheimer’s disease is evoked and reinforced by the pervasive and mutually reinforcing use of three key metaphors, which, for the purposes of this study, are described respectively as the <italic>epidemic metaphor</italic>, the <italic>military metaphor</italic>, and the <italic>predatory thief metaphor</italic>. These metaphors were found to be reflected in everyday language, with their ‘signature’ terms appearing in the titles of documentaries, articles, key reports on dementia, and even Alzheimer Association publications. A brief description of these three related metaphors is provided under separate subheadings below.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211429168"><title>Epidemic metaphor</title>
<p>Use of the epidemic metaphor in Alzheimer’s discourse characteristically included the following signature terms: ‘epidemic’, ‘plague’, ‘immune/immunity’, ‘afflicted’, ‘you can catch it’, ‘affect anyone’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211429168">Table 2</xref>).

<p>The term <italic>epidemic</italic> originally meant ‘the rapid and episodic onset of infectious diseases such as those historically associated with fear and sudden widespread death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211429168">Saguy &amp; Riley 2005</xref>, p.892). Because of being experienced as a ‘collective calamity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>, p. 58), <italic>epidemics</italic> and the term <italic>epidemic</italic> have come to be strongly associated with, if not to stand as, a synonym of death. Thus, even when used metaphorically to represent conditions that are not literally contagious (such as obesity), the conditions to which they refer are nonetheless treated ‘as if’ they are infectious diseases, which in turn evokes in people their deepest anxieties and largely repressed fears of death.</p>
<p>The use of the epidemic metaphor in Alzheimer’s discourse has had such an effect. Although not literally contagious, Alzheimer’s is treated ‘as if’ it is a contagious disease which, because of its perceived causal link to the unbearable and ‘sinful’ destruction of the human moral agent, has come to be represented as ‘the greatest evil to be avoided’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211429168">Smith, 1992</xref>, p. 51). The ‘evilness’ of the disease, in this instance, is attributed to its ‘devastating’, ‘fearsome’ and ‘terrifying’ assault on the soul, spirit and humanity not only of its ‘victims’, but also to bystanders – who even by just seeing it worry ‘this could happen to me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211429168">Meyer 1982b</xref>). In short, the disease is considered evil because of its perceived capacity to <italic>utterly destroy</italic> all that is deemed culturally to makes us human – our intellect, our personality, our capacity to respond to life in meaningful and acceptable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211429168">Smith, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fear of death and related concerns aroused by the epidemic metaphorization of the <italic>disease</italic> has been transferred onto the <italic>people</italic> living with the disease. This is perhaps most evident by the stigma and discrimination that individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease may experience, and which may be manifest by their being shunned and even abandoned by family and friends as the disease progresses. As reported by a dentist whose wife had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease: ‘Nobody comes to visit us anymore, nobody calls, everybody ducks us. People are afraid’ (Brozan – quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211429168">Smith, 1992</xref>, p. 49).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1471301211429168"><title>Military metaphor</title>
<p>The military metaphor has been used widely in medicine since the late 1800s, after bacteria were identified as being ‘agents of disease’, which ‘invaded’ or ‘infiltrated’ the patient’s body, resulting in the patient having to ‘fight an infection’ – a fight they either ‘won or lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>). This study has found that a variation of the military metaphor encompassing two predominant frames (which are described respectively as the<italic> enemy frame</italic> and the<italic> alien invader frame</italic>) was found to be widely used in discourse on Alzheimer’s disease.

<p>Criminal metaphors have been used rhetorically in legal writings and contexts to enhance communicative power, and have sometimes been used to ‘lend legitimacy and even urgency’ to other metaphors, such as military metaphors and metaphors of battle, or ‘the armed and righteous aggressive action’ that needs to be taken against offenders (for example, poachers, predators, pirates, and parasites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211429168">Loughlan, 2006</xref>, p. 219). The criminal metaphors ‘pirates’ and ‘parasites’, for example, have had a particular application in legal discourse on the unauthorized use of intellectual property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211429168">Loughlan, 2006</xref>). In the case of intellectual property disputes, criminal metaphors have functioned by drawing upon some highly negative images of lawlessness, and violent, predatory behaviour (pirates, predators), exercised against helpless victims, or of a creature eating away at and undermining the health and well-being of innocent victims (parasites), or a thief who by stealth removes what is not his or hers from an innocent owner (poachers), or a person riding for free while others must pay (free-riders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211429168">Loughlan, 2006</xref>, p. 219).</p>
<p>This study has found that a variation of the criminal metaphor ‘predatory thief’ has been widely used in discourse on Alzheimer’s disease, not only to capture the negative image of the disease, but also to add legitimacy to the military metaphor and to its associated frames, such as the epidemic metaphor, and the enemy and alien invader frames outlined above.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1471301211429168"><title>Euthanasia metaphor</title>
<p>Use of the euthanasia metaphor in Alzheimer’s discourse characteristically includes the following signature terms (commonly presented as a slogan): ‘My life, my death, my choice’. This study has found that <italic>euthanasia</italic> (and to a lesser extent <italic>physician-assisted suicide</italic>) has been primarily constructed, represented and used metaphorically in social discourse pertaining to end-of-life decision making and care. The metaphorical use of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has functioned, paradoxically, to <italic>reassure</italic> people, primarily by symbolizing ownership and personal control of one’s body (often portrayed as a private possession) and, via these things, the capacity to make self-determining choices, to protect one’s dignity, and the opportunity to face one’s mortality, uncertainty, and helplessness heroically. For the purposes of this study, the metaphorical use of the term euthanasia has been termed and will be referred to hereon in as the <italic>euthanasia metaphor</italic>.</p>
<p>Like the Alzheimer’s metaphor, the euthanasia metaphor has worked influentially to structure what people think, perceive, experience, and how they behave and relate to other people in regard to this issue. In particular, euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide has come to powerfully symbolize a consumer utopian wish for ‘ownership’, ‘control’, ‘esteem’ and ‘the right to choose the way out’. In the case Alzheimer’s disease, an individual’s capacity to make self-determining choices, to protect his or her dignity, and to face his or her mortality, uncertainty, insignificance and helplessness heroically, are commonly portrayed as being ‘savaged’ or ‘robbed’ by the disease. Thus, whereas Alzheimer’s disease/dementia has emerged as a synonym for <italic>losing</italic> ownership and control, euthanasia has emerged as its antonym, that is, it has come to symbolize the (<italic>re</italic>)<italic>gaining</italic> of ownership and control. That euthanasia does not, in reality, achieve any of these things (at best, the idea of euthanasia serves only to cultivate an illusion of control and choice) is largely overlooked in public and academic debate on the matter.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1471301211429168" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the context of this study, the metaphoric representation of Alzheimer’s disease was found to be particularly significant and as encompassing much more than the mere use of everyday language to describe and make sense of the perceived reality of ‘just’ living with a chronic disease. In keeping with what is known about the power of metaphors generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211429168">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>), this study found that the Alzheimer metaphor also worked influentially to structure what people thought, perceived, experienced, and how they behaved and related to other people living with, or talking about, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.</p>
<p>The potency of the metaphors and frames described in the context of this study rests on the fact that, although not caused by bacteria, Alzheimer’s disease is nonetheless spoken of ‘as if’ it is a bacterial agent. This has enabled Alzheimer’s disease to be variously represented as an ‘evil, invincible, predatory enemy or alien’ that ‘invades’, ‘strikes’, ‘attacks’, ‘destroys’, ‘hits’, ‘robs’, ‘deprives’ or ‘consumes’ individuals as well as those close to them. It has also given rise to the misleading perception that, ‘unlike other diseases, Alzheimer’s <italic>always wins’</italic>. This perception is misleading since there are many diseases that cannot be cured and, with the passage of time, will result in the unpreventable and premature death of an individual – including the very young. Such diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, could likewise be characterized metaphorically as ‘always winning’.</p>
<p>Despite the potency and invincibility of other diseases, it is its perceived capacity to ‘always win’ that has given Alzheimer’s disease its particular potency, literalness and authority as ‘<italic>the</italic> enemy’ against which society – and social movement entrepreneurs, such as euthanasia advocates – must ‘wage war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>, p. 65). Is it thus little wonder that people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (and other dementias) may feel demoralized. As Sontag explains, so ‘long as a particular disease is treated as an evil, invincible predator, not just a disease’ most people will certainly be demoralized upon learning that they have such a disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>At one level the Alzheimer metaphor might seem mundane, encompassing little more than the use of everyday language to describe and help give meaning to a perceived everyday ‘reality’ of those diagnosed and living with the disease. This is an incomplete account of what the metaphor is achieving, however, and, in particular, what it stands to achieve in the context of public and professional debate on the legalization of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide. It is perhaps no coincidence that the metaphoric representations presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211429168">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1471301211429168">5</xref> of this report share a significant feature: all comments have serviced the public portrayal and rhetoric of Alzheimer’s disease being not just a <italic>fearsome</italic> disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211429168">PBS, 2003</xref>), but ‘the worst of all diseases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211429168">National Film Board of Canada, 1988</xref>) and the ‘saddest of the tragedies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211429168">Dworkin, 1993</xref>, p. 218). There is scope to suggest that such a description likewise stands to strongly influence public perception and opinion on the euthanasia question and the moral permissibility of medically assisted death for people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Metaphors enable people to make meaning and to ‘see things in a fresh way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211429168">Thompson, 1998</xref>, p. 47). Metaphors can, however, also mesmerize and mislead people into thinking and behaving in problematic, wrong or morally risky ways – moreover, <italic>without their even being aware of it</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211429168">Lakoff, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211429168">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211429168">Lehrer, 2009</xref>). In this study, metaphoric thinking about Alzheimer’s disease and related frames were found to be problematic on a number of accounts. First, they have seriously undermined informed understanding of the disease and the care options available to people living with the disease. In keeping with Susan Sontag’s interpretative frame, by thinking of Alzheimer’s disease as ‘the worst of all diseases’, a ‘mark of doom’, a ‘synonym of death’, we are prevented from recognizing it for what it really is – namely, just one dreadful disease among many others that, despite being debilitating and incurable, can nonetheless be<italic> managed</italic> with compassion and care<italic>.</italic> One example of the collective failure of society to recognize Alzheimer’s disease as a manageable disease can be found in the conventional exclusion of people with dementia from palliative care resources. It is only relatively recently that the idea of ‘palliative dementia care’ has been taken seriously and operationalized in a systematic way as a care option for people living with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211429168">Purtilo &amp; ten Have, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211429168">Small, Froggatt &amp; Downs, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the metaphoric representation of Alzheimer’s disease has reinforced the stigmatization, shame-attachment, silence and secrecy that is all too often associated with the disease. As Sontag reminds us, in societies that have yet to come to terms with death, death stands as an ‘offensively meaningless event, so that disease widely considered a synonym for death is experienced as something to hide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>, p. 8). Thirdly, the metaphoric portrayal of Alzheimer’s disease in the public mind has given rise to a ‘politics of paranoia<bold>’</bold> (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211429168">Sontag, 1978</xref>, p. 68) and a ‘health politics of anguish’ (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211429168">Herskovits, 1995</xref>, p. 150). Because of being terrorized by the mere<italic> thought</italic> of ‘getting’ Alzheimer’s disease – of being ‘invaded by an alien’, of being overwhelmed by ‘tidal waves of dementia rolling through the generations’ – people become disposed to seek out those, anyone even, who they believe will offer a reprieve, a redemption, a remedy, a ‘final solution’ that will rescue them utterly and completely from their terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211429168">Becker, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing together all of the above considerations, one of the most significant aspects of the Alzheimer metaphor is the morally loaded language it encompasses and the ‘temptation of beneficent euthanasia’ (that is, killing people for their own good) that it places subliminally before the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211429168">Moody, 1992</xref>, p. 46). When people are spoken of as being ‘invaded by an alien’, a ‘terminally ill nonperson’, in a ‘persistent vegetative state’, ‘a withered shell without higher brain function’, ‘no longer there’, ‘already dead’, in a state of ‘living death’, a ‘funeral without end’, and the like, they are <italic>de-humanized</italic> (from the Latin <italic>de</italic>, denoting <italic>removal or reversal</italic>), literally ‘removed of human character’; that is, rendered ‘not human’ on account of being deprived of the positive human qualities culturally deemed to make them human. Once de-humanized it is but a short step to regarding such persons as being of only limited moral worth – literally <italic>de-moralized</italic> (deprived of their moral spirit and status, and left ‘morally corrupted’) – and hence as entities whom, in the last stages of the disease, maybe regarded by others as ‘terminally ill “non-persons” to whom only limited obligations are owed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211429168">Buchanan, 1988</xref>, pp. 285 &amp; 286; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211429168">Dworkin, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211429168">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211429168">Engelhardt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211429168">Kuhse, 1999</xref>). And once characterized as being of only ‘limited moral worth’ to whom only limited moral obligations are owed, it is but a short step to deeming such entities as ‘life unworthy of life’ and ‘better off dead’. Thus the path is set to justify their ‘least worst death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211429168">Battin, 1994</xref>) via euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide ostensibly to release them from the ‘worst of all diseases’.</p>
<p>The societal Alzheimerization of the euthanasia debate has also enabled more popular consideration to be given to the idea of giving people the option of requesting in advance medical assistance to die (called pre-emptive euthanasia), which may be made via an <italic>advance euthanasia directive</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>). Unlike conventional advance directives, advance euthanasia directives enable a person’s wishes to be enacted before they lose their competency to decide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>). In the Netherlands, for example, where people have the option of making advance euthanasia directives, pre-emptive euthanasia is permitted on grounds of a person’s ‘unbearable and hopeless suffering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211429168">Rurup, et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211429168">van Delden, 2004</xref>). In some cases, the mere <italic>anticipation</italic> of suffering by a person together with his or her desire for death as a ‘pre-emptive strike against the terrors of dying’ has been accepted as a circumstance under which euthanasia maybe performed by a qualified medical practitioner (ten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211429168">Have, 2005</xref>, p.163). Typical cases put forward in debate about the feasibility of advance euthanasia directives have involved patients with dementia ‘especially when they have become so demented that admittance to a nursing home is required’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211429168">van Delden, 2004</xref>, p.447; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211429168">Hertogh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A key outcome of this study has been the generation of the hypothesis that the euthanasia metaphor is paradoxically a symbolic defence aimed at protecting individuals against what has been described elsewhere as ‘existential anxiety associated with awareness of the inevitability of death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211429168">Goldenberg, McCoy, Pyszczynski, &amp; Greenberg, 2000a</xref>, p. 118). In other words, the idea of euthanasia and all that it has come to symbolize (control, choice, dignity, a way out) is primarily an anxiety engendered response to people’s deeply repressed fears, aroused by the terrifying knowledge of the inevitability of their own mortality and related concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211429168">Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211429168">Goldenberg, et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211429168">Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 2000b</xref>). The idea of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide thus serves an important ‘terror management’ function, in that its positioning as a cultural worldview serves to help people cope when they are reminded of their own inevitable mortality, insignificance, helplessness and uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211429168">Pyszczynski, et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211429168">Goldenberg, et al., 2000a</xref>, 2000b). The promulgation of the euthanasia metaphor – and indeed the very terms <italic>euthanasia</italic> and <italic>physician-assisted suicide</italic> themselves – achieves this in two key ways: first, by reminding individuals of their mortality (‘mortality salience’) and ipso facto increasing their felt need for protection against their concerns; and second, by offering individuals reassurance and protection (terror management) against their death-related anxiety – notably, by bolstering the illusion of control over their mortality and the terrifying helplessness and uncertainty associated with it.</p>
<p>In the context of this inquiry, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide as a symbolic defence against the fear of death was found to hold particular resonance in discourse on Alzheimer’s disease. This is because Alzheimer’s disease, which as shown has been portrayed in deeply negative and alarmist terms, is a potent reminder of the inevitability of human mortality (mortality salience) and as such has the capacity to trigger in people their deepest anxieties and terror about their own inevitable death. In contrast, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is framed and expressed in a way that, paradoxically, offers individuals reassurance and protection (terror management) against their death-related anxieties including the threat that death poses to their significance as meaning-making socially valuable beings.</p>
<p>The euthanasia metaphor’s symbolization of ‘ownership’ (and its promise to protect and preserve this) is of particular significance to discourse on Alzheimer’s disease which, as this study suggests, largely portrays people with the disease as having their minds, bodies, and souls ‘taken over’ or ‘robbed’ by the disease. This perhaps explains why the Alzheimer metaphor has come to service and support more the rhetorical framing devices used by social movement entrepreneurs championing the right to die, than those championing the right to life, and is more amenable to being evoked by the metaphors and frames used by right-to-die activists, than those used by right-to-life activists. It perhaps also helps to explain how and why euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide has successfully been reframed as not only being <italic>applicable</italic> to people living with Alzheimer’s disease/dementia, but that Alzheimer’s disease/dementia <italic>itself</italic> has come to be framed as being applicable to – and even as being an important cornerstone of – the euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide debate and its translation into permissive policy and practice.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1471301211429168" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Metaphors are often used in everyday discourse because they enable people to make meaning and to see things in a new and considered way. The use of the epidemic metaphor in the public policy debate on the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia, for example, has been enormously successful in getting Alzheimer’s disease/dementia recognized as a major public health issue and recently positioned as a global health priority. In the process, however, the epidemic metaphor has also had the unintended consequence of further stigmatizing the disease by subliminally cultivating a public terror of contagion, which in turn has contributed in judgement clouding ways to public paranoia and anguish about getting the disease. The associated military and predatory thief metaphors likewise risk negatively influencing the way people think and behave about the disease and its treatment options – including medically assisted death.</p>
<p>The component of the study being reported here has suggested there is a growing societal ‘Alzheimerization’ of the euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide debate, and that this could have significant public policy implications for people diagnosed with the disease and their carers, both lay and professional. It has also been suggested that there is a need to examine critically how Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are portrayed in the public media and used as linguistic framing devices to influence public opinion on the permissibility of euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide as a bona fide medical regimen. These findings yield three important lessons: first, constituents need to be very careful when using metaphors and be mindful of the possible unintended consequences that their use might inadvertently cause, especially when used in the public domain. Second, all constituents in the Alzheimer’s disease–euthanasia debate have a moral obligation to ensure the transparency of the processes (frames, myths, metaphors, images, texts) that stand to have a significant impact on people’s language, thought and behaviour in regard to the subject. The personal biases, fears, prejudices, and errors in reasoning that people will inevitably bring to decision-making processes – especially those imported via the use of metaphors to represent Alzheimer’s disease/dementia and euthanasia – also need to be made transparent.</p>
<p>Finally, a new language and new metaphors need to be found that will enable the constructive representation of the complex issues associated with the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia and the need for appropriate resources to be provided to ensure and enable that those diagnosed with the disease are properly cared for from diagnosis to death.</p>
