<abstract>
<p>This article uses the functional theory of campaign discourse to determine whether differences exist in the purpose and content of 75 web-only video ads and 742 television ads created by candidates and national parties during the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns. Web-only ads were more likely to include attack themes than TV ads, and TV ads were more likely to include acclaim themes than web-only ads. Ads differed little in their use of news-mediated evidence to bolster ad claims.</p>

<p>The 2008 U.S. presidential election cycle saw extensive use of “web-only” campaign commercials, which debuted in 2004 and brought the look and feel of the decades-old genre of television advertisements to the Internet. Widening availability of broadband Internet access in 2004 gave presidential campaigns their first opportunity to create videos that could be seen online by millions of potential voters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012468741">1</xref></sup> Use of video on campaign websites expanded in 2008 when, for the first time ever, more than half of American households had broadband access.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012468741">2</xref></sup> Online spots also grew as the number of candidates grew; the 2008 election cycle drew nearly two-dozen GOP and Democratic primary candidates in the first race since 1952 without an incumbent president or vice president.</p>
<p>Campaign websites give candidates, political parties, and interest groups a place where they can make more extended arguments, and provide more evidence, that could lead to voter persuasion. Such sites also give audiences the opportunity to “timeshift” and view, at any time, video content originally broadcast on television stations or networks. Campaigns can use the web as a place to provide content—such as speeches, statements, news reports, and video blogs—not designed for television broadcast and therefore not subject to Federal Communication Commission rules requiring that the content have at least four seconds of the candidate’s image and/or a mention that the ad was approved by the candidate or a sponsor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012468741">3</xref></sup> Among these video types are video ads that resemble traditional TV spots but were not intended to be broadcast as paid TV spots.</p>
<p>Given the growing body of literature suggesting that political communication on the Internet differs from other types of political communication, it follows that web-only video commercials differ from traditional political television spots. This article uses a variation on the method of Benoit’s functional theory of campaign discourse,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012468741">4</xref></sup> which states that campaign messages are designed to acclaim, attack, or defend policy and/or character, to analyze the content of 817 presidential campaign spots from 2004 and 2008. The goal is to determine whether quantitative differences exist between web-only spots and traditional television spots in their discursive purpose and in their use of third-party information.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-1077699012468741">
<title>Political campaigns, the Internet, and web-only spots</title>
<p>Since the Internet became available to the masses during the 1990s, political candidates have integrated it into campaigns to raise money, to find and rally supporters, and to communicate to their publics at a lower cost than other media channels and without the real or imagined interference of mainstream political news coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012468741">5</xref></sup> The Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project noted that 55% of all Americans went online for information about the 2008 campaign, and 45% saw an online video related to the campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012468741">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some online campaign videos use traditional techniques common to contemporary political spots designed for television, but with two key differences. One is that these web-only spots do not have to meet the stringent time requirements of TV spots, so they can run as long or as short as the creators think is necessary to make their points before viewers lose interest. Also, web-only ads need to be different from TV ads to attract viewers. Owen called television a “push” medium, in which viewers are passive and “exposure to ads may be inadvertent as they are interspersed among other programming and designed to reach multiple users at once.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012468741">7</xref></sup> Online, however, is a “pull” medium that requires users to be proactive and make many more choices, such as deciding whether to go to a website and, once there, whether to find, click, and view a spot. Therefore, web-only ads need to be more entertaining than conventional ads to attract attention.</p>
<p>The second, and more important, key difference is that web-only spots often have a style and purposes that differ from TV-focused spots, often using techniques that the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> said “harness the spirit of the Internet and the power of viral video.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012468741">8</xref></sup> The <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> noted that web-only spots often use humor and are helpful in “supplementing the campaigns’ tamer, televised commercials.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012468741">9</xref></sup> Sponsors of web-only spots can use them for the purposes of attracting coverage from mainstream news media, creating a viral effect, targeting specific audiences more effectively than traditional broadcast TV spots, and providing arguments with richer evidence than generally can be provided given the channel characteristics and strict time limits of traditional TV commercials.</p>
<p>Candidates have long sought ways to create “intermedia agenda setting” that works in their favor,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012468741">10</xref></sup> and televised political spots have long been a way to set the news media’s agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012468741">11</xref></sup> Web-only ads are another tool in the campaign arsenal to attract coverage from mainstream news media—and to do it cheaper and faster. The Living Room Candidate website noted that many 2008 ads were “created in rapid-response cycle, timed for the increasingly fast-paced news cycle.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012468741">12</xref></sup> Web-only ads can be produced quickly and cheaply and placed online, without having to schedule or pay for expensive television spots, in hopes that they will become subject to (free) news coverage, giving the ads their intended agenda-setting effect in the “earned media.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012468741">13</xref></sup> An example is the web-only “I am Joe” spot from GOP candidate John McCain, released October 23, 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012468741">14</xref></sup> The ninety-second spot, which included homemade videos produced by McCain supporters, was mentioned or linked to more than 1,300 times, according to a Google search, including links to bloggers worldwide, and news stories from mainstream media, including United Press International, Bloomberg News, CNN, and CBS.</p>
<p>Another use of web-only spots is to generate a viral effect, with the goal of producing spots that a campaign’s supporters recommend to others. These ads offer fodder that can be used in “word-of-mouth” efforts that research suggests may be more influential than traditional advertising in creating support for a candidate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012468741">15</xref></sup> The <italic>Boston Globe</italic> said web-only spots and other online videos “employ a level of risk-taking that’s relatively rare in today’s strait-laced media campaigns. Compared with standard TV spots, web ads are often funnier, more cutting, or more offbeat,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012468741">16</xref></sup> which might lead to their being linked to via social media or referenced in other ways by a campaign’s supporters or detractors. Ads by candidates during the 2008 presidential election reflected “the shift in popular culture toward the provocative tone of the Internet.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012468741">17</xref></sup> However, the <italic>New York Times</italic> noted on the day before the 2008 election that web ads received fewer views than other video on the sites of both candidates Barack Obama and McCain,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012468741">18</xref></sup> suggesting that campaigns are still learning how to best exploit the new medium.</p>
<p>Another important use of web-only spots is to target core demographic or psychographic groups. While traditional television ads generally aim at a wide range of voters, web ads can focus narrowly on subgroups that would be more likely to visit the campaign’s Internet site or be enticed, often via a viral effort, to otherwise view the spot and take some sort of action.</p>
<p>In some instances, the target groups are already committed to a candidate. Candidates’ web ads often seek to generate a two-step flow of information, in which opinion leaders receive information online and communicate it to fellow citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012468741">19</xref></sup> Such messages could be used to rally supporters or to send messages that would be misunderstood by or antagonize others. As Ridout, Fowler, and Branstetter noted, “While they [online ads] may serve to raise levels of enthusiasm among existing supporters of a candidate, it is less certain that they are able to speak to supporters of the other candidate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012468741">20</xref></sup> A Democratic example of a narrowly targeted message delivered online is Obama’s “Don’t Let Up” ad from October 28, 2008, which showed a bicyclist leading a race by seven seconds but crashing a few yards from the finish line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012468741">21</xref></sup> The crashed biker loses to a cyclist whose head was replaced by an oversized, digitally superimposed head of rival McCain. The ad reminded Obama supporters to stay focused despite favorable polls in the week before Election Day. If shown on broadcast television, the ad may have confused viewers who do not follow political news, or antagonized Republican or independent voters who were not the intended target but could have taken an oppositional decoding of the message and be offended by the notion that Obama expected to pedal to an easy victory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012468741">22</xref></sup> A Republican example is “The One,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077699012468741">23</xref></sup> an August 1, 2008, spot in which the McCain campaign included Charlton Heston’s movie portrayal of Moses parting the Red Sea in “[o]penly mocking” Obama “as having a Messiah complex.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077699012468741">24</xref></sup> Erler said the ad included visual and audio hints that Obama was “eerily similar to the egomaniacal antichrist figure of Nicolai Carpathia” that Christians familiar with the apocalyptic <italic>Left Behind</italic> series of novels would recognize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077699012468741">25</xref></sup> <italic>Time</italic> said this reading of the eighty-five-second ad “taps into a conversation that has been gaining urgency on Christian radio and political blogs and in widely circulated e-mail messages.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077699012468741">26</xref></sup> During the same week “The One” debuted, McCain’s campaign released a more culturally understandable TV spot comparing Obama to pop icons Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, further questioning whether Obama was merely a celebrity or actually a politician who would be able to lead. “The One” posed the same question, but in a way that McCain’s campaign felt was not palatable or understandable to a national audience. Also, “The One” was an example of intermedia agenda setting, as it led to hundreds of news stories about the ad and its implications. When journalists asked about the ad, McCain did not discuss its intended meaning, but instead said the campaign was “having some fun with our supporters. We’re going to display a sense of humor in this campaign.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077699012468741">27</xref></sup> For only the cost of the ad production and bandwidth, the McCain campaign rallied supporters with a web-only ad, raised question about Obama’s fitness to lead, and deflected criticisms about negative campaigning by suggesting critics were humorless.</p>
<p>Research also suggests that the tone of information provided on campaign websites may differ from the tone in other types of communication with voters. In an early look at web-based campaigning, Klotz noted that campaign-maintained political sites were mostly positive in 1996 senate races, but candidates who went negative online were profoundly negative. As he noted, “Despite these incentives for negative campaigning, the 1996 election suggests that positive materials will retain a prominent, even if diminishing, place in Internet campaigning. If the negative campaigning that does occur can move closer to engagement, the resonance of the distinction between positive and negative campaigning will itself decline.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077699012468741">28</xref></sup> That was true in 2004, as Cornfield showed a 56% positive to 44% negative balance in 137 online ads placed by candidates and national parties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077699012468741">29</xref></sup> (Cornfield’s research included all presidential campaign ads placed online; unlike this study, it did not differentiate between TV ads and web-only ads.) The research suggested that as more people use the web as an information source, online advertising could closely mirror traditional advertising. Also, Bystrom et al.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077699012468741">30</xref></sup> showed that campaign sites in 2000 were more likely to take what Trammell et al. called a “conversational and personalized approach to communication” online than in television ads,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077699012468741">31</xref></sup> a trend that likely continued, given wider use of social media by politicians during the 2008 campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012468741">32</xref></sup> Also instructive to this discussion is research into perception of political communication on the Internet and through conventional television. Literature suggests that while voters are generally cynical of political advertising regardless of communication channel,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012468741">33</xref></sup> advertising still affects the attitudes of message recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012468741">34</xref></sup> To that end, the Internet has provided political communicators a new channel through which they can further tailor messages to advance their aims.</p>
<p>Another potential use of online spots could be to address a major criticism of conventional political advertising on broadcast television—the concern that short video spots cannot provide a nuanced argument or provide more complete evidence to support their claims. Postman, for example, argued that the very nature of television has “devastated political discourse” because of the focus on images and inability to sustain complicated arguments that would be better expressed in textual form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012468741">35</xref></sup> The ability to provide fuller arguments and supporting evidence seems important in building message credibility, especially online, given research that broadband users are more likely to have higher levels of educational attainment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012468741">36</xref></sup> and tend to retain more information from the Internet and newspapers than television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012468741">37</xref></sup> Fodder from news media or other independent, third-party sources is particularly valued in political ads, because viewers perceive third-party news sources to be higher in credibility than political ads.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012468741">38</xref></sup> Some political advertising includes headlines or video, or otherwise briefly mentions headlines or snippets of news articles, to provide third-party endorsement of the ad’s stated idea, and usually includes the name of the news organization and the date of the item’s publication. Research shows that messages with third-party evidence are likely to be perceived as more credible<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012468741">39</xref></sup> and of higher quality<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012468741">40</xref></sup> than advertising without third-party evidence. Geer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012468741">41</xref></sup> and Roberts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012468741">42</xref></sup> have shown that third-party evidence is more likely to be used in negative ads, because negative claims are more likely to be verifiable than positive assertions, and because campaigns may be perceived as less negative by attributing the attack to the third party, not directly to the campaign. Henson and Benoit used functional theory to show how the use of third-party evidence, mostly from newspapers, has risen in political TV spots over the years, and to show that two-thirds of the evidence was used to bolster attacks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012468741">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>One potential solution to improve the credibility of campaign discourse would be to harness the limitless space of the Internet, and its ability to show ancillary material by hyperlinking or in other ways, to make more supportable claims and provide more evidence for claims made in video spots. Simply put, the Internet has given campaigns the ability to make as complete an argument as they wish, and to provide immediate access to information that supports those arguments. A resourceful audience member often can find the original news item by using references provided in the ad, but campaigns could make it easier by hyperlinking to the original news-mediated evidence cited in the spot. This message transparency provided by the web might help candidates make more credible and complete arguments, assuming that audiences would judge whether the third-party evidence briefly cited in a spot is supported by, and in context with, that full third-party evidence.</p>

<title>Functional theory of campaign discourse</title>
<p>The functional theory of campaign discourse provides a useful framework to categorize and analyze political advertising. The theory assumes that elections are inherently comparative, so politicians use campaign messages to make themselves appear to be more preferable than opponents. Therefore, campaigns create political television spots with functions that (1) acclaim themselves with positive statements about their credentials as a better candidate, (2) attack an opponent’s credentials, or (3) defend with refutations against an opponent’s attack. Candidates use those three functions for themes of (1) policy or (2) character. Policy themes can discuss actions or ideas related to governmental action related to past deeds, plans, and general goals. Character themes can discuss the candidate’s perceived qualities related to personal qualities, leadership abilities, and values or principles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012468741">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>As examples of the functional theory, consider messages from a fictional race involving political newcomer Candidate X against incumbent Candidate Y. Candidate X may acclaim his past deeds (such as job creation while running a business) or future plans (such as proposals to cut taxes or cut government bureaucracy) or character traits (such as leadership or empathy for voters). Or Candidate X may attack Candidate Y, claiming that Candidate Y supports bad policies (such as supporting a tax increase) or has poor character (such as being a political insider). Or Candidate Y may defend, claiming that the policy for a tax increase is to improve crumbling schools, and that being a “political insider” really means knowing how government works and effectiveness in bringing home support for constituents. In each instance, each message has a specific functional approach with the ultimate aim of having voters compare candidates to choose their preference. The functional theory provides a widely used method to analyze the content of political communication, including commercials,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012468741">45</xref></sup> speeches,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012468741">46</xref></sup> press releases,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012468741">47</xref></sup> candidate debates,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012468741">48</xref></sup> blog postings,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077699012468741">49</xref></sup> and the use of third-party evidence in political TV spots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077699012468741">50</xref></sup></p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>As web-only commercials are among the newest arrows in the still relatively new quiver of Internet-driven campaigning, little academic research has investigated the use and content of such online-only spots. For this reason, it seemed more appropriate to use research questions than hypotheses. The accelerated use of web-only political ads during the 2008 campaign and their ability to provide fuller arguments than broadcast ads, when placed in the context of research into political rhetoric and evidence, leads to two research questions. The first is based on the functional theory of political discourse:</p>

<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> How are web-only spots different from traditional broadcast spots in efforts to acclaim, attack, or defend policies and/or character?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second research question is based on research into the use and purpose of evidence in political advertising, as applied to this new form of web-only spots:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This content analysis used a modified approach to Benoit’s functional theory of political discourse to identify and differentiate the themes and topics of traditional TV spots from web-only spots created during the 2004 and 2008 presidential election cycles. Benoit noted that among the advantages of the approach is its inclusion of the additional “defense” function, which has not been included in previous approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077699012468741">51</xref></sup> This research’s key variation from the Benoit technique was the decision to use each spot as the unit of analysis, not each theme inside a spot as is suggested by Benoit. It was believed that considering the sum of each spot, instead of individual statements inside each spot, was necessary to better compare differences between the communication channels in the study.</p>
<p>Researchers found 817 individual, English-language video spots (237 from the 2004 election cycle and 580 from 2008) produced by Republican and Democratic candidates, and the Republican and Democratic National Committees, at Stanford University’s Political Communication Lab and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://livingroomcandidate.org">livingroomcandidate.org</ext-link>, two online repositories of campaign spots chosen because they hold a large majority of the spots released during those election cycles and better delineation between web-only and TV spots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077699012468741">52</xref></sup> The Political Communication Lab site is as “comprehensive as possible,” especially for ads by major candidates and parties, a Stanford representative noted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077699012468741">53</xref></sup> The livingroomcandidate site limits itself to general election spots, but, unlike the Stanford site, it noted whether 2004 ads were web-only spots. The incomplete delineation of web-only versus broadcast TV spots may limit this study; chi-square statistics are reported when appropriate because of this issue and because it is unknown whether the analyzed spots represent a census of spots produced during the two election cycles.</p>
<p>Each ad was categorized by the political discourse functions of “acclaim,” “attack,” and/or “defend.” The topic of “policy” and/or “character” also was coded for each ad. Because this research allowed ads to have multiple functions and topics, its general findings may differ from other analyses. Researchers determined that coding multiple themes in a single ad allowed for richer analysis, including the ability to compare complete spots by communication channel, and the multiple coding was connected to additional research involving this data set. A second series of analyses was performed on the 570 spots identified as having a single function, to determine whether the communication channels had significant differences in spots created for a single purpose of acclaiming, attacking, or defending. (The lone web ad with a defense-only theme was dropped for purposes of the chi-square analysis.)</p>
<p>Coders also looked to see whether spots included third-party evidence from news media sources. This included mentions of stories published in newspapers, magazines, and from wire services, information on websites, other political ads, or news reports from television or radio. Coders looked for clearly identifiable information about each piece of third-party evidence, such as the name of the source and a publication/broadcast date that viewers could use to find the original piece of evidence.</p>
<p>The main researcher and a graduate student coded the spots using a codebook developed for the project. For training, coders watched several of the same spots to discuss coding techniques; both researchers coded fifteen of the same spots as a pretest, compared the results, and, after coding fifteen more individually, saw improvements in reliability. The graduate student then coded the remainder of the spots, and the chief researcher independently coded every seventh ad as a check for intercoder reliability. Using a macro in SPSS 15.0.1 to calculate Krippendorff’s alpha,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077699012468741">54</xref></sup> reliability was calculated at .7475 for “acclaim,” .7502 for “attack,” .7570 for “defend,” .8073 for “policy,” and .7034 for “character.” Presence or absence of third-party evidence was calculated at .9211. All are within acceptable ranges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077699012468741">55</xref></sup></p>

<p>The number of web-only ads produced by candidates and parties rose dramatically in the 2008 election. Researchers found 75 web-only ads: 8 (3%) of the 237 spots from the 2004 election cycle and 67 (11%) of the 580 spots from 2008. While the rise in web-only spots between the two cycles could be a function of the comprehensiveness (and labeling of web-only spots) of the repository websites, the 2008 campaigns clearly showed a more sophisticated use of the web and of online-only spots than in 2004.</p>
<sec id="section7-1077699012468741">
<title>RQ1</title>
<p>Web-only spots were significantly more likely to have attack themes, and television spots were significantly more likely to have acclaim themes. Findings from the analysis are presented by categories of web and attack themes, and by TV and acclaim themes, for all 817 spots and for the subset of 570 single-function spots.</p>

<title>Web-only spots and attacks</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077699012468741">Table 1</xref> shows, while slightly more than half of all spots included an attack, 72% of web-only spots included attack themes, well above the 54.2% rate of TV ads. This is a significant difference, as were differences (data not shown in the table) revealing that web-only spots were more likely than TV spots to attack both policy and character. While a slightly higher percentage of web-only spots than TV spots included a policy attack, 53% to 50.4%, the difference was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 694) = 8.064, <italic>p</italic> = .005. Also, web-only spots included more personal attacks. The analysis showed that 60% of web-only spots included a character attack, compared to 38.8% of TV spots.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Why be nicer on television (more acclaim ads) than in web-only ads (more attack ads)? The answer appears to be related to differences between the type of election for which an ad is aimed, and in differences between media types.</p>
<p>The timing of spots during the life of a campaign is one factor in the functional discourse differences. Of the spots in this analysis, 418 (51.2%) debuted during primaries, when candidates are more likely to produce acclaim-themed ads that introduce themselves. Some candidates never moved beyond acclaim functions because their campaigns folded before they could move past introductions and into attacks usually saved for later, after campaigns have defined themselves and the candidate field is narrowed and attacks might prove more fruitful. Indeed, 96.2% of primary ads included an acclaim, significantly more than the 49.1% of general campaign ads, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 817) = 230.322, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Most of these spots were designed for TV, where campaigns generally start their quest to find voters. Attack-type spots were more prominent in the general election, with 71.7% of general-election ads including an attack, compared to 40.7% of primary ads. This is also significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 817) = 79.595, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The influx of thirty-four party-created ads in general elections also influences this analysis, because party ads are more likely to be created for general elections and “do more of the dirty work.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077699012468741">56</xref></sup> Every party ad included an attack theme.</p>
<p>The distinctions between communication channels also contribute to differences in spots’ purposes of functional discourse. As noted in the literature review, the TV push versus the web pull nature of how viewers receive content plays a factor in functional discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077699012468741">57</xref></sup> An experiment by Hill,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077699012468741">58</xref></sup> conducted long before campaigns took to the Internet, noted that viewers found negative ads more “entertaining” than positive ads. The combination seems appealing to makers of web spots, who may feel freer in making their attacks, especially on the character of the opponent, because viewers have a choice whether to watch the ads and campaigns can worry less about the repercussions of a negative ad seen by general audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077699012468741">59</xref></sup> Tinkham and Weaver-Lariscy also noted that negative ads “help voters feel greater confidence in their decisions,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077699012468741">60</xref></sup> so placing attack ads on a candidate’s site serves the double duty of persuading people who haven’t made up their mind and reinforcing the beliefs of supporters. On TV, however, attacks are less common—and character-only attacks even less common—because of perceptions by general audiences about negative spots. The result is a preponderance of negative spots online, the need to be more entertaining to attract viewers online than through television, the reality that attacks are more entertaining than acclaims or defenses, and the likelihood that online viewers are already more likely to favor the candidate and therefore less likely to be offended by a candidate who goes negative.</p>
<p>The second research question focused on differences in ads’ use of evidence. The most plausible explanation for online ads being more likely than TV ads to have third-party evidence is found in <bold>RQ1</bold>’s finding that web-only spots were more likely to be attack ads. Geer noted that “negative commercials tend to use evidence more than positive ads,” because negative ads rely on third-party evidence needed to boost credibility and because positive (acclaim) ads “tend to contain more general references that are harder to take issue with.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077699012468741">61</xref></sup> This explanation does not fully explain why substantially more acclaim-only spots on TV have evidence than web spots. One additional factor is that many acclaim spots on the web are aimed at the campaign’s followers and therefore require less evidence. An additional factor is the fundamental difference between TV and web spots.</p>
<p>The lack of time restraints on web spots gives ad makers the opportunity to include more evidence, and the hyperlinking attributes of the web make it possible for ad producers to include links to the evidence used in attack ads. However, few political campaign sites took advantage of web technology to provide additional information. A look at the still-available web sites of 2004 and 2008 candidates (available through the Internet Archives’ “Wayback Machine,” at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.archive.org">www.archive.org</ext-link>) showed that no candidates included hyperlinks to evidence cited inside political ads, and none included links to external evidence on the same page as the ad. This omission has two implications. One is that ad makers are missing an opportunity to educate potential supporters and/or further confirm the beliefs of supporters. A second implication is that ad makers may want only brief citations of news-mediated sources for their Potemkin appearances, because the full evidence in news stories or editorials might include information that runs counter to the spot’s purpose. Future research should further investigate how third-party evidence is used in political advertising.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research, among the first qualitative investigations of web-only political spots, offers insight into the new uses of the web by political communicators as online video has become more ubiquitous. Like many content analyses, it is limited in its ability to explain the underlying motives of communicators of previously created mass media messages. The findings may not be replicated during the 2012 or later elections, especially if candidates change their own advertising goals following the Supreme Court’s five to four ruling in the <italic>Citizens United v. Federal Communications Commission</italic> case, which has led to massive amounts of campaign advertising by organizations unaffiliated with candidates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077699012468741">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>The key <bold>RQ1</bold> findings—particularly that web spots are statistically more likely to include attacks and more likely to be attack-only functions than TV spots—suggest that candidates are more likely to speak out of both sides of their communication channels. With TV spots, political speech appears more measured, with fewer attacks and those attacks diluted to include acclaim themes. With online spots, campaigns feel freer to attack, even as they balance the need to be edgy and entertaining online. They have found ways to both throw elbows and rally the troops, and to gain exposure from social media and from news organizations without having to pay for TV ads.</p>
<p>The <bold>RQ2</bold> finding suggests that many campaigns are not fully using the Internet’s capabilities to raise the level of political discourse. While emotional appeals are vital in political ads,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077699012468741">63</xref></sup> it also is clear that campaigns can better use evidence to support their claims, and to provide that evidence to the public in more transparent ways to boost the credibility of those claims.</p>
<p>Together, this research’s findings confirm a duality of campaign rhetoric based on communication channel. They suggest that to better understand a campaign’s complete message, potential voters and news organizations must continue to follow traditional TV spots aimed at a general audience, and also follow web spots aimed at a campaign’s proponents and the mud-slinging spots deemed too harsh or complex for TV.</p>
