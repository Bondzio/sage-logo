<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a long term disease in which the lung becomes damaged due to obstruction and breathing is impaired. The main function of the lung is to inhale air with oxygen and exhale air with carbon dioxide. As with every disease, COPD is caused by genetic and environmental factors. The most common and notorious environmental cause is smoking. Other causes include occupational hazards. The smoke lines the bronchi and narrows the width, hence obstructs the air inhalation and exhalation. COPD is uncommon under age 35 and worse over age 65. Scientists estimate that around one million people in Britain suffer from COPD and it causes about 5% of all deaths annually. The author has collected all such facts in this little book, 110 pages, and outlined clearly the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. It reminded me of the saying ‘good thing come in small packages’.</p>
<p>Typical symptoms of COPD include breathlessness (first on exertion then at rest), wheeze, chest tightness, cough with phlegm, reduced exercise capacity and frequent chest infections. Anxiety and depression are more common. The author also mentions non drug treatments which include health education, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, encouragement of exercise and dietary advice. Being a practising doctor in London, I support the author’s drug management equally which include: reliever inhalers called short acting bronchodilators; preventer inhalers called long acting bronchodilators and; other treatments prescribed by a medical practitioner, for each patient. In the UK, there are nurse practitioners who may specialise in respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Compliance with the prescribed treatment can prolong life but it is a big problem among some patients, particularly those who do not believe in going to see their doctors or nurses. I often advise my patients to: <italic>‘keep taking your medication and drawing your salary or pension; if you stop one, the other will stop consequently.’</italic> Now, I should advise them also to read this little book.</p>
