<p>Several decades ago, malignant lymphoma was considered a fatal disease. Today, most patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) and many patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) can be cured with the introduction of more effective induction and salvage chemotherapy regimens. The use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant as either intensive consolidation or salvage therapy for selected patients has also contributed to increased cure rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212449031">1</xref></sup> However, these intensive chemotherapy regimens are associated with systemic toxicities such as myelosuppression, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), infections and mucositis. Hence, it is important to ensure that appropriate supportive care measures are provided to lymphoma patients in a timely manner.</p>
<p>In the literature, clinical pharmacists’ involvement in hematology and oncology services has been well-reported and reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212449031">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212449031">3</xref></sup> Given the complexity and intricacies of lymphoma treatments, clinical pharmacists are often positioned to ensure appropriate supportive care is provided to these patients. Clinical pharmacists may also be required to solve drug-related problems such as identification and prevention of drug-drug interactions, management of adverse drug reactions and adjustment of cytotoxic drug dosage in organ dysfunction. Essentially, clinical pharmacists are responsible in ensuring that lymphoma patients receive optimal pharmaceutical care while they are undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
<p>At the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), clinical pharmacists have taken upon responsibilities to provide direct pharmaceutical care in the center’s lymphoma team since 2006. Clinical pharmacists play a pivotal role in the management of chemotherapy-related and supportive care issues, as well as guiding cost-effective and safe prescribing. In collaboration with the medical team, clinical pharmacists are involved in conducting practice research to optimize the delivery of pharmaceutical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212449031">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212449031"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212449031">11</xref></sup> In this report, the dedicated roles and research activities conducted by the clinical pharmacists of a lymphoma team will be elaborated upon. Furthermore, the impact of the services delivered to the team and patients will be presented.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212449031"><title>Specific areas of work</title>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212449031"><title>Supportive care: granulocyte-colony stimulating factors stewardship</title>
<p>As lymphoma treatment often involves the administration of highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy, patients are at particularly high risk for febrile neutropenia (FN) after chemotherapy. For instance, the current mainstay of NHL treatment involves the usage of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy regimen, and the treatment is associated with an FN risk of 17–50% among patients who do not receive prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212449031">12</xref></sup> Prophylactic use of G-CSF allows oncologists to maintain chemotherapy dose density and intensity in order to optimize the treatment outcomes of aggressive lymphomas. Appropriate use of G-CSF prophylaxis also allows highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy to be given safely without an increase in the incidence of FN or treatment-related complications such as hospitalization and potential chemotherapy dose reductions and delays.</p>
<p>At NCCS, clinical pharmacists recommend routine prophylaxis with G-CSF among patients receiving chemotherapy regimens with a FN risk of more than 20%. Routine prophylaxis is recommended with many lymphoma regimens including ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cisplatin, cytarabine), RICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and R-HyperCVAD (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212449031">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212449031">14</xref></sup> Currently, two formulations of G-CSF are commercially available at NCCS: pegfilgrastim and filgrastim.</p>
<p>With the advent of G-CSF usage, the question arises as to whether pegfilgrastim or filgrastim offers better protection against FN among lymphoma patients and whether there is any difference in therapeutic efficacy between them. Hence, a retrospective study was designed to compare the efficacy of the two agents by evaluating the incidence of breakthrough FN (manifestation of FN despite appropriate G-CSF prophylaxis), treatment delays and chemotherapy dose reductions among 204 NHL patients. This study demonstrated that the incidences of breakthrough FN are relatively similar with the two agents (pegfilgrastim: 16.3% vs filgrastim: 13.6%, p = 0.69) (Table 1), and concluded that either G-CSF can be administered to NHL patients, with usage being largely guided by patient preference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212449031">4</xref></sup>

<p>Although the study results have shown that filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have similar efficacies for the prevention of FN in NHL patients, approximately 15% may still experience breakthrough FN. Hence, another epidemiological study was performed to evaluate the risk factors associated with breakthrough FN among patients who received pegfilgrastim prophylaxis for CHOP-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212449031">9</xref></sup> Clinical characteristics identified to be associated with breakthrough FN include older age, late stage disease, bone marrow involvement, renal dysfunction and high baseline lactate dehydrogenase. Results from this study provided useful information for identifying patients at higher risks for breakthrough FN, warranting closer monitoring and/or other strategies (such as antibiotic prophylaxis) to prevent neutropenic complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212449031"><title>Supportive care: antiemetic stewardship</title>
<p>Lymphoma chemotherapy regimens are often moderately to highly emetogenic, as they often contain cytotoxic agents such as anthracyclines (found in RCHOP, EPOCH), ifosfamide (found in RICE) and cisplatin (found in DHAP/ESHAP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212449031">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212449031"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212449031"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212449031">18</xref></sup> Therefore, it is extremely crucial to optimize the usage of antiemetics for preventing CINV. Effective management of CINV can prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, reduce healthcare expenditures and improve patients’ quality of life.</p>
<p>At NCCS, clinical pharmacists ensure that appropriate prophylactic antiemetics are being incorporated into treatment protocols based on center-based antiemetic guidelines to facilitate prescribing by our oncologists. Despite appropriate usage of prophylactic antiemetics, some patients inevitably still experience breakthrough CINV. Hence, pharmacists on the lymphoma team play a critical role to aid in the identification of patients who may be at risk for breakthrough CINV. For these high risk patients, additional antiemetics and counseling are warranted. Previously, oncologists have identified three most crucial risk factors that may increase the risk of CINV among our cancer patients. These risk factors include high-state anxiety, being female and of young age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212449031">5</xref></sup> Lymphoma patients, particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, are at higher risk for emesis as they tend to be younger who are often anxious about their conditions.</p>
<p>Coupling the evaluation of patient-specific risk factors and optimization of antiemetic prescribing using center-based guidelines, clinical pharmacists can contribute to appropriate use of antiemetics in the management of CINV among lymphoma patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212449031"><title>Supportive care: appropriate tumor lysis prevention</title>
<p>Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially life-threatening oncologic emergency that is commonly observed among patients with aggressive lymphomas such as Burkitt’s lymphoma. This is due to the release of intracellular contents into the circulation caused by massive cell destruction, resulting in electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction. A number of strategies for TLS management are available, which includes hyperhydration, urinary alkalinization, the use of uricosuric agent such as allopurinol, correction of electrolyte abnormalities and dialysis. However, very often these patients present from potential renal dysfunction, hence uricosuric agents and hydration fluids typically require optimization by clinical pharmacists on the team to ensure that the clinical efficacy of these agents are being maximized.</p>
<p>One of the most critical drugs in the contemporary management of TLS is rasburicase. It is a recombinant form of urate oxidase, and rasburicase is often used to manage TLS in lymphoma patients, particularly in those with renal dysfunction, and are unable to receive uricosuric agents such as allopurinol. A number of studies have suggested that a single, fixed dose of rasburicase is capable of lowering the uric acid levels in patients who are at risk for TLS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212449031">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212449031"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212449031">21</xref></sup> This has potentially cost-saving implications (one-fifth of the total cost) because the currently approved regimen for rasburicase usage requires 5 days of treatment.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain that a single, fixed dose of rasburicase would be effective in Asian lymphoma patients, a study was conducted to evaluate a series of lymphoma patients who have utilized a single, fixed dose of rasburicase 6 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212449031">7</xref></sup> Overall, most patients manifested at least two risk factors (such as tumor type, tumor burden, renal function and baseline uric acid) for TLS, and a single, fixed dose of rasburicase at 6 mg was deemed effective in lowering of uric acid levels and was able to sustain reduced uric acid levels for up to 72 h. In this study, the mean uric acid level was 835 µmol/L (range, 318–1237 µmol/L) prior to rasburicase treatment, and the mean uric acid level 24 h post administration of rasburicase was 186 µmol/L (range, 30–653 µmol/L). The reduction of uric acid was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, rasburicase was also effective in normalizing the serum creatinine levels and reducing renal complications such as the need for hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Proper selection of patients for rasburicase therapy is crucial for preventing injudicious use of this costly drug. In collaboration with the lymphoma specialists, clinical pharmacists have successfully established a team-based guideline for its usage, in order to ensure the drug is appropriately prescribed and monitored. Elements that are incorporated in this guideline include dosing, administration strategy, contraindications of rasburicase use, appropriate selection of patients and monitoring strategies.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1078155212449031"><title>Supportive care: therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of high-dose methotrexate</title>
<p>Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an extranodal form of NHL that involves the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid. The incidence of PCNSL has been increasing over the past 3 decades and the presentation of PCNSL is neurological in nature. At NCCS, high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX; which refers to methotrexate dosed at 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> and above) is often given as part of a chemotherapy regimen for treatment of PCNSL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212449031">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although HDMTX is highly efficacious for PCNSL, HDMTX treatment could lead to an increased incidence and severity of side effects compared to conventional methotrexate doses, thus necessitating institution of timely folinic acid (FA) rescue in these regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212449031">22</xref></sup> Myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicities, nephrotoxicity and transaminitis are commonly observed after HDMTX administration. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is carried out by pharmacists at specific time points (according to the chemotherapy protocol) to identify patients who are at risk of delayed methotrexate clearance and life-threatening toxicities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212449031">23</xref></sup> FA dose would need to be adjusted appropriately according to methotrexate levels through TDM. Together with appropriate supportive care strategies, toxicities associated with high serum methotrexate concentrations can be ameliorated.</p>
<p>Besides performing routine TDM of HDMTX, clinical pharmacists on the lymphoma team play a critical role to ensure that appropriate supportive care is provided, which includes appropriate dose adjustment of FA rescue, hyperhydration and urinary alkalinization. In addition, clinical pharmacists would actively screen for potential drug interactions associated with methotrexate. Through the mechanism of protein-binding displacement, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the potential for toxicity of methotrexate. These drug-drug interactions are deemed clinically significant as they may result in an increased occurrence of systemic toxicities, which may compromise the treatment outcomes in these lymphoma patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212449031">6</xref></sup> This further emphasizes the important role that clinical pharmacists play to prevent drug-related problems on the lymphoma team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1078155212449031"><title>Improvement of resource utilization: rapid Rituximab infusion</title>
<p>Since its approval in 1999, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is largely used in the treatment of CD20-expressing, B-cell NHL. It is however, associated with infusion-related reactions, which are highest with the first infusion and tends to decrease with subsequent infusions. Hence, rituximab is currently recommended by the drug manufacturer to be infused over 4 to 5 h to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions.</p>
<p>Many patients find rituximab infusion inconvenient due to its long duration of administration; furthermore, it may also pose scheduling difficulties for our center. From the health economists’ perspective, shorter infusion times would allow more patients to be treated and maximize allocated resources; from the patients’ perspective, spending less time for cancer treatment is definitely an attractive option resulting in improved acceptability of treatment and patients’ satisfaction. Therefore, to investigate the feasibility of administering rituximab over 90 minutes (also known as ‘rapid rituximab infusion’) without compromising patient safety, a prospective, single center, open-labeled study with proper sample size calculated was conducted. It aimed to determine the incidence and severity of grade 3 or 4 infusion-related adverse effects from rapid infusion of rituximab. In this study, a total of 79 patients were recruited within 17 months with a total of 269 infusions administered. The average number of rapid infusions administered to each patient was 3.4 cycles. Rapid infusion of rituximab was well tolerated without any grade 3 or 4 infusion-related adverse events observed. In terms of resource consumption saved, the total savings in facility charges was SGD$1915, and the total amount of chair time saved for all patients (which also translates to savings in chair time for our center) was 807 h. In this study, each patient saved an average of 10.2 h over their entire course of chemotherapy when they received rituximab as a rapid infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212449031">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In ambulatory cancer centers, resource limitations such as limited chair time, shortage of nursing and pharmacy resources are often encountered. Thus, with rituximab rapid infusion, patients can be provided more efficient care, and more patients can be accommodated for treatment. The adoption of the rapid rituximab infusion as standard of care at NCCS was made possible with a collaborative effort between the pharmacy and medical oncology departments, in order to conduct this study that confirmed the safety of rapid infusions in the Asian population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1078155212449031"><title>Medication safety: preventing drug-related problems</title>
<p>Lymphoma chemotherapy protocols are often complex, involving a variety of anticancer agents that are given in a scheduled manner. Clinical pharmacists frequently collaborate with oncologists on the team to create chemotherapy order forms that are in accordance with the standards provided by the American Society of Health System Pharmacists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155212449031">24</xref></sup> The development of chemotherapy order forms has greatly facilitated the prescribing of chemotherapy, ensuring clarity, consistency, safety and accuracy. They are being updated on a regular basis to incorporate treatment updates as well as specific recommendations regarding prophylactic antibiotics and/or G-CSF. This is particularly important when the team initiates novel treatment regimens that are inherently toxic. In these situations, clinical pharmacists play a key role to ensure that supportive care measures are maximized. For example, there has been a recent increase in the use of SMILE regimen for the management of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Supportive care measures such as prophylactic G-CSF usage and antibiotic support are crucial as grade 4 neutropenia events occur in 92% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212449031">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, lymphoma patients often suffer from poor immunity, rendered by both the disease and their treatment. Hence, these patients often seek complementary and alternative medicine usage (CAM) to boost the immune system. Common CAMs that are known for their immunodulating benefits include cordyceps, coriolus versicolor, echinacea and ginseng. At NCCS, over 50% of the patients use some form of CAM while they are receiving chemotherapy treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212449031">10</xref></sup> Approximately half (46.3%) of the patients on CAM did not discuss its usage with their oncologists. The most common reasons cited were that CAM were viewed as harmless and not medicines (34.3%), oncologists did not ask about CAM use (26.7%) and fear that oncologists may discourage CAM use (17.1%). Among all characteristics, only race, education level and prior CAM use were found to be associated with CAM use (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Due to narrow therapeutic indices of chemotherapy, drug-herb interactions could lead to complications, either increased toxicities or sub-therapeutic effects of chemotherapy. Nonetheless, drug-herb interactions are potentially detrimental and both patients and oncologists need to be aware of this impending risk. Therefore, to aid our oncologists in this area, an electronic database was created with a user-friendly interface that enables the rapid identification of chemotherapy interactions with CAM, including traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212449031">11</xref></sup> Further studies are required to evaluate whether usage of the database can prevent clinical sequelae due to CAM.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1078155212449031"><title>Recognizing the impact of pharmacists’ interventions</title>
<p>We have conducted a prospective evaluation to study the impact of all interventions that were made by the clinical pharmacists in our inpatient service over a 1-year period between May 2009 and May 2010. On average, 20 to 30 patients are admitted to the inpatient service on a monthly basis. Within 1 year, a total of 295 interventions were made for 116 patients. Interventions were evaluated based on the impact of three areas in clinical practice: avoiding or resolving drug-related problems, cost-related issues and workflow. The impact of the interventions was evaluated by two independent reviewers, including a lymphoma oncologist and an oncology pharmacist. For each area, the evaluators rated each intervention based on its impact from 0 to 4 using a standardized grid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212449031">Table 2</xref>).

<p>Majority of the interventions were on chemotherapy-related issues, optimization of antimicrobial usage and supportive care therapies. Overall, 97% of the interventions were accepted by oncologists. A total of 23% of the impact ratings were given a rating of 3 and above, demonstrating that these interventions were highly impactful and promote desirable outcomes including cost savings and safe prescribing. Impact ratings given 3 and above were highest among promotion of cost-effective prescribing (33.9%), followed by resolution of drug-related problems (26.2%) and improvement of workflow (10.2%). Ratings that solved or avoided drug-related problems and improved workflow were moderately concordant between the two reviewers in the areas of supportive care (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.544) and chemotherapy-related issues (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.559).</p>
<p>Although the tangible improvement in clinical outcomes as a result of these interventions has not been assessed, this evaluation has demonstrated that clinical pharmacists’ interventions are well accepted during lymphoma patient ward rounds and have created a positive impact on patient care. Data obtained from this study strongly justify the clinical pharmacy services offered to lymphoma patients on the team. It has also demonstrated that the inputs by clinical pharmacists are highly valuable and have major contributions to patient care.</p>

<p>This is the first published report that describes the clinical pharmacy services and research for lymphoma patients at a cancer center. Moving forward, clinical pharmacy specialists need to constantly expand their roles on the lymphoma team in order to satisfy the evolving demands of healthcare. To ensure that pharmacists serving on the lymphoma team are adequately trained to handle complex patient problems and proficient and competent to provide pharmaceutical care, advanced training programs (such as oncology pharmacy residencies) are now in place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212449031">26</xref></sup> It is also crucial to acknowledge that the aim to provide optimal care for patients can never be achieved through the sole efforts of clinical pharmacists. A multidisciplinary team-care approach must be adopted to assume responsibility and accountability in drug therapy management. Furthermore, one certainly cannot underemphasize the amount of synergism that was generated through developing close working relationships with other healthcare professionals. Ultimately, patients would definitely reap the benefits of such team alliances with the main aim of achieving improved medical care for patients.</p>
