<abstract>
<p>Due to the environmental concerns and expense associated with the disposal of wastewater after industrial cooking of rice, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of leaching, water uptake and volumetric expansion of rice during cooking at various milling durations and water-to-rice ratios. Two cultivars of Arkansas rice, a long grain (Francis) and a medium grain (Jupiter), were milled for 10, 20, and 30 s with a laboratory mill. Samples were cooked in aluminum foil covered beakers at water-to-rice ratios of 10:1, 15:1, and 20:1. After 20 min, rice was weighed for water uptake and measured for volumetric expansion using hexane displacement. The excess cooking water was evaluated for total solids, amylose, and protein to determine the extent of leaching. Water uptake and volumetric expansion significantly increased with milling duration in both cultivars. Leached solids increased as the water-to-rice ratio increased in Francis and increased with milling duration in Jupiter; however, the amylose content of leached solids was unaffected by the water-to-rice ratio in both cultivars. Thus, shorter milling durations may limit the extent of leaching during cooking, as observed with Jupiter, while a lower water-to-rice ratio may reduce wastewater contamination for cultivars similar to Francis.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211428001" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In home cooking, rice is cooked either in excess water or in a predetermined amount of water (with an approximate rice-to-water ratio of 1:2 (v/v)) that is completely absorbed during the cooking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211428001">Bett-Garber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211428001">Juliano, 1984</xref>). On an industrial scale, however, rice cooking often involves the use of variable levels of excess water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211428001">Boykin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211428001">Stover, 1992</xref>). At the end of the cooking process, the excess water often contains significant levels of starch, protein, and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211428001">Nierle et al., 1981</xref>) as well as various inorganic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211428001">Queiroz et al., 2007</xref>). This poses a significant problem in industry due to the costly disposal of industrial wastewater with a high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211428001">Boykin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies indicate that leaching of starch, proteins and lipids can be affected by several factors, including water-to-rice ratio (WRR) and degree of milling. Degree of milling is a measurement of the amount of bran removed from the surface of the rice kernel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211428001">Perdon et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211428001">Nierle et al. (1981)</xref> observed less solids when cooking brown rice than milled white rice indicating that the degree of milling likely affects the extent of solids lost during cooking. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211428001">Morawicki et al. (2009)</xref> observed that the extent of leaching of rice cooked in excess water was affected by the degree of milling and the WRR.</p>
<p>Other factors that may contribute to the loss of solids during cooking include the grain length (commonly characterized as short, medium or long grains) and cooking duration. Due to differences in gelatinization temperature, the long-grain rice cultivars were less likely to leach amylose which resulted in reduced total solids in the effluent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211428001">Metcalf and Lund, 1985</xref>). In addition, increasing the cooking duration in excess water resulted in a greater loss of solids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211428001">Yadav and Jindal, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The rice kernel undergoes significant changes during cooking. These changes can be partially defined by water uptake and volumetric expansion. Water uptake of rice is the amount of water absorbed by a quantity of rice when cooked in a boiling bath for a defined period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211428001">Bergman et al., 2004</xref>) while volumetric expansion, related to the water uptake, is the extent of swelling of the kernel. The water uptake is affected by cooking duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211428001">Yadav and Jindal, 2007</xref>), amylose content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211428001">Metcalf and Lund, 1985</xref>), and degree of milling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211428001">Mohapatra and Bal, 2006</xref>). Volumetric expansion is affected by both grain properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211428001">Ge et al., 2005</xref>) and cooking temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211428001">Ramesh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211428001">Sowbhagya et al., 1994</xref>). Understanding how water uptake and volumetric expansion are influenced by excess water may contribute to the optimization of cooking conditions during operations.</p>
<p>Since wastewater contamination is an industrial concern during cooking of rice in excess water, it is important to evaluate changes in rice and cooking water as affected by various processing and pre-processing conditions. Thus, the goal of this cooking study was to evaluate simultaneously the effects of grain length, milling duration, and excess water (at various WRRs) on cooked rice water uptake, volumetric expansion, and leaching of solids such as starch and protein.</p>

<p>Two cultivars of rice, Francis (a long-grain cultivar) and Jupiter (a medium grain) were harvested in the fall of 2007 from Stuttgart, AR and Newport, AR, respectively. Petroleum ether, hexane, ethanol, sodium hydroxide, acetic acid, iodine, potassium iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from VWR International (West Chester, PA). The standards (amylose, amylopectin and bovine serum albumin) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1082013211428001"><title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The effects of cultivar (long vs. medium grain), milling duration, and WRR were studied simultaneously using a 2 × 3 × 3 full factorial experimental design in triplicate. The three milling durations were 10, 20, and 30 s and the three WRRs were 10:1, 15:1, and 20:1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013211428001"><title>Rice harvest and pre-study treatment</title>
<p>The long-grain cultivar (Francis) was harvested at 18.5% harvest moisture content (MC) as determined by an individual kernel moisture meter (GAC2000, Dicky-John, Auburn, IL), while the medium-grain cultivar (Jupiter) was harvested at a 16.7% harvest MC. The rough rice was transported to the University of Arkansas rice processing laboratories where it was cleaned (Carter-Day Dockage Tester, Seedburo Equipment Co., Chicago, IL; MCI Kicker Grain Tester, Seedburo Equipment Co., Chicago, IL) and then spread on drying trays. The drying trays (wooden frame strung with wire mesh to allow air flow through the rice layer) were then placed in a chamber in which the equilibrium MC was set at 12.5% (relative humidity 62.1%, temperature 26.5 °C) using an environmental control unit (Parameter Generation and Control, Black Mountain, NC). During the slow drying process, rice MC was monitored periodically using an oven drying method modified from Jindal and Siebenmorgen (1987) during which duplicate 16 g samples of rough rice were dried for 24 h in a convection oven (1370 FM, Sheldon Inc., Cornelius, OR) set at 130 °C. Once the rice reached 12.4% MC, samples (150 g) were sealed in Ziploc® bags, stored at 4 °C and milled within a week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211428001"><title>Milling</title>
<p>Samples were removed from cold storage and allowed to equilibrate, while still sealed, at room temperature for 24 h. Each of the bagged samples (with 150 g rough rice) was dehulled using a laboratory huller (Type THU, Satake, Tokyo, Japan). The resulting brown rice was then milled using a laboratory milling machine (McGill No.2, RAPSCO, Brookshire, TX) for 10, 20, or 30 s, and the total milled mass was measured and recorded. The milled rice was separated into head rice (rice kernels 3/4 original length or longer) and broken kernels using a sizing device (Rice Sizing Device 61, Grain Machinery MFG Corp. Miami, Fl.). Excess bran and chaff was removed from the whole kernels by forcing air through the rice sample for 30 s (Grainblower, Seedburo Equipment Co,. Chicago, IL). The head rice (or whole rice) kernels were then weighed and the head rice yield (HRY) was calculated using equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1082013211428001">1</xref>).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1082013211428001"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013211428001-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Fractions of the same cultivar and milling duration were pooled together and placed in an equilibration chamber set at 29 °C and 58% RH long enough to ensure a 12% MC in the kernels before cooking. After moisture content equilibration, the samples were divided into 20 g aliquots, bagged, sealed, and stored at 4 °C until the cooking tests were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013211428001"><title>Surface lipid content</title>
<p>The surface lipid content was determined by lipid extraction with a Soxtec Avanti 2055 (Foss North America, Eden Prairie, MN) according to the methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211428001">Matsler and Siebenmorgen (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211428001">AACC International (2000)</xref>. Prior to extraction, samples of whole rice kernels (4–5 g) were placed in Soxtec thimbles, covered with defatted cotton and dried for one hour at 103 ± 2 °C. After cooling in a desiccator, boiling beads were added and the samples were placed in the Soxtec. Lipids were extracted with petroleum ether (approximately 70 mL). Following the evaporation of the solvent, the Soxtec thimbles were dried, allowed to cool in a desiccator, and subsequently weighed. The surface lipid content was calculated as the percent weight loss following lipid extraction from whole rice kernels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211428001"><title>Cooking</title>
<p>Milled rice samples from each cultivar and milling duration were removed from 4 °C storage and placed, while sealed, at room temperature for 1 h prior to cooking tests. In a beaker, 200, 300, or 400 mL water was brought to a boil and 20 g of rice was added immediately (representing WRRs of 10:1, 15:1, and 20:1, respectively). The samples were stirred thoroughly and then covered tightly with aluminum foil to prevent evaporation and maintain a constant volume. The foil was pressed around the beaker opening while leaving a small depression in the center where an ice cube was placed to promote condensation inside the beaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211428001">Figure 1</xref>). Once covered, heat was reduced to assure a gentle boil for 20 min. The cooked rice was then strained and the cooking water was collected in a pre-weighed glass beaker. The cooked rice was analyzed for water uptake and volumetric expansion, while the cooking water was analyzed for total solids, amylose and protein content.

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013211428001"><title>Water uptake</title>
<p>Immediately after cooking, the rice samples were weighed and water uptake was calculated as the percentage of weight gained during cooking (based on the original weight of the uncooked rice) using equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1082013211428001">2</xref>).

</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211428001"><title>Volumetric expansion</title>
<p>Volumetric expansion was determined through volume displacement of hexane. After the cooked rice was drained and weighed for water uptake, the cooked rice was placed in 150 mL hexane and the change in volume was recorded. The displacement of 20 g uncooked rice sample of the same cultivar/milling duration/WRR in 50 mL of hexane was also determined. The percent volumetric expansion was calculated using the following equation.

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211428001"><title>Solids leached</title>
<p>Immediately after the rice was cooked, the cooking water was collected in a pre-weighed glass beaker and placed in a laboratory oven set at 115 °C for 24 h. The beakers were cooled in a dessicator, weighed, and the mass of leached solids per 20 g rice sample was calculated. Then the dry solids were scraped out of the beaker into Ziploc<sup>TM</sup> bags, sealed and stored at 4 °C until the amylose and protein content could be determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211428001"><title>Apparent amylose content</title>
<p>Apparent amylose content of the leached solids was determined using the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211428001">Juliano et al. (1981)</xref>. From each sample, 100.0 ± 2.0 mg of dried leached solids was transferred into a 50 mL test tube. To this, 1 mL of 95% ethanol and 9 mL of 1 N NaOH were added. The test tubes were sealed and the samples were incubated overnight in a 50 °C water bath rotating at 100 rpm. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were rinsed 5 times with 10 mL of de-ionized (DI) water. The rinse water was added back and the final volume was brought to 100 mL with DI H<sub>2</sub>O. A 0.5 mL aliquot was mixed with 9.2 mL DI H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.1 mL 1 N acetic acid, and 0.2 mL of IKI solution (0.2% I<sub>2</sub> in 2% KI) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 620 nm with a spectrophotometer (PharmaSpec 1700, Shimadzu, Japan). The results were compared to standards solutions composed of different concentrations of amylose (potato starch) and amylopectin (waxy rice). The percentage of amylose (on a dry weight basis) was determined from the standard regression equation of amylose in the standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1082013211428001"><title>Bio-rad protein assay</title>
<p>The samples were prepared by dissolving 0.01 g of leached solids in 2 mL of 90% dimethyl sulfoxide. The samples were held overnight in a 95 °C hot water bath rotating at 100 rpm. Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard prepared in the same manner as the samples.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1082013211428001"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>JMP v.7 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the significance of treatments. Tukeys least squares adjustment method was used to compare treatment means (<italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

<sec id="sec17-1082013211428001"><title>Head rice yield</title>
<p>The HRY for Francis was 79% after milling for 10 s and 75% after milling for 20 s and 30 s. A decrease in HRY with increased milling duration was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211428001">Saleh and Meullenet (2007)</xref>. In contrast, however, the HRY for Jupiter ranged from 90% to 91% for all milling durations with no differences between means.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1082013211428001"><title>Surface lipid content</title>
<p>The surface lipid content of the rice cultivars as affected by milling duration are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211428001">Table 1</xref>. The surface lipid content decreased in Francis from 0.97% (with 10 s of milling) to 0.30% (with 30 s) while the lipid content of Jupiter rice decreased from 0.79% (with 10 s of milling) to 0.44% (with 30 s). Surface lipid content is a relative indicator of the extent of bran removal since the lipid content of the bran is significantly greater than the endosperm. The typical surface lipid content of white rice ranges from 0.3% to 0.5% according to Lu and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211428001">Luh (1991)</xref>; therefore, milling for 30 s was sufficient to remove most of the bran from the surface of the rice and simulate the production of white rice.

<sec id="sec19-1082013211428001"><title>Water uptake</title>
<p>The effects of WRR, DOM and cultivar on the water uptake of cooked rice are shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211428001">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211428001">3</xref>. As expected, the water uptake of Francis was greater than Jupiter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211428001">Bergman et al. (2004)</xref> reported that water uptake was greater in long-grain rice cultivars than medium-grain when cooked in excess water. This may be attributed to differences in amylose content between the medium and long-grain cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211428001">Bergman et al., 2004</xref>). Water uptake remained unaffected by WRR at all milling durations except in Francis at a DOM of 20 s where the water uptake decreased (from 240% to 231%) as WRR increased. There was, however, a significant interaction between cultivar and WRR that affected water uptake (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0407) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211428001">Table 2</xref>. This is likely due to differences in surface area, gelatinization temperature, amylose content and protein content of the two cultivars because these properties can influence the extent of water uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211428001">Bett-Garber et al., 2007</xref>). The interaction of WRR and cultivar on water uptake indicates that changes in the amount of cooking water may affect the cooking of each cultivar differently and the optimum industrial WRR for water uptake may also differ for each cultivar.

<p>Total leached solids was affected by WRR (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211428001">Table 2</xref>; however, when the total solids were evaluated by cultivar, the change in leached solids with increasing WRR was only significant in Francis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013211428001">Table 4</xref>). The total leached solids (for all milling durations) in Francis increased from 9.7% to 11.4% as WRR increased from 10:1 to 20:1. A positive relationship between WRR and amount of leached solids confirms that leached solids increase when rice is cooked in increasingly excess water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211428001">Nierle et al., 1981</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211428001">Vidal et al. (2007)</xref>, the internal temperature of the rice increases as the WRR increases which leads to greater amounts of gelatinization within the kernel and increased gelatinization could lead to an increase in leached solids. Overall, to minimize wastewater contamination from leached solids, the optimum WRR was 10:1 (for Francis) and the optimum milling duration was 10 s (for Jupiter).</p>

<sec id="sec22-1082013211428001"><title>Amylose content of leached solids</title>
<p>The amylose content of the leached solids was significantly affected by milling duration (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and by cultivar (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211428001">Table 2</xref>. As milling duration increased from 10 to 30 s, the amylose content increased from 13.8% to 29.0% and 1.7% to 9.9% for Francis and Jupiter, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1082013211428001">Table 5</xref>); thus, to dramatically reduce the percent amylose in the leached solids in the cooking water, the milling duration should be limited to 10 s. The increase in leaching with more extensive milling was most likely due to the greater amount of exposed starchy endosperm on the surface of the granule. In addition, differences in leaching between cultivars was attributable to differences in cell arrangement and protein content of the cultivars, which affects the rate of water diffusion into the kernel (Lee, 1987), starch dissolution and amylose leaching.

<p>The protein content of the leached solids ranged from 0.0 to 8.6 mg BSA/g leached solids for Francis and 0.0 to 9.3 mg BSA/g leached solids for Jupiter; however, none of the differences were significant with an increase in WRR (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4066) or milling duration (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0994). There was also no significant difference in the protein content of the leached solids of the two cultivars (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6217). It is possible that the large variation and the lack of observable differences could be the result of the samples having such low concentrations (below the limits of detection of the assay). Overall, there were detectable amounts of protein in the excess water indicating that there are losses in protein when rice is cooked in excess water. This was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211428001">Nierle et al.

<sec id="sec24-1082013211428001" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Leached solids are an adverse effect of cooking rice in excess water. The solids leached consist of valuable nutrients such as proteins, starches, and lipids that contaminate industrial waste. Reducing solids leached in cooking water will result in effluent with lower BOD and aid in reducing the environmental impact of many food companies. As the water-to-rice ratio increased, the total solids increased in the Francis cultivar, indicating that lower water-to-rice ratios may reduce the BOD of the wastewater. Furthermore, shorter milling durations may also limit the amount of solids leached. Less milling leaves traces of bran on the kernel that would add nutritional value to the product and save in industrial costs by reducing the energy required to mill the kernel. Since consumers prefer a white, polished rice kernel, however, shorter milling duration may not be long enough to remove the brown tinge that the bran layer leaves on the rice kernel.</p>
<p>Greater milling time increased the water uptake and volumetric expansion indicating a greater ability to absorb water with increased milling time. Thus, increasing milling time may reduce industrial cooking times; however, the energy saved in cooking may be lost in extended milling times.</p>
