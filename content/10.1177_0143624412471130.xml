<p>The formation of CIBSE as laid out on it’s the rules of 1899 was based on the need to “…. promote intellectual welfare of its members by periodical meetings, to read, consider and discuss papers or problems on Heating, Ventilation, or other kindred subjects …”. The first annual meetings were held in the homes of the CIBSE presidents allowing the <italic>whole</italic> institution (then known as the Institution of Heating and Ventilating Engineers, IHVE) to join together to share knowledge through the presentation and discussion of papers. And now, over 110 years later, the appetite, and the need, for knowledge and importantly the opportunity to share and discuss experiences, advancing techniques and emerging technologies has not diminished.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2010, a proposal was generated to create an annual symposium to address the call from the current CIBSE membership for a new, regular, technical-based event that could offer an accessible, peer-reviewed, forum for the “industry.” It was soon apparent that a key benefit would be that this could encourage participation of the broad constituency of professional “building services engineering” – academics and consultants, researchers and practitioners, modelers and fabricators, planners and operators, young and old – where the community could interact for mutual benefit. The symposium was conceived as an accessible learned event, focused around the technical content, where the industry could join without the distraction (and cost) of the frills of some of the more corporate events but providing ample opportunity for interaction and “networking.”</p>
<p>And so the 1st technical symposium was held at DeMonfort University in Leicester in September 2011 and, following the success of this inaugural event, the train was put in motion for an annual repeat event. The second symposium, held in the spring of 2012 at Imperial College, London, was further enhanced through the active involvement of ASHRAE in both its planning and delivery and included several papers from ASHRAE supported speakers. Each of the symposia included over 50 peer-reviewed presentations, both oral and poster, and were attended by in excess of 100 delegates from around the world.</p>
<p>And from these papers, a selection has been made to represent a coherent themed area that was strongly represented at the 2 symposia that of the benchmarking and prediction of building energy consumption to inform future design, construction and operation for reduced environmental impact. The authors have further developed their papers to both address the discussions resulting from their initial presentation at the symposium and to meet the requirements of the second review undertaken by BSERT.</p>
<p>The utopian ideal is that low energy design may be “future proof” so that it may properly take account of lifecycle requirements and makes appropriate provision for the uncertainties that are always manifested in the life of a real building. The underlying technologies in practice may, in themselves, not be “new technology” but the applications are often novel and so increase the risk and uncertainty in the pursuit to produce a near zero energy home. The Code for Sustainable Homes already incorporates a requirement for both limiting energy use and consequent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the challenge is to ensure that in complying with the code proper account is taken of the changes in future use, climate, and energy supply markets. Georgiadou et al. look to examine how the code may be more dynamic and future oriented and takes 2 best practice housing developments and explores methods that can sensibly be included as requirements in future codes.</p>
<p>Currently, simplified tools that are used to evidence compliance of building designs with codes and standards, such as the UK’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for assessing and comparing the energy and environmental performance of dwellings, can provide confirmation to building control authorities that a building will meet a prescribed minimum performance. But, by virtue of their design for application across a wide range of housing designs, the tools inherently lack facility and flexibility to examine the evolving applications of technology particularly where dynamic or adaptive control regimes are applied. Murphy et al. propose a new method specifically to allow the integration of novel dynamic heating and renewable energy systems and, specifically in their paper, air source heat pumps, in the SAP framework.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is only useful if the data that underpins methodology is representative of the specific building type, its energy consuming equipment and, importantly, its use. The work reported by Bottrill et al. takes a large set of energy data from performing arts buildings in the UK and compares the recorded energy use with those that I saw were the best most suitable available from the CIBSE publication TM 46 “Energy Benchmarks” – those for “entertainment hall.” Maybe not surprisingly when looking at specific application, their findings of total energy consumption were less than half of that benchmark. However, it clearly shows that in this sector there is particular need for greater discrimination in the reference data.</p>
<p>There are many tools available to model buildings and predict energy use, but it is knowledge and skill in the application of the tool that will determine how close result will be to the operation of a real world construction. And it is only through feedback from users and monitored installations that the iterative development the tools will move forward to provide more confident prediction. Smith et al. have taken some readily available software tools and applied them to case studies of refurbishment projects for a pair of 20<sup>th</sup> century schools. The practicality feasibility of measures applied using the software was moderated through a survey of building industry professionals involved in school design that identified the approaches that were most appropriate. Using the findings they have extrapolated their findings across the national school building stock to provide an indication of the potential carbon reductions.</p>
<p>As the performance of the building envelopes evolves and infiltration and ventilation regimes are tamed, the energy consumed in operating buildings is increasingly influenced, both in direct electrical consumption and consequent cooling load, by the small power consumption. Menezes et al. having examined the standard references for plug loads undertook a comparative study of a real office building in the UK and provide some initial findings of load profiles. The work showed a great diversity between what was currently predicted and the reality of their site studies in areas of IT equipment both in operation and, significantly for energy assessments, standby loads.</p>
<p>In many studies, there is a challenge to have access to, and inevitably influence, a “representative” sample of the buildings under investigation. The US Department of Defense consumes the power of a small nation and of that 8% that is used by the Army. So, the opportunity to assess and, potentially, make a significant dent in the $1 billion annual expenditure specifically in connection with building-related energy has truly global impact. US federal law has mandated that new buildings and buildings that are undergoing refurbishment should have a significantly reduced energy consumption compared with 2003 benchmarks with the aspiration of near zero energy buildings by 2030. With such a challenge, and with access to this globally important estate, Zhivov et al. provide compelling case study evidence of the efficacy of holistic solutions including packages of good housekeeping, energy-saving adaptations, renewable, co-generation and distributed energy schemes as a means of delivering whole life energy benefits in an integrated optimization process.</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to assume that a building will continue through its whole life cycle in the fall or use that was conceived by his designers and constructors. As the world economy ebbs and flows, and the demands and fashions of consumers change, not only has there been a vast expansion in the provision of data centres around the world but awareness of their huge appetite for resource has intensified. Flucker et al. have examined the opportunities for reducing the environmental impact of data centre building services, modifying designs to accommodate energy-saving aspects whilst maintaining all important reliability and redundancy. Their work shows examples of impressive financial benefit as well as reduced resource impact.</p>
<p>Combined together in this Special Issue, these papers are an excellent example of the benefit of the industry joining together and illustrate how sharing of investigation, practice and experience can inform academic and practitioner alike by expanding their sphere of knowledge beyond their normal “comfort zone.”</p>
