<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>This 18-day-old African American male neonate presented to our clinic with multiple brief seizures during the previous 2 days. The mother described 4 episodes of “jerking” movements of his left arm and left leg, each lasting approximately 15 seconds. Following these episodes, he appeared normal and took feedings without difficulty. The mother also noted that he would suddenly stop crying and “stare” for seconds before continuing crying. In the clinic, the patient had 2 more generalized seizures and was immediately transferred to the emergency room. In the emergency room, he continued to have seizures and was treated with diazepam.</p>
<p>He had no history of trauma, vomiting, diarrhea, or sick contacts and was feeding normally prior to the onset of this current illness. The patient was born at 37 weeks gestational age via nonspontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother had a positive group B streptococcus (GBS) screen but did not receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis prior to delivery. All other prenatal screening was negative. Both the patient and mother had routine postpartum hospital courses and were discharged 48 hours after delivery. Past medical history and surgical history were noncontributory. The patient was not on medications and had no known allergies. Family history included a seizure disorder in the patient’s aunt. The patient lived with his mother, grandmother, and mother’s boyfriend. There were no pets in the house.</p>
<p>On physical exam in the emergency department, temperature was100.9°F, heart rate 142 bpm, respiratory rate 75 rpm, blood pressure 116/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. The patient was nondysmorphic. He was sleeping comfortably and easily arousable. Head and neck examination revealed open flat fontanels and no thyromegaly. There was no significant adenopathy. Cardiovascular and lung examinations were normal. Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. There was neither hepatosplenomegaly nor masses noted. There were no rashes. On neurological exam, the patient had normal tone and moved all extremities spontaneously.</p>
<p>Initial laboratory studies revealed a sodium of 132 mmol/L, potassium 5.5 mmol/L, chloride 96 mmol/L, bicarbonate 27 mmol/L, glucose 96 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.3 mg/dL, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, total protein 5.8 g/dL, albumin 3.8 gm/dL, direct bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, AST (aspartate transaminase) 60 m/dL, ALT (alanine transaminase) 32 m/dL, alkaline phosphatase 249 m/dL, white blood cell count 8240/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 14.3 gm/dL, and platelets 440 000/ mm<sup>3</sup>. Urinalysis was within normal limits. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography scan were within normal limits. Subsequent lumbar puncture revealed a protein of 74 mg/dL, glucose 45 mg/dL, and white blood cells 174/mm<sup>3</sup> (polymorphonuclear leukocytes 15%, lymphphocytes 39%, and monocytes 37%). A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain, culture and herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed and demonstrated abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement within the posterior frontal and diffusely within the parietal and occipital sulci suggesting bacterial or viral meningitis. Initial blood culture Gram stain showed Gram-positive cocci.</p>
<p>Because of the positive blood culture, a working diagnosis of GBS meningitis was made and he was begun on cefotaxime and ampicillin. Acyclovir was added empirically, pending results of the CSF HSV-PCR. The following day, CSF and urine cultures were reported as no growth and the blood culture organism was identified as <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. CSF Gram stain and culture were negative but the HSV-PCR was positive. Amoxicillin and cefotaxime were therefore discontinued and the patient was continued on acyclovir, 60 mg/kg/d divided every 8 hours for 21 days. The patient’s seizure activity resolved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case highlights the difficultly in diagnosing perinatal HSV meningoencephalitis. Neonatal seizures are not uncommon and the differential diagnosis includes a broad range of etiologies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811426476">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811426476">1</xref></sup> Definitive diagnosis can be difficult and approximately 10% are ultimately of unknown etiology. However, in the case of a previously healthy child with a normal newborn screen and no dysmorphic features, the potential underlying causes are narrowed significantly. In a febrile neonate with irritability and poor feeding, both sepsis and central nervous system (CNS) infection are likely causes.</p>

<p>Neonatal HSV infection occurs in 1 per 3200 live births in the United States and is a leading cause of newborn morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811426476">2</xref></sup> Infection is spread from mother to newborn transplacentally or through retrograde infection via ruptured or compromised amniotic membranes. Intrauterine transmission occurs more commonly with primary infection as contrasted with reactivation infection during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811426476">3</xref></sup> Congenital HSV infection usually results in fetal demise or if later in pregnancy, premature labor and delivery. Perinatal transmission accounts for approximately 85%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811426476">5</xref></sup> The rate of perinatal transmission during vaginal delivery is markedly increased when maternal lesions are present at the time of birth. However, infection can also be transmitted to the fetus when visible lesions are absent; in fact, the majority of neonates with HSV are born to mothers without a history, symptoms, or risk factors for HSV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811426476">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neonatal HSV is classified into 3 categories: SEM (skin, eyes and mouth), CNS, and disseminated disease. SEM infections are most common, occurring in 45% of cases. Lesions become evident in the first 2 weeks of life, peaking at 6 to 12 days, unusual after 24 days but can manifest up to 42 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811426476">7</xref></sup> CNS disease occurs in 33% of neonatal HSV. Infection occurs through retrograde viral spread through the nasopharynx, but it can also result from hematogenous spread in disseminated disease or progression of SEM disease. Clinical manifestations of CNS disease include seizures, lethargy, poor feedings, fever, and irritability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811426476">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref></sup> Classic CSF findings include normal or decreased glucose, mildly elevated protein and mononuclear pleocytosis with increased red blood cell count in approximately 25% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811426476">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>While definitive diagnosis of disseminated and SEM disease is usually made with viral culture, CSF may be culture negative in isolated CNS disease. Therefore, the gold standard for diagnosing localized CNS HSV is DNA PCR of CSF fluid, found to be highly sensitive and specific, with values of 80% and 71%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811426476">8</xref></sup> It is now recommended to obtain CSF for HSV-PCR on initial presentation if there is any concern for HSV meningitis in neonates and infants younger than 42 days.</p>
<p>Further diagnostic studies for CNS disease include imaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Of these the most sensitive and specific is an MRI. Because HSV encephalitis is a highly destructive process, MRI demonstrates a wide range of findings including edema, hemorrhage, and destructive lesions of the temporal and less commonly parietal or frontal regions of the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref></sup> Further complicating diagnosis, CSF, EEG, and brain imaging may be normal early in the disease. Given the high morbidity and mortality of HSV neonatal CNS disease, HSV PCR, and initial empiric treatment with acyclovir is recommended in all cases of neonatal sepsis, aseptic meningitis, or meningoencephalitis without a known source pending results of the CNS PCR.</p>
<p>Disseminated disease occurs in 25% of neonatal HSV involving any combination of the CNS, skin, eye, liver, lungs, and adrenal glands. Patients usually present in the first 2 weeks of life with signs of sepsis, hyperbilirubememia, hemorrhagic pneumonitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, or respiratory distress. CNS involvement, including meningoencephalitis, occurs in up to 75% of disseminated disease and mortality in untreated cases is 80% to 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811426476">7</xref></sup> Treatment of neonatal HSV is acyclovir, 60 mg/kg/d divided every 8 hours, 14 days for SEM disease and 21 days for CNS and disseminated disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is currently a difference of opinion as to the value of a repeat CSF HSV-PCR following treatment to confirm the elimination of viral antigen. Some have suggested that a CSF PCR following antiviral treatment may be a prognostic indicator of long-term outcome. A study by Domingues et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811426476">9</xref></sup> directly correlated the amount of persistent CSF viral antigen with severity of disease and outcome at 3 months in a cohort of 16 patients with HSV disease. Another study by Kimberlin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811426476">8</xref></sup> demonstrated that 18 of 19 infants with detectable PCR viral antigen in the CSF following treatment died or had severe neurologic impairment within 1 year. However, other studies have failed to confirm a correlation with persistence of HSV viral antigen following treatment and long-term prognosis. A study by Revello et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811426476">10</xref></sup> in 26 patients with HSV encephalitis failed to correlate initial viral load or presence of posttreatment viral antigen with prognosis or severity of disease. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the prognostic value of posttreatment CSF HSV-PCR testing. It is important to note that posttreatment HSV-PCR, if performed, is suggested for prognosis only and not as a test to continue antiviral therapy in positive patients. To date, there are no studies to suggest increasing antiviral length of therapy; nor are there studies to suggest increased dosing based either on initial or on follow-up viral load.</p>
<p>In our case, the patient likely had CNS disease secondary to perinatal transmission from an asymptomatic maternal carrier. The mother lacked a history or risk factors for HSV and there were no lesions or signs of HSV during labor. Given that the majority of neonatal HSV infections occur in asymptomatic mothers, diagnosis can be difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811426476">6</xref></sup> Diagnosis was delayed because of a positive GBS screen not adequately treated during labor and delivery. In the first 30 days of life, the most common causes of meningitis are GBS, <italic>Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and other Gram-negative bacilli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811426476">11</xref></sup> Therefore, GBS was a reasonable etiology for this patient’s CNS symptoms and MRI findings. However, it is difficult to distinguish between bacterial meningitis and HSV meningoencephalitis with brain imaging as these diseases often have similar findings on MRI. Further complicating diagnosis, this patient had an initial blood culture Gram stain reported as Gram-positive cocci. Subsequently, the culture was reported to be coagulase negative <italic>S epidermidis</italic>, a common skin flora contaminant. Caution should be used when diagnosing sepsis or CNS infection based on initial blood Gram stains as normal flora contamination is a common laboratory finding.</p>
<p>CSF analysis is the most consistent and accurate method of distinguishing between underlying etiologies of meningitis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811426476">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811426476">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811426476">13</xref></sup> Our patient had classic CSF findings of viral CNS diseases, including normal glucose, increased protein, and lymphocyte/monocyte pleocytosis. Additionally, the initial CBC demonstrated lymphocytosis as opposed to neutrophilia seen in bacterial meningitis. In a meningitic neonate with conflicting history, imaging, and CSF results, HSV infection must be considered in the differential and empiric acyclovir administered until definitive diagnosis is determined. Empiric acyclovir has minimal side effects and significantly improves mortality in cases of neonatal HSV infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811426476">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811426476">4</xref></sup></p>
