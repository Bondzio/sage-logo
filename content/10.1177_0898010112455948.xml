<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This pilot study tested the effects of a 3-minute slow-stroke back massage (SSBM) on total minutes of nighttime sleep on persons with dementia with sleep disturbances aged 65 years or older in the nursing home. <bold>Design:</bold> Pilot randomized controlled trial. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were randomized to an intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) who received the 3-minute SSBM or a usual care control condition group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) who received usual bedtime care. Forty-eight hours of actigraphy data was recorded and analyzed on sleep variables at baseline and postintervention. <bold>Findings:</bold> Descriptive statistics showed a 36-minute increase on minutes of nighttime sleep in the SSBM intervention group (46.1 minutes) compared with the control group (10.32 minutes). Analysis of covariance did not reveal significant differences between the intervention and control groups on minutes of nighttime sleep, <italic>F</italic>(1, 37) = 1.90, <italic>p</italic> = .18, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .05, or on other sleep variables. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Dose-finding studies are needed to determine the duration of SSBM for sleep promotion. Findings from this pilot study suggest that SSBM may be an effective nursing intervention for sleep in persons with dementia in the nursing home, but further testing is needed to provide definitive results.</p>

<p>Disturbed sleep is a common problem for institutionalized persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112455948">Ancoli-Israel, Clopton, Klauber, Fell, &amp; Mason, 1997</xref>). The National Commission of Sleep Disorders Research estimates that 20.4% of nursing home admissions may be attributed to sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112455948">S. Martin, Aikens, &amp; Chervin, 2004</xref>). Substantial physiological and psychological stressors are associated with sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112455948">Morin, Rodrigue, &amp; Ivers, 2003</xref>) for frail persons with dementia in the nursing home. Once admitted into a nursing home, sleep patterns often worsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112455948">Middelkoop, Kerkhof, Smilde-van den Doel, Ligthart, &amp; Kamphuisen, 1994</xref>). Fragmented sleep with daytime drowsiness deteriorates cognitive and functional abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112455948">Ohayon &amp; Vecchierini, 2002</xref>). The consequences of untreated sleep disturbances also include limited social interaction, caregiver stress, and increased morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112455948">Ancoli-Israel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112455948">Foley, Ancoli-Israel, Britz, &amp; Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112455948">J. L. Martin et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112455948">Ouslander et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010112455948">Pollak, Perlick, Linsner, Wenston, &amp; Hsieh, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the widespread use of sedative hypnotics, two thirds of persons in the nursing home continue to experience sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112455948">National Institutes of Health, 2005</xref>). Adverse side effects of sedating medications include falls, decreased cognition, daytime drowsiness, respiratory depression, and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112455948">Glass, Lanctot, Herrmann, Sproule, &amp; Busto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112455948">Hollbrook, Crowther, Lotter, Cheng, &amp; King, 2000</xref>). The marginal benefits associated with long-term use of psychotropic drugs for sleep disturbances do not justify the risk of adverse drug reactions and other side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112455948">Glass et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112455948">Hollbrook et al., 2000</xref>) in persons with dementia. Slow-stroke back massage (SSBM) is a traditional nursing intervention with few side effects that may be used to improve sleep disturbances in persons with dementia. Most of the research on SSBM and persons with dementia is limited to the effects of relaxation and dates from 1987 to 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112455948">Harris &amp; Richards, 2010</xref>). Currently, there are no research studies using objective measures for sleep on the effects of SSBM and persons with dementia in the nursing home. Current research is therefore needed to identify effective nonpharmacological interventions such as massage that can improve sleep and quality of life in persons with dementia in the nursing home.</p>
<p>SSBM is a nonpharmacological intervention used primarily as a relaxation technique. It is characterized by long, slow, gliding, repetitive strokes from the sacral to cervical regions of the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112455948">Labyak &amp; Metzger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112455948">Richards, 1998</xref>). Although evidence of its effectiveness is sparse, SSBM has been used since the time of Florence Nightingale to relieve stress and promote sleep. It has few contraindications or side effects.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that SSBM modifies stress associated with chronic physiological and psychological illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112455948">Corley, Ferriter, Zeh, &amp; Gifford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455948">Fakouri &amp; Jones, 1987</xref>) in persons with dementia, and studies have documented the effects of massage on relaxation in institutionalized persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112455948">Corley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455948">Fakouri &amp; Jones, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112455948">Fraser &amp; Kerr, 1993</xref>). The 3-minute protocol used in this study was based on experimental studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455948">Fakouri and Jones (1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112455948"><italic>n</italic></xref> = 18) and Corely et al. (1995; <italic>n</italic> = 19) who pioneered the use of a 3-minute SSBM protocol for relaxation in the nursing home. The technique can be administered safely by trained nursing staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112455948">Daybreak Geriatric Massage Institute, 2006</xref>). However, no research has examined the use of SSBM to improve sleep in nursing home residents with dementia.</p>
<p>Therefore, this pilot study tested the effects of a 3-minute SSBM on the sleep of persons with dementia with sleep disturbances in the nursing home. The primary aim was to compare the effects of a 3-minute SSBM with a usual care/control condition on total minutes of nighttime sleep. Secondary aims were to compare the effects of SSBM and a usual care/control condition on minutes of sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and daytime inactivity.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that through relaxation, SSBM could reduce allostatic load from physiological and psychological stress associated with dementia. Specifically, it was anticipated that tactile stimulation from SSBM would activate the mechanoreceptors that transmit nerve impulses along the spinothalamic tract. Neuroreceptors increase parasympathetic activity and inhibit sympathetic nervous stimulation, causing a decrease in vital signs that result in a relaxation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112455948">Lawton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010112455948">Vgontzas et al., 2001</xref>). Relaxation would decrease presleep hyperarousals and increase minutes of nighttime sleep, decrease sleep latency, increase sleep efficiency, and decrease daytime inactivity, all of which are associated with restorative sleep.</p>

<sec id="section2-0898010112455948">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This randomized controlled pilot study compared the effects of a 3-minute SSBM and a usual/care control condition on minutes of nighttime sleep of persons with dementia with sleep disturbance. Actigraphy was used as an objective measure of sleep. Forty-eight hours of actigraphy were used to determine preintervention baseline sleep disturbances. Participants with less than 420 minutes of nighttime sleep were included in the study. An additional 48 hours of actigraphy data were collected post intervention for both groups. All participants in the SSBM intervention and usual/care control condition groups received usual bedtime care such as dressing, toileting, and medication administration at bedtime by the usual caregivers. No changes in the physical setting, nursing services, staffing patterns, medications, or patient care protocols were instituted as part of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010112455948">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>All participants were from four nursing homes located in rural Southeastern United States communities. Combined, the facilities had an occupancy of 504 beds with few private rooms. The facilities were similar in demographics, socioeconomic levels, admission criteria, and Medicare beds. The facilities complied with the state minimum staffing requirements, with a staff-to-resident ratio of 1:9 on the evening shift and 1:14 on the night shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112455948">Tilly, Black, Ormond, &amp; Harvell, 2003</xref>). Nightly routines were similar in all facilities. Bedtime routines began at 6:00 p.m. and included evening snacks, medication administration, and incontinence care for most residents. Twenty-three participants were from one nursing facility (15 in intervention group, 8 in control group). The remaining 17 participants were from the other three facilities (5 in intervention group; 12 in control group). SSBM was not practiced in any of the facilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010112455948">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria for the study were the following: (a) English speaking, (b) age 65 years or older, (c) a chart diagnosis of dementia from the medical record, (d) the ability to follow simple commands, (e) resident of the facility for more than 90 days, and (f) sleep disturbance, defined as less than 7 hours (420 minutes) of nighttime sleep determined by an average of 48 hours of actigraphy data. This study used 7 hours of nighttime sleep as the cut point for “poor sleepers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112455948">Ancoli-Israel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112455948">Carskadon &amp; Dement, 2005</xref>). Exclusion criteria were the following: (a) an unstable medical condition; (b) an integumentary condition such as herpes zoster, sutures, decubitus ulcer, or rash that would interfere with the SSBM; and (c) vertebral fracture or recent fall.</p>
<p>After approval by the university institutional review board, nursing staff provided the medical directors from each facility with a list of possible participants based on the inclusion criteria. The medical directors selected 146 potential participants from the list and, letters for recruitment and authorization to release health information were sent to the legal authorized representatives by certified mail. There were 86 responses to the 146 letters, and 59% expressed interest in having the resident’s chart reviewed for eligibility. Participants were recruited from June 2008 through January 2009. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010112455948">Figure 1</xref> gives the participant flowchart.</p>

<p>The MacArthur Competency Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112455948">Appelbaum &amp; Grisso, 2001</xref>) was used to assess the capacity to provide informed consent of nursing home residents and legal authorized representatives. Residents who met the initial eligibility criteria and showed decision-making capacity provided written informed consent. For those with insufficient capacity to provide consent, the legal authorized representative provided written informed consent.</p>
<p>The first author reviewed the chart for changes in condition, recorded vital signs, and administered the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) to determine level of cognition. Then 48 hours of baseline actigraphy data were collected. Participants sleeping less than 7 hours (420 minutes) based on actigraphy data were randomly assigned to treatment versus control. The Number Crunching Statistical Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112455948">Hintze, 2005</xref>) was used to generate a table of random numbers and a randomization schedule for the allocation sequence as participants were enrolled in the study.</p>
<p>Out of the 146 letters, 34% provided informed consent, but 12% of the consents did not meet the inclusion criterion of less than 7 hours of nighttime sleep, 4% withdrew before baseline data was completed, 2% died after completing baseline data collection, and 2% withdrew during treatment due to inability to tolerate the actigraph. Participants’ ages ranged from 75 to 101 years (mean age ± standard deviation = 86.15 ± 6.49). When participants withdrew from the study, they were replaced by the next consented participant until a total of 40 were enrolled. Of those who completed the study, 32 were females and 8 were males. One participant was African American. Demographic data, medical diagnoses, medical history, and medications were collected via chart abstracting.</p>
<sec id="section5-0898010112455948">
<title>Variables and their measurement</title>
<p>The MicroMini Motionlogger actigraph model from Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., was used to collect data on the sleep variables. The Motionlogger is a small device about the size of a wristwatch that records physical movement. The device uses a zero crossing algorithm to determine the intensity of movement every 1 minute.</p>
<p>All participants wore the Micromini Motionlogger for 48 hours during baseline data collection. Prior to the evening of the baseline data collection, the author secured the motionlogger with a hospital bracelet as a reminder to prevent accidental removal. The actigraph was placed on the nondominant wrist or on the opposite extremity in the case of a flaccid extremity or participant preference. The actigraph was worn during bathing and activities of daily living. The participant was monitored by the facility nurses for circulation and skin breakdown. The actigraph was removed by the author after 48 hours of data collection was completed. The actigraph data were averaged and analyzed using the Ambulatory Monitoring Software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112455948">ACT Millennium, 2006</xref>), which determines whether each 1-minute epoch represents a period of wake or sleep.</p>
<p>If the participant was determined to sleep less than 420 minutes (7 hours), the participant was randomized to a SSBM intervention group or a usual care/control group. The same procedure was followed as described for the baseline data collection. The actigraph was reapplied for an additional 48 hours. After data collection was completed, the author removed the actigraph. The 48 hours of actigraph data for both groups was averaged and analyzed in the same manner as the baseline data to calculate the postintervention results on sleep variables.</p>
<p>Data were collected on variables for nighttime sleep, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and daytime inactivity. Nighttime sleep was defined as the total minutes of sleep during the usual bedtime to usual rise time for each participant, as reported by the nursing assistant. Sleep latency was the minutes from lights out to sleep onset. Sleep efficiency was defined as the percentage of time the participant spent in bed asleep. Wake after sleep onset was defined as the minutes of time awake after falling asleep. Daytime inactivity was used to describe the minutes of inactivity from the participant’s usual rise time to usual bedtime interval. The term <italic>daytime inactivity</italic> was used because the actigraphy software for analyzing data is unable to distinguish between sleep and quiet wakefulness.</p>

<sec id="section6-0898010112455948">
<title>Slow-stroke back massage intervention</title>
<p>Participants randomized to the SSBM intervention group received a 3-minute SSBM at bedtime for two nights. All SSBM interventions were performed in the participant’s room by the first author, a certified geriatric advanced practice nurse trained in SSBM at the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112455948">Daybreak Geriatric Massage Institute (2006)</xref>. A 3-minute protocol for SSBM was used because when vital signs were measured in previous studies, 3 minutes of SSBM were sufficient to produce a relaxation response in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112455948">Corley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455948">Fakouri &amp; Jones, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112455948">Holland &amp; Pokorny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112455948">Meek, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Nursing assistants assigned to the participant’s care performed usual bedtime care, including medications, bathing, and toileting. After the participant completed the usual care and was ready to go to sleep, the first author adjusted lighting and room temperature, carefully inspected the participant’s back for lesions, and helped the participant to a comfortable position. Then she performed the 3-minute SSBM. She used her palms and fingers to perform the massage, beginning at the sacral region, progressing upward to the cervical region and then back to the sacral region using 12 to 15 long, slow, circular strokes per minute for 3 minutes (±15 seconds). A watch with illuminated hands was used so that she could read the time in the dark. Conversation was kept at a minimum. At the conclusion of the intervention, the first author left the room quietly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010112455948">
<title>Usual care control condition</title>
<p>Participants randomized to the control group received usual bedtime care from the facility staff, including medications, bathing, and toileting. Control group participants and those who were ineligible for randomization were offered a one-time, 3-minute SSBM treatment at the conclusion of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010112455948">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests for descriptive statistics were used to examine group equivalence on age, gender, ethnicity, and MMSE. To examine differences between the SSBM intervention and the control group, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on minutes of nighttime sleep was performed using baseline minutes of nighttime sleep as the covariate. Assumptions for continuity, independence, random sampling, missing data, outliers normality, and homoscedasticity were met. The homogeneity of regression slopes was checked using a scatter plot, and the regression slopes were reasonably close to parallel. An ANCOVA was also used to test the effects of massage on sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and daytime inactivity, using each baseline sleep variable as the covariate.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 40; 20 in each group) from four nursing homes were randomly assigned to treatment (a 3-minute SSBM) or usual care control. Chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests revealed no differences between the intervention and control groups on age, gender, or ethnicity. Means and standard deviations on MMSE scores were 8.15 ± 6.83, range 0 to 21 for the SSBM intervention group and 13.35 ± 7.18, range 1 to 26 for the control group. There was a significant difference in MMSE scores between the SSBM intervention and control groups. The mean MMSE score for all participants was 10.58 ± 7.31, indicating moderate stages of dementia. The most common medical diagnoses were Alzheimer’s dementia (50%), vascular dementia (15%), Parkinson’s dementia (2.5%), mixed dementia (2.5%), dementia not otherwise specified (30%), depression (62.5%), anxiety (55%), and arthritis (45%). Sedating medications included antidepressants (57.5%), antianxiety medications (27.5%), antipsychotics (47.5%), and mood stabilizers (20%).

<p>However, this study revealed clinical significance for SSBM as an intervention for persons with dementia and sleep disturbance in the nursing home. Means and standard deviations showed greater improvement from baseline to posttreatment for the SSBM intervention group than the control group in the descriptive statistics. For example, total nighttime sleep improved by 46.1 minutes in the SSBM intervention group and only 10.32 minutes in the control group, a difference of 36 minutes. Sleep efficiency increased by 13.8% in the SSBM intervention group and by 9.7 % in the control group, a 4.1% greater increase.</p>
<p>According to reports by the nursing assistants, the time from usual bedtime to usual rise time was 10 hours or longer for 80% of the participants in this study. Only two participants spent between 7 and 8 hours in bed for the purpose of sleeping. In all facilities, 50% of participants were in bed before 8:00 p.m. and 32.5% were awake before 6:00 a.m. The long intervals in bed may have contributed to poor sleep and were reflected in the large values for sleep latency and wake after sleep onset.</p>
<p>Subjective reports by participants indicated a positive response to the SSBM. One participant with considerable aphasia said plainly, “That feels good.” Other subjective reports included, “This is better than the old massages [old-time massages]. It is the way you do it [massage]. You put your hand on my back and loved me a little bit. I liked that.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The 3-minute SSBM is a nonpharmacological intervention that may improve nighttime sleep of persons with dementia in the nursing home without the adverse side effects of psychotropic medications. Although in this pilot the intervention group did not show significant differences in sleep improvement between the intervention group and the control group, the increase in nighttime sleep from baseline to post was 36 minutes greater in the SSBM intervention group than in the control group. Establishing SSBM as a part of bedtime routines may be one strategy for sleep promotion in persons with dementia with sleep disturbances.</p>
<p>It is possible that the response to the SSBM intervention for sleep may have been blunted in this sample by neurodegenerative changes associated with disease progression. Future studies could control for this differences by narrowing the range for MMSE scores in the inclusion criteria to target the SSBM intervention to a specific stage of dementia.</p>
<p>A comparable study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112455948">Richards, Beck, O’Sullivan, &amp; Shue, 2005</xref>) on the effects of social activities on persons with dementia in the nursing home, a secondary analysis showed that 40% of participants experienced 7 hours or more nighttime sleep. When data on sleep efficiency was analyzed on sleep efficiency less than 50% on participants in the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) compared with the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 30) showed statistically results for the social activities intervention on sleep variables, including less daytime sleep, day/night sleep ratio, falling asleep faster, and fewer nighttime awakenings. The 7 hours of nighttime sleep used as the cutoff for baseline screening in this study may also need to be reduced to 5 hours. When descriptive statistics were analyzed on the subgroup (<italic>n</italic> = 31) in this sample who slept less than 5 hours, results showed a mean of 246 ± 127.9 minutes of nighttime sleep postintervention in the SSBM group (<italic>n</italic> = 16) and 173.13 ± 126.1 minutes in the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 15). That is participants in the SSBM group slept 67.16 minutes longer than those in the control group. Thus, participants with poorer sleep/wake patterns may show a greater response to the SSBM intervention.</p>
<p>Randomization and reports by the nursing staff on usual bedtimes and rise times were used to remove bias by the first author who performed the study. However, these reports often failed to correlate with the actigraph data, and routines were subject to changes in the schedules and staffing of the facility. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112455948">Littner et al., 2003</xref>) recommends the use of sleep diaries in conjunction with actigraphy data. Sleep assessment data including usual bedtimes and rise times recorded by a research assistant or nursing assistant may increase the accuracy of the data on time spent in bed, usual rise times, bedtimes, awakenings, and artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112455948">Littner et al., 2003</xref>). Data could be documented in the chart or with vital signs.</p>
<p>The decision to use a 3 minute SSBM in this study was based on two published studies using a 3-minute SSMB protocol in the nursing home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112455948">Corley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112455948">Fakouri &amp; Jones, 1987</xref>). The duration of the SSBM, however, requires further investigation. No studies used objective measures to measure the effects of SSBM on sleep in persons with dementia in the nursing home. Three to five minutes is a reasonable time frame for facilitating a bedtime routine in almost any nursing home setting.</p>
<p>Feasibility for dose response studies for SSBM with larger sample sizes that include more control over the environment for nighttime disturbances need to be piloted and further investigated as an intervention for persons with dementia and sleep disturbances. SSBM is reimbursable by Medicare and some insurance companies for certain diagnoses. Although SSBM is typically based on 30- or 60-minute intervals because of payment for massage therapists, feasibility for dose response studies for SSBM are needed. This pilot study could be replicated using larger sample sizes and further investigation of the dose of SSBM as an intervention for persons with dementia and sleep disturbances. Data for results on sleep variables need to be collected using objective measures for sleep, such as actigraphy. Nurses could be taught to use SSBM as an intervention for sleep in persons with dementia.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112455948">Office of Inspector General, 2001</xref>) in the <italic>State Operations Manual</italic>, S<italic>ection F329</italic> recommend aggressive reductions in psychotropic medications and the use of nonpharmacological therapies for sleep in persons with dementia in the nursing home. In this study, more than 50% of the participants in all facilities took potentially sedating medications. Studies have shown, however, that persons with dementia in the nursing home taking psychotropic medications, antipsychotics, or benzodiazepines do not have any better nighttime sleep than those who do not take medications for sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112455948">Simpson, Richards, Enderlin, O’Sullivan, &amp; Koehn, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0898010112455948">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Although descriptive and anecdotal findings from this pilot study provide some support for the utility of SSBM to promote sleep in persons with dementia in the nursing home, the study had several limitations. The short duration of data collection may have influenced results on nighttime sleep and exploratory sleep variables. Dose finding studies are needed to determine the frequency and duration for massage protocols to improve sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends collection of actigraphy data for a minimum of three consecutive 24-hour periods of actigraphy data with the use of sleep diaries to obtain reliable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112455948">Littner et al., 2003</xref>). One study in community dwelling older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112455948">Rowe et al., 2008</xref>) showed that 14 days may be needed for more accurate results on sleep variables. Future studies with larger funding sources are needed to collect 3 to 14 consecutive days of actigraphy with observation by the research team to keep reliable sleep diaries on baseline and intervention data.</p>
<p>In this study, there was no control over nighttime routines. Sleep was hindered by environmental factors common in nursing homes. Nightly schedules for turning residents in bed, incontinence care, and other nursing tasks increased nighttime activity. Roommates with different bedtime schedules, televisions, and hallway noise also hindered sleep. SSBM may be more effective if used as a part of a multicomponent intervention that includes bright light therapy, relaxing music, social activities, and interventions to promote a more relaxing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112455948">J. L. Martin, Marler, Harker, Josephson, &amp; Alessi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112455948">Richards et al., 2005</xref>). The study should be tested on persons with less than 5 hours of total minutes of nighttime baseline sleep.</p>
<p>Because nighttime care is performed by nursing assistants, future studies should test the implementation of SSBM by nursing assistants who perform usual care on persons with dementia in the nursing home. This could remove bias by the researcher and test the feasibility of translating the SSBM intervention into practice the bedside.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provided support for the feasibility of the 3-minute SSBM intervention and provided some indication that SSBM may be an effective intervention to facilitate sleep among cognitively impaired older adults with dementia.</p>
