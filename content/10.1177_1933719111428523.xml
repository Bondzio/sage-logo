<abstract>
<p>The outer layer of the human placenta is the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast is formed by the fusion of mononuclear cytotrophoblasts, and aged syncytiotrophoblast nuclei are extruded into the maternal blood as membrane-enclosed “syncytial nuclear aggregates” that are then eliminated from the maternal circulation. Apoptosis proteins are hypothesized to be involved in both of these processes, but the mechanism of death in the syncytiotrophoblast is unclear and death processes in this multinucleated layer are likely to differ from related processes in mononuclear cells. We have used a combination of villous explant culture and immunohistochemical staining of semi-serial sections from the explants to study the changing expression of 4 proteins that are markers of apoptotic processes in first-trimester human placentae. These studies show that Bcl-2 expression is limited to the syncytiotrophoblast and syncytial nuclear aggregates, while conversely Bax is expressed in some cytotrophoblasts. Activated caspase 3 and the M30 cytokeratin neoepitope were localized to isolated regions of the syncytiotrophoblast and some syncytial nuclear aggregates but were never present in the same area. Combining our results with those of others, we suggest a refined scheme whereby proteins of the apoptosis cascade participate in both the processes of syncytial formation and death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Placental villous trophoblast is the transport barrier between mother and fetus. The outer layer of this barrier is the syncytiotrophoblast, which is in direct contact with maternal blood. The syncytiotrophoblast is a continuous layer of cytoplasm and nuclei that is formed and expanded by fusion of the underlying mononuclear cytotrophoblasts. Under physiologic circumstances, aged syncytiotrophoblast nuclei are extruded into the maternal circulation as membrane-enclosed “syncytial nuclear aggregates” that are subsequently “embolized” to the maternal lungs before being eliminated.<sup>

</sup> It has been reported that syncytial nuclear aggregates undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) before entering the maternal circulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111428523">3</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111428523"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111428523">6</xref>
</sup> In most cells, apoptosis involves a characteristic series of events including cytoskeletal and membrane lipid rearrangements, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation and culminates in the extrusion of intracellular contents in membrane-enclosed blebs called apoptotic bodies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428523">7</xref>
</sup> The process is often, but not always, mediated by a group of proteases called caspases and is characterized by changes in the expression of regulatory proteins such as the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic Bax.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111428523">8</xref>
</sup> However, as the syncytiotrophoblast is multinucleated, the process of cell death is likely to be somewhat different to analogous processes in mononuclear cells. In the syncytiotrophoblast, large multinucleated fragments called syncytial nuclear aggregates are shed from the layer into the maternal blood, and it has been suggested that syncytial nuclear aggregates may be the equivalent of apoptotic blebs in the syncytiotrophoblast.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111428523">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428523">9</xref>
</sup> Studying the role of apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblast death is further complicated by the growing acceptance that proteins of the cellular apoptosis machinery also assist in the differentiation of some cell types. In particular, apoptosis proteins appear to be involved in the process by which mononuclear cytotrophoblasts fuse to form new regions of syncytiotrophoblast.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111428523">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111428523">11</xref>
</sup> Understanding the nature of the cell death in the syncytiotrophoblast is important as it has been reported that cells that die by apoptosis are phagocytosed and eliminated without generating an inflammatory response, whereas cells dying by necrosis generate inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111428523">12</xref></sup> Confirming this is also true of dead trophoblasts, we have recently shown that the phagocytosis of apoptotic syncytial nuclear aggregates, or trophoblast debris, leads macrophages to adopt an anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive phenotype,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428523">13</xref>
</sup> while others have shown that phagocytosis of apoptotic trophoblasts induces macrophages to produce cell survival factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428523">14</xref>
</sup> In normal pregnancy, vast numbers of syncytial nuclear aggregates are eliminated from the maternal circulation without generating an inflammatory response, but there is evidence of increased syncytial shedding in preeclampsia, a disease that is characterized by an intensified maternal inflammatory response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111428523">15</xref>
</sup> As aberrant maternal responses to syncytial nuclear aggregates and/or other trophoblast debris could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, it is important to understand the processes controlling the nature and extent of cell death in the syncytiotrophoblast.</p>
<p>In order to explore the involvement of proteins of the apoptotic cascade in the life cycle of syncytiotrophoblast and gain a better understanding of the dynamic processes involved in normal pregnancy, we studied the changes over time in the localization of several apoptosis-related proteins in villous cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast using a villous explant model. Our findings confirm the suggestion that apoptosis-related proteins are involved in regulating the life cycle of trophoblasts.</p>

<title>Explant Culture</title>
<p>Sixteen placentae (12 weeks of gestation) were obtained following elective surgical termination of pregnancy (TOP). The gestational age of all pregnancies prior to TOP were confirmed by ultrasound measurement of crown-rump length. The viability of the pregnancies was confirmed by detection of a fetal heart by ultrasound. Placental tissues were washed thoroughly with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Triplicate explants of ∼400 mg wet weight were washed thoroughly with sterile PBS, pH 7.4 and cultured in Net-well (400 µmol/L mesh; ProSciTech, Australia) supported in 12-well culture plates (Greinerbio-one CELL STAR, Ray Lab, Auckland, New Zealand) containing 3 mL of complete trophoblast medium. The complete trophoblast medium contained Dulbecco modified Eagles medium salts/F12 (DME/F12; Life Technologies, Auckland, New Zealand) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 5 µg/mL insulin, 10 µg/mL transferin, 100 µg/mL L-glutamate, 20 nmol/L sodium selenite, 400 U/L human chorionic gonadotropin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/L penicillin), pH 7.4. The explants were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air for up to 96 hours.</p>

<title>3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide Assay</title>
<p>Fresh placental tissues or explants cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours were incubated with 5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ([MTT] Sigma, Australia) in complete trophoblast medium at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air for 1 hour. Tissues/explants were washed twice with sterile PBS, pH 7.4 and liquid nitrogen was then used to freeze MTT-treated explants in cryoembedding medium (Biotek Scientific Supplies, Auckland, New Zealand). The frozen tissue blocks were cut into 5 µm serial sections using a cryostat (Leica CM 1900, BioLab Scientific, Auckland, New Zealand) and collected on glass slides (BioLab Scientific). Slides were fixed in 4% (weight/volume [w/v]) paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4 for 3 minutes at room temperature (RT) then coverslips were mounted immediately with Aqua-mount (Biotek Scientific Supplies) and the sections were visualized using a light microscope within 1 hour of fixing (Leitz, Germany). Images were captured using a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera and downloaded into Microsoft Photo Editor v3.0.2.3 (Microsoft, Seattle, Washington).</p>
<p>Additional sections were cut from the same blocks as used for the MTT assays and fixed with cold acetone (−20°C) for 10 minutes then left to air-dry for 1 hour. The acetone fixed sections were stored at −20°C until used for immunohistochemical staining.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical Staining</title>
<p>Fresh frozen tissue sections from placental tissues and explants cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours were thawed for 5 minutes at RT and were encircled with a Dako pen (DAKO, MedBio, New Zealand). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS-Tween for 10 minutes at RT. After 3 washes with PBS-Tween, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 10% normal goat serum in PBS-Tween as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111428523">Table 1</xref> for 1 hour at RT. The slides were then washed 3 times with PBS-Tween and the activity of endogenous peroxidase was quenched by the addition of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 5 minutes at RT. The slides were then washed 3 times with PBS-Tween. A Zymed Histostain-Plus kit (Zymed, San Francisco, California) containing biotinylated secondary antibody and enzyme conjugate was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amino ethyl carbolyl stain (Medbio, Christchurch, New Zealand) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were then washed with deionized water, immersed in hematoxylin nuclear stain (Surgipath; Australian Laboratory Services, Auckland, New Zealand) for 1 minute then washed with tap water and coverslips were mounted with Aquamount (Biotek Scientific Supplies).</p>

<title>Quantification</title>
<p>Sections stained for Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic protein), Bax (proapoptotic protein), M30 (trophoblast apoptosis), activated caspase 3 (apoptotic marker), and MTT (viability marker) were examined using a light microscope (Leitz) and digitally photographed. The area of villi in square millimeters was measured using Image J software. Sixteen placentae (each with fresh tissue and the 3 different explant culture conditions) were analyzed. The expression of these protein tissue explants was evaluated by examining 20 fields of villous tissue in each slide. Immunoreactivity with each protein was evaluated at high-power (×40) magnification, and the fields were obtained by systematic screening of the slide from one corner to the opposite. Only fields at least 80% covered by tissue were examined. The localization of positive cells was noted and categorized as being syncytiotrophoblast, syncytial nuclear aggregates, villous cytotrophoblasts or villous stromal cells. Villous cytotrophoblasts were defined as cellular structures containing a single nucleus and lying between the syncytiotrophoblast and villous stroma. Syncytial nuclear aggregates were defined as structures containing large aggregates of nuclei that protruded prominently from the syncytiotrophoblast into the intervillous space. The numbers of positive cells and syncytial nuclear aggregates were expressed as the number of positive cells/mm<sup>2</sup> of tissue. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide stained cells were examined in 20 fields of villous tissue from each slide using high-power (×40) magnification, and the fields were obtained by systematic screening of the slide in a grid pattern.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The end stage of the life cycle for the syncytiotrophoblast is widely considered to be the extrusion of apoptotic or proapoptotic nuclei and cytoplasm in structures called syncytial nuclear aggregates (sometimes called syncytial knots while some workers may use the phrase syncytial sprouts, but this term is confusing as true syncytial sprouts are sites at which new villi are generated).
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111428523">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111428523"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111428523">18</xref></sup> Studying the formation of new syncytiotrophoblast and the shedding of syncytial nuclear aggregates from the human placenta is difficult as obvious ethical considerations prevent the in vivo manipulation of this tissue while, interspecies differences mean that normal laboratory animal models are also of limited value in studying these processes, particularly as trophoblast shedding and deportation does not appear to occur in most other species.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111428523">19</xref>
</sup> Although there have been a number of previous studies examining the localization of apoptotic proteins in the placenta, most of these studies have been limited to studying expression patterns in tissue at a single time point <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111428523">10</xref>
</sup> or have focused on the role of an individual protein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111428523">11</xref>
</sup> Whereas, in this study we have used villous explant cultures to help develop an understanding of changing and dynamic processes that occur during the life cycle of syncytiotrophoblast by examining the expression of several apoptosis-related proteins over time. We have previously shown that villous explants shed syncytial nuclear aggregates in vitro and that the numbers of the shed nuclear aggregates that were apoptotic increased with increasing time in culture, such that, by 72 hours the majority of the shed syncytial nuclear aggregates were apoptotic, with approximately 5% of the shed nuclear aggregates remaining viable and a further 5% being necrotic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111428523">20</xref>
</sup> In this work, we have examined factors that may contribute to this apoptotic trophoblast shedding and have summarized the expression patterns of the apoptosis-related proteins studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1933719111428523">Figure 6</xref>. In agreement with others,<sup>

</sup> we have shown that expression of Bcl-2 is confined primarily to the syncytiotrophoblast layer in fresh placental tissue and have extended this finding to demonstrate that the levels of Bcl-2 in the syncytiotrophoblast drop as explants are cultured for increasing lengths of time. As the levels of Bcl-2 dropped in the syncytiotrophoblast (with increasing time in culture), the numbers of syncytial nuclear aggregates/mm<sup>2</sup> of syncytiotrophoblast increased, suggesting that Bcl-2 may be involved in preventing the formation of syncytial nuclear aggregates. Further support for this concept comes from our finding that, as the number of syncytial nuclear aggregates increased, caspase-3-positive/Bcl-2 negative were primarily activated, suggesting that as the culture continued the syncytial nuclear aggregates were increasingly apoptotic (or proapoptotic), and this mirrors our previous finding that the number of apoptotic syncytial nuclear aggregates shed from explants increases with increasing time in culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111428523">20</xref>
</sup> However, we found that in fresh tissue, the majority of syncytial nuclear aggregates stained positive for Bcl-2 confirming a previous suggestion that syncytial nuclear aggregates are proapoptotic rather than representing truly apoptotic structures<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111428523">3</xref>
</sup> and also demonstrating that the presence of Bcl-2 in itself is not adequate to prevent nuclei moving into syncytial nuclear aggregates. Therefore, our results suggest that Bcl-2 may be involved in limiting apoptosis in the syncytiotrophoblast but that other factors must also be involved in this process. Many other apoptosis inhibiting substances have been found in the trophoblast layers of the placenta including several members of the inhibitors of apoptosis or IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111428523">25</xref>
</sup> Potentially one or more of these factors may be involved, along with Bcl-2, in regulating syncytiotrophoblast death.</p>

<p>In clear contrast to the expression of Bcl-2, the proapoptotic protein Bax was expressed only in the cytotrophoblasts and was notably expressed in cytotrophoblasts underlying regions of the syncytiotrophoblast that did not express Bcl-2. We interpret this result to suggest that, as has been suggested by others, proteins of the apoptotic cascades are involved in the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblast and Bax appears to be involved in this process. One of the functions of Bax is to initiate the caspase cascade, and it was also interesting to note that Bax was not present in the vicinity of either activated caspase 3 or the M30 neoepitope in cytotrophoblasts. We believe that our finding that these proteins were not present in the same area of tissue in our specimens reflects differences in the temporal expression of these proteins, and we suggest the following sequence of events may occur. First, in the cytotrophoblasts, Bax disrupts mitochondrial function triggering the caspase cascade including the activation of caspase 3. The activated caspases induce changes in the cytotrophoblasts including cytoskeletal rearrangements resulting in the expression of the M30 neoepitope, but that these proteins were not present in the same area of tissue means that both Bax and the caspases must act and then be degraded rapidly. The cytotrophoblasts then fuse with the syncytiotrophoblast. This freshly produced syncytiotrophoblast then expresses Bcl-2 which along with other, as yet undefined antiapoptotic proteins, protect the syncytiotrophoblast from caspase-induced death. Declining levels of antiapoptotic proteins in the syncytiotrophoblast then led to the activation of fresh caspases that induce the “death” of regions of the syncytiotrophoblast that are finally extruded as syncytial nuclear aggregates. According to this scheme, M30 may be expressed in freshly fused syncytiotrophoblast, that is transferred from the fused cytotrophoblasts, as well as in aging syncytiotrophoblast. In contrast, caspase 3 must be generated in the syncytiotrophoblast and not transferred in its activated form from the cytotrophoblasts. Since those cytotrophoblasts which stained most strongly for Bax were underlying areas of the syncytiotrophoblast that did not express Bcl-2, we believe that aging regions of the syncytiotrophoblast are able to signal to the underlying cytotrophoblasts to commence the process leading to fusion that we have just described. We suggest this series of events based on our own results which build on those of others <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111428523">10</xref>
</sup> and note that scheme is simply a hazy outline of a very complex process. Many more proteins than we have studied are likely to be involved in this process, and we trust that others will continue to add to, and refine, this outline. Further it must be noted that the explants we studied were dying with increasing time in culture as indicated by the reduced amount of MTT metabolized by the explants as culture progressed. That the explants were dying must be borne in mind when considering the results of our study especially at the later time points.</p>
<p>Our results clearly demonstrate that the syncytiotrophoblast is a dynamic tissue and that neighboring villi and even regions within the same villus may strongly express quite different patterns of proteins. Over many years, we have found that immunohistochemically determined expression patterns of various proteins in the syncytiotrophoblast are “patchy” even when examining proteins, such as β-hCG, which are widely considered to be ubiquitously expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast. Given that the syncytiotrophoblast is a dynamic tissue with some regions representing freshly fused cytotrophoblast while other regions are nearing the end of their life cycle, we should not be surprised to find discontinuous expression of proteins in this dynamic cell layer. This may be especially true of proteins that are important in regulating the life cycle of the syncytiotrophoblast, and we note that others examining the expression patterns of apoptosis-related proteins have reported patchy staining.<sup>

</p>
<p>This study, along with similar immunohistochemistry studies, is limited in that we have been able to present results that represent only a snapshot in time of a process that is continuous in a dynamic and constantly changing cell layer. We have attempted to address this problem in part by studying cultured villous explants at various time points and by doing so we believe that we have moved from the single snapshot presented by previous studies to a series of these snapshots, much like a low-quality animated cartoon. However, much work remains to be done before we have clear and full understanding of the proteins and processes that regulate the life cycle of the syncytiotrophoblast.</p>
