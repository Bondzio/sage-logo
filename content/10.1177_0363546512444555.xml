<body>
<p>Over much of the past century, the marathon has been considered the pinnacle of endurance sports. The race has a storied past, taking its name from the mythical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512444555">14</xref></sup> run of Pheidippides in 490 BC. A herald, Pheidippides, ran from the Battle of Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory of Persia before collapsing and dying from exhaustion. In popular culture, the word “marathon” has come to mean “something characterized by great length or concentrated effort.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512444555">15</xref></sup> During the past decade, marathon running has increased, both in terms of the number of races held and the number of participants in these races. The 2010 Running USA annual report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512444555">23</xref></sup> estimates that there has been a 32% increase in the number of marathon finishers over the past decade.</p>
<p>Perhaps the recent increases in marathon popularity are partially because of increasing awareness of the health benefits gained from regular exercise. Numerous studies have demonstrated that physical exercise has beneficial effects on physical and mental health in addition to improving longevity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512444555">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512444555">18</xref></sup> Similarly, marathon running has been associated with decreased risks of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512444555">28</xref></sup> People who run regularly have been found to have lower rates of all-cause mortality and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512444555">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these benefits, marathon running sometimes adversely affects health. The yearly incidence of injury in people training for marathons has been reported to be as high as 90%, with the vast majority of these injuries being musculoskeletal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512444555">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512444555">7</xref></sup> There are demonstrable biochemical and physical signs of myocardial damage occurring acutely after running a marathon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512444555">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512444555">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512444555">17</xref></sup> People who undergo less intense premarathon training regimens have higher levels of cardiac injury biomarkers detected in the serum after a marathon when compared with those who train more intensely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512444555">10</xref></sup> With the recent increases in marathon popularity, there has been some concern that many of the newer marathon runners are less physically fit and less well trained,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512444555">29</xref></sup> possibly increasing their susceptibility to cardiac injury. Sudden death, most often due to cardiac events, sometimes occurs in marathon runners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512444555">20</xref></sup> Sudden death of a marathon participant has historically been described as rare, with previous studies reporting an incidence ranging from 1 per 50,000 to 1 per 126,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512444555">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512444555">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512444555">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512444555">21</xref></sup> However, recently, there has been increased media attention to marathon-related deaths, especially after the 7 deaths that occurred between half-marathon and marathon participants over a 6-week period in 2009.</p>
<p>Given the recent changes in marathon participation and public concern over the safety of marathon running, we sought to characterize trends in marathon participation and performance during the 2000-2009 time period and to re-evaluate the current incidence of sudden death in marathon participants over this decade.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512444555" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Marathons were selected from 3 of the most comprehensive running databases (determined by the number of races included): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MarathonGuide.com">MarathonGuide.com</ext-link>, Athlinks, and The Association of Road Racing Statisticians (ARRS). Only full marathons run in the United States during the years 2000-2009 were investigated to keep the search results finite, easily accessible, and accurate; half-marathons and international races were excluded. Redundant races among the databases were confirmed to be identical by comparing their dates, locations, and histories of name change and by checking the race’s Web site.</p>
<p>A 3-pronged approach was used to find information on mortalities that occurred during these marathons or within a 24-hour period after an event that was reported to have occurred during the marathon. First, LexisNexis, an Internet archival database with nearly 5 billion documents of source information, was searched for reports of marathon deaths in news headlines. The input consisted of the name of the marathon from the master list derived from the 3 databases and the terms “dea*” or “die*” or “fatal*” (asterisks yield all words with the initial letter sequence). Second, the Google search engine was searched by inputting the name of the marathon, the words “death” and “die” in individual searches per year, and the specific year. Third, race directors were contacted via e-mail or directly through that race’s Web site to inquire about mortalities. This last approach was limited by inaccurate or outdated contact information.</p>
<p>Marathon data collected from the databases included number of finishers per year, the gender split of participants, the top finishing times for men and women, and the average overall finishing time for each race. Only data from race finishers were incorporated into the ensuing analysis; comprehensive data from participants who did not finish the races were not reliably recorded or available. Races listed only in the ARRS database were not included in the results because of its listing of smaller races with incomplete data sets; this did not significantly affect the total number of participants per year. Races listed only in the ARRS database accounted for 12.3% of races that occurred during the year 2009, but only 0.3% of total finishers for that year. A similar result was observed in the year 2000. Additionally, there were no marathon deaths recorded in those ARRS races. Discrepancies in data between the 2 databases used for race times were resolved by assigning MarathonGuide.com to be the primary source of information; the MarathonGuide.com data set was determined to be most similar to results posted by individual race Web sites and therefore deemed more accurate.</p>
<p>The information collected on runners’ deaths included the name, date, location of the marathon in which the death occurred, age, gender, and cause of death of the runner. If documented in the media source, previous comorbidities and autopsy results of the runner were also collected. Marathon deaths confirmed only by a single news source were excluded (1 death). In addition, the race directors of those marathons that experienced participants’ deaths were contacted via e-mail to confirm those deaths. Because of the strict 24-hour window in the death search parameters, one death that resulted from an event that occurred during a race was excluded because the participant died after the time limit had passed. In this search process, data regarding runners treated or transported during marathon events were not universally and reliably recorded unless the participant died within this 24-hour time window.</p>
<p>A descriptive statistical analysis was first performed to summarize numbers of marathon races, marathon finishers, mean overall marathon finishing time, and mean top marathon finishing time by gender and study year. In addition, overall and gender-specific marathon death rates were calculated as the number of fatal cases divided by the number of participants during the stated specific time period. The summarized demographic and clinical characteristics of fatal marathon runners were presented as median and corresponding interquartile range for continuous variables and as percentage for category variables. Comparisons of fatality rates between male and female runners as well as fatality rates between months were performed by the Fisher exact test. Finally, an ordinary least-square regression model was performed to examine if there was a linear trend during 2000-2009 in average overall marathon finishing time, average top gender-specific finishing time, and overall and gender-specific fatality rate. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Marathon Details</title>
<p>During the study period from 2000 to 2009, a total of 3184 unique marathons were run with an overall number of 6341 races. The number of overall unique marathons increased every year from 2000 to 2009, ranging from 218 (6.9% of cumulative races in the 10-year period) in 2000 to 437 (13.7% of the total) in 2009. The total number of marathon finishers has increased over this decade from 299,018 in 2000 to 473,354 in 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512444555">Figure 1</xref>), an average increase of 17,434 per year.

<title>Marathon Deaths</title>
<p>Of 3,718,336 total marathon participants over the 10-year study period, we identified 28 people (6 women and 22 men) who died during the marathon race and up to 24 hours after finishing. The overall rate of death has not changed over this time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512444555">Figure 3</xref>). The overall, male, and female death rates for this 10-year period were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-1.13) deaths per 100,000 finishers (<italic>P</italic> value for 10-year trend, .860), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.48-1.36) deaths per 100,000 finishers (<italic>P</italic> value for 10-year trend, .533), and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.21-0.79) deaths per 100,000 finishers (<italic>P</italic> value for 10-year trend, .238), respectively. The relative risk of death was higher for men than for women, although this was not statistically significant (relative risk, 2.38; 95% CI, 0.96-5.87).</p>

<p>The median age of people who died was 41.5 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 25.5 years and an overall range from 22 to 68 years. Those less than 45 years (younger) comprised 50% (n = 14) of all deaths, and those ≥45 years (older) comprised 50% of deaths (n = 14). We did not have data on age distribution of the participants. Myocardial infarction/coronary atherosclerosis was the cause of death for 93% (n = 13) of older racers compared with 0% of younger racers. A variety of conditions caused death in younger racers, the most common being cardiac arrest not otherwise specified (21%, n = 3). Ninety-three percent of deaths among younger participants occurred after mile 20 compared with 36% for older participants.</p>
<p>The median distance that was traveled before a death occurred was 22.5 miles, with an IQR of 10.6 miles. Seven people (25%) completed the marathon before their deaths, and 64.3% of deaths (n = 18) occurred after reaching at least mile 20. Those who died before reaching mile 5 made up 14.3% of all deaths (n = 4). Cardiac and cardiovascular origins accounted for 86% (n = 24) of all deaths (myocardial infarction/coronary atherosclerosis = 13, cardiac arrest not otherwise specified = 4, cardiac arrhythmia = 1, prolapsed mitral valve = 2, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy = 2, coronary fibromuscular dysplasia = 1, heart failure = 1). Myocardial infarction/coronary atherosclerosis caused 46% (n = 13) of all deaths (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512444555">Table 1</xref>). Hyperthermia and a brain aneurysm caused 1 death each, and hyponatremia caused 2 deaths.</p>

<p>In this national study, we found that the death rate for marathon running over the past decade was largely unchanged at 0.75 per 100,000 finishers. Deaths in men continued to be more common than in women, although this was not statistically significant. The overall number of finishers has increased at a rate of 17,434 participants per year, without a change in the average race time. However, top times in men and women have increased slightly, with an average of 2:50:22 for men and 3:24:35 for women in 2009.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with recent studies and reports that describe growing participation in marathon running.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512444555">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512444555">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512444555">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512444555">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512444555">23</xref></sup> We initially had hypothesized that this increase in participation would be among less physically fit participants, resulting in higher average finishing times and marathon-associated deaths. This does not appear to be the case as both average finishing times and marathon death rates have remained unchanged. Other data, such as nonfinish rates or percentage of participants requiring medical assistance, would have provided more evidence to the physical fitness of the participants. Unfortunately, we did not have access to this information.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the average top finishing times have increased steadily over the past decade. This is likely because of the increase in the number of events, with smaller events that do not attract the elite athletes. It is less likely that performance among top athletes is declining. The top finishing times for the Boston Marathon have been improving over the past 10 years (2001, 2:09:43; 2006, 2:07:14; 2011, 2:03:02).</p>
<p>That deaths were more common in men than women is not surprising given that most deaths were related to cardiovascular disease. Male sex independently confers a 2-fold increase in the risk of coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512444555">11</xref></sup> Coronary artery disease has been documented to account for 73% of sudden cardiac deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512444555">27</xref></sup> in joggers and marathon runners, who commonly demonstrate myocardial injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512444555">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512444555">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512444555">17</xref></sup> Half the deaths occurred in relatively younger participants (&lt;45 years). We could not calculate the death rate among different age groups, but in the 2011 running of the Los Angeles Marathon, 74% of finishers were less than 45 years old (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://active.com">active.com</ext-link>). This suggests a lower death rate than would be expected if deaths were equally distributed among younger and older participants. As above, this is to be expected given the relationship between age and coronary artery disease. Nearly all deaths in older participants were caused by myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>The majority of deaths occurred in the latter half of the race or after the race finished, which has been previously observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512444555">20</xref></sup> For those deaths that occurred after the race where finishing time was available, all but 1 death occurred in participants achieving finishing times that were under the average race time for that race. These findings call into question whether improved conditioning and/or athleticism necessarily makes a difference in the mortality rate for racers who finish. Many authors have debated the need for potential cardiac risk screening in marathon runners.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512444555">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512444555"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512444555">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512444555">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512444555">26</xref></sup> Our results do not support premarathon screening to prevent death given the low/stable mortality, lack of criteria for predicting death, and potential costs of screening the large number of low-risk participants.</p>
<p>While recent media scrutiny surrounding marathon running<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512444555">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512444555">19</xref></sup> has questioned the activity’s safety, this study provides evidence that the risk of dying remains low and less than reported rates for jogging,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512444555">25</xref></sup> vigorous exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512444555">24</xref></sup> and participation in triathlons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512444555">8</xref></sup> While male marathon mortality rates for the years 2006 to 2008 (2.5, 1.6, and 1.6 per 100,000 finishers, respectively) were higher than the 1.5 deaths per 100,000 participants reported for triathlons during that time period, our study confirms the need for analysis over extended time periods to reduce misconceptions generated by anecdotal short-term spikes of increased marathon deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512444555">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effect of increased attention to safety risks on mortality is unclear. Recognition of environmental risks, such as heat, has led race directors to cancel or prematurely shut down even the largest marathons, notably the Chicago Marathon in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512444555">22</xref></sup> There has been a recent increase in availability of emergency medical response personnel as well as rapid defibrillators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512444555">6</xref></sup> The finding that the vast majority of deaths were not caused by acute, race-related preventable causes (eg, hyponatremia and hyperthermia) does not undermine the role of improved in-race safety support in treating and preventing progression of injuries.</p>
<p>Our study is the most comprehensive, primary evaluation of recent marathon running, yet it has limitations. Chief among them was the reliance on publicly available information, which potentially limited the accuracy of our data. While there exists a private registry for sudden deaths in athletes, there is no mandated central database that tracks all marathon races or types of deaths in marathons. For this reason, our team took a systematic approach to identifying the largest population of available races as well as a practical and redundant search process to identify all deaths. Furthermore, our search time period spanned the past decade, which likely aided in the availability and accessibility of mortality references in multiple media forms (eg, Internet and print). Additionally, deaths in marathon running have received heightened media attention, which may have improved the success of our search strategy. Second, we limited our study to full marathons (as opposed to half-marathons) and deaths within 24 hours of the race event. This reduced the number of deaths included but gave us a more homogeneous sample with higher reliability of data. Furthermore, the amount of expected training and strenuousness of a full marathon are significantly more than a half-marathon. Third, we were unable to measure the number and proportion of racers who did not complete the marathon. This is potentially an important measure of the physical fitness of marathon participants through this time period. Fourth, we lacked complete access to medical information. While the information gathered regarding cause of death was often described in public information, we frequently did not have access to medical history, which would have provided greater context for the cause of death. Despite these limitations, our study is the most up-to-date, primary evaluation of marathon running race data and of marathon mortality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our national study determined that while overall marathon participation has increased over the past 10 years, the average race times and mortality rate have remained constant. The majority of deaths continue to be cardiac related but do not appear in a predictable pattern. Marathons remain a safe endeavor, despite recent high-profile incidents.</p>
