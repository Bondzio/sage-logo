<p>Cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention can promote recovery, reduce coronary events and improve quality of life in many people with heart disease. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113477571">Evans et al., 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113477571">World Health Organization</xref> statistics (WHO, 2011) indicate that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death and disability in the world. WHO promotes three key messages to protect heart health:
<list id="list1-1744987113477571" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes every day of the week will help to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Eating at least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, and limiting your salt intake to less than one teaspoon a day, also helps to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In 2009, a focus edition of the <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> highlighted the efficacy and complexity of cardiac rehabilitation. Papers in this edition demonstrated that the successes of policy interventions to improve outcomes for cardiac patients were confounded by a range of factors. Relative to the weight of evidence of the efficacy cardiac rehabilitation, programmes were under-resourced, had low referral rates and uptake was poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113477571">Thompson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There was recognition that ‘one size does not fit all’ and there was a need for innovative approaches to the design and delivery of programmes that work within the diversity of client circumstance. In addition, it was acknowledged that the researching and evaluating of such programmes poses significant methodological challenges in the midst of such complexity.</p>
<p>Secondary prevention of a further cardiac event and the primary prevention of a co-morbidity are key elements of cardiac rehabilitation. This paper by Steinke et al. makes a contribution to this literature. The authors acknowledge that sexual function is an important part of physical activity and indeed the absence of sexual activity after a cardiac event can have a significantly detrimental impact on patients’ mental health and quality of life. Nevertheless, assessment of sexual concerns is often overlooked in practice.</p>
<p>The research team are developing an instrument to measure sexual self-perception and adjustment in cardiac patients for use in clinical practice, research and evaluation. This paper reports on the evaluation of the psychometric properties of a questionnaire modified by the research team, the Sexual Self-Perception and Adjustment Questionnaire (SSPAQ), specifically for this purpose. The SSPAQ sought to measure sexual self-perception and adjustment in cardiac patients and variables included sexual satisfaction, sexual anxiety, sexual depression and sexual self-efficacy. Whilst the validity and reliability of the instrument in terms of internal consistency, content validity and construct validity was reported, further testing of the instrument with a larger sample size is required to increase specificity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the instrument may be used to assist in the delivery of successful counselling interventions to assist individuals in regaining a healthy sex life after a cardiac event and add further evidence of the efficacy of tailored cardiac rehabilitation interventions.</p>
