<abstract>
<p>Obesity in Hispanic children is epidemic. Recent recommendations are to focus on parent as role model as a means of prevention. Ways to Enhance Children’s Activity and Nutrition (We Can!) is a public education outreach program from a collaboration of 4 institutes at National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in Hispanic mothers’ behaviors, knowledge, and body mass index after participating in a 6-week We Can! program. Thirty-five Hispanic mothers participated in a 6-week program offered in Spanish at an elementary school setting. Height, weight, body mass index, and the We Can! survey were obtained preprogram and postprogram. Findings included significant changes in behaviors identified as risk behaviors for childhood obesity. Outcomes were similar to non-Spanish-speaking families with whom the program was first piloted. Lessons learned from this experience may benefit others who are trying to provide preventive care of Spanish-speaking families.</p>

<p>Childhood obesity is associated with racial/ethnic status, poverty, and familial obesity. Parental modeling of obesogenic behavior including poor nutritional habits, sedentary lifestyle, increased television viewing, lack of adequate exercise, and maternal obesity have been identified as primary high-risk factors for preschool obesity onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412452884">1</xref></sup> Interventions targeting parental nutrition and physical activity may be key to lessening the obesity epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412452884">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412452884"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452884">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Latino children are disproportionally affected by obesity, with the reported prevalence among 6- to 11-year-olds being 39.3% compared with 26.2% among non-Hispanic Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412452884">5</xref></sup> Alarmingly, over the past decade, more than 5% of Latino children have a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 99th percentile for age and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412452884">6</xref></sup> The importance of parental role modeling is understood; however, parents may need guidance in becoming the “agents” of change, and there are some social/cultural factors outside of parental control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412452884">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412452884"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412452884">9</xref></sup> Ayala and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412452884">10</xref></sup> state that being aware of Latino families’ knowledge levels, cultural beliefs, and values related to health and obesity is critical.</p>
<p>Ways to Enhance Children’s Activity and Nutrition (We Can!) is a nationally recognized program developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452884">11</xref></sup> to educate parents and caregivers on obesity prevention with an emphasis on increasing parenting capabilities to affect family health. Parents are encouraged in the home environment to (<italic>a</italic>) increase the availability and accessibility of healthy foods; (<italic>b</italic>) limit the availability and accessibility of sweetened beverages, high-fat foods, and energy-dense foods with low nutrient value; (<italic>c</italic>) learn portion control at home and at restaurants; (<italic>d</italic>) support and enable family physical activity; and (<italic>e</italic>) support and enable reduced screen time (computer and TV). We Can! was originally piloted nationally across 14 sites with survey data for evaluation purposes collected from 154 adult participants (73% Caucasians) at 9 intensive sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452884">11</xref></sup> Statistically significant outcomes on 12 indicators after We Can! included more favorable attitudes and behaviors toward limiting portion sizes, making healthy foods more available, influencing family food choices, and replacing TV time with exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452884">11</xref></sup> Program findings are promising; however, research is needed to support its use among diverse families. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in Latino mothers’ behaviors and knowledge after participating in a 6-week We Can! program. Unlike the earlier studies, our population was 100% Latino and the program was offered in Spanish.</p>
<sec id="section1-1941406412452884">
<title>Theoretical/Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The conceptual model for this study is based on Golan and Weizman’s family-based and health-centered approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412452884">12</xref></sup> to induce environmental change and changes in the parents’ lifestyle, cognition, and parenting practices. Parents being the main change agents recognize that family and home environment are major factors affecting the child’s habits, which is the We Can! focus.</p>

<sec id="section2-1941406412452884" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A descriptive repeated-measures design was used for this study. All study procedures, including protocols for recruiting participants and obtaining informed consent, were reviewed and approved by the appropriate administrative and institutional review boards.</p>
<sec id="section3-1941406412452884">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Mothers were recruited from an urban elementary school located in a large metropolitan Southern California city between September 2009 and June 2011. We Can! was introduced to mothers after a principal–parent meeting at the school by the principal investigator (PI), a bilingual, bicultural pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) student, and the school nurse. The orientation included a program description, meeting expectations, and clarification of attendee questions. Inclusion criteria were (<italic>a</italic>) age ≥18years, (<italic>b</italic>) child attending the elementary school, and (<italic>c</italic>) an interest in learning about improving diet and activity levels in their family. Meeting expectations included (<italic>a</italic>) attendance at six 1.5-hour weekly meetings and (<italic>b</italic>) homework based on the program curriculum. Four 6-week groups with 8, 11, 5, and 11 participants, respectively, were held.</p>
<sec id="section4-1941406412452884">
<title>We Can! program</title>
<p>The standardized We Can! curriculum was followed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412452884">Table 1</xref>). A complete discussion of the program is described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412452884">8</xref></sup> Reading assignments of 2 to 4 pages from the participant workbook corresponded with weekly discussion topics. Mothers’ selected one “eating well tip” and one “moving more tip” to work on during the week with her family and reported back on the success and barriers at the following meeting.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collected at the first (pre-intervention) and last (postintervention) meetings included anthropometric measures (weight, height, BMI), the We Can! survey, and 5 questions to specifically measure dietary (vegetables, fruits, sweetened drinks [juice], sweets), and activity behaviors. Demographic data were collected at baseline. The PI and PNP completed the anthropometric measures of the mothers, and the PNP read each of the questions from the survey out loud to participants to ensure understanding. For example, some participants had not heard of BMI or daily value on labels (which is content taught in the program). The rest of the questions were reported to be understandable to our participants. Questionnaires took about 30 minutes to complete. Mothers received a $20.00 stipend and pedometer at enrollment on completion of pre-intervention measures and a $20.00 stipend on completion of the program and after data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1941406412452884">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Body weight</italic> was measured using a digital scale (Tanita Model 554 Innerscan; TanitaCorp, Arlington Heights, IL). The mothers weighed in at each session without shoes and in light clothing. Weight was recorded to the nearest decimal fraction (eg, 141.1).</p>
<p><italic>Height</italic> was measured using a calibrated wall-mounted stadiometer (Ayrton Stadiometer Model 5100; Ayrton Corporation, Prior Lake, MN). Height was recorded to the nearest 1/8 inch.</p>
<p>BMI is the ratio of weight in kilograms to the square of height in meters and was calculated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adult charts.</p>
<p>The We Can! survey consisted of 47 items comprising 8 subscales: (<italic>a</italic>) Food and Eating Beliefs and Behaviors; (<italic>b</italic>) Knowledge about Food and Weight; (<italic>c</italic>) Plans for Healthy Foods and Snacks; (<italic>d</italic>) Physical Activity Attitudes, Beliefs, and Intentions; (<italic>e</italic>) Physical Activity Knowledge; (<italic>f</italic>) Physical Activity Behaviors; (<italic>g</italic>) Screen Time Knowledge; and (<italic>h</italic>) Screen Time Attitudes and Intentions. Internal consistency reliabilities were not reported in the original study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452884">11</xref></sup> In this study, Cronbach’s α scores ranged from .695 to .916, indicating adequate reliability (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412452884">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study was designed to continue to build the empirical base establishing the effectiveness of We Can! to promote the prevention or management of obesity, by examining changes in Latino mothers’ behaviors and knowledge after participating in a 6-week We Can! program. Our results suggest We Can! functioned well overall when implemented with Spanish-speaking Latinas. Among our sample compared with the original We Can! results with English-speaking participants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452884">11</xref></sup> our results were similar. For all We Can! survey subscales, the higher mean was associated with the posttest, which is indicative of improvement in habits. We had statistically significant changes in 6 of 8 subscales showing improvements in the majority of program outcome objectives. Although not statistically significant, <italic>screen time attitudes</italic> improved as more parents said they limited screen time in their home after participating in the program, and <italic>plans for healthy family foods</italic> also improved. Previous studies that encouraged 5 fruits and vegetables found Hispanic parents rated consuming fruits and vegetables as less important for weight management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412452884">9</xref></sup> and the original We Can! study showed less positive responses from Hispanics in healthy eating attitudes (planning to decrease fat and sugar in their diet). In our study also we initially found these attitudes, even though improvement was seen after program completion.</p>
<sec id="section11-1941406412452884">
<title>Limitations to Study</title>
<p>These findings must be interpreted in light of the fact that there are several limitations to this study: small sample size, nonrandomized design, not all school nurses or staff would have the opportunity or time to assist with studies at their school settings, and lack of follow-up past the 6 weeks, limiting generalizability. Nonetheless, study findings are encouraging and provide additional data for health care and policy agencies considering the use of We Can! to improve health promoting behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1941406412452884">
<title>New Contribution to the Literature</title>
<p>Given the high incidence of childhood obesity reported in disadvantaged families, various strategies are needed to reach these high-risk families. Prior research has reported higher incidence of obesity in low-income, uneducated mothers, which was seen in our population. Our study is unique in that all of our participants were Latino compared with 22% in the original We Can! evaluation; 67% had less than a high school education compared with 11% of the participants in the original study. Of note is our mothers’ interest in learning about nutrition, their openness to gentle suggestions in how to bring about small behavioral changes with their children, their increased awareness, and recognition of the importance they play in their role modeling. This study underscores the need for further research examining the effect of We Can! with Latino families with a larger sample and a control group. It also adds support for use of the program with low-income families.
