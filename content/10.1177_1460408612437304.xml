<abstract>
<p>Ankle fractures and dislocations are common injuries. The aim of this pictorial review is to illustrate their radiological assessment, the normal anatomy, the radiographic techniques and the classification of fractures and dislocations in and around the ankle. The mechanism of injury will also be described, which not only can help in classifying the injury, but may also aid in deciding their management. This is not a comprehensive surgical review; however, the importance of determining whether fractures are stable or unstable and the various treatment options are discussed<italic>.</italic></p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408612437304"><title>Incidence and risk factors</title>
<p>The incidence of ankle fractures is 3.0 per 1000 women per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612437304">Hasselman et al., 2003</xref>). Isolated fibular fractures are the most common with a prevalence of 57.6% and isolated medial malleolar fractures are the least common (2.9%). Ankle fractures are more frequent in females with a high body mass index (BMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612437304">Hasselman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408612437304">Seeley et al., 1996</xref>) and occur particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408612437304">Daly et al., 1987</xref>) but this correlation is not proven consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612437304">Hasselman et al., 2003</xref>). Although one would assume that ankle fractures are more common in osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408612437304">Seeley et al., 1991</xref>) more recent literature has found no strong correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408612437304">Hasselman et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408612437304"><title>Anatomy</title>
<p>Traditionally, the ankle joint has been considered as a hinge joint but in addition to plantar-flexion and dorsi-flexion, it is capable of sliding and rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408612437304">Sammarco et al., 1973</xref>). It consists of the distal aspect of both the tibia and fibula articulating with the body of the talus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408612437304">Figure 1</xref>). It is surrounded by many ligaments, tendons and retinacula. On the lateral side, these comprise the anterior talo-fibular, calcaneo-fibular and posterior talo-fibular ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408612437304">Figure 2</xref>). The distal tibia and fibula are held together by the anterior tibio-fibular ligament, the syndesmotic ligament and the posterior tibio-fibular ligament. Medially, they are supported by the deltoid ligament made up of a superficial component, attached to the medial malleolus superiorly and the talar neck and calcaneum inferiorly, and a deep part attached to the medial malleolus superiorly and the talus inferiorly. The latter is the main stabilizing structure on the medial side and is an important factor when considering the management of ankle fractures.

<sec id="sec3-1460408612437304"><title>Mechanism of injury</title>
<p>Ankle fractures can be broadly classified according to the mechanism of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408612437304">Figure 3</xref>). An understanding of this mechanism allows all of the associated injuries to be elaborated. Inversion injuries account for approximately 85% of traumatic conditions of the ankle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612437304">Greenspan, 2000</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Serious ankle injuries including fractures and fracture dislocations may occur with low-energy rotational motion occurring in sport or in simple daily activities such as missing a step. High-energy injuries with axial loading usually result in more serious pilon or tibial plafond fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408612437304">Marsh and Saltzman, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408612437304"><title>Investigation</title>
<p>Plain films are the primary mode of investigating ankle trauma. Three principle radiographic views are required for the assessment of ankle fractures: firstly, where the X-ray beam passes from anterior to posterior (AP), secondly, a mortise view and, finally, a lateral of the ankle. The distal tibia and fibula are well demonstrated on the AP view. If the foot is plantar flexed then the narrowest part of the talus is tangential to the beam, making the clear space appear pathologically wide implying ligamentous disruption. The mortise view is a variant of the AP view, taken with the foot internally rotated by 10°, which clearly demonstrates the ankle mortise. The lateral view is used to assess the anterior aspect as well as the posterior lip of the distal tibia.</p>
<p>Additional radiographic views include oblique views. The internal oblique view is taken with the ankle held in internal rotation by 30–35° and is effective in demonstrating the tibio-fibular syndesmosis. External oblique views may be useful in assessing the lateral malleolus and the anterior tibial tubercle.</p>
<p>Suspected ligamentous injuries may require stress radiography, joint arthrography, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, careful examination of the plain films together with an understanding of the kinematics and mechanism of injury can aid in predicting ligamentous injury.</p>
<p>CT is particularly useful in grading the severity of specific fractures such as pilon fractures of the distal tibia, triplanar and Salter Harris injuries of the growth plate and has had an increasing role in the evaluation of posterior malleolar fractures. CT findings in such injuries have an important role in determining prognosis and management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408612437304"><title>Ligamentous disruption</title>
<p>Injury to the deltoid ligament can range from a sprain to complete rupture depending on the severity of eversion force. Rupture of the deltoid is typically associated with a tear of the anterior tibio-fibular ligament. On plain films, lateral shift of the talus in the absence of a spiral fracture of the fibula implies disruption of both the anterior tibio-fibular and deltoid ligaments. If there is massive lateral shift of the talus (more than 3 mm), so that the medial clear space is enlarged on plain films, both parts of the deltoid must be ruptured. Similarly, medial shift of the talus indicates that the lateral ligaments are ruptured. In such cases further imaging of the ligaments such as MRI is not usually required. Once reduced the fracture and soft tissues usually heal satisfactorily, in the vast majority of cases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408612437304">Figure 4</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-1460408612437304" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Case 1: A 56-year-old woman involved in a road traffic accident. Radiographs show a Maisonneuve or Weber type C fracture. There is a vertical posterior tibial fracture with lateral talar shift and widening of the ankle mortise medially. There is also a spiral fracture proximal fibula. Similarly, injury to the lateral collateral ligaments of the ankle can range from a simple sprain to rupture depending on the severity of an inversion force. When there is no associated fracture, disruption of the anterior talo-fibular ligaments is recognized on inversion stress films by an increase in talar tilt to more than 5°.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408612437304-fig4.tif"/>

<sec id="sec6-1460408612437304"><title>Alternative classification systems</title>
<p>Fractures of the ankle may also be classified by anatomical structure: unimalleolar, bimalleolar, trimalleollar or complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408612437304">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>The first modern classification of ankle fractures, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408612437304">Lauge-Hansen (1950</xref>), was based on the mechanism of injury and the reproducibility of fracture patterns in cadavers. It categorizes ankle fractures and dislocations into supination-external rotation, supination-adduction, pronation-external rotation and pronation-abduction. The first word of this two-part nomenclature denotes the position of the foot at the time of injury and the second defines the deforming force applied. This pioneering work laid the foundation for the closed treatment of ankle fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408612437304">Lindsjö, 1985a</xref>) as the pattern implies the mechanism of injury and reversing the deforming force facilitates optimal reduction. With the advent of modern operative techniques and a trend towards anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation this classification lost favour, as it was considered complicated and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>A simpler classification of ankle fractures was introduced by Danis in 1949 and modified by Weber in 1972 based on the anatomy of the distal fibular fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1460408612437304">Figure 6</xref>). The simplicity of this classification has made it very popular, but its main shortcoming is that it does not take any injury to the medial structures into consideration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1460408612437304">Figures 7</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1460408612437304"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1460408612437304"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1460408612437304"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1460408612437304"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1460408612437304">12</xref>).

<p>The Weber classification forms the basis of that described by the AO group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408612437304">Weber, 1972</xref>). This is the most comprehensive and detailed classification of malleolar fractures. It extends Weber’s three lateral types into nine groups based on trauma to the medial structures and/or a postero-medial fracture. Weber types A (infrasyndesmotic) and B (transsyndesmotic) are further divided into 1, 2 and 3 based on an isolated fibular fracture, associated with a medial malleolar fracture or with a postero-medial fracture, respectively. Weber type C (suprasyndesmotic) is categorized into C1, C2 and C3 depending on the configuration and site of the fibular fracture.</p>
<p>These nine groups are further divided into 27 subgroups related to factors such as ligament avulsions versus bony avulsions and the presence or otherwise of Chaput’s tubercle fracture (antero-lateral corner of the tibia), Le Fort’s avulsion (fibular insertion of the anterior tibio-fibular ligament) and Volkmann’s fragment (posterior margin of the tibia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612437304">Müller et al., 1979</xref>). The complexity of this classification system limits its wide application, except in research studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408612437304"><title>Pilon fractures</title>
<p>A pilon fracture is a comminuted fracture of the distal tibia which consists of a long oblique break extending medial to lateral, involving the dome of the distal tibial articular surface, and extending along the adjacent metaphysis. These fractures are rare injuries accounting for approximately 7–10% of all tibial fractures and less than 1% of fractures of the lower limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408612437304">Calori et al., 2010</xref>). They most commonly occur after road traffic accidents or high-energy falls.</p>
<p>Pilon fractures have been classified by Muller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408612437304">Muller et al., 1979</xref>) depending on the displacement of the fracture fragments and the incongruity of the joint. Pilon type 1 represents a fissure of the articular surface without significant displacement of the fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1460408612437304">Figure 13</xref>).
<fig id="fig13-1460408612437304" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>Case 8: A 30-year-old man jumped from 2-storey building: (a) AP and lateral X-rays show a type 1 pilon fracture. There is minimal displacement of the fragments of the distal tibia. (b) A CT scan of the same patient in plaster of Paris and (c) external fixation of the reduced fracture. A pilon type 2 represents a fissured fracture with articular incongruity. A pilon type 3 is a compression fracture of the distal tibia with displacement of the weight bearing segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1460408612437304">Figure 14</xref>).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1460408612437304"><title>Triplanar fractures</title>
<p>Triplanar fractures of the distal tibia are classified separately from pilon fractures. The triplanar is a fracture of the lateral aspect of the tibial epiphysis complicated by extension into two other planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1460408612437304">Figure 15</xref>) and is essentially a combination of a Tillaux fracture (described below) and a Salter Harris 2 fracture. It is usually caused by plantar-flexion and external rotation. The twisting mechanism in an immature skeleton produces forces that splint along the path of least resistance and the growth plate. Fusion of the growth plate starts medially so this area is relatively resistant to fracture.
<fig id="fig15-1460408612437304" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>Case 10: A 14-year-old presenting after a twisting injury: (a) AP and lateral views of the ankle.

There is a fracture of the lateral third of the tibial plafond with intra-articular separation. The sagittal reconstruction shows 2 mm of intra-articular separation with lateral displacement of the lateral fragment.

<sec id="sec9-1460408612437304"><title>Tillaux fractures</title>
<p>A Tillaux fracture is a type of fracture of the distal tibia which consists of a vertical fracture line that extends from the distal articular surface upward to the lateral cortex. It most often results from an abduction and external rotation injury causing avulsion of the lateral margin of the distal tibia. The lateral margin is affected because the growth plate fuses from medial to lateral making the medial side stronger. In children, this fracture is classified as a Salter Harris type 1 V injury of the distal growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1460408612437304">Figure 16</xref>).

There is avulsion of the lateral margin of the distal tibial epiphysis and a further oblique fracture of the posterior tibial metaphysis. (b) Sagittal and coronal CT reconstructions after reduction. Radiological evaluation is pertinent to surgical management. Displacement of the fracture fragment by more than 2 mm or irregularity of the distal surface of the tibia warrants surgical treatment.

<p>A Pott’s fracture is a fracture of the distal fibula with disruption of the tibio-fibular syndesmosis (Weber C). A Dupuytren’s fracture is due to an eversion injury resulting in a fracture of the distal fibula 2–7 cm above the tibio-fibular syndesmosis with an associated disruption of the deltoid ligament.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1460408612437304"><title>Unstable fractures and dislocations</title>
<p>The ankle joint is inherently stable because of its articulating bony architecture and the strength of the supporting ligaments. Ankle dislocation is usually accompanied by malleolar fractures because of the mechanical strength of the ankle mortise and surrounding ligaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408612437304">Shaik et al., 2006</xref>). Ankle dislocation without an accompanying fracture is a rare occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408612437304">Wilson et al., 1939</xref>). Risk factors that may predispose to dislocation include joint hypermobility, internal malleolar hypoplasia, peroneal muscle weakness and a history of prior ankle strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408612437304">Thangarajah et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>When assessing ankle injuries it is important to assess whether the fracture is stable or unstable as reduction of joint disruptions is a prerequisite to all further treatment.</p>
<p>Isolated Danis–Weber type A fractures are usually stable. Displaced type A fractures are best treated with internal fixation of the malleolar fragment with screws directed almost parallel to the articular surface. Accurate restoration of the fibular articular surface should be achieved. The lateral malleolar fracture may be stabilized with plates and screws or, rarely, tension band wiring.</p>
<p>Undisplaced Danis–Weber type B fractures are potentially unstable if the tibio-fibular ligament is torn or avulsed. Displaced type B fractures are unstable injuries and closed reduction with traction or internal fixation is usually required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1460408612437304">Figures 19</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1460408612437304"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1460408612437304"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1460408612437304">22</xref>).

<p>Dislocation of the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints is referred to as a Chopart dislocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-1460408612437304">Figure 25</xref>). This injury usually occurs as a result of a severe twisting injury, fall from a height or motor vehicle accidents. Displacement of the distal fragments can be in various directions but is most commonly in the medial direction. There are often associated fractures of the calcaneus, cuboid or navicular bones.

<sec id="sec14-1460408612437304"><title>Dislocation of the subtalar joint</title>
<p>The two major classifications of dislocations of the subtalar joint include peritalar and complete dislocations.</p>
<p>Peritalar dislocations account for approximately 15% of all talar injuries and 1% of all dislocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408612437304">Greenspan, 2000</xref>). This involves simultaneous dislocations of the talocalcaneal and talonavicular joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1460408612437304">Figure 26</xref>) with preservation of the tibiotalar joint with four subtypes: medial, lateral, posterior and anterior. Total talar dislocation is characterized by complete disruption of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1460408612437304">Figure 27</xref>). This is a serious injury, which is frequently complicated by osteonecrosis of the talus.

<sec id="sec15-1460408612437304"><title>Clinical considerations for treatment</title>
<p>Smoking, alcohol and malnutrition all contribute to a poor prognosis for patients with these injuries. Smoking adversely affects bone mineral density and the dynamics of bone and wound healing leading to delayed union and prolonged healing times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408612437304">Sloan et al., 2010</xref>). The effect of chronic alcoholism on bone healing is multifactorial. In addition to its direct effect on bone mineral density, factors associated with alcohol abuse such as nutritional deficiencies, liver damage and hypogonadism also contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408612437304">Laitinen et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Elderly and obese individuals with ankle fractures pose a particular challenge. Osteoporotic bones may make the fractures more complex and difficult to manage either conservatively or operatively and they may be more prone to redisplacement in those with a higher BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408612437304">Böstman et al., 1995</xref>). Diabetics with neuropathy and micro-angiopathy have a higher incidence of wound complications including superficial or deep infection, nonunion, malunion, implant failure and the requirement for revision surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408612437304">Costigan et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612437304">Wukich et al. (2008)</xref> conducted a critical analysis of the available literature on ankle fractures in diabetic individuals and formulated a series of clinical recommendations advising that a thorough neurovascular examination should be undertaken and in those cases with suboptimal perfusion, a vascular consultation should be sought before considering operative intervention. Ideally, ankle fractures and dislocations should be treated urgently but in those with established significant swelling they are best managed initially with rest, ice packs and elevation. Definitive treatment either operatively or non-operatively may be considered at a later stage when the swelling and any fracture blisters have subsided. Significantly displaced fractures or fracture dislocations should be immediately reduced in the A&amp;E department to prevent localized ischaemia and soft tissue compromise from direct pressure from, usually, the distal tibia medially on the skin. Any compound fracture is a surgical emergency requiring urgent washout, debridement with internal or external fixation depending on the grade and contamination. Isolated undisplaced lateral malleolar fractures with no established talar shift or undisplaced bimalleolar fractures may be treated non-operatively with a well-moulded cast or functional brace with a period of protected weight bearing. Conservative treatment may occasionally be indicated when the patient is frail or unlikely to comply such as those with no fixed abode.</p>
<p>The aim of operative treatment in ankle fractures is to achieve static congruity (accurate reduction of the ankle mortise) and dynamic congruity (exact reduction of the talus in the mortise with no talar shift). Lateral malleolar or fibular fractures are usually stabilized with a one-third tubular plate and screws including lag screws. Medial malleolar fractures may be fixed either with partially threaded cancellous screws or by a tension band wiring technique depending on the size and quality of the fracture fragment(s). Potential rupture of the deltoid ligament is not routinely explored unless it is considered to be ‘trapped’ in the joint, obstructing a congruent reduction of the talus in the mortise, when it may be retrieved and repaired. It is considered that posterior malleolar fractures should be fixed only if the fracture fragment is more than 25% of the total width of the distal tibia on a ‘true’ lateral view as that may compromise stability. A postero-medial or postero-lateral approach is preferable depending on the fracture pattern. Syndesmotic injuries may be assessed intra-operatively by stressing the distal tibio-fibular joint after the fibular fracture has been fixed and stabilized with a screw(s) or a button technique passed across the syndesmosis. Postoperatively, these patients are usually immobilized in a splint or plaster with the foot in a neutral position and protected weight bearing for a period of three to six weeks depending on the fracture configuration, treatment method and patient factors. Diabetics with potential neurovascular compromise should be considered for a prolonged period of non-weight bearing followed by a further period of protected weight bearing before allowing full weight bearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408612437304">Wukich et al., 2008</xref>). Hardware removal though not routinely recommended may be undertaken at a later stage when the fracture has reliably healed if the patient prefers this or in those patients with clear local symptoms over a prominent implant.</p>
<p>Good or excellent results have been reported with conservatively treated stable ankle fractures, as high as 95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408612437304">Bauer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408612437304">Kirstensen et al., 1985</xref>). The results are not as reliable in operatively treated displaced malleolar fractures. However, good to excellent results have been reported in 85–90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408612437304">Beris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408612437304">Lindsjö 1985b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408612437304">Tunturi et al., 1983</xref>). Despite this, the management of ankle fractures is not free of complications. Loss of fracture reduction, more common in fractures treated with closed reduction has been reported to be as high as 26% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408612437304">Federici et al., 1993</xref>). Other complications may include malunion, nonunion, infection and wound breakdown, decreased ankle motion and ankle arthrosis (Rockwood). A recent study carried out in a large diverse population of 57,183 patients in California, who had undergone open reduction and internal fixation, has shown an overall low short-term complication rate including pulmonary embolism (0.34%), mortality (1.07%), wound infection (1.44%), amputation (0.16%), and revisional surgery (0.82%). The rate of ankle replacement at five years follow-up was reported to be 0.96% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408612437304">Soohoo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, an understanding of the mechanism and modern classification of fractures and dislocations around the ankle allows appropriate management of the injuries and complications. Imaging is pragmatic in that simple X-rays and CT where appropriate allow an understanding of the ligaments disrupted without needing to image them. The use of accepted classification systems allows appropriate treatment and prognostication of complications.</p>
