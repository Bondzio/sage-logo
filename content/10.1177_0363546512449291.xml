<sec id="section1-0363546512449291">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Pectoralis major ruptures are closely associated with weight lifting and participation in sports. The anatomy of the pectoralis major tendon is unique with an elongated thin footprint requiring multiple points of fixation to restore the native anatomy. Multiple options exist for tendon repairs, but the strongest construct has yet to be identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512449291">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>The intent of this study was to compare the load to failure of bone trough, cortical button, and suture anchor repairs of the pectoralis major tendon in the extended and abducted position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512449291">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512449291">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Thirty fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were divided equally into 3 groups based on the repair technique to be performed. Bone mineral density of the surgical neck of the proximal humerus was assessed before each repair. Bone trough, suture anchor, and cortical button repairs were performed as dictated by computerized randomization. Each specimen was loaded to failure and mode of failure was noted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512449291">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The majority of failures occurred through the suture used for tendon repair. One specimen in the bone trough group failed via fracture of the proximal humerus. The suture anchor group failed at the implant in 5 of 9 specimens and through the suture in 4 of 9 specimens. Load to failure was greatest in bone trough repairs at 596 N, followed by cortical button at 494 N, and finally suture anchor repairs with 383 N. Load to failure was significantly greater in the bone trough group when compared with suture anchor repairs (<italic>P</italic> = .007). No correlation was found between bone mineral density and load to failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512449291">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Bone trough repair of the pectoralis major tendon was stronger than suture anchor repair.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>

<p>Rupture of the pectoralis major tendon is rarely reported in the literature, despite recent literature demonstrating an increasing incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512449291">13</xref></sup> The bench press exercise is the most common cause of this injury. The pectoralis major tendon is most prone to rupture during eccentric contraction with the arm positioned in 30° of extension and 40° of abduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> In this position, the inferior fibers of the tendon are placed at a mechanical disadvantage and undergo twice the excursion of the superior fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> These ruptures most commonly occur as an avulsion of the tendinous insertion directly from bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512449291">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outcomes with operative intervention of complete ruptures have been shown to be superior to nonoperative management in strength testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512449291">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> as well as functional outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512449291">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512449291">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291">15</xref></sup> Studies have shown excellent return to sport with surgical repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512449291">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512449291">20</xref></sup> The pectoralis major tendon is unique in that it has a long narrow footprint requiring a broad repair site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512449291">3</xref></sup> This type of repair can be accomplished by creating a bone trough or by using multiple suture anchors or cortical buttons. Good outcomes have been reported with each of these repairs, but a direct comparison as to the biomechanical properties of these 3 techniques has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Hart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512449291">5</xref></sup> recently performed a cadaveric, biomechanical comparison of bone trough and suture anchor techniques for repair of tendinous avulsions of the pectoralis major tendon. They found no difference between repairs and found an ultimate failure load of 611 N for bone trough and 620 N for suture anchor. The mode of failure differed between groups, with fracture occurring in half of the bone trough group specimens and suture breakage occurring in all of the suture anchor group specimens. Unlike pectoralis major ruptures, the biomechanical properties of distal biceps tendon repairs have been studied extensively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512449291">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512449291">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512449291">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512449291">16</xref></sup> In 2 recent studies, cortical button repairs of distal biceps ruptures have demonstrated the highest load to failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512449291">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref></sup> The pectoralis major tendon has a longer, thinner insertion requiring multiple points of fixation and results in different forces across the repair construct. The pectoralis major tendon also tends to fail in a position of abduction, extension, and external rotation where significant shear forces act upon the tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> This variation in the anatomy and mechanism of failure for the pectoralis major tendon suggest that the biomechanical properties may be different from those of the distal biceps tendon.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical strength of bone trough, cortical button, and suture anchor repairs of the pectoralis major tendon. On the basis of prior distal biceps studies, we hypothesized that the cortical button repair would be strongest, whereas the suture anchor repair would be weakest for the pectoralis major tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512449291">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>An a priori power analysis (power of 0.8) was undertaken and a sample size of 10 specimens per group was determined to be sufficient to detect a 100-N difference based on the methods that Mazzocca et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref></sup> used for evaluation of distal biceps repairs. Bone mineral density, load to failure, and mode of failure were recorded. The load to failure of the 3 different repair techniques was compared using nonparametric statistical tests. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison between multiple groups. Pairwise comparisons were performed using a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. A scatterplot with linear regression analysis was used to assess influence of bone mineral density on load to failure. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512449291">
<title>Specimen Preparation</title>
<p>Thirty fresh-frozen cadaver shoulders were obtained and randomized to bone trough, suture anchor, or cortical button fixation. The age, sex, and race were recorded for each specimen. The average age of specimens was 54.4 years (27-68 years). Specimens were thawed at room temperature 24 hours. Bone mineral density and dissection of the pectoralis major tendon were performed once specimens were completely thawed. Bone mineral density was assessed (DexaScan; XL Image Densitometer, GE/Lunar Expert, Madison, Wisconsin) at the proximal humerus metaphysis of each specimen as described by Tingart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512449291">18</xref></sup> The insertion of the pectoralis major was isolated, and a tendinous avulsion was simulated by sharply releasing its attachment onto the humerus. The pectoralis major tendon was then repaired to the pectoralis footprint on the lateral lip of the bicipital groove with bone trough, suture anchors, or cortical buttons as designated by computerized randomization.</p>

<sec id="section11-0363546512449291">
<title>Bone Trough Repair</title>
<p>The bone trough was prepared as described by Schepsis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291">15</xref></sup> by creating a 5-cm trough just lateral to the bicipital groove at the pectoralis footprint. A 2-mm drill was used to create 4 drill holes 1 cm lateral to the bone trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512449291">Figure 1</xref>). To provide conformity with the other methods of repair, 3 No. 2 polyblend (Fiberwire; Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida) sutures were passed in a Krackow fashion for a total of 6 limbs across the repair site. The sutures were passed and tied to the accompanying limb to secure the tendon within the trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512449291">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Suture Anchor Repair</title>
<p>The suture anchor repair was performed using three 5-mm suture anchors (PEEK Biocorkscrew; Arthrex Inc). The anchor is composed of a PEEK suture anchor with a No. 2 polyblend eyelet that a No. 2 polyblend suture passes through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512449291">Figure 2</xref>). The pectoralis footprint was cleared of all soft tissue and lightly abraded before suture anchor insertion. Each anchor was loaded with a single No. 2 polyblend suture (Fiberwire; Arthrex Inc). One limb was passed through the released pectoralis tendon using a locking Krackow stitch configuration for a total of 6 suture limbs across the repair site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512449291">Figure 3</xref>). As described by Provencher et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512449291">14</xref></sup> 1 limb was left free to pull the tendon to its insertion before securing the repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512449291">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Cortical button repairs were performed as described by Schnaser et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512449291">16</xref></sup> Similar to the suture anchor repair, the pectoralis footprint was cleared of any remaining soft tissue and lightly abraded before insertion of the cortical buttons. Three No. 2 polyblend sutures (Fiberwire; Arthrex Inc) were passed in a Krackow fashion for a total of 6 suture limbs across the repair site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512449291">Figure 4</xref>).

<title>Biomechanical Testing</title>
<p>A position of 30° of extension and 40° of abduction was chosen for biomechanical testing, to simulate the position of the arm during the bench press exercise when rupture most commonly occurs. The humerus was rigidly secured to the base, and the proximal aspect of the pectoralis tendon was clamped and attached to a custom material testing system driven by a linear actuator under servo control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512449291">Figure 5</xref>). The tendon was loaded to a just-taut condition. Then, a 1-Hz sinusoidal perturbation with an amplitude of 3 mm was applied for 20 cycles for preconditioning before load-to-failure testing. Load-to-failure testing was performed at a rate of 100 mm/s. The tendon loading force and displacement during the cyclic loading and load to failure were sampled at 100 Hz, and the observed mode of failure for each specimen was recorded. With a significant length of tendon clamped between the teeth, no slippage of the tendon was noted.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One shoulder in the suture anchor group was lost due to a sensor failure, so a total of 29 shoulders were loaded to failure. (Ten repairs were performed with a cortical button, 10 via bone trough, and 9 with suture anchor repairs.)</p>
<sec id="section16-0363546512449291">
<title>Load to Failure</title>
<p>The mean (standard deviation) load to failure was 596.6 (125.8) N for the bone trough repair, 493.9 (116.5) N in the cortical button repair, and 383.1 (167.9) N for the suture anchor repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512449291">Figure 6</xref>). Analysis using a Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrated a significant difference in load to failure among the 3 repair constructs (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Pairwise comparison using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test demonstrated that bone trough repair was significantly stronger than suture anchor repair (<italic>P</italic> = .006). There was not a significant difference between bone trough versus cortical button (<italic>P</italic> = .08) or cortical button versus suture anchor (<italic>P</italic> = .22). A post hoc power analysis indicated that a comparison of cortical button versus suture anchor would require 27 specimens in each group, whereas 23 specimens would be needed for comparison of cortical button versus bone trough.</p>

<title>Mode of Failure</title>
<p>In the suture anchor group, failure occurred through the eyelet of the anchor in 5 of 9 specimens, whereas the suture broke in the remaining 4 specimens. In the cortical button group, all 10 repairs failed via a break in the suture.

The mean (standard deviation) bone mineral density was 0.555 (0.142) g/cm<sup>2</sup> for bone trough, 0.579 (0.111) g/cm<sup>2</sup> for cortical button, and 0.573 (0.191) g/cm<sup>2</sup> for suture anchor. The fracture occurred in a specimen with a bone mineral density of 0.338 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, which was the lowest bone mineral density of the bone trough group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rupture of the pectoralis major has been increasingly reported in the literature. Still, most series contain relatively few patients. Surgical repair is superior to nonoperative treatment for the majority of these injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512449291">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512449291">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512449291">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512449291">20</xref></sup> Although bone trough, suture anchors, and cortical buttons have all been described to repair pectoralis major ruptures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512449291">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512449291">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512449291"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512449291">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> there is no consensus on which repair construct is strongest for these injuries. A recent report by Mazzocca et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref></sup> found cortical button repairs to be stronger than both suture anchor and bone trough repairs for distal biceps ruptures.

<p>Clinical studies have shown that surgical repair can return peak torque, work, and adduction strength to &gt;90% of the contralateral side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512449291">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512449291">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512449291">19</xref></sup> However, these studies have not compared outcomes between different repair techniques. Aarimaa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512449291">1</xref></sup> reported on 12 patients with suture anchor repair and 10 patients with suture repair using drill holes with good subjective results for both techniques. This series included both acute and chronic tears and did not directly compare results between the 2 surgical techniques.</p>
<p>With one exception, there are no published studies comparing repair strength of various repair constructs for pectoralis major rupture. Hart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512449291">5</xref></sup> recently compared suture anchor with bone trough repairs of pectoralis major ruptures in cadavers. These authors found a significant incidence of fracture in the bone trough group and no difference in ultimate failure between the 2 groups. Our study differs from Hart et al in that we did find a difference between bone trough and suture anchor repair of pectoralis major ruptures. There are several possible explanations for this finding. We included 10 specimens per group, whereas they included only 6 specimens. It is possible that our study was more sufficiently powered to detect a difference between the 2 groups. In addition, we tested the repairs in 30° of extension and 40° of abduction to simulate the arm position during the bench press exercise when pectoralis major rupture is most likely to occur. The average age of the cadaveric specimens in our study was 54.4 years, whereas that by Hart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512449291">5</xref></sup> was 85 years. Admittedly, both studies used specimens older than the population most frequently affected by this injury. However, Tingart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512449291">18</xref></sup> showed that there was a significant difference in bone mineral density of specimens younger than 70 years and those that were older than 70 years. This is an important point as 50% of the specimens in Hart et al’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512449291">5</xref></sup> failed via fracture of the bone bridge in the bone trough group, whereas there was only 1 (10%) fracture via this mechanism in our study. Last, we included a third group in which cortical buttons were used for repair. The cortical button technique for repair of pectoralis major ruptures has recently been described in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512449291">16</xref></sup> and these devices have been shown to be the strongest repair construct for distal biceps repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512449291">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mode of failure differed between the groups in the current study. More than half of the suture anchors failed at the suture anchor loop. This may not happen in specimens where the eyelet and anchor are not separate materials, such as some of the metal anchors that are currently on the market. Our findings suggest that improvement in suture loop design of anchors may allow for stronger repair constructs. One of the specimens in the bone trough group failed via a fracture of the proximal humerus. This method of repair violates more of the humeral cortex than the other 2 repair techniques, perhaps making this complication more likely.</p>
<p>Repairs of biceps tendon ruptures showed increasing strength by increasing the number of suture anchors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512449291">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512449291">9</xref></sup> Increasing the number of suture anchors may increase strength, however, if the native footprint is respected, then the bone bridge between anchors would need to be decreased, potentially increasing the risk of fracture. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of modifying the number of suture anchors used for this repair.</p>
<p>It is interesting that we found a 100-N difference between bone trough and cortical button repairs, as both groups failed primarily by suture breakage. We hypothesize that this difference is the result of different forces experienced by the suture at the suture-repair interface. In the bone trough group, sutures traversed a distance of approximately 1 cm, leading to a greater area of contact with bone compared with the cortical button group, where the suture made a 180° turn. This acute turn may lead to increased force over a shorter distance of suture, which may have resulted in the difference in load to failure.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the strength of each construct, our study attempted to evaluate the effect of bone mineral density on repair strength. Our findings do not support an effect of bone mineral density on the strength of pectoralis major repairs. Unlike tendon repairs to purely metaphyseal cortical bone, the pectoralis major insertion extends to involve the diaphysis of the humerus. The humeral cortex tolerated greater loads to failure in all but 1 specimen (fracture in the bone trough repair group) than the material used to repair the avulsed tendon. As a result, it is not surprising that we did not find an influence of bone mineral density on the strength of our repair.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, the bone trough appears to be the strongest repair construct for pectoralis major repair. However, 1 proximal humerus fracture occurred during testing in this group. Silverstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512449291">17</xref></sup> recently described a proximal humerus fracture in an actual patient 8 weeks after a pectoralis major repair performed via the bone trough method. Caution should be exercised when using the bone trough method, particularly in contact athletes or others who are likely to experience high torsional loads to their proximal humerus in the postoperative period. When using the bone trough method, surgeons must weigh the increased strength with the potential complication of a proximal humerus fracture. In elite athletes, other modes of fixation may be preferred to avoid this potentially devastating complication. An additional consideration is the more extensive surgical exposure necessary to perform the bone trough repair. To provide for an adequate 1-cm bone bridge between the bone trough and drill holes, exposure of more of the lateral aspect of the humerus is required than with suture anchor or cortical button repair, which may prove difficult in muscular individuals with large deltoid muscles.</p>
<p>Our study had several important limitations. One, it was a biomechanical study performed on cadavers, and thus repair strength may be different in actual patients depending on bone quality and adherence to postoperative restrictions. Second, we examined only 3 repair constructs, and variations in the number of sutures or implants may influence the strength of repair. However, we did attempt to standardize the repairs by using 6 suture strands across the repair site for each repair strategy. Third, all implants used in the present study are made by one manufacturer, and the results may not be applicable to other manufacturers’ implants on the market. Despite these limitations, we were able to show that bone trough is stronger than suture anchor repair for pectoralis major tendon repair. Cortical button repair is an attractive option for repair for these injuries as less dissection is necessary than for bone trough repair, and no implant failures or proximal humerus fractures were observed in this group.</p>
