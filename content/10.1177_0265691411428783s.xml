<p>Together with the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the 1937 Paris Universal Exposition was the most prominent showcase of the Third Reich in its attempt to present itself to the outside world as a dynamic, modern regime which had managed to rally the nation unanimously behind the cause of National Socialism. Yet surprisingly few historians have investigated this aspect of Nazi propaganda, even though participation in the Exposition proved to be a major international success for the regime. Both the German pavilion constructed by Albert Speer and Leni Riefenstahl’s documentary <italic>Triumph des Willens</italic> about the 1934 Nuremberg party rally, which premiered for an international audience on that occasion, were awarded gold medals. In her lavishly illustrated book Karen Fiss not only looks at the Nazi regime’s skilful presentation of its technical, scientific, artistic and social achievements in Paris; she is even more interested in the perception of this self-portrayal by the French public. This has the effect that the analysis of the intentions, planning and execution of the German contribution to the Exposition and the overall perception of this event in the Reich falls a bit short.</p>
<p>Fiss sees the 1937 Exposition as a culmination of illusory French hopes for a continuation of the Franco-German rapprochement which had begun in the 1920s. As a consequence, the Popular Front government under Leon Blum in 1936/37 tried its best to secure German participation in the event, hoping that acceptance of the invitation could be seen as a sign of good will and peaceful intentions on the part of the new rulers <italic>outre-Rhin</italic>. Hence the French government granted the Reich privileged conditions in terms of the size of its imposing pavilion opposite the Soviet exhibition hall. It also helped finance the German contribution as the Third Reich was notoriously short of foreign currency as a result of its autarky and rearmament policy. The Germans were also granted the privilege of using their own workforce to build the pavilion. This had the effect that the German pavilion was one of the few buildings ready for the official opening of the Exposition in May 1937 while all other nations had to rely on French workers, and, as a result of strikes, the completion of their exhibition spaces was delayed. Consequently the French public contrasted the apparent efficiency of the Nazi regime with the decadence prevailing in French society. According to Fiss, the Nazi regime participated in the Exposition not because it was genuinely interested in international rapprochement but because it hoped to sell as many German products as possible in the wake of the Exposition and in order to maintain a peaceful façade as long as the military preparations for the next war were unfinished.</p>
<p>In her thoughtful analysis of the German pavilion the author shows the inherent contradictions in the Nazi regime’s presentation at the Exposition. On the one hand it displayed the latest technological, scientific and industrial achievements, such as TV transmissions, synthetic rubber and silk products, huge turbines and a Mercedes racing car. On the other hand these modern products of a clearly highly industrialized society were presented in a building speaking an anti-modernist language of architecture. Using stained glass windows, wall mosaics and naturalist paintings depicting craftsmen and peasants at work, the interior design of the pavilion celebrated the virtues of a pre-industrial society as if it wanted to create the illusion that all these technological feats had been achieved by traditional means of production.</p>
<p>Regardless of these contradictions, which provided evidence of the fact that the Nazi regime was obviously not at ease with modern times, the French public reacted largely positively, even enthusiastically, to the pavilion and the accompanying German cultural programme, notably the screenings of German documentaries and feature films carefully chosen by Goebbels. Fiss explains this positive reception, which was not limited to right-wing or fascist groups, with reference to the widespread feeling of economic and social malaise, lack of energy and national unity which marked French society in the 1930s. In the face of this the supposed German dynamism, discipline, self-confidence and national unity as staged in Paris seemed to be an antidote. Due to the prevailing pacifism in French society and a certain self-delusion, Nazi Germany’s representation of itself for all its martial and overpowering presence, as evident in the pavilion’s architecture and size or in Riefenstahl’s documentary of the immense party rallies in Nuremberg, was not perceived as a potential threat to France. Rather it was seen as the confident self-assertion of a regime which seemed to offer a viable alternative to the decadence of western societies. Thus, according to Fiss, French reactions to the German presence at the Paris Exposition already had all the ingredients that would mark the cultural collaboration with the German occupier after 1940. The Germans for their part would use the same cultural smoke-screen as in 1937 to maintain the illusion among the French that an understanding between the two nations was possible, whether in times of peace or war.</p>
