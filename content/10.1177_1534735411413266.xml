<abstract>
<p>Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are the most common, intractable and unpleasant side effects in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone have significantly improved the control of acute nausea and vomiting, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a significant clinical problem. Combined neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists with 5-HT3 antagonists and steroids are observed to be better in the control of both acute and delayed emesis. However, the use of these antiemetics is observed to possess inherent side effects. The medicinal plants such as <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>, Korean red ginseng, American ginseng berry, <italic>Ganoderma lucidum, Zingiber officinale</italic>, grape seed extract, and the oil of <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> are reported to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting mostly in preclinical studies. Of these, ginger has also been evaluated for its efficacy in humans and the results have been contradictory. The current review for the first time summarizes the results related to these properties. An attempt is also made to address the lacunae in these published studies and to emphasize aspects that need further investigations for these plants to be of use in clinics in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite significant progress in the field of cancer treatment, effective management of chemotherapy- and radiation-induced nausea and vomiting, abbreviated as CINV and RINV respectively, is still a major problem as nearly 70% to 80% of patients are affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref></sup> These complications are the most feared adverse effects of these cytotoxic treatment modalities and may compel the patient to opt out of the therapy. Severe nausea and vomiting at times leads to the development of complications such as fluid–electrolyte imbalances, weight loss, dehydration, anorexia, weakness, fractures, esophageal tears, prerenal azotemia, wound dehiscence, or decline in behavioral and mental status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>These adverse effects may deteriorate patients’ physical and mental status, self-care, and functional ability and may lead toward withdrawal from the anticancer treatment regimen. This will invariably affect the treatment outcome and survival of the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411413266">2</xref></sup> It also increases patient’s anxiety and dissatisfaction with the hospital experience and may contribute to future anticipatory nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411413266">3</xref></sup> Depending on the severity and frequency, nausea and vomiting are graded as represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534735411413266">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Depending on the time after administration of the chemotherapy/radiotherapy, nausea may be classified as acute nausea, which occurs within 24 hours after chemotherapy and can be subdivided into early acute (within 12 hours) and late acute (12 to 24 hours); delayed nausea, which appears more than 24 to 96 or 120 hours after treatment; anticipatory nausea, which occurs before a new cycle of chemotherapy in response to conditioned stimuli, such as the smells, sights, and sound of the treatment room and breakthrough nausea and vomiting that occurs despite preventive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411413266">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411413266">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The major factors that determine the incidence and severity of CINV include the dose and type of chemotherapy administered, the treatment schedule, the use of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents, and patients’ inherent characteristics. Chemotherapeutic agents such as carmustine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide (≥1500 mg<sup>2</sup>), dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, and streptozocin are the highly emetogenic and cause increased frequency of nausea and vomiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411413266">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Comparatively, RINV is not as prevalent or severe as CINV but can interrupt treatment schedule, can negatively influence the efficacy of the treatment, and can affect the quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411413266">6</xref></sup> The pathophysiology of RINV is incompletely understood but is thought to be similar to that caused by chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411413266">6</xref></sup> Unlike chemotherapy, which is systemic treatment; radiotherapy is delivered from an external source and is localized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411413266">6</xref></sup> The severity of RINV depends on the site of irradiation, the field size, and the dose per fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411413266">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411413266">7</xref></sup> RINV is very high when the total body, proper abdominal, and gastrointestinal regions are irradiated; moderate when the upper abdomen, pelvic, and cranial parts are involved; low when the lower thorax and craniospinal regions are subjected; and minimal when breast and extremities are irradiated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411413266">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411413266">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increased risk of CINV and RINV are observed in patients younger than 50 years, with history of light alcohol use, and with history of vomiting during pregnancy-induced nausea/vomiting. Additionally, patients who are dehydrated, debilitated, those who have an electrolyte imbalance, or those who have recently undergone surgery or radiation therapy, are also at greater risk of experiencing serious complications from CINV and RINV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411413266">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411413266">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411413266">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Physiological and Biochemical Basis for Nausea</title>
<p>Chronic nausea in the setting of cancer treatment is often multifactorial in origin. Factors such as raised intracranial pressure, metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, and uremia, dehydration, malignant bowel obstruction, and gastroduodenal ulcers contribute to vomiting and nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735411413266">8</xref></sup> Nausea also has a psychological basis, which may either exacerbate or induce chronic nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735411413266">8</xref></sup> Neurophysiologic studies have shown that both nausea and vomiting are controlled and mediated by the central nervous system but by different mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735411413266">9</xref></sup> Nausea is mediated through the autonomic nervous system, whereas vomiting results from the stimulation of a complex reflex that is coordinated by a putative true vomiting center.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411413266">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The vomiting center is believed to receive convergent afferent stimuli from several central neurologic pathways. The sensory stimuli of smell, taste, psychological response, and pain, led from the limbic system stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Motion sickness occurs via impulses from the labyrinthine apparatus of the inner ear. Exogenous chemicals and endogenous substances that accumulate during inflammation, ischemia, and irritation stimulate vagal and spinal nerves from visceral and vasculature to cause vomiting and nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411413266">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cause of CINV has both components, that is, peripheral and central, which makes it difficult to treat. Serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the enteric nervous system, which accounts for 80% of the total body serotonin. Intestinal irritation or damage to the neoplasm leads to release of 5HT that stimulates the 5HT3 receptors and CTZ that ultimately stimulates the vomiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411413266">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The central pathway, on the other hand, is induced by substance P, which is abundantly present in the CTZ and stimulates the neurokinin-1 receptors as well as the gastrointestinal vagal afferent nerve fiber. A multitude of receptors is effected in CINV, namely, CB1 (canabinoid-1), D3 (dopamine-3), D2 (dopamine-2), H1 (histamine-1), M3, M5 (muscarinic-3 and -5), and GABAB (gamma amino butyric acid-B). This is reflected in the wide array of antiemetic drugs that are present. There are more neurotransmitters and receptor systems in play which are as yet unascertained. In CINV sometimes although emesis is brought under control with drugs, nausea continues unabated, reducing the quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411413266">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conventional Antiemetic Agents Used in Cancer Treatment</title>
<p>Antiemetic agents are the most commonly used interventional agents in the management of treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Conventionally, an antiemetic agent should be effective against the nausea and vomiting produced by most chemotherapeutic drugs; have no interaction with the cancer chemotherapeutic agents; be available as oral, injectable, and suppository forms; possess minimal side effects, especially euphoric reactions; be efficient and reproducible gastrointestinal absorption; have therapeutic blood levels for 4 to 12 hours postadministration; be effective with repeated use; show low abuse potential; and have reasonable cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basis for antiemetic therapy is the neurochemical control of vomiting. Many antiemetics act by competitively blocking receptors for these substances, thereby inhibiting stimulation of peripheral nerves at the CTZ, and perhaps at the “vomiting center.” Combination of antiemetic regimens has become the standard care for the control of CINV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411413266">10</xref></sup> However, the choice is complicated as when selecting an antiemetic the clinicians must opt for an agent that provides optimal protection against nausea and vomiting while avoiding drug–drug (antiemetic–anticancer) interactions and additional adverse events. The other factors that need to be considered are the dose of antineoplastic agent used, the combination of antineoplastic drugs, route of administration, and the treatment schedule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regimens to prevent radiation- and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are guided by the emetogenic potential of the drug dose and the combinatorial agents used. Patients in a hospital setup receiving highly emetogenic potential chemotherapy, may require higher doses of antiemetics, whereas those receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy on an outpatient basis may do best with sublingual or rectal antiemetic routes of delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411413266">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref></sup> Various classes of antiemetics, their applications, and inherent side effects are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534735411413266">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534735411413266">3</xref>.</p>

<title>Plants as Antiemetic Agents</title>
<p>Complementary therapies are widely used throughout the world and according to a recent report almost 80% of the global population relies on alternative therapies for their health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534735411413266">11</xref></sup> When compared with the conventionally used drugs of modern medicine, these medications are clearly underresearched. However, their wide acceptance makes it imperative that scientific investigations are performed with the plants commonly used in the various traditional systems of medicine and have been practiced for centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534735411413266">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observations suggest that traditional knowledge and plants have contributed to the development of antiemetic drugs in the prevention of CINV and RINV and the development of the cannabinoids dronabinol, nabilone, marinol, and cannabis from <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> commonly known as marijuana is the best example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411413266">4</xref></sup> Scientific studies carried out in the past 2 decades have shown that some of the most important medicinal plants, for xample, <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>, Korean red ginseng, American ginseng berry, <italic>Ganoderma lucidum, Zingiber officinale</italic>, and grape seed extract possess antiemetic action against CINV and mint oil and ginger against RINV.

After a latency period of 1 hour, the episodes of nausea and vomiting initiated and reached a peak at 1.5 hours and persisted for 3 hours. Oral administration of the extract (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 g/kg) reduced the cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting in a concentration-dependent manner.

The authors observed that the acetone and 50% ethanolic extract at the doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg per os (p.o.). exhibited significant protection whereas aqueous extract at these doses was ineffective against emesis. The acetone extract was more effective than ethanolic extract but was less effective than granisetron.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534735411413266">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The acetone and 50% ethanolic extract of ginger in the doses of 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg (p.o.) and fresh ginger juice (2 and 4 mL/kg) were also investigated against cisplatin effect on gastric emptying in rats. It was observed that all the 3 ginger preparations reversed the cisplatin-induced delay in gastric emptying, and the ginger juice and acetone extract were more effective than the 50% ethanolic extract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534735411413266">52</xref></sup> The reversal produced by the ginger juice was better than the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, whereas that of the acetone extract of ginger was similar to ondansetron.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534735411413266">52</xref></sup> Together, these studies suggest that ginger possesses antiemetic effects and also reduces the gastrointestinal side effects of cisplatin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534735411413266">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534735411413266">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gingerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735411413266">Figure 1</xref>), the active principle of raw ginger, was also investigated for its antiemetic effects against the cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg i.p.)-induced emesis in minks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534735411413266">53</xref></sup> Pretreatment with gingerol (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, i.g.) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the number of retching and vomiting incidents during the 6-hour observation period. The effects of 200 mg/kg of gingerol and the positive control ondansetron were almost similar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534735411413266">53</xref></sup> Immunohistochemical studies showed that gingerol caused a dose-dependent suppression in the levels of substance P and NK1 receptors in area postrema and ileum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534735411413266">53</xref></sup></p>

<p>Studies by Sharma et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534735411413266">54</xref></sup> have shown that the administration of the hydroalcoholic extract of ginger 1 hour before exposure to 2 Gy of γ irradiation was effective in blocking the saccharin avoidance response for 5 posttreatment observational days. The study showed that intraperitoneal administration of the extract (50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg body weight) to male rats caused a dose- and time-dependent protective effect and that the best effects were observed at 200 mg/kg body weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534735411413266">54</xref></sup> It was also observed that in the female rats (administered with 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg/kg body weight) the optimal effect was observed at 250 mg/kg by intraperitoneal route, confirming the existence of gender difference in relation to behavioral responses or differential metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534735411413266">55</xref></sup> The authors hypothesize that the observed protective effects of ginger may be because of its antioxidant properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534735411413266">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534735411413266">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The antiemetic studies with ginger in humans have been mixed and contradictory. In one of the earliest studies, Pace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534735411413266">56</xref></sup> investigated the antiemetic effect of ginger in leukemic patients receiving chemotherapy. The patients were randomized to receive oral ginger or placebo in addition to prochlorperazine. The results showed that when compared with those receiving placebo, a significant reduction in nausea was observed in patients receiving ginger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534735411413266">56</xref></sup> Furthermore, pilot studies by Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534735411413266">57</xref></sup> and Pecoraro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534735411413266">58</xref></sup> have also supported ginger’s use as an antiemetic in patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Additionally, experiments have confirmed that ginger is effective in reducing nausea and vomiting induced by low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with other anticancer drugs causing mild emesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534735411413266">59</xref></sup> However, the antiemetic efficacy of ginger was found to be equal to that of metoclopramide but inferior to that of ondansetron.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534735411413266">59</xref></sup> Combining high-protein meals with ginger also reduced the chemotherapy-induced delayed nausea and the use of standard antiemetic medications in patients with cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534735411413266">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a double-blinded crossover study, Manusirivithaya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534735411413266">61</xref></sup> have observed that the addition of ginger to standard antiemetic regimen of gynecologic oncology patients receiving cisplatin offered no advantage in reducing nausea or vomiting in the acute phase of cisplatin-induced emesis, whereas in the delayed phase it was effective and that the beneficial effect was comparable to that of metoclopramide.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that the administration of ginger (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 g) along with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists reduced the chemotherapy-induced nausea in patients undergoing treatment for breast, alimentary, and lung cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534735411413266">62</xref></sup> The optimal effect was observed for the cohorts who had received 0.5 or 1.0 g of ginger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534735411413266">62</xref></sup> Very recently, Pillai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534735411413266">63</xref></sup> have also observed that ginger root powder was effective in reducing the severity of acute and delayed CINV when provided as a adjunct to ondensetron and dexamethasone in bone sarcoma patients receiving the highly emetogenic chemotherapy containing cisplatin/doxorubicin. Together, these reports clearly suggest the usefulness of ginger as an adjuvant to the conventional antiemetic agents.</p>
<p>Contradictory to these observations is the recent study by Zick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534735411413266">64</xref></sup> suggesting that ginger offers no benefit in reducing the prevalence or severity of acute or delayed CINV when combined with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and/or aprepitant. Furthermore, the authors also observed that the participants who took both ginger and aprepitant had more severe acute nausea than participants who took only aprepitant, suggesting a possible antagonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534735411413266">64</xref></sup> Overall, these observations clearly suggest that more observational studies, with a larger sample size, are needed to confirm the encouraging preliminary data on ginger safety.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Numerous preclinical studies in the past 2 decades have demonstrated unequivocally that traditionally used plants such as <italic>S baicalensis</italic>, Korean red ginseng, American ginseng berry, <italic>G lucidum</italic>, ginger, and grape seed extract possess antiemetic actions against CINV, and mint oil and ginger against RINV. Most of the antiemetic studies against CINV have been with cisplatin and future studies are required with other chemotherapeutic agents and their combinations that induce emesis. This would clearly indicate the spectrum of efficacy of these plants in preventing CINV. The outcomes of such studies may be useful for the clinical applications of these plants and their phytochemicals as antiemetic agents and may open up a new therapeutic avenue.</p>
<p>Most of the plants studied have been used in traditional systems of medicine for many centuries. These plants are consumed by humans and are reported to be devoid of toxic effects at the permissible doses. However, the observation that some of the plants possess pro-oxidant effects necessitates performing detailed toxicological studies to understand the antioxidant and pro-oxidant concentrations of these plants. Some of the administration has been by intraperitoneal route, which is not the preferred route for humans. Studies should be planned to test the efficacy of these plants when administered through oral route. Experimental studies should also be performed with tumor-bearing animals to rule out the possibility of interference of these plant compounds with the antineoplastic activity of the emetogenic anticancer agents. Only when these studies are performed and satisfactory results obtained, can the value of these plants as antiemetic agents be appreciated.</p>
<p>From the contradictory clinical observations with ginger and the animal studies with grape seed extracts it is very evident that the concentration of phytochemical plays a major role in the observed pharmacological effects. Therefore, studies should also be performed with well-characterized and standardized extracts. Studies should also be aimed at identification of the bioactive compounds present in the respective plants that are responsible for the antiemetic effects. Currently, only gingerol and ginsenoside, the active principles of raw ginger and ginseng, respectively, have been reported to possess antiemetic effects. Similar studies should also be performed with other phytochemicals. When these studies are performed, it will clearly indicate the potential of these plants as possible nontoxic antiemetic agents against chemotherapy- and radiation-induced nausea. Till then, caution needs to be taken especially with the plants that exhibit pro-oxidant effects (at higher doses) as their use can further increase emesis and aggravate side effects, thereby affecting the treatment response/regimen and survival of the patient.</p>
