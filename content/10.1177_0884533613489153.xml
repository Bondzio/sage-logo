<abstract>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the pediatric population. Increased recognition of this form of liver disease parallels the dramatic rise in childhood and adolescent obesity over the past 2 decades. Like adults, most children with NAFLD are obese, and comorbidities include insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Unfortunately, pediatric NAFLD is not always a benign condition, with some children progressing to hepatic fibrosis and even cirrhosis in severe cases. The etiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is not yet fully understood; however, hepatic steatosis in the context of insulin resistance and increased oxidative stress may lead to progressive disease. Although physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and radiographic findings provide clues to the potential presence of fatty liver disease, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Lifestyle modification, including slow and steady weight loss, improved dietary habits, and increased daily, aerobic physical activity, remains the first-line approach in treating pediatric fatty liver disease. Antioxidant pharmacologic therapy such as use of vitamin E has shown some benefit in patients with biopsy-proven steatohepatitis. Nutrition plays an essential role not only in the development of fatty liver disease but also potentially in the treatment and prevention of progression to more severe disease.</p>

<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the pediatric population. The emergence of this chronic medical condition has paralleled the dramatic rise in child and adolescent obesity over the past 2 decades. Often referred to as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is often accompanied by other cardiovascular and endocrine consequences of obesity, including hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Even in childhood, fatty liver can lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533613489153">1</xref></sup> Weight loss and exercise remain the mainstay of treatment of fatty liver disease. Nutrition, therefore, plays a role in the development of fatty liver disease in at-risk patients, as well as in its treatment.</p>

<title>History</title>
<p>First described by Ludwig et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533613489153">2</xref></sup> in 1980, NAFLD describes a pattern of liver injury similar to that seen in patients with alcoholic liver disease but in individuals without a history of alcohol consumption. This pattern of liver injury is not unique to adults, with the first pediatric cases reported by Moran and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533613489153">3</xref></sup> in 1983. Fatty liver disease became a globally recognized phenomenon with reports emerging from around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533613489153">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613489153"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533613489153">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Definition and Terminology</title>
<p>NAFLD, defined as macrovesicular fat accumulation in more than 5% of hepatocytes, encompasses a spectrum of liver disease, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis. Simple steatosis is the accumulation of fat of varying degrees within hepatocytes without evidence of inflammation. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is the combination of fatty infiltration of hepatocytes with the presence of inflammation. This liver cell injury is often manifested by ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes and increased Mallory’s hyaline deposition. Progressive inflammation in both pediatric and adult NASH patients can lead to scarring or fibrosis of the liver and, in severe cases, even cirrhosis. It is important to note that in NAFLD, these findings are present in patients without a history of significant alcohol consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533613489153">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-0884533613489153">
<title>Pathogenesis</title>
<p>The pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD is not yet fully understood. It is clear that fatty liver disease is strongly associated with obesity and insulin resistance. A “2-hit” hypothesis for the development of NAFLD proposed by Day and James<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533613489153">8</xref></sup> has been widely accepted by many researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533613489153">9</xref></sup> The first “hit” is accumulation of fat within the hepatocytes. Insulin resistance is thought to further promote hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing fatty acids in the liver. Hepatic steatosis can impair insulin signaling and may induce hepatic insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613489153">10</xref></sup> The simple presence of fat in the liver is not necessarily injurious to the liver in itself. Why and how simple steatosis progresses to inflammation, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis is not fully understood. Oxidative stress leading to increased inflammation has been proposed as the second hit that results in liver injury. It has been shown that there are increased levels of lipid peroxidation in NASH patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533613489153">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533613489153"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533613489153"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533613489153">14</xref></sup> The end products of lipid peroxidation, such as 4-hydroxynonenol and malondialdehyde, may induce inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in the progression of steatosis to NASH or even cirrhosis in severe cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533613489153">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>There have been conflicting studies evaluating the role of high-fructose diets in promoting steatosis and fibrosis by stimulating inflammatory cascades in hepatic cells. Kelley and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533613489153">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that rats fed a high-fructose diet showed changes in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway consistent with an inflammatory response. Their model suggested that high-fructose diets led to lipid dysregulation due to activation of inflammatory pathways in the liver. However, others have shown that high-fructose diets alone cannot account for the hepatic changes seen in NAFLD. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533613489153">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that Ossabaw swine fed high-calorie and high-fructose diets developed evidence of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, glucose intolerance, and hypertension. However, no hepatic changes were evident either in biochemistries or histology until a high-fructose diet was combined with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet.</p>
<p>Increased visceral adiposity is a well-known component of the metabolic syndrome. Adults and children with NAFLD often demonstrate evidence of increased central obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533613489153">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533613489153">19</xref></sup> Obesity has been shown to be associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)–6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor–α. This increased inflammatory state may further play a “second hit” role, leading to progressive liver injury in NASH patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533613489153">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<sec id="section5-0884533613489153">
<title>Age</title>
<p>NAFLD is now the most common etiology of chronic liver disease in both adults and children in the developed world. It most commonly presents in the pediatric population in the prepubertal or early adolescent years. There are case reports of fatty liver disease presenting in children as young as 2–3 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533613489153">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613489153">22</xref></sup> Most hepatologists, however, evaluate other potential causes of hepatic steatosis when a child presents in very early childhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0884533613489153">
<title>Sex</title>
<p>Fatty liver disease is more common among male children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533613489153">23</xref></sup> In an autopsy study by Schwimmer and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613489153">22</xref></sup> liver biopsy specimens reviewed in children who died from natural causes revealed 10.5% of boys and 7.4% of girls had some degree of NAFLD. There may be histologic differences among boys and girls in the location and type of inflammation of fatty liver disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0884533613489153">
<title>Race and Ethnicity</title>
<p>Interestingly, there are clear racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of pediatric NAFLD, with the highest rate reported in Hispanic male adolescents. The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH trial), a study of cardiovascular risk factors among obese children and adolescents, revealed elevated transaminases in 36% of Hispanic adolescents and in 22% of non-Hispanic whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533613489153">24</xref></sup> These findings were supported in another study by Schwimmer and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533613489153">23</xref></sup> in which elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was present among 53% of obese Hispanic youth between the ages of 5 and 19 years compared with 25% of non-Hispanic whites of a similar age. Although there is a clear predominance of fatty liver disease among Hispanic youth, there seems to be a relative paucity of fatty liver disease in African American children. In the study by Schwimmer and colleagues, elevated ALT was as low as 14% in obese African American children compared with 22% of white patients and 36% of Hispanic youth. They found the differences among these 3 groups to be statistically significant. These data were supported by findings in the autopsy study by Schwimmer et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613489153">22</xref></sup> published in 2006, which reported that prevalence differed significantly by race and ethnicity with fatty liver among 11.8% of Hispanic children, 10.2% of Asian children, 8.6% of white children, and only 1.5% of black children.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0884533613489153">
<title>Prevalence</title>
<p>The overall prevalence of pediatric fatty liver disease can be difficult to determine due to the different ages, races, and ethnicities of pediatric populations studied and variations in parameters used to define fatty liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533613489153">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533613489153">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533613489153">26</xref></sup> Using an elevated ALT above the upper limits of normal as a criterion for fatty liver disease, researchers estimated a prevalence of 3% of adolescent children with elevations in aminotransferases in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1998–2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533613489153">27</xref></sup> A school-based study of obese children in Minnesota, California, Texas, and Louisiana found that 23% of obese 17- to 18-year-olds had an ALT of &gt;40 U/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613489153">22</xref></sup> Histology is considered the gold standard for diagnosing fatty liver disease. In an autopsy study, Schwimmer and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533613489153">22</xref></sup> reviewed liver biopsy specimens of 742 children ages 2–19 years who died from nonhepatic diseases. They reported an NAFLD prevalence of nearly 10% when data were adjusted for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Interestingly, this prevalence increased to nearly 40% when evaluating the data from only obese adolescents. The authors noted there was an overrepresentation of Hispanic males in late adolescence in this study. Multivariate analysis, showed that older age, male sex, being overweight, and Hispanic ethnicity were independent predictors of fatty liver disease in the population studied.</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of fatty liver disease among the children parallels the increasing trends in pediatric obesity. Both the prevalence and the severity of obesity have increased among North American children in the past several decades. NHANES data report an increase in adolescent obesity from 5% in 1960 to 15% in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533613489153">28</xref></sup> More recent NHANES data from 2007–2008 report that 17% of U.S. children and adolescents are obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533613489153">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533613489153">29</xref></sup> This increase in obesity is seen across all age groups, with obesity increasing from 5%–10% in preschool-aged children from 1976–1980 and 2007–2008. Among school-age children, the prevalence of obesity increased from 6.5%–19.6% and among adolescent children from 5%–18.1% during the same period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533613489153">29</xref></sup> With the rise in childhood obesity, there are growing reports of increasing rates of comorbidities associated with obesity, including insulin resistance, hypertension, and fatty liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533613489153">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533613489153">31</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0884533613489153">
<title>Clinical Presentation</title>
<p>Although many patients with fatty liver disease are asymptomatic, the most common physical complaint among NAFLD patients is abdominal pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533613489153">32</xref></sup> In a retrospective study of pediatric patients with biopsy-proven fatty liver disease, abdominal pain was reported in 18 of 43 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533613489153">33</xref></sup> In another multicenter study surveying 106 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, 6% presented with vague abdominal pain. Other reported symptoms among pediatric NAFLD patients include fatigue, irritability, headache, and difficulty concentrating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533613489153">34</xref></sup> Many patients are incidentally discovered to have fatty liver disease when elevated transaminases are determined during routine testing with a comprehensive metabolic panel during evaluation of obesity or unrelated physical complaints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0884533613489153">
<title>Natural History</title>
<p>Although many patients with fatty liver disease have stable, simple steatosis, the natural history of fatty liver disease among the adult population can be a slowly progressive disease that can advance to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533613489153">35</xref></sup> In adult patients with simple steatosis, there is low risk for progressive liver injury, whereas adult patients with NASH are more likely to progress to cirrhotic liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533613489153">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533613489153">37</xref></sup> The data on natural history in the pediatric population are more limited. In a retrospective, single-center study of 66 children with NAFLD, Feldstein and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533613489153">38</xref></sup> reported on 66 children with NAFLD with a 20-year follow-up. Five of these patients had serial liver biopsies over varying periods; 4 had progressive fibrosis, 2 developed diabetes, 2 had transplants, and 2 died from cirrhosis. Strikingly, the 2 patients who had transplants developed recurrent NASH in the transplanted liver. Kohli and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533613489153">39</xref></sup> published 2 cases of rather rapid progression of fibrosis over 3–5 years in 2 pediatric patients with NAFLD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0884533613489153">
<title>Physical Examination Findings</title>
<p>Physical examination findings accompanying fatty liver disease may include obesity, hepatomegaly, acanthosis nigricans, and hypertension. Obese children with disproportionate central or truncal obesity, often seen in metabolic syndrome, may be at increased risk for fatty liver disease and more at risk for fatty liver disease that progresses from simple steatosis to fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533613489153">40</xref></sup> Acanthosis nigricans, a dermatologic manifestation of insulin resistance or hyperinsulinism, is commonly seen in children with NAFLD. It is characterized by hyperpigmentation and a velvety thickening of the skin most commonly found along the nape of the neck, axilla, knees, knuckles, and skin folds. Acanthosis nigricans has been reported in up to half of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533613489153">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533613489153">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533613489153">41</xref></sup> Hepatomegaly, although often difficult to detect on physical examination secondary to obese body habitus, has been reported in up to 50% of patients with NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533613489153">42</xref></sup> Elevated blood pressure is another common finding in both metabolic syndrome and pediatric NAFLD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533613489153">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533613489153">43</xref></sup> As the majority of NAFLD patients are asymptomatic, physical examination findings can provide important clues to the presence of fatty liver disease. It is important for physicians, dieticians, and other care providers to maintain a high degree of suspicion in obese patients presenting with elevated blood pressure, central obesity, hepatomegaly, and acanthosis nigricans and identify those patients who should undergo further evaluation for potential fatty liver disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0884533613489153">
<title>Comorbidities</title>
<p>NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Common comorbidities in NASH patients include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin-resistant diabetes. Patients with NAFLD have higher rates of cardiovascular risk markers such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides than do obese teens without NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533613489153">44</xref></sup> Several studies in both pediatric and adult populations have provided evidence that insulin resistance is common among NAFLD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533613489153">33</xref></sup> Some centers have reported the presence of insulin resistance in up to 95% of patients with biopsy-proven NASH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533613489153">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dyslipidemia, another component of metabolic syndrome, is commonly seen in pediatric NAFLD patients. In a Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) study evaluating the association between metabolic syndrome and liver histology among children with NAFLD, Patton and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533613489153">45</xref></sup> studied 254 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 17 years with fatty liver. Of the 254 children included in this study, 26% met criteria for metabolic syndrome, defined as 3 or more of the following criteria: central obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, and elevated blood pressure. Although central obesity (67.1%) and hypertension (44.7%) were the most common components of metabolic syndrome seen among the children studied, dyslipidemia was present in about 25%. Interestingly, there was a decreased prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia among Hispanic children (22.9% vs 33.3%) in this study; however, the Hispanic children did show an increased prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In this study, the presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with severity of steatosis but not severity of fibrosis. Of the individual components of metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia was not an independent predictor of severity of steatosis or fibrosis, whereas insulin resistance was.</p>
<p>Several studies have explored the relation between severity of fatty liver disease and cardiovascular health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533613489153">46</xref></sup> In a study by Targher and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533613489153">47</xref></sup> carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis, was evaluated with ultrasound in 85 adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH and compared with results from 160 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)–matched healthy controls. They discovered that patients with NAFLD had significantly greater carotid IMT when compared with controls. Degree of IMT also correlated with severity of liver disease, with the greatest degree of thickness seen among the NASH patients and least thickness noted with the normal controls. Furthermore, the histologic severity of NAFLD independently predicted carotid IMT after adjustment for cofounding variables.</p>
<p>Although insulin resistance is very common in NAFLD, many patients progress to a diagnosis of diabetes. NAFLD is present in 50%–60% of adults with type II diabetes mellitus and up to 45% of patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Adult patients with type II diabetes mellitus and NAFLD appear to have more progressive liver disease and more fibrosis and even cirrhosis compared with those with simple steatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533613489153">10</xref></sup> Disturbingly, in a recent abstract describing the natural history of NASH in a group of 57 children who were controls in a therapeutic trial, 10% developed diabetes during the 2 years of study follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533613489153">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bone health has also been evaluated in pediatric patients with fatty liver disease. Pardee and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533613489153">49</xref></sup> evaluated bone mineral density among obese children with and without fatty liver disease. Thirty-eight children with biopsy-proven NAFLD were matched by age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, and weight with children without evidence of liver disease. Bone mineral density was measured, and age- and sex-specific <italic>z</italic> scores were compared between obese children with and without NASH. Bone mineral density was significantly lower among the NAFLD patients (<italic>z</italic> score of −1.98) compared with the obese controls (<italic>z</italic> score of .048). Furthermore, those patients with more severe disease (ie, NASH vs simple steatosis) had statistically lower <italic>z</italic> scores (<italic>z</italic> score of −2.37) compared with NAFLD patients without steatohepatitis (<italic>z</italic> score of −1.58). Interestingly, these differences persisted despite controlling for total percent body fat.</p>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common comorbidity affecting obese patients. The estimated prevalence of OSA among the general population has been reported from 1%–4%, with a marked increase among obese patients, whose rates are between 25% and 35%. Adult studies have suggested that there is a greater than 90% prevalence of OSA among patients with NAFLD. There has been speculation that the hypoxemia associated with OSA may contribute to the injury pattern and oxidative stress contributing to NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533613489153">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533613489153"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533613489153">52</xref></sup></p>

<title>Laboratory Evaluation</title>
<p>Evaluating children for fatty liver disease often starts with basic laboratory evaluation. Classically, aminotransferases are mildly elevated, with ALT being greater than aspartate aminotransferase (AST). However, patients with NASH may have normal aminotransferases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533613489153">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533613489153">54</xref></sup> Degree of elevation of aminotransferases does not always indicate more severe disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533613489153">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533613489153">56</xref></sup> There are case reports of patients with biopsy-proven NASH with completely normal liver enzymes. In an abstract by Molleston and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0884533613489153">57</xref></sup> that evaluated children with NASH and an ALT of &lt;60 U/L, 87% of patients studied had stage 0 or 1 fibrosis, 3% had bridging fibrosis, and 3% had biopsy-proven cirrhosis. The usefulness of ALT is impaired by the fact that the upper limit of ALT used in children’s hospitals varies widely and is based on locally defined reference populations which may include children who are obese or have liver disease. “Normal” ALT is thus often set too high to reliably indicate the presence of liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533613489153">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>In patients with persistently elevated liver enzymes, it is important to consider evaluating for other causes of chronic liver disease, including α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, and hemochromatosis. It is notable that positive serum autoantibodies are present in a significant number of both pediatric and adult patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533613489153">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533613489153">56</xref></sup> The possibility of underlying metabolic liver disease should be considered in atypical cases, especially among the very young.

<title>Radiographic Evaluation</title>
<p>Radiographic evaluation can assist in the diagnosis of NAFLD in pediatric patients. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently the primary modalities for the radiographic assessment of pediatric NAFLD. Abdominal ultrasound is the least invasive imaging modality and can detect the presence of hepatic steatosis. Fat accumulation in the liver results in a hyperechoic or bright appearance on ultrasound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0884533613489153">58</xref></sup> Ultrasound is favorable in that it is easily obtainable, noninvasive, and relatively inexpensive. Sonographic imaging, however, does have several limitations. Ultrasound imaging can be operator and machine dependent. The degree of hyperechogenicity can also be altered by other variables such as body habitus. Studies have suggested a marked decrease in sensitivity and specificity secondary to severely obese body habitus, and in 1 study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0884533613489153">59</xref></sup> when mild steatosis was found on liver biopsy, sensitivity of detection on ultrasound was only 43%. One of the greatest limitations with standard ultrasound imaging is the inability to determine the degree of steatosis and detect evidence of inflammation, liver cell injury and fibrosis, or progression of disease.</p>
<p>MRI is more accurate than ultrasonography in assessing severity of liver fat in NAFLD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533613489153">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0884533613489153">60</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy can measure quantity of fat and water in the liver more precisely than standard MRI techniques, but it is more expensive and often more difficult to obtain, especially in young pediatric patients.</p>
<p>Although sonography and standard MR/MR spectroscopy can detect the presence and degree of fat in the liver, they are unable to detect the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. Novel methods of ultrasound and MR are currently being studied to further characterize the degree of fibrosis with these imaging modalities. Transient elastography, an ultrasound method to detect the degree of liver “stiffness” or fibrosis, has been the subject of intense research interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0884533613489153">61</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section15-0884533613489153">
<title>Histologic Evaluation</title>
<p>Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD, and distinct histopathologic features characteristic of NAFLD have been described in adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0884533613489153">62</xref></sup> Although children display many of the findings seen in adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH, they also have unique characteristics. The characteristic histologic findings seen in adult NASH patients include macrovesicular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and Mallory hyaline. With the goal of further defining histologic features of pediatric NAFLD, Schwimmer and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0884533613489153">63</xref></sup> reported on a large series of liver biopsy findings in pediatric patients with fatty liver disease. Liver biopsy specimens from 100 children ages 2–18 years with fatty liver disease were reviewed. They defined 2 distinct forms of histologic findings among the patients studied. Seventeen percent of pediatric patients showed findings consistent with typical adult NASH patterns, including steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and perisinusoidal fibrosis without portal involvement. They classified this as typical type 1 NASH. However, 51% of their patients had a different pattern of liver injury, with marked steatosis and inflammation most notable in the portal areas. Pediatric patients also tended to show less evidence of the ballooning degeneration, which is often characteristic in adult patients. This pattern of liver injury was called type 2 NASH. Schwimmer and colleagues also noted age, sex, race, and ethnicity differences between the 2 patterns of NASH, with type 2 NASH patterns being more common among boys and Asian, Native American, and Hispanic children. Children with type 2 NASH also tended to be younger and had more severe obesity than those with type 1 NASH. Schwimmer and colleagues suggested that given the distinct pathologic and demographic differences noted between adult and pediatric patients, there may be important pathophysiologic differences between adult and pediatric NASH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0884533613489153">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are no clear guidelines on the timing of liver biopsy in the pediatric NAFLD patient. The decision to obtain histologic confirmation of fatty liver disease must be weighed against the inherent risks associated with the procedure. At this time, biopsy is still considered the gold standard method in determining the presence or degree of inflammation, fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Biopsy can also help confirm the diagnosis in some cases that are not inherently clear, such as when obese patients have mildly elevated autoantibodies and when Wilson disease is a consideration. Current research is evaluating the role of noninvasive biomarkers in determining the degree of fibrosis in patients with fatty liver disease.</p>

<sec id="section16-0884533613489153">
<title>Screening</title>
<p>Screening for NAFLD is essential for identifying children at increased risk for fatty liver disease. Healthcare workers’ awareness of the comorbidities associated with NAFLD, such as metabolic syndrome (hypertension, insulin resistance, and truncal obesity), in association with physical examination findings, such as acanthosis nigricans, may motivate providers to screen for the possibility of liver disease. However, there is not a consensus on the most practical screening method. Although ultrasound can detect up to three-fourths of patients with fatty liver, it may not be a realistic screening tool. Recently, an American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Committee on obesity suggested a biannual screening for liver disease with serum AST and ALT starting at age 10 years in obese children with a BMI greater than the 95th percentile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533613489153">64</xref></sup> It is prudent to remember, however, that a certain percentage of patients with fatty liver disease have normal transaminases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0884533613489153">65</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section17-0884533613489153">
<title>Treatment</title>
<p>The goal of treating fatty liver disease in the pediatric population focuses on improving not only liver injury and preventing progression of inflammation to fibrosis but also the comorbidities known to be associated with fatty liver disease. Unfortunately, to date, only a very limited number of randomized controlled studies have evaluated the effectiveness of treatment strategies in pediatric fatty liver disease.</p>
<sec id="section18-0884533613489153">
<title>Weight Loss and Exercise</title>
<p>Obesity underlies almost all pediatric fatty liver disease. Addressing obesity with weight loss and exercise is currently the mainstay of treatment for pediatric fatty liver disease, and some studies have shown success in improving liver enzymes and liver histology as well. The degree of weight loss required to change laboratory or histologic findings of fatty liver disease has been debated. Adult studies have suggested that a weight loss of &gt;5% is associated with improvement in fat and inflammation on liver biopsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0884533613489153">66</xref></sup> Nobili and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0884533613489153">67</xref></sup> have published several studies evaluating the effectiveness of lifestyle changes, including weight loss programs and exercise regimens, on improving fatty liver disease and its comorbidities in children. Nobili et al have also shown that diet and exercise can improve the comorbidities associated with fatty liver disease, including glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels. In their 2006 prospective study, 84 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and elevated AST and ALT underwent a 2-hour glucose tolerance test followed by a 12-month program of lifestyle advice focusing on physical activity and dietary modifications. Patients who completed the diet and exercise program had a significant improvement in BMI, fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, and liver enzymes. They also demonstrated improved echogenicity on liver ultrasound. A later study suggested that lifestyle interventions also have a favorable impact on liver histology. A total of 53 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included in the study. Lifestyle intervention consisted of a diet individualized to meet each patient’s caloric needs. All patients were encouraged to increase their daily physical activity. Patients were then randomized to receive placebo or α-tocopherol 600 IU/d plus ascorbic acid 500 mg/d and were treated for 24 months. Results showed the amount of weight lost at 24 months was similar in the placebo and antioxidant groups. There was improvement in the degree of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning in both groups. Lifestyle intervention with diet and increased physical activity were thus associated with weight loss and a significant improvement in liver histology and laboratory abnormalities in pediatric NAFLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0884533613489153">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the known association between obesity and fatty liver disease, many have questioned whether specific dietary components may make individuals more susceptible to developing fatty liver disease. For instance, some research has suggested a role for excess fructose as a risk factor for the development of fatty liver disease. In a study by Ouyang and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0884533613489153">69</xref></sup> a dietary history, serum, and liver tissue were obtained from 49 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and compared with 24 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls. Results revealed fructose consumption was 2–3 times greater among the NAFLD patients compared with controls. Furthermore, patients with NAFLD also showed increased hepatic messenger RNA expression of fructokinase, an enzyme important in fructose metabolism, as well as increased fatty acid synthase, an enzyme important in lipogenesis. Although this study suggested a role for increased dietary fructose playing a role in development of fatty liver disease, other studies evaluating the effectiveness of a low-fructose diet on improving fatty liver disease have not been promising. A randomized, controlled, 6-month pilot study of 10 children with NAFLD compared the effectiveness of a low-fructose vs a low-fat diet in improving ALT in NALFD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0884533613489153">70</xref></sup> Patients on the low-fructose diet eliminated sugar-containing beverages, fruit juice, and food items in which high-fructose corn syrup was a primary ingredient. Patients on the low-fat diet were asked to adhere to recommendations from the American Heart Association (AHA). Oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and isoprostane levels were analyzed in blood and urine. Patients in the low-fructose group had decreased caloric intake per day compared with the low-fat group (22.5 kcal/kg/d vs 29.6 kcal/kg/d). At the end of 6 months, the oxidized LDL cholesterol was significantly lower in the low-fructose group. However, ALT levels did not change in either group.</p>
<p>Lower carbohydrate diets have been studied in adults. Ryan and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0884533613489153">71</xref></sup> suggested that a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet may have benefit in adult NAFLD patients irrespective of weight loss. In this study, patients were randomized to receive a hypocaloric diet composed of either 60% carbohydrate and 25% fat or 40% carbohydrate and 45% fat. The patients in the low-carbohydrate diet group showed lower levels of ALT than the higher carbohydrate/fat diet irrespective of weight loss.</p>
<p>Simple recommendations, such as limiting the amount of time children spend watching television, can have a positive impact on potential weight loss. For many years, reports have linked increased television time to childhood obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0884533613489153">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0884533613489153">73</xref></sup> Increased television watching may also be associated with other features of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension. In a study by Pardee and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0884533613489153">74</xref></sup> 546 obese children aged 4–17 years were enrolled in a study aimed at identifying whether television watching was associated with hypertension in obese children. They discovered that television time was positively correlated with the severity of obesity and that the severity of obesity and daily time spent in front of the television were significant and independent predictors for hypertension. Limiting television viewing to less than 2 hours per day has also been formally recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0884533613489153">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Weight loss is an important part of managing NAFLD. Weight loss goals should be individualized based on patients’ ages and BMI. In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics published recommendations from an expert committee on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533613489153">64</xref></sup> Treatment strategies emphasize 4 stages of care, including prevention, structured weight management, comprehensive multidisciplinary intervention, and tertiary care intervention. Prevention strategies are often simple and broad based such as focusing on basic healthy lifestyle eating and exercise habits, which can be routinely discussed in an outpatient setting. Structured weight management, the second stage of care, emphasizes specific goals; for instance, in patients with a BMI &gt;99th percentile, weight loss goals are not to exceed more than 2 pounds per week. For more intense behavioral changes and intervention, stage 3 may involve involving a multidisciplinary team with extensive experience in childhood obesity with expert medical, psychological, dietary, and physical therapy specialists. Stage 4 interventions often may involve pharmacologic or surgical therapy for weight loss.</p>
<p>Addressing weight loss and exercise in children should involve a multidisciplinary approach between primary care physician, gastroenterologists, and registered dieticians. Involving psychologists to work on motivational practices, in addition to occupational therapists or exercise physiologists, can be useful tools as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533613489153">64</xref></sup> Setting small, realistic, and obtainable goals is more likely to achieve success and maintain motivation. Consultation with registered dieticians on a regular basis can help track caloric intake, identify caloric goals necessary to achieve healthy weight loss, and ensure well-balanced healthy diets. AHA guidelines for dietary strategies in obese individuals can serve as guidelines for creating dietary plans. For example, the AHA recommends keeping total fat intake to &lt;35% of total calories and limiting trans-fat consumption to &lt;1% and saturated fat consumption to &lt;7% of total daily calories. For children and teens, many calories are “wasted” on intake of sugar-filled drinks. Based on a 2000-calorie diet, the AHA recommends limiting sugar-sweetened beverages to 36 ounces or less per week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0884533613489153">76</xref></sup> “MyPlate,” created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has replaced the traditional “food pyramid” to allow for easy and straightforward recommendations on appropriate food portions and food groups recommended for each meal, based on the USDA and Department of Health and Human Services Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 report. For instance, each meal should consist of slightly more than one-fourth vegetables, slightly less than one-fourth fruit, one-fourth grains, and one-fourth lean protein with a serving of nonfat or 1% milk. ChooseMyPlate.gov is an excellent web resource for children and families.</p>
<p>Increasing physical activity has also been key in the current treatment recommendations for pediatric NAFLD. Kistler and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533613489153">77</xref></sup> published a retrospective study in 2011 with the NASH CRN research group evaluating physical activity recommendations, exercise intensity, and histologic severity of NAFLD in 813 adult patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. They reported that neither moderate-intensity exercise nor total exercise per week was associated with NASH or stage of fibrosis. However, they found that there was an association with vigorous exercise and decreased severity of NASH, indicating that the intensity of exercise may be more important than the total volume or duration of exercise. In 2008, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued comprehensive guidelines on the type, duration, and intensity of physical activity for children and adolescents 6 years and older.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0884533613489153">78</xref></sup> The guidelines emphasized the importance of 60 minutes or more of daily aerobic physical activity such as walking, running, swimming, and biking. This document emphasized that activity should be of either moderate or vigorous intensity. Age-appropriate muscle strengthening (eg, push-ups, sit-ups) and bone-strengthening physical activity (eg, tennis, jump rope, hopscotch) at least 3 days per week was recommended. The authors noted that activities that were age appropriate, were fun, and provided a variety were more likely to be engaging and sustained by children and adolescents.</p>

<title>Pharmacotherapy</title>
<p>As in adults, pediatric pharmacotherapy of fatty liver disease has focused on treating insulin resistance and oxidative stress. In a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial from the NASH CRN conducted at 10 university centers, 173 patients with biopsy-proven NASH received treatment with insulin sensitizer metformin, antioxidant vitamin E, or placebo. Although the network’s adult study had shown biochemical and histologic benefit of vitamin E but not insulin sensitizer pioglitazone, neither metformin nor vitamin E was superior to placebo in decreasing ALT levels in pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NASH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533613489153">79</xref></sup> Despite the lack of statistically significant changes in ALT between the groups, there were some statistically significant improvements in a subgroup of patients with biopsy-proven NASH who received vitamin E.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0884533613489153">80</xref></sup> Interestingly, there was improvement even in the placebo group of this study, suggesting that either participating in the trial or receiving diet and exercise advice at visits may have had a positive impact on steatohepatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533613489153">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other studies have explored the role of ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of adult fatty liver disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid formed by intestinal bacteria, may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties that may be beneficial in fatty liver disease. The safety and efficacy of high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid for NASH was evaluated in a 12-month, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter trial by Ratziu and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533613489153">81</xref></sup> One hundred twenty-six adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH were given ursodiol at 25–38 mg/kg/d. ALT levels were decreased by 28.3% in the NASH patients receiving ursodiol compared with a 1.6% decline in the placebo group. In total, 24.5% of patients receiving ursodiol showed normalization of ALT at the end of the study compared with 4.8% of individuals in the placebo group. The ursodiol group also showed improvement in measures of glycemic control and insulin resistance. Despite the favorable effects of ursodiol on ALT in the study by Ratziu et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533613489153">81</xref></sup> other studies have shown no histologic improvements in NAFLD patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0884533613489153">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of probiotics in the treatment of NAFLD has been explored. Animal models have suggested that bacterial overgrowth may produce increased endogenous production of ethanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0884533613489153">83</xref></sup> Ethanol, a known hepatotoxin, may contribute to oxidative stress and play a role in the transition from steatosis to an inflammatory response leading to NASH. However, in a 2007 Cochrane review on the use of probiotics for NAFLD and/or steatohepatitis, Lirussi and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0884533613489153">84</xref></sup> concluded that the lack of randomized controlled trials “provided no evidence to support or refute probiotics for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and or/steatohepatitis.” Cysteamine, another potent antioxidant, is currently being studied for the treatment of pediatric fatty liver disease. Dohil and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0884533613489153">85</xref></sup> first reported on the effectiveness of enteric-coated (EC) cysteamine in 11 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Patients received EC cysteamine twice daily for 24 weeks. Of the 11 treated patients, 7 had a &gt;50% improvement in ALT levels, with 5 patients achieving normalization of their ALT levels despite no change in BMI status. A multicenter study from the NASH CRN is currently under way studying the effectiveness of cysteamine on liver histology in pediatric NASH patients.</p>

<title>Bariatric Surgery</title>
<p>With the rise in morbid obesity over the past 2 decades, weight loss surgery has become a surgical intervention for treatment. Adult studies have evaluated the impact of bariatric surgery on NASH. In a study by Klein and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0884533613489153">86</xref></sup> obese adult patients with biopsy-proven fatty liver disease who underwent gastric bypass surgery showed improvements in the degree of steatosis on liver biopsy, as well as decreased levels of insulin, glucose, and free fatty acids, following surgery. They also demonstrated a decrease in the hepatic expression of factors involved in the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Mattar and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0884533613489153">87</xref></sup> presented similar data in 2005 among 70 obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Frequency of metabolic syndrome decreased from 70% to 14%. Improvements in liver histology were also noted. Steatosis improved from 88% to 8%, inflammation improved from 23% to 2%, and fibrosis improved from 31% to 13%. Inflammation and fibrosis actually resolved in 37% and 20% of patients, respectively. There are limited data at this time regarding the impact of bariatric surgery on fatty liver disease in the pediatric population. More data are needed to ascertain whether improvement in liver disease in children will be similar to adults following bariatric surgery. This dramatic intervention is likely to pertain only to a small proportion of children with NAFLD, and it should be noted that most pediatric bariatric surgery programs do not perform the surgery prior to the completion of puberty.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children. Increased awareness of the risk factors and physical examination findings associated with this disease may allow primary care physicians, subspecialists, and other healthcare providers to identify and screen youth at risk. Pediatric fatty liver disease is not always a benign condition; affected children are at risk for cirrhosis and (rarely) even end-stage liver disease. Early recognition may allow for earlier interventions. At this time, lifestyle modifications emphasizing dietary changes and weight loss as well as increased aerobic physical activity remain the mainstay of treatment for fatty liver disease. Pharmacologic therapy with antioxidants such as vitamin E has shown some promise in improving liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH, and other drugs are being studied. Research into the pathogenesis, risk factors, natural history, and treatment of fatty liver disease is needed.</p>
