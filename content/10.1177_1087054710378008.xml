<p><bold>Background</bold>: Medication treatment studies of ADHD have typically not assessed effects on reading performance, although reading difficulties frequently co-occur in children with ADHD. The current study characterizes the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX; Vyvanse<sup>®</sup>, Shire US Inc.), at peak efficacy, on reading performance in children with ADHD. <bold>Method</bold>: Children (ages 6-12; <italic>N</italic> = 26) with ADHD enrolled in a modified laboratory school study with an open-label, dose-optimization phase of LDX (30-70 mg/d). The Gray Oral Reading Test-4 (GORT-4) with measures of rate, accuracy, and comprehension was administered at baseline and 3-4 hr postdose, following 4 to 5 weeks of optimal dose titration. <bold>Results</bold>: Treatment reduced ADHD symptoms. Reading rate was improved, especially among children with higher verbal fluid reasoning without additional symptoms of neurodevelopmental delay. No differences were observed for reading accuracy or comprehension. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Endophenotypical profiles may predict drug effects in specific skill areas, such as reading rate.</p>

<p>The two most common psychological deficits of childhood are reading disorder (RD) and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710378008">Shaywitz, Shaywitz, Fletcher, &amp; Escobar, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054710378008">Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, &amp; Hulslander, 2005</xref>). RD is more commonly found among children with ADHD than in the general population, with co-occurrence estimates ranging from 25% to 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710378008">Willcutt et al., 2001</xref>). It has been shown that RD and ADHD are likely to share a small but significant genetic commonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710378008">Light, Pennington, Gilger, &amp; DeFries, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054710378008">Willcutt, Pennington, &amp; DeFries, 2000</xref>), but the literature is somewhat confusing regarding the presence of a shared neurocognitive substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710378008">Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>). Much of the early research in RD focused on impaired phonological awareness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710378008">Foorman, Francis, Fletcher, &amp; Lynn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710378008">Stanovich, 1988</xref>) and orthographic skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710378008">Ehri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710378008">Ehri &amp; Wilce, 1985</xref>) as the core deficits, whereas more recent studies have focused on the influence of attentional deficits, for example, on teacher ratings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710378008">Rabiner &amp; Coie, 2000</xref>) or verbal working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710378008">Ashbaker &amp; Swanson, 1996</xref>). Also, the cognitive behavioral deficits associated with the RD + ADHD phenotype include a pattern of deficits in executive function that are not conjointly present in children either with RD or ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710378008">Willcutt et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although educators may disagree over procedural approaches to reading education, they generally agree that “reading assumes not only the fluent, accurate recognition of words, but in addition, a clear grasp of the meanings implied by the symbols used” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710378008">Gray, 1940</xref>). Deficits in either reading rate or accuracy (together subsumed under the rubric “fluency”) impose limitations on reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710378008">Perfetti, 1985</xref>). For example, in a recent study of children with and without ADHD who were typical readers, the rate at which children with ADHD read silently was slower and more variable, and their reading comprehension was impaired in comparison to non-ADHD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710378008">Schuck 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Oral reading speed may also influence reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710378008">Deno, Mirkin, &amp; Chiang, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710378008">Fuchs, Fuchs, &amp; Maxwell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710378008">Shankweiler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710378008">Shinn, Good, Knutson, Tilly, &amp; Collins, 1992</xref>). Although the precise mechanisms to account for the observed colinearity are still a matter of speculation, the strength of association between the two measures, attests to the importance of oral reading rate for adequate reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710378008">Manis, Doi, &amp; Bhadha, 2000</xref>). A plausible hypothesis is suggested by the rapid automatized naming (RAN) literature that has shown significant positive correlations between the ability to rapidly name letters or other visual symbols and reading ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054710378008">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>). It has been suggested that the more quickly (automatically) words can be read aloud, the more mental or attentional resources become available for acquiring new vocabulary and comprehending text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710378008">Schneider, Dumais, &amp; Shiffrin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710378008">Schuck 2008</xref>). Clinical conditions besides ADHD in which such automatic processing may be compromised (e.g., symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder), also would be expected to be associated with inadequate or variable auditory processing skills employed in reading fluency and comprehension tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710378008">Dunn, Gomes, &amp; Gravel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710378008">Kamio, Robins, Kelley, Swaison, &amp; Fein, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Phonological awareness, orthographic skills, and executive functions cannot alone account for the variability in reading performance. In almost every multivariate study of RD, an important association between reading ability and measures of general cognitive ability has been reported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710378008">Wadsworth, Olson, Pennington, &amp; DeFries, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054710378008">Willcutt et al., 2001</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710378008">Naglieri (2001</xref>, p. 305) has noted “it is inconsistent with the literature to assume that these two constructs are not substantially correlated,” and previous work with the Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (PASS) model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710378008">Naglieri &amp; Reardon, 1993</xref>) likewise indicated a positive association between reading and general intelligence. In a study designed to determine how growth in reading skill could be predicted from (a) Verbal IQ, (b) reading-related language abilities (phonological, rapid naming, and orthographic), and (c) attention ratings; though Verbal IQ was not the best, <italic>unique</italic> predictor, it predicted response to early intervention in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710378008">Stage, Abbott, Jenkins, &amp; Berninger, 2003</xref>). By way of illustration, the univariate correlations between Verbal IQ and Word Attack (the subtest measuring a child’s ability to apply phonics to nonsense words) and Word Identification on the Woodcock-Johnson Reading Mastery Test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054710378008">Woodcock, McGrew, and Mather, 2001</xref> were .21 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and .30 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), respectively, whereas a multiple correlation model, using both Verbal IQ and tutor ratings of attention were .37 for Word Identification and .19 for Word Attack. Clearly, attentional factors, when contrasted with Verbal IQ, accounted for more of the variability in learning to read. Stimulant medications, including methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMPH) are the most frequently prescribed medications for the treatment of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710378008">Greenhill et al., 2002</xref>). Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX; Vyvanse<sup>®</sup>, Shire US Inc.) is a recently approved prodrug stimulant used for the treatment of ADHD in children aged between 6 and 12 years and in adults. LDX is a therapeutically inactive molecule that is converted after oral congestion to <sc>l</sc>-lysine and active <sc>d</sc>-AMPH, which is responsible for its therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710378008">Pennick, 2010</xref>). Published studies of LDX demonstrate its effectiveness throughout the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710378008">Biederman et al., 2007</xref>) with the measurement of onset and duration of efficacy from 1.5 to 13 hr postdose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054710378008">Wigal, Kollins, Childress, &amp; Squires, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that stimulant therapy may contribute to enhanced reading performance in terms of visual working memory as well as oral reading rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710378008">Bedard, Jain, Hogg-Johnson, &amp; Tannock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710378008">McInnes, Bedard, Hogg-Johnson, &amp; Tannock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710378008">Sutcliffe, Bishop, Houghton, &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710378008">Keulers et al. (2006)</xref> found that MPH significantly improved performance on measures of reading accuracy and reading speed in children diagnosed with <italic>both</italic> ADHD and dyslexia when compared to children with <italic>either</italic> ADHD or dyslexia. This modified laboratory school study is the first characterization of the efficacy of LDX on reading performance in children diagnosed with ADHD with measures taken at baseline and at the last study day when receiving clinically determined optimal LDX dosing at 4 to 5 weeks after initial exposure to LDX treatment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054710378008">
<title>Study Objectives</title>
<p>This study was designed to address two questions: (a) Does treatment with LDX impact reading fluency, specifically the two components of fluency, reading rate and accuracy, in children for whom it treats symptoms of ADHD? and (b) given published evidence of a highly positive correlation between Verbal IQ and reading achievement, would a measure of verbal fluid reasoning <italic>moderate</italic> the effects of drug treatment on reading fluency? In other words, would LDX yield a more pronounced effect on reading fluency when verbal fluid reasoning skills were held constant?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This single-blind, modified laboratory school study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710378008">Wigal &amp; Wigal, 2006</xref>) of LDX was conducted at the University of California (UC), Irvine. The study protocol was approved by the UC Irvine local institutional review board and the State Research Advisory Panel of California. All parents or caregivers gave written informed consent, and the subject’s assent was obtained before any study-related procedures were performed. All study activities were performed in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and applicable local regulations. Shire Development Inc. provided study medication and support for study-related care. In addition, parent(s)/legally authorized representatives of participating children signed an Authorization of Release of Personal Health Information for Research Purposes (HIPAA) form when giving legal informed consent for participation in the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1087054710378008">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 28 boys and girls aged between 6 and 12 who met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710378008">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) criteria for a primary diagnosis of any of the three subtypes of ADHD were enrolled. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710378008">Table 1</xref> for participant demographics on the 26 participants who completed the study. Two participants were early terminations from the study and did not complete the final assessments.) During the study screening, medical and medication history data were collected, and a Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children—Present and Lifetime Version interview was conducted by a trained investigator (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710378008">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>). Each participant was required to have (a) a baseline, clinician completed ADHD-Rating Scale-Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710378008">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, and Reid, 1998</xref>) score of 1.5 and <italic>SD</italic> above the norm; (b) age-appropriate intellectual functioning as determined by an IQ of ≥80 on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2 (KBIT-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378008">Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2006</xref>); and (c) blood pressure within the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. Thus, the study was not designed to preselect for specific learning- or reading-based disabilities. Key exclusion criteria were presence of a comorbid psychiatric condition with severe symptoms, conduct disorder, or other medical condition that could confound assessments, pose a risk to the participant, or prohibit study completion. Other exclusion criteria were adverse reaction or nonresponsiveness to previous AMPH therapy, pregnancy, substance abuse, weight &lt; 22.7 kg (50 lb), body mass index &gt; 98th percentile for age, seizure within the last 2 years, Tic or Tourette disorder, use of medication with central nervous system effects (excluding bronchodilators), or clinically significant laboratory and/or ECG abnormalities. Children whose current ADHD medication provided effective control of symptoms with acceptable tolerability were also excluded. Thus, to be included in the study, children could be identified as positive stimulant responders, but on their current stimulant treatment, they were required to have inadequate stimulant medication response either due to inadequate dose or duration of action as reported by the parent/legally authorized representative.</p>

<p>Following screening, washout (if necessary), and baseline, participants participated in a weekly, open-label, dose-optimization phase (4-5 weeks). Dosage was initiated at 30 mg/d LDX and adjusted to the next available dose at weekly intervals, until optimal dose was reached similar to that used in other laboratory school studies of LDX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054710378008">Wigal et al., 2009</xref>). Optimal dose was defined as the dose that produced a reduction in ADHD-RS-IV score ≥30%, and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710378008">Guy, 1976</xref>) score of 1 or 2, with tolerable side effects. Tolerability was determined by the investigator, based on review of adverse events and the clinical judgment of the treating physician, a board certified developmental–behavioral pediatrician. Once reached, the optimal dose was maintained for the remainder of the dose-optimization phase. The dose dispensed at the conclusion of the dose-optimization period was then used during the single blind, half-day modified laboratory school session visit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087054710378008">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>General intelligence</title>
<p>The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Scale-2 (KBIT-2) was administered to each prospective participant at the screening visit. The KBIT-2 is a brief measure of verbal and nonverbal intelligence that can be administered in approximately 15 to 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378008">Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2006</xref>). The Verbal score is based on the results of two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles, whereas the Nonverbal score consists of performance on the Matrices subtest. Split-half reliability coefficients for the stratified normative sample ranged from .89 to .98 for the Verbal score and .88 to .98 for the IQ Composite; test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from .92 to .95 for the IQ Composite and .86 to .97 for the Verbal subtests. The KBIT-2 has substantial positive correlations with other well-known tests of cognitive ability; for example, .83 between the KBIT-2 Verbal subtests and the Verbal IQ Composite of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd Edition (WISC-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710378008">Wechsler, 1997</xref>); .76 between the KBIT-2 IQ Composite and Full Scale IQ on the WISC-III; and .77 between the KBIT-2 IQ Composite and Full Scale IQ on the WISC-IV. In addition, KBIT-2 scores have significant positive correlations with scores on recognized tests of achievement; for example, .65 between the KBIT-2 Verbal score and the Reading score of the Wide Range Achievement Test, 3rd Edition (WRAT-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710378008">Wechsler, 1997</xref>), and .52 between the KBIT-2 IQ Composite and Arithmetic on the WRAT-3.</p>
<p>In particular, the Riddles subtest of the KBIT-2 was selected for further analysis because, unlike the Verbal Knowledge subtest, the Riddles subtest is thought to involve reasoning ability, integration, and logical classification skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710378008">Kagan &amp; Klein, 1973</xref>), or a crystallized verbal reasoning factor (G<sub>CV</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710378008">Ackerman, Beier, &amp; Bowen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710378008">A.

<title>Behavior ratings</title>
<p>Efficacy measures of treatment response included ratings on the ADHD-RS-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710378008">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>) and CGI-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710378008">National Institutes of Mental Health, 1985</xref>). The ADHD-RS-IV lists the nine <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms of inattention and the nine <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity in an alternating format for completion by raters. For the ADHD-RS-IV, the following psychometric properties have been reported: coefficient alphas, .88 for hyperactivity-impulsivity and .96 for inattention; test-retest reliabilities, .88 for hyperactivity-impulsivity and .89 for inattention; and in factorial studies using the ADHD-RS-IV with various ADHD criterion measures, 53% to 77% of the variance was accounted for by the ADHD-RS-IV ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710378008">DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, &amp; Reid, 1998</xref>). A severity score ≥30 on the ADHD-RS-IV was required for study entry. Ratings on the ADHD-RS-IV are known to significantly discriminate among children with and without ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710378008">DuPaul, Anastopoulos, et al., 1998</xref>). The CGI provides a global assessment of the participant’s level of impairment and uses the clinician’s experience as a reference point to note presence of symptoms, severity of symptoms, distress, and impairment or effect of ADHD on behavior and functioning. Licensed, in-house clinicians completing behavior ratings in the present study were blind to the purpose and design of this specific study protocol.</p>

<title>Gray Oral Reading Test, Fourth Edition (GORT-4)</title>
<p>The GORT-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710378008">Wiederholt &amp; Bryant, 2001</xref>) was administered during the baseline visit and again following titration to optimal dose, at the laboratory school visit. The GORT-4 is a test of oral reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension, based on the participant’s reading performance of 14 paragraphs or “stories.” The GORT-4 has parallel forms, A and B, so that one half of the participants was tested on Form A and one half was tested on Form B for the baseline administration, the order being reversed for the laboratory school administration. It typically can be administered in about 15 to 45 min depending on reading rate and level. Participants begin reading at their expected ability level, and then continue until basal and ceiling levels are established. The averages of alternate form reliabilities, stratified by age group, were .94 for rate, .94 for accuracy, and .85 for comprehension. The averages of coefficient alphas, measuring internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710378008">Cronbach, 1951</xref>) for Forms A and B, stratified by age level, were .925 for rate, .915 for accuracy, .97 for comprehension, and .965 for the oral reading quotient. Test-retest reliabilities, averaged over the two forms, were .93 for rate, .90 for accuracy, and .855 for comprehension. Interscorer reliability, averaged across forms were .97 for rate, .99 for accuracy, and .95 for comprehension. Concurrent validity coefficients, based on GORT-4 performance and scores on other reading measures (e.g., Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests–Revised: Word Attack; Wide Range Achievement Test–Revised: Reading), averaged .74 for rate, .75 for accuracy, and .45 for comprehension. The GORT-4 also has substantial positive correlations with measures of aptitude or intelligence; for example, .67 between GORT-4 Reading Comprehension and Verbal IQ on the WISC-III, .56 between GORT-4 Reading Rate and WISC-III Full Scale IQ; .81 between GORT-4 Reading Rate and .83 between GORT-4 Reading Accuracy and Verbal Reasoning on the Scholastic Aptitude Scale; and .80 between GORT-4 Reading Comprehension and Full Scale IQ on the WISC-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710378008">Wiederholt &amp; Bryant, 2001</xref>). For the present study, raw scores were converted to standard scores according to the GORT manual instructions.</p>

<title>Power analyses</title>
<p>A sample size calculation for a one-sample matched pairs design was performed according to the methods presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710378008">Chow, Shao, and Wang (2003)</xref>. Previous comparisons of LDX versus placebo on behavioral outcomes have yielded an effect size of .527 (based on a mean difference of 0.50 and a standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] of 0.9491). Past research on reading performance has shown children with ADHD exhibiting slower performance than children without ADHD. The effect sizes from these studies have been high ranging from 0.80 to 1.58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710378008">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710378008">Tannock, Martinussen, &amp; Fritjers, 2000</xref>). No studies evaluating effects of medication on reading performance among children with ADHD were found. Therefore, a conservative approach was used to estimate the desired effect size. This was done by giving more weight to the previous results involving LDX than to the high effect sizes from studies with differing study designs or medications. The analysis indicated that a group of 26 to 28 participants would be sufficient to detect a moderate effect size (.5-.7) at 95% power when testing at a significance level of α = .05 (two-sided). However, 40 participants were planned for enrollment, because 25% of participants were predicted to discontinue during the study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results suggest a possible endophenotypical profile that may predict reading improvement based on response to medication, such as LDX, at least when reading rate is used as the outcome measure. It seems that bright, but inattentive children, who show a positive diminution of inattentive symptoms as a result of LDX intervention, are most likely to also show improvement in reading rate. It is possible that latent capacities, as represented by G<sub>cv</sub> may be activated by LDX, once attention is increasing, thereby increasing productivity. Since the existing literature indicates a substantial predictive relationship between reading rate and reading comprehension, it is also possible that, over time, the increases in reading rate promoted by medication could serve as a bridge to enhanced reading comprehension. On the other hand, refractoriness to stimulant treatment (e.g., LDX), as exemplified by those individuals in this study who seemed to have a blunted response on inattentive symptoms (IN<sub>f</sub>), may signify a less likely effect on reading rate and, by way of extension, reading comprehension. Specifically, poor response to treatment, as manifested by lack of symptom reduction, is correlated with a lack of improvement in reading rate, <italic>R</italic> = −.42, <italic>p</italic> = .0318.</p>
<p>A combination of optimal reduction of inattentive symptoms plus preexisting crystallized verbal intelligence was significantly correlated with reading improvement. Furthermore, the absence of other symptoms of neurodevelopmental delay (e.g., decrement in social communication) accounted for an additional small, but significant, increment in reading improvement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1087054710378008">Figure 3</xref>). This is consistent with word fluency data in children with autistic symptoms showing an aberrant differentiation of response to context-dependent words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710378008">Dunn &amp; Bates, 2005</xref>). Thus, it is likely that reading rate will improve given a favorable combination of these preexisting characteristics as well as a positive response to medication treatment.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that should be addressed in future research. First, this article includes a small sample although it is composed of very well-characterized children with ADHD. Second, we did not <italic>a priori</italic> select for children with specific RDs, but rather assumed a range of heterogeneity in reading ability in a population assessed with diagnostic rigor for attention deficits. In addition, these results are not sufficient to support a positive effect of LDX on reading comprehension, but do suggest that this would be an appropriate hypothesis for a medication intervention studied over a longer period. The present study may be viewed as exploratory because it represents treatment over about a month’s period and would thus limit the effect of reading rate and accuracy on reading comprehension. Improvement in reading rate may make reading more automatic as more mental capacities become available. Future studies might also include methods such as the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) as an alternative individually administered test that does not include subtests obviously related to reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710378008">Naglieri, 2001</xref>) as well as the measurement of specific reading subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery–Third Revision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054710378008">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>) to more fully characterize reading disabilities in children studied. The effect of the drug itself on the reading measures studied is limited by the small sample size.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that LDX treatment may result in improvement in some aspects of reading performance, specifically reading rate, by controlling ADHD symptoms of inattention, contingent on the availability of adequate levels of G<sub>cv</sub>, and the absence of other symptoms of neurodevelopmental delay. There is no evidence that LDX treatment, whether mediated by G<sub>cv</sub> ability or reduced symptoms of inattention, results in improvements in either reading accuracy or reading comprehension. However, based on the well-known positive association between reading rate and reading comprehension, it is possible that LDX treatment in a larger sample and/or over a longer time frame could also have a positive influence on the latter endpoint.</p>
