<p>This book focuses on the recent increasing international investment in Africa, partly spurred by the rise of China as a global economic power and investor in Africa. For obvious reasons, Chinese investment in Africa is given more coverage but the book also deals with the role of traditional investors (former colonial powers and the US) as well as relative newcomers from outside (such as India and Brazil) as well as inside Africa (South Africa). The book starts with a discussion of the broader issues in an introductory and first chapter. The subsequent three chapters, respectively, examine the role of the ‘old’, the Chinese and the ‘new’ economic powers. While the next three chapters focus on international investments in natural resources including oil, uranium and coltan, timber, biofuels and fish, Chapter 8 covers a case study of manufacturing in Zambia. The concluding chapters look into the future and ask whether Africans can ‘unscramble’ their continent.</p>
<p>The book argues that the tension between a growing global economy and fixed amounts of natural resources is the underlying cause for the flow of investment from rich countries and corporations to regions of untapped resources such as Africa. The first two chapters contrast the first (colonialism) and second ‘scrambles’ for Africa; even though there are many similarities between the two, the difference in the current period due to the existence of politically, if not economically, independent governments is emphasized. By critically reviewing the <italic>World Development Report</italic> (2009) which focused on the role of economic geography, the wider literature on the underdevelopment of Africa is engaged. The main argument of the book is that geographical features that are sometimes identified as part of the physical geography are themselves socially constructed and determined by historical contexts.</p>
<p>The interests and strategies of the ‘old’ economic powers are discussed in Chapter 2. The ‘old’ include former colonial powers like Britain and France, the European Union as a whole, the US, Japan and South Africa. Specific interests of these powers are highlighted. Britain set up the Department for International Development (DFID) in an attempt to untie aid from commercial interests with mixed success. Recently, France seems to have been increasingly aligning itself with the interest of the US, particularly in terms of cooperation against terrorism after September 11. Traditionally, the European Union engaged itself mainly through Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) like the Lomé Convention, but the role of EPAs has significantly declined. After the debacle of its Somali intervention, the US was less keen on direct interventions in Africa, but their interest was rekindled after September 11 and the Iraq war. In addition to heavy investment in African oil, the US has wide interests in security as well as countering the influence of China in Africa. Japan’s interest in Africa is closely aligned with that of the US. South Africa’s role has recently widened from its traditional involvement in southern Africa, mainly in the SADC (Southern African Development Community) region, to the rest of Africa. Investment in infrastructure, oil, gas, petroleum, mining, retailing, manufacturing and mobile phone networks is increasingly becoming important.</p>
<p>The recent increasing involvement of China is characterized as ‘flexigemony’, a process of negotiations over resource and market access through cooperation with African state elites rather than through conditionality and military might (Chapter 3). The Chinese involvement aims to assure supply of raw and agricultural materials, market and land. In addition, it is also a channel of Chinese migration to Africa, and is used to get diplomatic support and present an alternative model to Western development and cooperation. The Chinese policy will likely strengthen patrimonial governments, especially at a time when the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and African Union (AU) are trying to move away from that tradition.</p>
<p>Other economic players include India, Brazil, Russia, Malaysia and Turkey (Chapter 4). The clear separation between the state and private companies make the case of India different from that of China. Brazil probably has technology that is appropriate to Africa and has deliberately cultivated close links with African countries. Russia is a less important player, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union and because of its abundant energy resources. While the involvement of Malaysia in the oil sector is not negligible, Turkey is mainly interested in markets for its products.</p>
<p>The next four chapters focus on specific resources. In Chapter 5, the ‘scramble’ for African oil in West Africa, Equatorial Guinea and the Sahel region is presented. Chapter 6 looks at two natural resources particularly important in the nuclear and communication industries: uranium and coltan. Competition for Africa’s timber, biofuels, plants and fisheries is discussed in Chapter 7. The environmental impact, including on water, of these investments is highlighted. Using data from 27 Chinese and Indian firms in Zambia, Chapter 8 argues that the liberalization process undertaken in the last decades of the twentieth century has opened the way to Asian investment. Poor working conditions and tense relationships between Chinese firms and labour unions are recurring challenges.</p>
<p>The final chapters discuss the potential for Africans to ‘unscramble’ the continent. The book argues that the new ‘scramble’ is likely to be replicating the old patterns of enclave-led growth and is unlikely to result in a fundamental class restructuring with the emergence of formidable middle and industrial working classes. It is argued that Asian investment fits more with extractive rather than productive and transformative pattern of globalization. To improve conditions, foreign investment which displaces local entrepreneurs should be discouraged and joint venture partnerships between local and foreign investors should be encouraged. In the case of Chinese involvement, more transparency in dealings with African governments is recommended.</p>
<p>The book provides a valuable source of information on recent international investment in Africa. It also provides an interesting comparison between the old and new ‘scramble’ for Africa. The cases studies are also very informative. More on the heterogeneity in the types of relationships between African governments and the Chinese and other foreign investors would have been a good addition – depending on the type of business, current national and international politics, negotiating capacity of governments and so on; the nature of these relationships is expected to differ. Finally, the book argues that recent infrastructure investment should not replicate the previous colonial pattern, but this recommendation seems to ignore existing distribution of economic activities and the comparative advantages.</p>
